Synopsis Background: Surviving passenger and estates of deceased passengers filed products liability action against automobile manufacturer in connection with rollover accident. The Circuit Court, Cook County, James P. Flannery, Jr., J., entered judgment on jury verdict after denying plaintiffs' posttrial motion. Plaintiffs appealed. Holdings: The Appellate Court, Campbell , J., held that: [1] expert testimony of police officers that driver caused accident was admissible; [2] trial court could refuse to bar testimony of manufacturer's expert on basis of manufacturer's failure to produce statistical data forming factual bases for expert's opinions; and [3] trial court could deny plaintiffs' motion to deem facts admitted.

Opinion Justice CAMPBELL delivered the opinion of the court: ***115 *811 Plaintiffs Vito Favia, as administrator of the estates of Nicholas and Rosa Favia, Caterina Favia as the special administrator of the estate of Patricia Favia, and Michael Favia, individually, appeal a jury verdict entered in favor of defendant Ford Motor Co. in a products liability action arising out of a single-vehicle rollover crash. Onappeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in: (1) admitting police testimony concerning the cause of the crash; (2) admitting expert opinions based on statistical data not produced by defendant to plaintiffs; and (3) denying plaintiffs' motion to deem facts admitted. Plaintiffs also argue that the cumulative effect of the above errors denied them a fair trial. The record on appeal discloses the following facts. At approximately 4:30 a.m. on September 18, 1994, plaintiff and his decedents were passengers in a Ford Aerostar Extended (Aerostar) driven by Sebastiano Partipilo, headed west on Interstate 74 outside Greenburg, Indiana. The vehicle was driving in the left lane through a construction zone. Orange barrels separated the left lane from the right lane, which was undergoing repaving. The right lane was approximately five inches lower than the left. United States Army Major Jeffrey Gorres, traveling behind the Aerostar, testified at trial that while traveling at approximately 60 miles per hour, Partipilo allowed the right side tires to drop into the unpaved right lane. The Aerostar crashed into construction barrels as it went. Partipilo maneuvered the Aerostar out of the right lane, but after overcoming the drop-off, the vehicle was rocking back and forth, continuing left across the lane into the dirt median. Partipilo then steered sharply to the right, causing the Aerostar to be perpendicular to the direction of travel. Major Gorres saw sparks as the left front wheel rim contacted the pavement. The Aerostar then rolled over four or five times before coming to rest along the right side of the road. Plaintiff and his decedents were thrown from the vehicle. Plaintiff Michael Favia suffered injuries that left him legally blind, while Patricia, Nick and Rosa Favia were killed. Major Gorres stopped his car to check the severity of the injuries then drove to a nearby gas station to telephone for emergency assistance. Within minutes of the call, emergency assistance arrived, *812 including firefighters and paramedics. Decatur County sheriff's deputy Robert Ewing began to investigate the crash scene and obtained assistance from Indiana State Police Sergeant Daniel Goris. The testimony of Deputy Ewing and Sgt. Goris was presented ***116 **1185 to the jury via edited copies of their videotaped evidence depositions. Deputy Ewing had worked in law enforcement since 1991. He studied accident investigation at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, with an additional 40-hour reserveFavia v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4deputy course in accident investigation and further training at the Indiana State Police School. Deputy Ewing estimated that since 1991, he had investigated, on average, 75 crashes annually, including rollovers on the interstate with ejected passengers. Sgt. Goris started in law enforcement as a road deputy in 1976. Goris testified that he attended 80 hours of crash investigation school and 40 hours of advanced technical crash investigation. As a technical crash investigator, he had investigated numerous crashes, including interstate rollovers with ejected passengers. Neither Deputy Ewing nor Sgt. Goris had training in mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, vehicle dynamics or kinematics, or accident reconstruction. Working together, Deputy Ewing and Sgt. Goris made notations and took measurements with respect to the tire marks and other markings on the road, the location of the vehicle and the injured and deceased passengers. Based on these notes and measurements, Sgt. Goris prepared a diagram that was included in Deputy Ewing's report on the crash. Deputy Ewing testified that Partipilo's over-steering was the primary cause of the crash, with the unlevel pavement being a contributing cause of the crash. Sgt. Goris opined that Partipilo over-steered, but that it was Partipilo allowing the right-side tires to drop into the unpaved right lane that caused the crash. On cross-examination, both Deputy Ewing and Sgt. Goris testified that they had no training in mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, vehicle dynamics or kinematics, or accident reconstruction. Sgt. Goris testified that he had no opinion as to whether the design of the vehicle might have been an additional cause of the accident. Plaintiffs presented a number of expert witnesses regarding the design and safety of the Aerostar. David Bilek, who held a degree in mechanical engineering technology, testified regarding the vehicle's \"static stability factor,\" the relationship between a vehicle's center of gravity and its track width. Bilek testified that the Aerostar Extended's length decreased its static stability factor because its width remained the same. The vehicle has a lower static stability factor than passenger cars, and it decreases when it is fully loaded. Bilek opined *813 that Partipilo's steering was reasonably foreseeable to Ford and that the design was defective because the center of gravity was too high under such conditions. On cross-examination, Bilek testified that a vehicle is not defective simply because it has a different rollover potentialfrom other cars, and that one cannot predict whether a vehicle will rollover based only on its static stability factor. Milton Chase, Ph.D., testified that in the 1960s, he began work on a computer software package for modeling vehicle systems called Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS). The software applies vehicle properties and the laws of physics to create a computer model of a vehicle and perform computerized testing of its behavior. The system is used by automobile manufacturers, including Ford. Dr. Chase testified to his development of ADAMS simulations of the Aerostar's performance of J-turns and of the rollover at issue in this case. Dr. Chase testified that the vehicle, when loaded to its gross weight limit, tipped up on its side wheels when performing J-turns. Dr. Chase opined that the Aerostar was unreasonably ***117 **1186 dangerous because it had inadequate resistance to rollover when fully loaded. On cross-examination, Dr. Chase admitted that his computer simulation of the rollover here did not match as to where the vehicle came to rest. Dr. Chase also doubted that he had used the same ADAMS model as Ford had. Dr. Chase admitted that he acquired his tire data for the simulations from a slow- speed test while Ford used tire data collected at 55 miles per hour. Dr. Chase also admitted that a safely designed car can roll over for many reasons. Statistician Randall Whitfield performed an analysis of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) concerning crashes with one or more similarities to the crash at issue in this case. Whitfield's analysis showed that in four different categories, the Aerostar's involvement in rollover crashes was greater than that of peer vehicles, opining that this was due to the design of the vehicle. On cross-examination, Whitfield agreed that even a safely designed vehicle can roll over given some sort of tripping. He also admitted that he excluded certain vehicles lacking a driver-side airbag from his study, which tends to skew the results against vehicles which have that airbag, like the Aerostar. Ford also presented a number of expert witnesses regarding the design and safety of the Aerostar. Donald Tandy, a former Ford employee and engineering consultant on crash investigation and vehicle development, helped design the Aerostar Extended model. Tandy's duties included validating the ADAMS model, which includes correlating the model with real world, on-track testing at various load *814Favia v. Ford Motor Co., 381 Ill.App.3d 809 (2008) 886 N.E.2d 1182, 320 Ill.Dec. 113 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5weights on wet and dry pavement. Tandy also validated the results of Ford's ADAMS J-turn simulations. Tandy opined that ADAMS is not an appropriate tool for reconstructing real world accidents. Tandy also opined that Dr. Chase had not adjusted his computer model to reflect the specific age and characteristics of the actual vehicle in this case. Tandy also criticized specific aspects of Dr. Chase's reconstructions. For example, Tandy noted that Dr. Chase modeled the ledge between the right and left lanes of the highway as a 45-degree ramp, rather than the vertical drop mentioned in the eyewitness testimony. Tandy testified that the computer program crashed when he modified it to reflect the vertical drop. Tandy further testified that the difference in the tire data did not correlate to the real-world performance of the Aerostar. Tandy additionally noted that the simulation did not account for differences in friction that would occur on the dirt and grass surface of the median. Lee Carr, another former Ford employee and engineering consultant, had over 20 years of experience investigating rollover crashes. Carr opined that neither the Aerostar's steering nor stability systems caused the accident. Carr explained how the various markings and measurements noted by the police allowed him to calculate the vehicle's speed and roll sequence. Carr testified that only one second elapsed from the time the Aerostar returned to the pavement and the time it entered the grassy median. Carr opined that this showed over-steering and that the vehicle could not stabilize itself in one second from the bouncing occurring from surmounting the five-inch drop. Carr testified that once the vehicle made contact with the median, Partipilo reversed his steering, the vehicle slid clockwise, causing weight to shift inside the vehicle. The rear and left front tires added force, digging into the dirt of the median. As the left front tire attempted to clear the median and reenter the pavement, the rim struck the pavement and the vehicle began to roll within two- ***118 **1187 thirds of a second, slowing to 51 miles per hour and rolling four times. Carr further opined that the static stability factor is too simplistic a method for determining a car's risk of rollover. Carr testified that Ford and other automobile companies use industry standards of likely lateral forces placed by drivers on vehicles. Generally, crash avoidance maneuvers will measure 0.5 times the force exerted by Earth's gravity (\"G\"). Carr testified that his testing of the Aerostar was fully comfortable on dry roads up to at least 0.8 Gs.Michelle Vogler, Ph.D., who holds bachelor, master and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering, testified that her consulting firm concentrates on risk analysis and accident statistics of motor vehicles. Dr. Vogler testified that, based on data from the National Automotive *815 Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System, the more times a vehicle rolls, the more unusual the accident. Less than one-tenth of one percent of rollover accidents have a roll count of four. Dr. Vogler criticized Whitfield's statistical analysis, noting that the FARS data he used captures only 4% of the rollovers that occur annually. Moreover, because fatal accidents often result from factors unrelated to vehicle design, the accuracy of the analysis is compromised. Furthermore, exclusion of vehicles with driver-side airbags eliminated 40% of passenger minivans, including models comparable to the Aerostar. In addition, Whitfield did not normalize the data to account for measure for risk exposure relative to other vans and ignored the numbers of each type of vehicle on the road. Given the limitations of the FARS data, Dr. Vogler testified that she used the Combined State Database, which compiles accident reports for all accidents in a given state, and the R.L. Polk Registration Database, a compilation of vehicle registration data from all 50 states. Dr. Vogler took the data from the first database and from FARS, normalizing both using the data from the second database by the number of vehicles on the road and the length of time they were registered. Dr. Vogler found that the Aerostar's rollover rate was comparable to other small vans, which have a lower rollover rate than passenger cars and light trucks. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury deliberated and returned a verdict in favor of Ford. The jury also answered a special interrogatory finding Partipilo's driving the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries and death. Plaintiffs filed a posttrial motion. The trial court denied that motion and entered a judgment on the verdict. Plaintiffs now appeal.

This court will not reverse a trial court's ruling on a motion for a new trial except in those instances where it is affirmatively shown that the trial court clearly abused its discretion. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 455, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would take the same view. ***119 **1188 *816 People v. Illgen, 145 Ill.2d Ill.Dec. 599, 583 N.E.2d 515 (1991) . However, unlike motions for judgment n.o.v., a court may consider errors in the exclusion or admission of evidence and grant a new trial if there were serious and prejudicial errors made at trial. See Bartlett Bank & Trust Co. v. McJunkins, 147 Ill.App.3d 52, 63, 100 Ill.Dec. 420, 497 N.E.2d 398 (1986). II Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in admitting opinion testimony of Deputy Robert Ewing and Sergeant Daniel Goris as to the cause of the rollover crash. Plaintiffs argue that their opinions were inadmissible as lay testimony because they did not witness the crash. Plaintiffs argue that their opinions were inadmissible as expert testimony because they lacked the background and experience that would qualify them to testify as to the cause of a rollover crash, e.g., training in physics, mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, vehicle dynamics or kinematics, or accident reconstruction. Ford initially responds that plaintiffs waived this issue by soliciting opinion testimony from Sgt. Goris. A review of the cited transcript, however, shows that the testimony at issue was not on the ultimate issue of causation. Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the testimony at issue is lay or expert testimony. [6] [7] [8] [9] An individual will be allowed to testify as an expert if his experience and qualifications afford him knowledge that is not common to laypersons and where such testimony will aid the trier of fact in reaching its conclusions. People v. Novak, 163 Ill.2d 93, 104, 205 Ill.Dec. 471, 643 N.E.2d 762 (1994) . An expert need only have knowledge and experience beyond that of the average citizen. Novak, 163 Ill.2d at 104, 205 Ill.Dec. 471, 643 N.E.2d 762. There is no predetermined formula for how an expert acquires specialized knowledge or experience and the expert can gain such throughpractical experience, scientific study, education, training or research. Novak, 163 Ill.2d at 104, 205 Ill.Dec. 471, 643 N.E.2d 762 . Whether an individual is an expert on a particular subject is a matter generally reserved to the sound discretion of the trial court. Schaffner v. Chicago & North Western Transportation Co., 129 Ill.2d 1, 36, 133 Ill.Dec. 432, 541 N.E.2d 643 (1989) . As with the motion for new trial, an abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would take the same view. Illgen, 145 Ill.2d at 364, 164 Ill.Dec. 599, 583 N.E.2d 515 . [10] The specific issue is whether these two police officers were qualified to give expert testimony on causation regarding the crash. An officer whose knowledge is based primarily on practical experience is no less an expert than one who possesses particular scientific or academic knowledge. Ralston v. Plogger, 132 Ill.App.3d 90, 98, 87 Ill.Dec. 386, 476 N.E.2d 1378 (1985) . Thus, case law shows that the issue turns on the experience of the testifying officer. *817 For example, in Wade v. City of Chicago Heights, 295 Ill.App.3d 873, 230 Ill.Dec. 297, 693 N.E.2d 426 (1998), the defendant city challenged the ability of an engineer to rely on the opinion of the city's own police officer, Henry Rice, Jr., regarding the cause of an accident, arguing that Rice was not qualified to render that opinion. This court rejected the argument: \"In cases cited by the City, where the officer was held to be unqualified to state an opinion about the cause of the accident, the officer was inexperienced. In ***120 **1189 Thurmond v. Monroe, [159 Ill.2d 240, 249, 201 Ill.Dec. 112, 636 N.E.2d 544] (1994), the officer had been with the department for one year at the time of the accident and had investigated fewer than 20 cases. Thurmond, 159 Ill.2d at 249 [201 Ill.Dec. 143 Ill.Dec. 723, 554 N.E.2d 658 (1990) ], the officer had worked for the department for four months when investigating the case and was asked to recreate the events of the accident beyond his own observations.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7The Wade court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. Similarly, in Loseke v. Mables, 217 Ill.App.3d 521, 160 Ill.Dec. 471, 577 N.E.2d 796 (1991), the trial court admitted opinion testimony from an Illinois State Police trooper with 17 years of law enforcement experience and training in accident reconstruction, which included 40 hours of instruction at the Illinois Police Academy and a 40-hour course at Illinois Central College, but who was not qualified as a full-blown accident reconstructionist. This court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. Loseke, 217 Ill.App.3d at 523-25, 160 Ill.Dec. 471, 577 N.E.2d 796 . In this case, the record shows that plaintiffs' motion in limine to bar the police opinion testimony was argued before the trial judge on several occasions. For example, on May 23, 2005, the parties argued the motion, but plaintiffs' counsel was unclear as to what sort of foundation might be laid as to the qualifications of each officer. The court passed the issue at that time, but made the following comment: \"THE COURT: * * * I see in your motion the things that would discredit the officer's testimony. I'm not a reconstructionist. I don't know about physics. I don't know about rollovers. That doesn't tell me what he does know, and those are the tings the Court's going to look at to determine if somebody's qualified. He may not know about rollovers. I don't know that precludes him from testifying to his observations. He may be qualified in spite of this as an expert. He may be. I don't know. I want to hear what he says.\" On May 24, 2005, the transcript shows that the trial judge heard *818 argument and ascertained from plaintiffs' counsel that the plaintiffs' position was that the only people who can give opinions on the causation of a rollover accident are reconstructionists. At that time, the judge responded, without ruling, that it was his understanding that one did not have to be a reconstruction expert to give causation testimony and that the general rules regarding the qualification of experts applied. The trial court gave plaintiffs' counsel more time to identify case law directly on point. On June 9, 2005, the trial court ruled that both Deputy Ewing and Sgt. Goris were qualified to give the testimony that the court understood they were going to give. That ruling was memorialized ina written order. Plaintiffs' counsel later lodged a continuing objection during the hearings in which the trial court ruled on specific objections to portions of the videotaped testimony to be shown to the jury. **1190 ***121 [11] In this case, the record shows that Deputy Ewing had worked in law enforcement since 1991. He studied accident investigation at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy, with an additional 40-hour reserve deputy course in accident investigation and further training at the Indiana State Police School. This instruction included instruction in identifying and distinguishing skid and yaw marks. Deputy Ewing estimated that since 1991, he had investigated, on average, 75 crashes annually, including roughly 5 to 10 rollovers annually. Some of these accidents occurred on the interstate with ejected passengers. Sgt. Goris started in law enforcement as a road deputy in 1976. Goris testified that he attended 80 hours of crash investigation school and 40 hours of advanced technical crash investigation. As a technical crash investigator, he had investigated numerous crashes, including interstate rollovers with ejected passengers. Given these qualifications and the prevailing case law, it was not fanciful, arbitrary or unreasonable for the trial court to allow the police to give causation testimony, based on their years of experience and real-world expertise as accident investigators. Their lack of particular scientific or academic knowledge goes to the weight of their testimony, not its admissibility. Nor can the police opinions be said to have been unfairly prejudicial to plaintiffs' case. The limits on the scope of their expertise were well established on cross-examination. Deputy Ewing's testimony identifies more than one contributing cause to the accident. Sgt. Goris explicitly admitted that he had no opinion as to whether the design of the Aerostar was a contributing cause of the rollover. Plaintiffs admit in their brief that the driver's maneuvers were a proximate cause of the rollover. Nor did plaintiffs limit themselves to accident reconstruction experts in this case, presenting expert testimony from statistician *819 Randy Whitfield in their attempt to prove that the Aerostar's design was connected to an over-involvement in rollover accidents. Thus, it cannot be said that accident reconstruction, engineering, physics and the like are the only types of expertise relevant to determining the cause or causes of a rollover accident.Favia v. Ford Motor Co., 381 Ill.App.3d 809 (2008) 886 N.E.2d 1182, 320 Ill.Dec. 113 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8Accordingly, this court concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the police opinion testimony. III [12] Plaintiffs next argue that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony from Dr. Michelle Vogler, who testified at trial about: the risk of rollover for small vans generally; the risk of rollover for the Aerostar relative to the risk of rollover for passenger cars, light trucks and other small vans; and the statistical correlation between a vehicle's static stability and the risk of rollover. Dr. Vogler's opinions were based in part on data derived from accident reports in five states and data from the R.L. Polk Registration Database regarding vehicle registration in all 50 states. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have barred Dr. Vogler's testimony due to Ford's failure to produce the data forming the factual bases for those opinions. Plaintiffs rely primarily on dicta from this court's opinion in Petre v. Kucich, 331 935, 265 Ill.Dec. 125, 771 N.E.2d 1084 (2002) , a medical malpractice case in which the trial court barred defendants from presenting any evidence to the jury relating to their expert's unpublished statistical compilations. This court stated that the trial court had not abused its discretion in barring the testimony, because defendants' failure to disclose the protocols and data underlying the study ***122 **1191 violated Supreme Court Rule 213 (177 Ill.2d R. 213) and denied plaintiffs the opportunity both to have their own experts evaluate the study and to appropriately cross-examine the expert. Petre, 331 Ill.App.3d at 947-48, 265 Ill.Dec. 125, 771 N.E.2d 1084. Supreme Court Rule 213 provides in relevant part as follows: \"(f) Identity and Testimony of Witnesses. Upon written interrogatory, a party must furnish the identities and addresses of witnesses who will testify at trial and must provide the following information: * * * (3) Controlled Expert Witnesses. A 'controlled expert witness' is a person giving expert testimony who is the party, the party's current employee, or the party's retained expert. For each controlled expert witness, the party must identify: (i) the subject matter on which the witness will testify; (ii) the conclusions and opinions of the witness and the bases therefor; (iii) the qualificationsof the witness; and (iv) any reports prepared by the witness about the case.\" 210 Ill.2d R. 213(f)(3). *820 Thus, the plain language of the rule requires that a party provide certain types of information upon written interrogatory. The rule specifies that with respect to a controlled expert witness, the party must identify the bases for the expert's conclusions and opinions. On this issue, Ford identified the bases for Dr. Vogler's opinions and conclusions, identifying the specific databases she employed for her statistical analysis. This renders Petre distinguishable, not only because the expert there could not identify the data, but also because the expert there was the exclusive source for obtaining the underlying data. In addition, there was no suggestion in Petre that the expert would agree to provide the underlying data subject to a protective order. Plaintiffs argue, as they did in the trial court, that Rule 213 requires not only that Dr. Vogler disclose the bases for her opinions, but that she produce and provide a copy of the actual data to them. Rule 213(f), by itself, does not require production of evidence. Rule 213(e) provides that a party served by interrogatory may answer by producing documents within that party's possession and control, but that the production of documents shall comply with the requirements of Rule 214 . In turn, Rule 214 sets forth the procedure for written requests, with objections being heard by the court upon prompt notice and motion of the requesting party. In this case, plaintiffs sought data not from Ford, but from one of Ford's controlled party experts. Plaintiffs cite no authority for this situation, aside from the dicta in Petre, which is distinguishable as noted above. In this case, Dr. Vogler provided some data, but stated her objection to providing the specific data at issue here without a protective order, because her firm obtained the data pursuant to agreements that precluded the firm from freely distributing the data. Plaintiffs do not provide any citation to the record showing that they promptly notified and moved the trial court to hold a hearing on the objection. Ford provided Dr. Vogler's report to plaintiffs in December 2004. Plaintiffs apparently did not request the additional data at issue until March 2005. Plaintiffs were notified by Ford's counsel that the data at issue here would not be produced absent a protective order in June 2005. Plaintiffs point to nothing in the record showing that they promptly moved to resolve the dispute. Rather, plaintiffsFavia v.

Given the facts and circumstances of the case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to bar Dr. Vogler's testimony at that time. *821 IV [13] Plaintiffs next contend that the trial court erred in denying plaintiffs' motion to deem facts admitted, specifically to admit that Dr. Chase used the correct ADAMS database in conducting his simulations of the Aerostar's performance of J-turns and of the rollover. [14] Rule 216 provides that a party to an action may serve another party to that action with a written request for his admission of \"any specified relevant fact\" set forth in the request. 134 Ill.2d R. 216(a) ; P.R.S. International, Inc. v. Shred Pax Corp., 184 Ill.2d 224, 234, 234 Ill.Dec. 459, 703 N.E.2d 71 (1998) . The party receiving the request must then either deny or object to the request within 28 days, but if that party does neither, the factual matters in the request are deemed judicial admissions. See 134 Ill.2d R. 216(c); see also Banco Popular v. Beneficial Systems, Inc., 335 Ill.App.3d 196, 208, 269 Ill.Dec. 389, 780 N.E.2d 1113 (2002). Issues of which requests were proper under the rule and which requests should be deemed admissions are questions of law to be reviewed de novo. P.R.S. International, Inc., 184 Ill.2d at 233-34, 234 Ill.Dec. 459, 703 N.E.2d 71. Rule 216(c) provides as follows: \"Each of the matters of fact and the genuineness of each document of which admission is requested is admitted unless, within 28 days after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission either (1) a sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters or (2) written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part. If written objections to a part of the request are made, the remainder of the request shall be answered within the period designated in the request. A denial shallfairly meet the substance of the requested admission. If good faith requires that a party deny only a part, or requires qualification, of a matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and deny only the remainder. Any objection to a request or to an answer shall be heard by the court upon prompt notice and motion of the party making the request.\" 134 Ill.2d R. 216(c). Plaintiffs first argue that Ford's response was not a sworn statement. However, \"the plain language of the rule states that the party to whom the requests to admit are directed must serve upon the requesting party either 'a sworn statement' denying the matters of which admission is requested or written objections which need not be sworn.\" Vision Point of Sale, Inc. v. Haas, 226 Ill.2d 334, 355, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065 (2007) . In this case, Ford's response to one of plaintiffs' interrogatories regarding the ADAMS data was not a denial, but an objection. Thus, it was *822 not required to be sworn. However, both responses also state that Ford is unable to admit or deny, which may fall within the part of the rule requiring a sworn statement. Plaintiffs rely primarily on ***124 **1193 Moy v. Ng, 341 793 N.E.2d 919 (2003) , a case overruled by our supreme court in Vision Point of Sale, 226 Ill.2d at 355-56, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065, which held that a verification of the response by a corporate officer was sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 216(c). In this case, the responses were accompanied by a sworn certification by an agent of Ford authorized to do so, based on facts assembled by authorized employees and counsel of Ford. Plaintiffs also argue that Ford did not provide a reason for its inability to admit or deny the interrogatories regarding the ADAMS data. However, a reading of the responses to the interrogatories, not to mention the further explanations provided to the trial court at the hearing on plaintiffs' motion to compel an answer, shows that Ford provided detailed technical reasons why it was unable to admit or deny whether plaintiffs' ADAMS data was the proper data. Accordingly, the trial court probably did not err in denying plaintiffs' motion to deem facts admitted. VFavia v.

However, inasmuch as the asserted errors were not an abuse of discretion or an error of law in the case of the request to admit, the cumulative effect cannot rise to the level of reversible error.

United States District Court, N.D. Illinois. Melissa HART and John Hart, Plaintiffs, v. Dow CHEMICAL, a Delaware Corporation, Dowelanco, an Indiana General Partnership, Velsicol Chemical Company, a Delaware Corporation, Terminex, International Company, L.P., a Delaware Corporation, d/b/a Ballantyne Pest Control, L.P., Ballantyne Pest Control, Inc., an Illinois Corporation and Waste Management Pest Control, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, Defendants. No. 95 C 1811. | Sept. 30, 1997. MEMORANDUM AND ORDER MANNING , District Court J. *1 This matter comes before the court on objections by plaintiffs, Melissa Hart and John Hart (\"Harts\"), to the report and recommendation and orders issued by Magistrate Judge Keys on September 16, 1997 (\"Report\"). The Harts also request the opportunity to further brief several motions considered in the Report. For the reasons set forth below, the court adopts the Report in part and refrains from providing a final ruling on the remainder of the Report pending further briefing. BACKGROUND The Harts originally filed this cause of action against defendants, Dow Chemical Company and DowElanco (\"Dow defendants\") and Terminex International Company (\"Terminex\") in the Circuit Court of Cook County. The Harts alleged that Melissa suffered injuries caused by a pesticide, chlorpyrofis, applied to their residence. They alleged that defendants either applied or manufactured this pesticide and asserted strict liability and negligence among other state law claims. The original complaint also asserted a class action. On March 23, 1995, the Dow defendants removed the case tofederal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. sections 1441 and 1446, based upon diversity jurisdiction. On February 28, 1996, the Harts filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint in order to drop their class action allegations. On March 1, the Magistrate Judge to whom the case was referred held a status hearing on the motion. During the course of the hearing, counsel for the Harts indicated that they were investigating the addition of other parties, and referred specifically to Waste Management Corporation. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion. On May 10, 1996, the Harts filed their First Amended Complaint that dropped the class action allegations, maintained their previous individual claims and added claims against Velsicol Chemical Company (\"Velsicol\"), Ballantyne Pest Control, Inc. (\"Ballantyne\"), and Waste Management Pest Control, Inc. (\"WMPC\"). While the counts directed to the Dow defendants and Terminex still attempted to hold them liable for their manufacture or application of products containing chlorpyrofis, additional counts alleged Velsicol's liability for its manufacture and sale of the pesticides, chlordane and heptachlor, and Ballantyne and WMPC's liability for their application of all three chemicals to the Hart's residence.1 Because each of these new defendants are Illinois citizens, their joinder would destroy diversity jurisdiction. Consequently, the Magistrate Judge granted the Harts leave to amend their complaint again. The Harts then filed their Second Amended Complaint that asserted subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"). 7 seq. On September 5, 1996, Velsicol filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The case was subsequently reassigned to another magistrate judge.2 *2 The successor Magistrate Judge's Report considers a myriad of subsequent motions filed by the parties. The first group of motions revolve around the joinder of the new defendants and the subject matter jurisdiction of this court. On September 6, 1996, the Harts filed a motion to remand to the Circuit Court for lack of complete diversity. The Dow defendants, soon joined by Terminex and Ballantyne, responded with their own motions to reconsider the order granting leave to amend the complaint or, in the alternative, that the new defendants be dropped for misjoinder pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. WMPC and Ballantyne also each filed a motions to dismiss.Hart v. Dow Chemical, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997) 1997 WL 627645 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2The Magistrate Judge also considered a second group of motions in connection with motions for summary judgment by the original defendants. The Dow defendants had served plaintiff's counsel with Requests for Admission pursuant to Federal Rule 36 (\"Requests\"). A large number of these Requests inquired about the Harts' ability to prove that chlorpyrofis caused Melissa's injuries. The record reflects that the parties disagree over when the Harts first received these Requests. While the Dow defendants claim to have mailed them to the Harts' counsel in October 1996, the Harts maintain that the mailing did not contain any Requests. The Harts contend that they first learned of the Requests at a status hearing on discovery matters on January 8, 1997. The parties do agree that the Harts received copies by January 20, 1997. On January 17, the Harts had filed a motion to establish the original service dates and for leave to file a motion to withdraw default admissions.3 In a minute order dated January 22, the Magistrate Judge denied the Harts' motion to establish service dates as moot, and granted the Harts leave to file a motion to withdraw default admissions. The parties then briefed the Harts' motion to withdraw default admissions. Based upon its position that the Harts had admitted to their Requests by default, on February 25, 1997, the Dow defendants moved for summary judgment, essentially arguing that the Harts could not raise a genuine issue of fact that chlorpyrofis proximately caused Melissa's injuries. The Dow defendants' 12(M) statement referred in large part to its Requests for Admission. The Harts responded by filing a motion to strike the defendants' motion for summary judgment. On March 5, Terminex joined the Dow defendants' motion for summary judgment. DISCUSSION Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) authorizes a magistrate judge to issue binding orders that are \"not dispositive of a claim or defense.\" Under Federal Rule 72(a), a district court may reverse such a nondispositive order that is \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" If the order would be \"dispositive of a claim or defense of a party\", however, then Federal Rule 72(b) only authorizes a magistrate judge to issue a recommendation to the district court that is subject to that court's de novo review. I. Motion for Voluntary Dismissal.*3 As an initial matter, the Harts moved to voluntarily dismiss the Dow defendants. The court adopts the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and grants this motion. Consequently, the Magistrate Judge correctly denied the Dow defendants' motions to reconsider and drop non-diverse parties at moot, and recommended that the court similarly deny the Dow defendants' motion for summary judgment as moot. II. Joinder of Parties and Remand. The Magistrate Judge granted Terminex and Ballantyne's motions to reconsider the original order to grant plaintiffs leave to file their amended complaint. First, the Magistrate Judge found that, because the Harts failed to bring their intention to join a non-diverse party to the court, that prior Magistrate Judge had never properly evaluated the jurisdictional ramifications as required under 28 U.S.C. section 1447(e) . Consequently, he returned to the original motion to amend the complaint and determined that the equities favored denying the joinder of the non-diverse defendants. After denying the motion to amend the complaint, he struck the First and Second Amended Complaints. A. Motion to Reconsider. The court first addresses the Harts' objection that the Report committed an error of law in asserting his authority to reconsider the prior order or the standard under which he determined that reconsideration was appropriate. The Magistrate Judge rejected the defendants' asserted authority for review, Federal Rule 60(b), because it governs relief from final judgments. See Trans States Airlines v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., 86 F.3d 725, 728 (7th Cir.1996). But he reviewed Judge Gottschall's interlocutory order, regardless, pursuant to the inherent power of the court, see Atchley v. Heritage Cable Vision pursuant to Rule 54(b). See Pitvot v. Point Int'l, Inc. 1286, 1287 (N.D.Ill.1993) . The Harts argue that, because they never had the opportunity to address this issue, the court should not provide them with leave to brief the Magistrate Judge's authority and the appropriate standard. However, the Harts have been provided with ten days since the Report was issued to do just that. They have not provided the court with any reason to question the sound authority that the Magistrate Judge relied upon or his application of the authority of the case. Neither has this court's independentHart v. Dow Chemical, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997) 1997 WL 627645 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3research uncovered any. In their brief below, the Harts indicated that 28 U.S.C. section 636 and Federal Rule 72 proscribed review in light of their directions to parties to file objections to orders within ten days. But the fact that the original order was directed by a magistrate judge, instead of directly by this court, does not undermine the court's regular authority to review previous decisions for manifest errors of law or, especially, errors of apprehension. Quaker Alloy Casting Co. v. Gulfco Indus., Inc., 123 F.R.D. 282, 288 (N.D.Ill.1988) . As explained below, the record reveals that, in seeking leave to amend the complaint, the Harts never appropriately apprised the defendants or the court of its intention. Therefore, it is difficult to see how the defendants could be required to have raised an objection. *4 Moreover, the court finds that Judge Keys' conclusion, that reconsideration was warranted in light of the Harts' failure to inform the court of its intent to add non-diverse parties, was contrary to law. The Harts' written motion to amend their complaint explained that they sought only to drop their class action allegations. While plaintiffs' counsel had mentioned the possibility of adding new defendants at a hearing, this brief reference never alluded to an intent or possibility that they might join non-diverse parties that would threaten the court's jurisdiction over the case. The fact that plaintiffs' counsel referred to \"Waste Management\" simply cannot be construed as satisfying his responsibility to alert the court and parties to the Illinois citizenship of the new parties. In order to permit the joinder of non-diverse defendants after removal, a district court must exercise its discretionary authority under 28 U.S.C. section 1447(e). Morse v. Southland Corp., 816 F.Supp. F.2d 1179, 1182 (5th Cir.1987) ; Nab Const. Corp. Design-Cast, Inc., 1991 WL 87370 at * 2 (E.D.N.Y. May 16, 1991). But because neither Judge Gottschall nor the parties were alerted to such joinder, the Magistrate Judge correctly concluded that Judge Gottschall could not have evaluated the joinder as required by section 1447(e). The Harts' response that defendants could have raised any dispute with joining the parties in May of 1996 is not persuasive. The Harts have not disputed that the defendants promptly sent a letter to them challenging the propriety of joinder. The Harts responded by requesting leave to amend the complaint again to cure any jurisdictional problems. Only after their second amendment, did the Harts finally move to remand. Accordingly, the court finds that Judge Keys' decision to reconsider the motion to amend was not contrary to law.B. Motion Requesting Leave to File Amended Complaint. The Harts next object to the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that joinder of the new defendants was inappropriate under section 1447(e) .4 A motion to amend is a nondispositive motion, including a motion to amend to join new parties.5 Therefore, the court reviews any factual findings for whether they are clear error and legal findings for whether they are contrary to law. The court exercises broad discretion in determining whether joinder is appropriate under section 1447(e). E.g., Coley v. Dragon Ltd., 138 F.R.D. 460, 467 (E.D.Va.1990) . Accordingly, Judge Keys' determination that joinder was improper will only be contrary to law if Judge Keys abused his discretion in reaching that decision. *5 The parties do not dispute the critical factors in determining whether an amendment adding non-diverse defendants is appropriate: the extent to which the purpose of the amendment is to defeat federal jurisdiction, whether the plaintiff has been dilatory in asking for amendment, whether plaintiff will be significantly injured if amendment is not allowed, and any other factors bearing on the equities. Witknowski v. Toyota Indus. Equip., Inc., 1992 (quoting Hensgen, 833 F.2d 1179, 1182). After reviewing the record, the Magistrate Judge found that the record evidenced forum shopping on the part of the Harts and that the Harts had been dilatory in amending their complaint to add the non-diverse parties. In light of these findings, the Magistrate Judge further concluded that Terminex's interest in retaining the case in a neutral forum outweighed the Harts' interest in challenging of their defendants together in a single forum. First, the court cannot say the Report's finding that the Harts have engaged to some extent in forum shopping is clearly erroneous. The court agrees with the Harts that their amendment to add the FIFRA jurisdictional basis, and subsequent effort to remand their case, do not provide particularly strong evidence of forum shopping. On the other hand, the Harts' flaccid effort to use FIFRA as a jurisdictional basis does not provide evidence to the contrary. It is difficult to believe that counsel did not make any effort to locate precedent on the Seventh Circuit's view of such a jurisdictional basis before amending their complaint. SeeHart v. Dow Chemical, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997) 1997 WL 627645 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4Shaw v. Dow Brands, Inc., 994 F.2d 364, 366 (7th Cir.1993) . Besides, the Harts filed their claim in state court despite the diverse identity of the original defendants. In their briefs below, the defendants pointed to ample motive for forum shopping. Federal courts have been hostile to any testimony of the Harts' originally retained toxicologist, Dr. Robert K. Simon, on issues of medical causation. See Goeway v. United States, 886 F.Supp. 1268, (S.D.Ohio 1992), aff'd, 24 F.3d 809 (6th Cir.1994). More notably, the Harts face Seventh Circuit precedent hostile to the admissibility of evidence relating to multiple chemical sensitivity disorder. See Bradley v. Brown, 42 F.3d 434, 438 (7th Cir.1994) . The Harts also failed to answer the defendants' point that Harts' experts allegedly identified several other pesticides in suspicious quantities, and yet they have failed to pursue the manufacturers of those pesticides. As the Harts argue, the record also indicates that they have legitimate interests in attempting to pursue the non-diverse defendants. They assert that their residence also remained contaminated by pesticides applied or manufactured by these defendants. Beside apparently hoping to look at the combination of chemicals as the cause of Melissa's injuries, they also hope to avoid having the various defendants attempt to shift blame to the absent parties. Finally, the Harts would rather avoid the expense, complications and risks of parallel litigation. But the Report never indicates that the Harts only interest was forum shopping. Consequently, the court does not find the Report's finding of forum shopping \"inexplicable\" or in clear error. *6 Second, the record provides ample support for the Report's finding that the Harts were dilatory in adding the non-diverse defendants. While the Harts had sought leave to amend their complaint at the end of February 1996, as explained above, the court does not consider this an effort to add non-diverse parties. Rather, the Harts did not join the non-diverse defendants until May 1996, some 14 months after their claims were removed to federal court. Although not moving at a fast pace, the case is hardly in its infancy. The court cannot find that the defendants suffer no prejudice from such a belated removal to a new venue. The Harts respond that they simply had not identified the defendants until the spring of 1996. However, in contrast to the Harts' disingenuous position in their original brief, the evidence reveals that their expert had reported \"highly concentrated\" levels of Velsicol's pesticides in the humidifierfilters of their home in the spring of 1995. As the Report admonishes, the Harts still have not provided any convincing explanation of why it took almost a year for them to obtain the additional necessary evidence to decide to join Velsicol. The Report accepted the Harts' claim that they had not learned of Ballantyne and WMPC's involvement until January 26, 1996. The court finds no error in Judge Keys' suspicion of the Harts' explanation for their five month effort to obtain the verification that counsel felt was necessary to join the parties as defendants. Finally, the Harts have failed to demonstrate that Judge Keys abused his discretion in finding that the equities weigh in favor of Terminex. Terminex has a significant interest in proceeding in a federal instead of an out of state forum. See Poulos v. NAAS Foods, Inc., 959 F.2d 69, 71 (7th Cir.1992) . The court fails to discern why Terminex's theoretical hundreds or thousand of suits out of state should diminish its concern of out of state bias. In addition, the Harts' delay of over one year before attempting to remove their case is likely to cause at least some prejudice to Terminex's efforts in federal court to this time. The court does not discount the prejudice that the Harts will suffer. But neither did Judge Keys. Judge Keys considered the Harts' assertion that they would face multiple litigation and found it was not sufficient to warrant joinder. In light of his findings of dilatory conduct and some improper motive, the court cannot say that Judge Keys abused his discretion in finding that the equities indicated that it was inappropriate to permit Hart to join the new defendants. For the first time, the Harts raise in their objections concern that nonjoinder will force them to face an array of statute of limitations defenses to their claims against WMPC and Veliscol.6 But any statute of limitations defenses directed to their original effort at joining the new defendants would also be faced in this forum as well. The Harts have provided no legal argument as to how those defenses would differ in the Illinois courts. To the extent that the striking of their amended complaints may render their claims stale, the Harts' own dilatory conduct in originally amending their complaint is to blame. *7 Accordingly, the court finds that Judge Keys' denial of the Harts' motion to amend the complaint was not contrary to law. Because we affirm Judge Keys' refusal to grant the Harts leave to join the new defendants, the court adopts his recommendations to deny the Harts' motion to remand,Hart v. Dow Chemical, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997) 1997 WL 627645 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5as well as deny Velsicol's motion to dismiss, Ballantyne's motion to dismiss and WMPC's motion to dismiss. III. Default Motions and Summary Judgment. The Harts also object to Judge Keys' decision to deny their motion to withdraw default admissions. Federal Rule provides that failure to answer a request in 30 days results in a deemed admission. In his Report, Judge Keys considered the Harts to have received the requests on January 20, 1997, when they admit to having received the Dow defendants' Requests for Admission. The Harts also do not claim to have answered the Dow defendants' Requests until April 15.7 The Harts filed their briefs in support of their motion to withdraw any default admissions in February and March of 1997. However, during that time, they never provided any answer to the Requests. In his Report, Judge Keys denied the Harts' motion to withdraw and stated that they never appropriately responded to the Requests despite repeated prompting by the court. In addition, Judge Keys explained that, in support of their motion to withdraw, the Harts never came forward with evidence in support of the merits of their case affected by the default admissions. The Harts assert that the Report's treatment of their motion to withdraw the default admissions suffers from three critical defects. First, the Harts argue, as in their motion to withdraw, that Requests themselves were improper. Second, the Harts object that, in contrast to the Reports' implication, they served the Dow defendants with their answers on April 15. The Harts argue that they had not responded pending the disposition of their motions to establish the service dates of the originally mailed Requests and to withdraw the default admissions. Third, the Harts object that their briefs and attached exhibits demonstrated that withdrawal of any defects was appropriate. Although the Report does not explicitly address the Harts' challenge to the substantive propriety of the Requests, this is in all likelihood because there is nothing inappropriate about them. The Requests inquired as to whether the Harts had any evidence that chlorpyrofis caused or contributed to Melissa's injuries, any written report, diagnosis or opinion from a physician supporting such causation, as well as other inquiries on evidence relating to defects in the chlorpyrofis. The Harts contend that these inquiries are not authorized by Rule 36. However, they cite to no case law prohibiting such requests.*8 There is nothing improper about a request simply because it goes to an ultimate fact that may be dispositive of the case, Cereghino v. Boeing Co., 873 F.Supp. 398 (D.C.Or.1994), or because Requests effectively cover the entire case. See Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. Deutz-Allis Corp., 120 F.R.D. 655, 658 (E.D.N.C.1985). Although it is inappropriate to request admissions to pure legal conclusions, see Golden Valley Microwave Foods, Inc. v. Weaver Popcorn Co., 130 F.R.D. 92, 95-96 (N.D.Ind.1990), requests on mixed matters of law and fact or other legal conclusions that directly relate to the facts of the case are authorized. See, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Wallenstein, 1996 WL 729816 at *3 (E.D.Pa. December 17, 1996) . The critical requests went to whether the Harts possessed certain types of evidence, or any evidence, to support their factual claim that the chlorpyrofis caused Melissa's injuries. To the extent that this request was broad, defendants risked that any ambiguities would be construed against it. See Ortho Diagnostic Sys., Inc. v. Miles, Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (D.C.N.Y.1994) . However, the Harts also question whether the Requests were improperly premature. Rule 36(a) provides that requests for admission may not be served before the parties have conferred under Federal Rule 26(f), unless authorized by an agreement of the parties or the court. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 36(a). The record does not reveal that any Rule 26(f) conference had taken place. Consequently, the Dow defendants' Requests were only proper if served with leave of the court or by agreement of the parties. From the parties current presentation of the record, it is unclear whether the Dow defendants served their Requests in a manner permitted under Rule 36(a). If they were not, then deeming those Requests admitted would be contrary to law. Assuming that the Requests were properly authorized by Rule 36(a), there is also some ambiguity as to whether the Harts provided a timely response. Rule 36(b) provides that a party must respond to a request for admission within thirty days of proper service by an \"answer or objection.\" In his Report, Judge Keys appeared to consider January 20, 1997, as the day of service of the Requests. There is some further support for this being the critical date in Judge Keys' January 22 minute order declaring the Harts' motion to establish the service dates of the originally claimed requests moot. While the Harts did not answer the Requests until April 15, they did submit their briefs moving for withdrawal of admissions. Although not entitled objections, these briefs primarily challenged the propriety of the Requests. In addition, assuming that Judge Keys did not consider the Requests served on the October dateHart v. Dow Chemical, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1997) 1997 WL 627645 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6claimed by the Dow defendants, then the Harts had no default admissions to withdraw. *9 In light of these ambiguities, the court will grant the Harts' request for further briefing with respect to the motion to withdraw default admissions, as well as the related motion for summary judgment and motion to strike the motion for summary judgment. The parties are advised to address the concerns expressed by the court above, as well as Judge Keys' conclusion that the Harts failed to adequately support their motion to withdraw the default admissions. Terminex is granted leave to file a brief in response to this order and the Harts' objections by October 17, 1997. This brief should be no more than fifteen pages in length. The Harts may file a reply brief of no more than fifteen pages by October 31,1997. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, the court adopts Judge Keys' report and recommendation in part and orders further briefing with regard to the issue of plaintiffs' default admissions and Terminex's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' motion to voluntarily dismissthe Dow defendants is granted. Consequently, the Dow defendants' motion to reconsider and to drop non-diverse parties, and Dow defendants' motion for summary judgment are denied as moot. Defendant Terminex's motion for reconsideration and defendant Ballantyne's motion to join in Dow Chemical's consolidated motion for reconsideration are granted. Consequently, the plaintiffs' motion to remand is denied as moot. In addition, defendants Velsicol, Ballantyne and WMPC are dismissed from the case; defendant Velsicol's motion to dismiss is denied as moot; defendant Ballantyne's motion to dismiss is denied as moot; and defendant WMPC's motion to dismiss and motion for leave to amend the motion to dismiss are denied as moot. Disposition of the remaining portions of Judge Keys' report and recommendation, addressing plaintiff's motion to withdraw default admissions, Terminex's motion for summary judgment and plaintiff's motion to strike defendants' motion for summary judgment, will be considered upon further briefing as provided in the order above. All Citations Not Reported in F.Supp., 1997 WL 627645 Footnotes 1The amended complaints allege that Terminex retained inventory stocks of chlordane and heptachlor, as well as continued to commercially apply those chemicals. See Second Amended Complaint \u00b6 19. But these complaints only appear to have alleged that Terminex applied the product, Dursban, to the Harts' residence. Id . at \u00b6 23. In addition, these complaints never allege that Dursban contained either chlordane or heptachlor. 2Magistrate Judge Joan Gottschall to whom the case was initially referred was appointed as an Article III district court judge and the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys. 3The Harts contend that the Report erroneously states that they never filed a motion to withdraw default admissions. The record indicates that the Harts only filed a motion for leave to file a motion to withdraw and, subsequently, two briefs in support of such a motion. Consequently, the Report appears accurate. Regardless, any error would have been harmless as Judge Keys indicated that he considered the supporting briefs notwithstanding. 4In their objections, the Harts present their arguments on this matter in their objection to Judge Keys' denial of their motion to remand. 5The Harts have not challenged Judge Keys' characterization of the motions for reconsideration or to join the non- diverse parties as nondispositive. In addition, a refusal to join parties, at least those not indispensable, is not necessarily dispositive of any substantive claims. In fact, even a motion to remand is not considered a dispositive motion. See, e.g., Young v. James, 168 F.R.D. 24, 25026 (E.D.Va.1996) (containing excellent analysis and collection of case law). 6The Harts never responded to Terminex's argument that Ballantyne would clearly be dismissed from this action. The complaint, itself, alleges that Ballantyne dissolved as a corporation in 1989. Illinois law imposes a statute of limitations against claims against dissolved corporations of five years following their dissolution. 805 ILCS 5/22.80. The Harts did not file their action against Ballantyne until after this five year window. 7Of course, Terminex is the only defendant remaining. Terminex did not serve their own Requests until April 29, 1997. The Harts responded to Terminex's Request within the 30 day frame on May 22, 1997. However, the Harts do argue that Rule 36 admissions only relate to the requesting defendant. Nothing in the Rule indicates that it is limited so.Hart v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2**683 Syllabus* Alleging that they were defrauded by misrepresentations in a registration statement and prospectus for certain securities, purchasers of such securities brought a class action in Federal District Court against most of the participants in the offering, seeking recovery under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), which makes it unlawful for \"any\" person to use \"any\" manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in the purchase or sale of \"any\" security. The trial judge instructed the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs had proved their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence, and judgment was entered on the basis of a jury verdict in plaintiffs' favor. The Court of Appeals held that a cause of action may be maintained under \u00a7 10(b) for fraudulent **684 misrepresentations and omissions even when, as in this case, that conduct might also be actionable under \u00a7 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), which expressly allows purchasers of a registered security to sue certain enumerated parties who play a direct role in a registered offering when false or misleading information is included in a registration statement. However, the Court of Appeals concluded that a plaintiff seeking recovery under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act must prove his case by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, and reversed and remanded on other grounds. Held: 1. The availability of an express remedy under \u00a7 11 of the 1933 Act does not preclude defrauded purchasers of registered securities from maintaining an action under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act. Pp. 686-690. (a) The two provisions involve distinct causes of action and were intended to address different types of wrongdoing. Under \u00a7 11, a plaintiff need only show a material misstatement or omission in a registration statement to establish a prima facie case. Such an action must be brought by a purchaser of a registered security, and can only be brought against certain parties. In contrast, \u00a7 10(b) is a \"catchall\" antifraud provision and requires a purchaser or seller of a security, in order to establish a cause of action, to prove that the defendant acted with scienter. Pp. 686-688. (b) To exempt conduct actionable under \u00a7 11 from liability under \u00a7 10(b) would conflict with the basic purpose of the 1933 Act: to provide greater protection to purchasers ofregistered securities. It is hardly a novel proposition that the two Acts prohibit some of the same conduct. Cf. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668. A cumulative construction of the remedies under the Acts is also supported by the fact that when Congress comprehensively revised the securities laws in 1975, federal courts had consistently recognized an implied private right of action under \u00a7 10(b) even where express remedies under \u00a7 11 or other provisions were available. A cumulative construction of the securities laws also furthers their broad remedial purposes. Pp. 688-690. 2. Persons seeking recovery under \u00a7 10(b) need prove their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence only, not by clear and convincing evidence. The preponderance standard has been consistently employed in private actions under the securities laws. Cf. SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 64 S.Ct. 120, 88 L.Ed. 88. Reference to the traditional use of a higher burden of proof in civil fraud actions at common law is unavailing here. An important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived deficiencies in the available common-law protections by establishing higher standards of conduct in the securities industry. The balance of the parties' interests in this case warrants use of the preponderance standard, which allows both parties to share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion. While defendants face the risk of opprobrium that may result from a finding of fraudulent conduct, defrauded investors are among the very individuals Congress sought to protect in the securities laws, and if they prove that it is more likely than not that they were defrauded, they should recover.

Opinion Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court. These consolidated cases raise two unresolved questions concerning Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). The first is whether purchasers of registered securities who allege they were defrauded by misrepresentations in a registration statement may maintain an action under Section 10(b) notwithstanding the express remedy for **685 misstatements and omissions in registration statements provided by Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k . The second question is whether persons seeking recovery under Section 10(b) must prove their cause of action by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence. I In 1969 Texas International Speedway, Inc. (\"TIS\"), filed a registration statement and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission offering a total of $4,398,900 in securities to the public. The proceeds of the sale were to be used to finance the construction of an automobile speedway. The entire issue was sold on the offering date, October 30, 1969. TIS did not meet with success, however, and the corporation filed a petition for bankruptcy on November 30, 1970. *378 In 1972 plaintiffs Huddleston and Bradley instituted a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas1 on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of TIS securities. The complaint alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the 1934 Act\") and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 CFR 240.10b-5.2 Plaintiffs sued most of the participants in the offering, including the accounting firm,Herman & MacLean, which had issued an opinion concerning certain financial statements and a pro forma balance sheet3 that were contained in the registration statement and prospectus. Plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had engaged in a fraudulent scheme to misrepresent or conceal material facts regarding the financial condition of TIS, including the costs incurred in building the speedway. After a three-week trial, the District Judge submitted the case to the jury on special interrogatories relating to liability. The judge instructed the jury that liability could be found only if the defendants acted with scienter.4 The judge also instructed the jury to determine whether plaintiffs had proven their cause of action by a preponderance of the evidence. *379 After the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on the submitted issues, the judge concluded that Herman & MacLean and others had violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by making fraudulent misrepresentations in the TIS registration statement.5 The court then determined the amount of damages and entered judgment for the plaintiffs. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a cause of action may be maintained under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act for fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions even when that conduct might also be actionable under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"the 1933 Act\"). Huddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534, 540-543 (1981). However, the Court of Appeals **686 disagreed with the District Court as to the appropriate standard of proof for an action under Section 10(b), concluding that a plaintiff must prove his case by \"clear and convincing\" evidence. Id., at 545-546. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment on other grounds and remanded the case for a new trial. Id., at 547-550, 560. We granted certiorari to consider whether an implied cause of action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act will lie for conduct subject to an express civil remedy under the 1933 Act, an issue we have previously reserved,6 and to decide the standard of proof applicable to actions under Section 10(b).7 *380 456 U.S. 914, 102 S.Ct. 1766, 72 L.Ed.2d (1982) . We now affirm the court of appeals' holding that plaintiffs could maintain an action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, but we reverse as to the applicable standard of proof.Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375 (1983) 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 99,058 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4II The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \"constitute interrelated components of the federal regulatory scheme governing transactions in securities.\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 206, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1387, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). The Acts created several express private rights of action,8 one of which is contained in Section 11 of the 1933 Act. In addition to the private actions created explicitly by the 1933 and 1934 Acts, federal courts have implied private remedies under other provisions of the two laws.9 Most significantly for present purposes, a private right of action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 has been consistently recognized for more than 35 years.10 The existence of this implied remedy is simply beyond peradventure. *381 The issue in this case is whether a party should be barred from invoking this established remedy for fraud because the allegedly **687 fraudulent conduct would apparently also provide the basis for a damage action under Section 11 of the 1933 Act.11 The resolution of this issue turns on the fact that the two provisions involve distinct causes of action and were intended to address different types of wrongdoing. Section 11 of the 1933 Act allows purchasers of a registered security to sue certain enumerated parties in a registered offering when false or misleading information is included in a registration statement. The section was designed to assure compliance with the disclosure provisions of the Act by imposing a stringent standard of liability12 on the parties who *382 play a direct role in a registered offering.13 If a plaintiff purchased a security issued pursuant to a registration statement, he need only show a material misstatement or omission to establish his prima facie case. Liability against the issuer of a security is virtually absolute,14 even for innocent misstatements. Other defendants bear the burden of demonstrating due diligence. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(b) . [1] Although limited in scope, Section 11 places a relatively minimal burden on a plaintiff. In contrast, Section 10(b) is a \"catchall\" antifraud provision,15 but it requires a plaintiff to carry a heavier burden to establish a cause of action. While a Section 11 action must be brought by a purchaser of a registered security, must be based on misstatementsor omissions in a registration statement, and can only be brought against certain parties, a Section 10(b) action can be brought by a purchaser or seller of \"any security\" against \"any person\" who has used \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j (emphasis added). However, a Section 10(b) plaintiff carries a heavier burden than a Section 11 plaintiff. Most significantly, he must prove that the defendant acted with scienter, i.e., with intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.16 Since Section 11 and Section 10(b) address different types of wrongdoing, we see no reason to carve out an exception to Section 10(b) for fraud occurring in a registration statement just because the *383 same conduct may also be actionable under Section 11.17 Exempting such conduct from liability under Section 10(b) would conflict with the basic purpose of the 1933 Act: to provide greater protection to purchasers of registered securities. It would be anomalous indeed if the special protection afforded to purchasers in a registered offering by the 1933 Act were deemed to **688 deprive such purchasers of the protections against manipulation and deception that Section 10(b) makes available to all persons who deal in securities. While some conduct actionable under Section 11 may also be actionable under Section 10(b), it is hardly a novel proposition that the Securities Exchange Act and the Securities Act \"prohibit some of the same conduct.\" United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.S. 768, 778, 99 2077, 2084, 60 L.Ed.2d 624 (1979) (applying Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act to conduct also prohibited by Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act in an action by the SEC). \" 'The fact that there may well be some overlap is neither unusual nor unfortunate.' \" Ibid., quoting SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 468, 89 S.Ct. 564, 572, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969) . In savings clauses included in the 1933 and 1934 Acts, Congress rejected the notion that the express remedies of the securities laws would preempt all other rights of action. Section 16 of the 1933 Act states unequivocally that \"[t]he rights and remedies provided by this subchapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist at law or in equity.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p . Section 28(a) of the a parallel provision. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78bb(a) . These provisions confirm that the remedies in each Act were to be supplemented by \"any and all\" additional remedies. This conclusion is reinforced by our reasoning in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra, which held that actions underHerman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375 (1983) 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 99,058 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5Section 10(b) require proof of scienter and do not encompass negligent conduct. In so holding, we noted that each of the express civil *384 remedies in the 1933 Act allowing recovery for negligent conduct is subject to procedural restrictions not applicable to a Section 10(b) action.18 425 U.S., at 208-210, 96 S.Ct., at 1388-89. We emphasized that extension of Section 10(b) to negligent conduct would have allowed causes of action for negligence under the express remedies to be brought instead under Section 10(b), \"thereby nullify [ing] the effectiveness of the carefully drawn procedural restrictions on these express actions.\" Id., at 210, 96 S.Ct., at 1389 (footnote omitted). In reasoning that scienter should be required in Section 10(b) actions in order to avoid circumvention of the procedural restrictions surrounding the express remedies, we necessarily assumed that the express remedies were not exclusive. Otherwise there would have been no danger of nullification. Conversely, because the added burden of proving scienter attaches to suits under Section 10(b), invocation of the Section 10(b) remedy will not \"nullify\" the procedural restrictions that apply to the express remedies.19 This cumulative construction of the remedies under the 1933 and 1934 Acts is also supported by the fact that, when Congress comprehensively revised the securities laws in 1975, a consistent line of judicial decisions had permitted plaintiffs to sue under Section 10(b) regardless of the availability of express remedies. In 1975 Congress enacted the \"most substantial and significant revision of this country's Federal securities laws since the passage of the Securities Exchange *385 Act in 1934.\"20 See **689 Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub.L. No. 94-29, 89 Stat. 97. When Congress acted, federal courts had consistently and routinely permitted a plaintiff to proceed under Section 10(b) even where express remedies under Section 11 or other provisions were available.21 In light of this *386 well-established judicial interpretation, Congress' decision to leave Section 10(b) intact suggests that Congress ratified the cumulative nature of the Section 10(b) action. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, --- U.S. ----, ----, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 1841, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982); Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580-581, 98 S.Ct. 866, 870, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) . A cumulative construction of the securities laws also furthers their broad remedial purposes. In enacting the 1934 Act, Congress stated that its purpose was \"to impose requirements necessary to make [securities] regulation and control reasonably complete and effective.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a778b. In furtherance of that objective, Section 10(b) makes it unlawful to use \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\" in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. The effectiveness of the broad proscription against fraud in Section 10(b) would be undermined if its scope were restricted by the existence of an express remedy under Section 11.22 Yet we have repeatedly recognized that securities laws combating fraud should be construed \"not technically and *387 restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate [their] remedial purposes.\" SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 284, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963). Accord: Superintendent of Insurance **690 v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971) ; Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 151, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 1471, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972). We therefore reject an interpretation of the securities laws that displaces an action under Section 10(b).23 [2] Accordingly, we hold that the availability of an express remedy under Section 11 of the 1933 Act does not preclude defrauded purchasers of registered securities from maintaining an action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act. To this extent the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed. III In a typical civil suit for money damages, plaintiffs must prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence.24 Similarly, in an action by the SEC to establish fraud under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) , we have held that proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices to establish liability. SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 355, 64 S.Ct. 120, 125, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943). \"Where ... proof is offered in a civil action, as here, a preponderance of the evidence will establish the case ....\" *388 Ibid. The same standard applies in administrative proceedings before the SEC25 and has been consistently employed by the lower courts in private actions under the securities laws.26 The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that plaintiffs in a Section 10(b) suit must establish their case by clear and convincing evidence. The Court of Appeals relied primarily on the traditional use of a higher burden of proof in civil fraud actions at common law. 640 F.2d, at 545-546. Reference to common law practices can be misleading, however, since the historical considerations underlying the imposition ofHerman & MacLean v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6a higher standard of proof have questionable pertinence here.27 See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 744-745, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1929, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) **691 (\"[T]he typical fact situation in which the classic tort of misrepresentation and deceit evolved was light years from the world of commercial transactions to which Rule 10b-5 is applicable.\"). Moreover, the antifraud provisions of the securities laws are not coextensive with *389 common law doctrines of fraud.28 Indeed, an important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived deficiencies in the available common law protections by establishing higher standards of conduct in the securities industry. See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 186, 84 S.Ct. 275, 279, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963). We therefore find reference to the common law in this instance unavailing. Where Congress has not prescribed the appropriate standard of proof and the Constitution does not dictate a particular standard, we must prescribe one. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 95, 101 S.Ct. 999, 1004, 67 L.Ed.2d 69 (1981) . See generally Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, supra, 421 U.S., at 749, 95 S.Ct., at 1931 (private cause of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must be judicially delimited until Congress acts). In doing so, we are mindful that a standard of proof \"serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.\" Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1808, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) . See Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 370-371, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1075, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring). Thus, we have required proof by clear and convincing evidence where particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake. See, e.g., Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (proceeding to terminate parental rights); Addington v. Texas, supra (involuntary commitment proceeding); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 285-286, 87 S.Ct. 483, 487, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966) (deportation).29 By contrast, imposition of even severe civil sanctions that do not implicate such interests has been permitted after proof by a *390 preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Regan, 232 U.S. 37, 48-49, 34 S.Ct. 213, 217, 58 L.Ed. 494 (1914) (proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices in civil suits involving proof of acts that expose a party to a criminal prosecution). Thus, in interpreting a statutory provision in Steadman v. SEC, supra, we upheld use of the preponderance standard in SEC administrative proceedings concerningalleged violations of the antifraud provisions. The sanctions imposed in the proceedings included an order permanently barring an individual from practicing his profession. And in SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S., at 355, 64 S.Ct., at 125, we held that a preponderance of the evidence suffices to establish fraud under Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act. A preponderance-of-the-evidence standard allows both parties to \"share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.\" Addington v. Texas, 421 U.S., at 423, 99 S.Ct., at 1808. Any other standard expresses a preference for one side's interests. The balance of interests in this case warrants use of the preponderance standard. On the one hand, the defendants face the risk of opprobrium that may result from a finding of fraudulent conduct, but this risk is identical to that in an action under Section 17(a), which is governed by the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. The interests of defendants in a securities case do not differ qualitatively from the interests of defendants sued for violations **692 of other federal statutes such as the antitrust or civil rights laws, for which proof by a preponderance of the evidence suffices. On the other hand, the interests of plaintiffs in such suits are significant. Defrauded investors are among the very individuals Congress sought to protect in the securities laws. If they prove that it is more likely than not that they were defrauded, they should recover. [3] We therefore decline to depart from the preponderance- of-the-evidence standard generally applicable in civil actions.30 *391 Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' decision as to the appropriate standard of proof is reversed. IV The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part and otherwise remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed.2d 499. 1The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in January, 1973. 2Plaintiffs also alleged violations of, inter alia, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a). We have previously reserved decision on whether Section 17(a) affords a private remedy, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, 439 U.S. 551, 557, n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 790, 795, n. 9, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979), and we do so once again. Plaintiffs have abandoned their Section 17(a) claim, Brief, at 4, n. 6, and the Court of Appeals did not address the existence of a separate cause of action under Section 17(a). Accordingly, there is no need for us to decide the issue. 3A pro forma balance sheet is one prepared on the basis of assumptions as to future events. 4The judge stated that reckless behavior could satisfy the scienter requirement. While this instruction reflects the prevailing view of the courts of appeals that have addressed the issue, see McLean v. Alexander, 599 F.2d 1190, 1197, and n. 12 (CA3 1979) (collecting cases), we have explicitly left open the question whether recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 194, n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1381, n. 12, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). 5The trial court also found that Herman & MacLean had aided and abetted violations of Section 10(b). While several courts of appeals have permitted aider and abettor liability, see IIT, An International Investment Trust v. Cornfeld, 619 F.2d 909, 922 (CA2 1980) (collecting cases), we specifically reserved this issue in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra, 425 U.S., at 191-192, n. 7, 96 S.Ct., at 1380, n. 7. Cf. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith v. Curran, ---U.S. ----, ----, 102 S.Ct. 1825, 1847-48, 72 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982) (discussing liability for participants in a conspiracy under analogous Commodity Exchange Act provision). 6See, e.g., Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 752 n. 15, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 1933 n. 15, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975). 7The Fifth Circuit's adoption of a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard in a private action under Section 10(b) appears to be unprecedented. See E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 98.04, at 930 (1981 Cum.Supp.). Other courts have employed a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in private actions under the securities laws. See, e.g., Mihara v. Dean Witter & Co., 619 F.2d 814, 824-825 (CA9 1980); Dzenits 494 F.2d 168, 171, n. 2 (CA10 1974); Globus Service, Inc., 418 F.2d 1276, 1291 (CA2 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913, 90 S.Ct. 913, 25 L.Ed.2d 93 (1970); Franklin Life Insurance Co. v.

Ltd., S.Ct. 896, 66 L.Ed.2d 827 (1981) (Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act); Kirshner v. United States, 603 F.2d 234, 241 denied, 442 U.S. 99 S.Ct. 2821, 61 L.Ed.2d 274 (1979) (Section 17(a) of the Securities Act). But see, e.g., Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) (no implied private right of action under Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act); Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 926, 51 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977) (defeated tender offeror has no implied private right of action under Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act). 10The right of action was first recognized in Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., 69 F.Supp. 512 (ED Pa.1946). By 1961, four courts of appeals and several district courts in other circuits had recognized the existence of a private remedy under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and only one district court decision had reached a contrary conclusion. See III L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1763-1764 and nn. 260-263 (2d ed.1961) (collecting cases). By 1969, the existence of a private cause of action had been recognized by ten of the eleven courts of appeals. See VI L. Loss, Securities Regulation 3871-3873 (2d ed. Supp.1969) (collecting cases). When the question whether an implied cause of action can be brought under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 was first considered in this Court, we confirmed the existence of such a cause of action without extended discussion. See Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U.S. 6, 13, n. 9, 92 S.Ct. 165, 169, n. 9, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). We have since repeatedly reaffirmed that \"the existence of a private cause of action for violations of the statute and the Rule is now well established.\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra, 425 U.S., at 196, 96 S.Ct., at 1382 (citing prior cases). 11The Court of Appeals noted that the plaintiffs \"apparently did have a Section 11 remedy.\" 640 F.2d, at 541, n. 5. While accurate as to the two other defendants, this conclusion may be open to question with respect to Herman & MacLean.Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375 (1983) 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 99,058 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8Accountants are liable under Section 11 only for those matters which purport to have been prepared or certified by them. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a)(4) . Herman & MacLean contends that it did not \"expertise\" at least some of the materials that were the subject of the lawsuit, Tr. of Oral Arg. at 6-8, which if true could preclude a Section 11 remedy with respect to these materials. 12See H.R.Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1933) (Section 11 creates \"correspondingly heavier legal liability\" in line with responsibility to the public). 13A Section 11 action can be brought only against the issuer, its directors or partners, underwriters, and accountants who are named as having prepared or certified the registration statement. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). At the same time, Sections 3 and 4 of the 1933 Act exclude a wide variety of securities (such as those issued by the government and certain banks) and transactions (such as private ones and certain small offerings) from the registration requirement. \u00a7 77c and d. 14See Feit v. Leasco Corp., 332 F.Supp. 544, 575 (EDNY 1971); R. Jennings & H. Marsh, Securities Regulation 828-829 (1977). 15See Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1117, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980). 16See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra, 425 U.S. at 193, 96 S.Ct., at 1380 . 17Cf. Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite, 90 S.Ct. 616, 624, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970) (existence of express provisions for recovery of attorneys' fees in \u00a7\u00a7 9(e) and 18(a) of 1934 Act does not preclude award of attorneys' fees under \u00a7 14(a) of the Act). 18For example, a plaintiff in a Section 11 action may be required to post a bond for costs, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e), and the statute of limitations is only one year, \u00a7 77m. In contrast, Section 10(b) contains no provision requiring plaintiffs to post security for costs. Also, courts look to the most analogous statute of limitations of the forum state, which is usually longer than the period provided for Section 11 actions. See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra, 425 U.S., at 210, n. 29, 96 S.Ct., at 1389, n. 29 . 19See 1951); A.

Nixon, 429 F.2d 348, 355 (CA10 1970) (recognizing overlapping actions but resolving conflict in favor of express remedy where that remedy is \"explicit\"). Two early district court decisions had refused to recognize an action under Rule 10b-5 in the face of overlap with Section 11. Rosenberg v. Globe Aircraft Corp., 80 F.Supp. 123 (ED Pa.1948) ; Montague v. Electronic Corp. of America, 76 F.Supp. 933 (SDNY 1948). The latter case was not subsequently followed in the Southern District, e.g., Osborne v. Mallory, 86 F.Supp. 869 (SDNY 1949), and it has no precedential value in light of the Second Circuit's decision in Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., supra. The Rosenberg decision stood alone at the time of the 1975 amendments, and even that decision had not been followed in the district in which it was decided, Premier Industries, Inc. v. Delaware Valley Financial Corp., 185 F.Supp. 694 (ED Pa.1960) , or elsewhere within the same circuit, Dauphin Corp. v. Redwall Corp., 201 F.Supp. 466 (D.Del.1962) . Since the 1975 amendments, the lower courts have continued to recognize that an implied cause of action under Section 10(b) can be brought regardless of whether express remedies are available. See, e.g., Berger v. Bishop Investment Corp., 695 F.2d 302 (CA8 1982); Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. National Student Marketing Corp., 650 F.2d 342, 354-359 (CADC 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 954, 101 S.Ct. 3098, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981) ; Ross v. A.H.

These include corporate officers other than those specified in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a), lawyers not acting as \"experts,\" and accountants with respect to parts of a registration statement which they are not named as havingHerman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375 (1983) 103 S.Ct. 683, 74 L.Ed.2d 548, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 99,058 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9prepared or certified. If, as Herman & MacLean argues purchasers in registered offerings were required to rely solely on Section 11, they would have no recourse against such individuals even if the excluded parties engaged in fraudulent conduct while participating in the registration statement. The exempted individuals would be immune from federal liability for fraudulent conduct even though Section 10(b) extends to \"any person\" who engages in fraud in connection with a purchase or sale of securities. 23We also reject application of the maxim of statutory construction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius. See H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1173-1174 (tent. ed. 1958); Note, Implying Civil Remedies from Federal Regulatory Statutes, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 285, 290-291 (1963) . As we stated in SEC v. Joiner Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 350-351, 64 S.Ct. 120, 123, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943), such canons \"long have been subordinated to the doctrine that courts will construe the details of an act in conformity with its dominating general purpose.\" See generally Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 1257, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963) (favoring \"an analysis which reconciles the operation of both statutory schemes with one another rather than holding one completely ousted\"). We believe the maxim cannot properly be applied to a situation where the remedies redress different misconduct and where the remedial purposes of the Acts would be undermined by a presumption of exclusivity. 24See Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1808, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) . 25See Steadman SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 101 S.Ct. 999, 67 L.Ed.2d 69 (1981) . 26See note 7, supra. 27A higher standard of proof apparently arose in courts of equity when the chancellor faced claims that were unenforceable at law because of the Statute of Wills, the Statute of Frauds, or the parole evidence rule. See Note, Appellate Review in the Federal Courts of Findings Requiring More than a Preponderance of the Evidence, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 111, 112 (1946). Concerned that claims would be fabricated, the chancery courts imposed a more demanding standard of proof. The higher standard subsequently received wide acceptance in equity proceedings to set aside presumptively valid written instruments on account of fraud. See United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224, 240-241, 17 S.Ct. 809, 810, 42 L.Ed. 144 (1897); Southern Development Co. v.

United States, 123 U.S. 307, 316-319, 8 S.Ct. 131, 135-37, 31 L.Ed. 182 (1887) ; Maxwell Land-Grant Case, 121 U.S. 325, 7 S.Ct. 1015, 1028, 30 L.Ed. 949 (1887) (\"We take the general doctrine to be, that when in a court of equity it is proposed to set aside, to annul or to correct a written instrument for fraud or mistake in the execution of the instrument itself, the testimony on which this is done must be clear, unequivocal, and convincing, and that it cannot be done upon a bare preponderance of evidence which leaves the issue in doubt.\"). Such proceedings bear little relationship to modern lawsuits under the federal securities laws. 28See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 194, 84 S.Ct. 275, 284, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963) (common law doctrines of fraud which developed around transactions involving tangible items of wealth are ill-suited to the sale of intangibles such as securities); III L. Loss, Securities Regulation 1435 (2d ed. 1961). 29In Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252, 266, 100 S.Ct. 540, 548, 62 L.Ed.2d 461 (1980) , we held that the Due Process Clause did not require proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence even in an expatriation proceeding. Cf. Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 135-136, 78 S.Ct. 612, 616, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958) (in the absence of evidence of congressional intent to adopt a particular standard of proof, Court imposes clear-and-convincing-evidence standard in expatriation cases). 30The Court of Appeals also noted that the proof of scienter required in fraud cases is often a matter of inference from circumstantial evidence. If anything, the difficulty of proving the defendant's state of mind supports a lower standard of proof. In any event, we have noted elsewhere that circumstantial evidence can be more than sufficient. Michalic v. Cleveland Tankers, Inc., 364 U.S. 325, 330, 81 S.Ct. 6, 10, 5 L.Ed.2d 20 (1960) .

In a securities fraud case, judgment was entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, at Dallas, William M. Taylor, Jr., J., on the basis of a special jury verdict in answer to specific factual interrogatories. On appeal by certain defendants, the Court of Appeals, Alvin B. Rubin, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) there is implied cause of action under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 even when express cause of action is created by other sections of the federal securities laws; (2) corporate officers and accountants who prepared corporate issuer's prospectus in connection with securities offering are not sellers of those securities under the Texas Securities Act; and (3) trial court's failure to submit issues of reliance and causation to jury required new trial.

Opinion ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge: This eight-year securities litigation traverses the gamut of Rule 10b-5 issues. After lengthy discovery and a three-week trial to a jury, a judgment was entered on the basis of the jury's special verdict in answer to specific factual interrogatories. Despite this carnage, the battle must again be joined because the district court failed to submit crucial issues on reliance and causation to the jury. Although the judgment must be reversed, we nevertheless affirm the ruling that there is an implied cause of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 even when an express cause of action is created by other sections of the federal securities laws. We reverse the judgment holding that corporate officers and accountants who prepare the corporate issuer's prospectus in connection with a securities offering are sellers of those securities under the Texas Securities *539 Act. Finally, we consider other issues likely to recur at the unfortunately necessary new trial. I. FACTS Texas International Speedway, Inc.

The corporation was nonetheless short-lived, for on November 30, 1970, TIS filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act. In 1972, the plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of TIS securities filed this class action alleging claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated pursuant to that statute. While the class action complaint alleged a panoply of federal and state law violations, only two remain material: conspiracy to violate Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 and conspiracy to violate the Texas Securities Act (TSA), a pendent claim. The complaint sought damages from LoPatin, the former President, Treasurer and Director of TIS; Share, the former Executive Vice-President and Director of TIS; Herman and MacLean (H&M), the accountants who had participated in preparation of the prospectus, and others.1 With court approval, the class compromised its claims against the underwriters for $275,000 and those against the speedway contractor for $50,000. The court order stated that \"the release of any of the settling defendants is not to be treated as the release of a joint tort-feasor under common law.\" The amounts received in settlement were credited against the judgment eventually obtained by the plaintiffs but the nonsettling defendants' cross-claims for contribution were disallowed. The issues that now concern us focus on statements made in the TIS prospectus. It contained an audited balance sheet dated May 31, 1969, and an unaudited balance sheet dated August 31, 1969. It related that the speedway was under construction and the proceeds of the securities issue would be used to pay the costs of that construction. It also contained a pro forma balance sheet dated May 31, 1969, showing that, upon completion of the public offering of the securities and the application of the proceeds to the construction costs of the speedway, TIS would on the speedway's opening date have $93,870 in cash on hand after allocation of $295,771 for general administrative expenses. The trial judge submitted the case to the jury on special issues concerning whether the prospectus was materially misleading and, if so, whether this was done with scienter of various defendants. Despite the defendants' requests, he refused to submit special issues relating to reliance and causation.The jury found that the prospectus was materially misleading as to the cost of constructing the speedway and that the defendants had \"failed to disclose\" the true facts with reckless disregard for the truth.2*540 The trial judge then himself determined the amount of damages and entered judgment for the plaintiffs and against LoPatin, Share and H&M. II. THE IMPLICATION OF A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER SECTION 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5 DESPITE THE APPLICABILITY OF EXPRESS CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS The Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. s 77a et seq., (the 1933 Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. s 78a et seq., (the 1934 Act) each authorizes specific private civil actions for damages arising out of statutory violation.3 Together they \"constitute interrelated components of the federal regulatory scheme governing transactions in securities.\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 206, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1387, 47 L.Ed. 668, 684 (1976) . Each of the Acts contains general prohibitory sections that neither specifically authorize nor forbid a private cause of action. In a series of separate decisions, spanning four decades, courts have found that many of these provisions, including Section 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5, imply a private judicial remedy.4 *541 The plaintiffs alleged violations of Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. s 240.10b-5 , all of which have been held to imply a private action. However, the alleged misrepresentations in the prospectus would also warrant a suit under Sections 11 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. ss 77k and 77l (2). The apparent overlap in the applicability of the express liability provisions of the 1933 Act and the implied remedies raises the issue whether an implied cause of action is available when an express cause of action has been created, a question reserved by the Supreme Court in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 752 n.15, 95 S.Ct. L.Ed.2d 539, 559 n.15 (1975) , and again left open in Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 211 n.31, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1389 47 L.Ed.2d 668, 687 n.31 (1976), in considering theHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L.

The classic reconciliation of the apparent overlap of the express civil liability provisions of the 1933 Act and the cause of action implied in Rule 10b-5 is, according to 4 A. Bromberg, Securities Law: Fraud SEC Rule 10b-5 s 2.4, at 384.6 (Supp.1977), provided by Fischman v. Raytheon MFG. Co., 188 F.2d 783 (2d Cir. 1951) . In Fischman, the common stockholders who were the plaintiffs contended that they were injured by the misstatements in a registration statement pursuant to which preferred stock was issued. Because they had not purchased the registered securities, they had no claim under Section 11 of the 1933 Act. The trial court held that these common stockholders were not entitled to relief under Rule 10b-5 because to allow such a claim would circumvent the restrictions imposed in an action under Section 11. The Second Circuit, reversing the district court, noted that proof of fraud is required under Rule 10b-5 but not required in a Section 11 action. \"We think that when, to conduct actionable under s 11 of the 1933 Act, there is added the ingredient of fraud, then that conduct becomes actionable under s 10(b) of the 1934 Act and the Rule....\" 188 F.2d at 786-87.5 Moreover, in SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 89 S.Ct. 564, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969), the Supreme Court considered the contention that Rule 10b-5 does not cover misrepresentations in connection with proxy solicitations in the light of Section 14 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78n, which provides a complex regulatory scheme covering such solicitations. \"(T)he existence or nonexistence of regulation under s 14,\" the Court said, \"would not affect the scope of s 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The two sections of the (1934) Act apply to different sets of situations. Section 10(b) applies to all proscribed conduct in connection with a purchase or sale of any security; s 14 applies to all proxy solicitations, whether or not in connection with a purchase or sale. The fact that there may well be some overlap is neither unusual nor unfortunate.\" 393 U.S. at 468, 89 S.Ct. at 573, 21 L.Ed.2d at 680 (emphasis added). However, recent Supreme Court decisions curtailing the broader sweep given the Securities Acts by lower federal courts6 together with the footnote observations in Ernst & Ernst and Blue Chip Stamps recognizing, without deciding, the overlap issue, give substance to the argument that no remedy should be implied for actions covered *542 by express liability provisions of the statutes.7Two circuit courts have recently addressed the question.8 The Second Circuit adopted the Fischman rationale in Ross v. A. H. Robins Co., 607 F.2d 545 (2d Cir. 1979) , cert. denied, 446 946, 100 S.Ct. 2175, 64 L.Ed.2d 802 (1980) , holding that a cause of action may be implied in Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for conduct that might also permit suit under Section 18 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78r. While this court had the present case under advisement, the District of Columbia Circuit took the same position, holding that a remedy is implied under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act despite the possibility of overlap between that implied cause of action and express remedies provided by other sections of the securities laws. Wachovia Bank and Trust Co. v. National Student Marketing Corp., No. 79-1595 (D.C.Cir. 1980). See generally Note, Rule 10b-5: The Circuits Debate the Exclusivity of Remedies, The Purchaser-Seller Requirement, and Constructive Deception, 37 Wash. and Lee L.Rev. 877 (1980). [1] These decisions reason that the courts \"are not being asked to create a new judicial remedy. It is well established that a private remedy exists\" under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Ross v. A. H. Robins Co., 607 F.2d at 553.9 The question is whether an established remedy may be invoked despite the existence of another remedy for the same conduct. While Sections 11 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act, like Section 18 of the 1934 Act, contain limitations and requirements not exacted of Section 10(b) litigants, allowing invocation of the Section 10(b) remedy does not impermissibly nullify those constraints. To prevail under Section 10(b) a plaintiff must prove facts not necessary to recovery under the provisions of the 1933 Act. To recover under Section 10(b) , the plaintiff must prove deceit10 committed with scienter.11 [2] While here the alleged deceitful statements were lodged in a registration statement filed with the SEC, thus implicating the express liability provisions of the 1933 Act, to draw the distinction suggested and deny the implied action under Section 10(b) would make the existence of the action under Section 10(b) depend on whether the statement relied upon was or was not contained in an SEC filing. If deceitful statements were made both in SEC filings and elsewhere, then the existence of the Section 10(b) cause of action might depend *543 on whether the investor relied on one or the other. To hold that the purchasers in this case must be limited to the express liability provisions of the 1933 Act because the false statements were made in the prospectus filed with the SEC, would, as the court observed in Ross, \"encourage corporate managers to include theseHuddleston v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9misrepresentations in material filed with the S.E.C., for the sole purpose of insulating themselves from liability under s 10(b) and restricting the class of potential plaintiffs to the unlikely few who actually viewed and relied on the misleading information.\" 607 F.2d at 556 . Therefore, we hold that a cause of action lies under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 even if the deceit that is the basis for the Section 10(b) action may also be actionable under other express liability provisions of the securities law. III. ELEMENTS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER SECTION 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5 The elements necessary to prove a Section 10(b) claim have been so often applied by the lower federal courts that they can be stated in black letter fashion. To make out a claim under Section 10(b) , which is based on the common law action of deceit, the plaintiff must establish (1) a misstatement or an omission (2) of material fact (3) made with scienter (4) on which the plaintiff relied (5) that proximately caused his injury.12 We discuss each of these prerequisites in turn. A. Materiality Considering the definition of a material fact under Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act and the SEC rules governing proxy statements, the Supreme Court, in TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976) , adopted a \"general standard of materiality ... as follows: An omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would (not might ) consider it important in deciding how to vote.\" TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. at 449, 96 S.Ct. at 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d at 766 (emphasis added). \"(T)here must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.\" Id. at 449, 96 S.Ct. at 2132, 48 L.Ed.2d at 766. \"In this circuit, the test of materiality (under Rule 10b-5) is 'whether a reasonable man would attach importance to the fact misrepresented in determining his course of action.' Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing Co., 489 F.2d 579, 603-04 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 134, 42 L.Ed.2d Fickling, 621 F.2d 1362, 1365 n.9 (5th Cir. 1980). See Wheat v. Hall, 535F.2d 874, 876 (5th Cir. 1976); John R. Lewis, Inc. v. Newman, 446 F.2d 800, 804 (5th Cir. 1971). See generally Project, Recent Developments in Securities Law: Causes of Action Under Rule 10b-5, 26 Buffalo L.Rev. 503, 516-22 (1977). [3] The TIS prospectus warned the potential investor that \"THESE SECURITIES INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK\" and that the construction costs might be underestimated. Nonetheless, *544 there was evidence from which the jury might have inferred that, on the effective date of the registration statement, LoPatin, Share and H&M already knew that the cost of construction was understated and that consequently the Company's working capital position would not be as favorable as the prospectus reflected.13 To warn that the untoward may occur when the event is contingent is prudent; to caution that it is only possible for the unfavorable events to happen when they have already occurred is deceit. Considering the evidence presented, the jury could justifiably conclude that the prospectus misstated the costs of completion of the speedway, the amount of working capital that would be available to the Company and the urgency of TIS's need to generate funds from the operation of the speedway. Each of these facts, and, certainly their combined significance could all be considered important in the total mix of information considered by the securities purchaser. The fact that it is not unusual for the final cost of construction to exceed the contract price does not condone the deliberate misstatement of the cost anticipated on the basis of known events. The very fact that LoPatin and Share reduced certain estimated construction costs to prevent cost estimates from exceeding the estimates of available funds before the construction budget appeared in the prospectus, and the later revelation of construction cost \"overruns\" to the SEC in January, 1970, indicate that LoPatin, Share and H&M believed that the costs of completion figures would be considered important by the potential investor in making his ultimate investment decision. We conclude, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the finding of materiality of the misstatements.14 B. Scienter In Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the Rule 10b-5 implied cause of action requires a showing of scienter. See also Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 100 S.Ct.Huddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 101945, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980). The Court defined the term as \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. at 193 n.12, 96 S.Ct. at 1381 n.12, 47 L.Ed.2d at 677 n.12. In Aaron the Court expressly did not \"address the question, reserved in Hochfelder, ... whether, under some circumstances, scienter may also include reckless behavior.\" 446 U.S. at 686 n.5, 100 S.Ct. n.5 . [4] This circuit's position on whether reckless behavior is sufficient to establish scienter is presently uncertain because the panel decision in Broad v. Rockwell International Corp., 614 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1980) , was vacated by the granting of a rehearing en banc in that case, 618 F.2d 396 (5th Cir. 1980) . See Dwoskin v. Rollins, Inc., 634 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir. 1981) . The panel in Broad, concurring in the position accepted *545 by a number of other circuits,15 had expressly held that recklessness was sufficient to establish scienter. In cases decided both before and after the Broad decision, we have referred to establishing scienter by proof of reckless conduct.16 We here conclude that recklessness can, under certain circumstances, be sufficient to establish scienter for purposes of the cause of action under Rule 10b-5. See G. A. Thompson & Co., Inc. v. Partridge, 636 F.2d 945 (5th Cir. 1981), in which another panel of this court recently reached this same conclusion and adopted the recklessness standard. Reckless conduct sufficient to serve as scienter must involve more than simple, or even inexcusable negligence. It requires \"an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, ... which presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.\" SEC v. Southwest Coal & Energy Co., 624 F.2d 1312, 1321 n.17 (5th Cir. 1980) (quoting Franke Midwestern Oklahoma Development Authority, 428 F.Supp. 719, 725 (W.D.Okl.1976)) (SEC enforcement case). See, e. g., McLean v. Alexander, 599 F.2d 1190, 1197 (3d Cir. (6th Cir. 1979) . [5] The trial court correctly charged the jury that scienter could be established by proof of \"conduct which is so extreme as to be a form of intentional conduct or behavior equivalent to an intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\"17 [6] LoPatin, Share and H&M contend that the trial court erroneously failed to direct a verdict in their favor on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate scienter even under this recklessness standard. There was,of course, no direct testimony that any of the defendants acted knowingly with intention to deceive potential investors. However, circumstantial evidence presented to the jury would permit the inference that the misstatements in the prospectus were made with the requisite scienter. Extrinsic facts can be used to establish scienter in a Rule 10b-5 action. See 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 63, at 3-219 (Supp.1980). [7] We note that the trial court charged the jury using the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, the usual burden of proof required in civil cases. Thus, the interrogatories propounded to the jury required it to make its finding of the requisite scienter, as well as the other elements of the Rule 10b-5 action, by only a preponderance of the evidence. However, as the Supreme Court made clear in Hochfelder, Rule 10b-5 is an anti-fraud provision: to prevail in an action brought pursuant to the Rule, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with an \"intent to ... defraud.\" Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, The traditional burden *546 of proof imposed in cases involving allegations of civil fraud is the \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard.18 We conclude that the higher threshold of proof of fraud required in Rule 10b-5 actions mandates that the plaintiffs prove their case under the higher burden of proof.19 The failure of the district court to charge the jury as to the \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof does not, however, affect our determination of the merits of this case for we conclude that, even under that standard, the jury could infer from the evidence presented that the defendants acted with the requisite scienter in regard to the material misstatements in the prospectus. [8] [9] Whether a defendant's actions in a Rule 10b-5 case violate the standard of care imposed by the Rule, thus establishing scienter, is a question of fact to be determined as of the time of the actions about which the plaintiff is complaining. 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 63, at 3-215 (Supp.1980). See Holmes v. Bateson, 583 F.2d 542, 552 (1st Cir. 1978) . The evidence was sufficient to warrant, although it did not compel, the inference that each of the defendants acted with the requisite state of mind.20 Herman contends that the evidence failed to establish scienter on his part because he was not privy to all the information available to LoPatin and Share and because he relied on the construction cost figures they submitted to him and was notHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11aware of the inaccuracy of those estimated costs. There was expert testimony that H&M was, to some degree, negligent in its accounting procedures. Although such negligence could not, under the standard articulated in Hochfelder, establish the requisite scienter, the jury might reasonably have concluded from Herman's testimony and from any inference to be drawn from his involvement in the preparation of the Use of Proceeds section of the prospectus, as well as from the refusal of H&M in October, 1969, to provide a comfort letter to the underwriters referring to the construction costs in the prospectus, that H&M acted with the requisite scienter. \"Proof of a defendant's knowledge or intent (in a Rule 10b-5 action) will often be inferential....\" Rolf v. Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co., Inc., 570 F.2d 38, 47 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, *547439 U.S. 1039, 99 S.Ct. 642, 58 L.Ed.2d 698 (1978) .21 We conclude that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to preclude a directed verdict in favor of H&M. C. Reliance and Causation Reliance and causation are related concepts. In the common law deceit action from which the Rule 10b-5 claim is derived, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show reliance on the defendant's fraudulent representations as a prerequisite to recovery. Establishing reliance, however, merely proves that the plaintiff was induced to act by the defendant's conduct. It is a nonsequitur to conclude that the representation that induced action necessarily caused the consequences of that action. As we have seen, the general statement of the elements of recovery under Rule 10b-5 requires proof both that the plaintiff relied on the misstatement and that the misstatement was the cause of his loss. In Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972), the Supreme Court held that in some circumstances affirmative proof of reliance is not necessary. It distinguished the three subparagraphs of Rule 10b-5,22 pointing out that the first and third subparagraphs are not restricted to the misstatement or omission of a material fact but forbid a \"course of business\" or a \"device, scheme, or artifice\" that operates as a fraud. If a person who has an \"affirmative duty under the Rule to disclose\" a material fact to the holder of a security devises a plan to induce the holder to sell the securities without disclosing to him material facts that reasonably could be expected to influence his decision to sell, positive proof of reliance, it held, is not a prerequisite to recovery. Under the circumstances of that case, \"involving primarily a failure to disclose ... (a)ll that is necessary is that the facts withheld bematerial in the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in the making of this decision.... This obligation to disclose and this withholding of a material fact establish the requisite element of causation in fact.\" 406 U.S. at 153-54, 92 S.Ct. at 1472, 31 L.Ed.2d at 761 . While Affiliated Ute relieves the investor in certain circumstances of the necessity of proving affirmatively that he relied on a prospectus or other representation, it does not eliminate the reliance element from the Rule 10b-5 case altogether. See Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith, Inc., 482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973). In Rifkin v. Crow, 574 F.2d 256, 262 (5th Cir. 1978), we restated our understanding of the Affiliated Ute rationale as it relates to proof of reliance in a Rule 10b-5 action: (W)here a 10b-5 action alleges defendant made positive misrepresentations of material information, proof of reliance by the plaintiff upon the misrepresentation is required. Upon an absence of proof on the issue, plaintiff loses. On the other hand, where a plaintiff alleges deception by defendant's nondisclosure of material information, the Ute presumption obviates the need for plaintiff to prove actual reliance on the omitted information. Upon a failure of proof on the issue, defendant loses. But this presumption of *548 reliance in nondisclosure cases is not conclusive. If defendant can prove that plaintiff did not rely, that is, that plaintiff's decision would not have been affected even if defendant had disclosed the omitted facts, then plaintiff's recovery is barred. [10] Thus, reliance is an issue in all Rule 10b-5 cases. The difference between misrepresentation and non-disclosure cases relates only to whether proof of reliance is prerequisite to recovery or whether proof of non-reliance is an affirmative defense. See Dwoskin v. Rollins, Inc., 634 F.2d 285, 291 n.4 (5th Cir. 1981) . It is, therefore, necessary to characterize the facts in a Rule 10b-5 case as involving either primarily a failure to disclose, implicating the first or third subparagraph of the Rule andHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12invoking the Affiliated Ute presumption of reliance, or, on the other hand, primarily a misstatement or failure to state a fact necessary to make those statements made not misleading, classified under the second subparagraph of the Rule and as to which no presumption of reliance is applicable. Rifkin v. Crow, 574 F.2d at 263. This case, involving alleged misstatements and omissions in a prospectus published pursuant to a public offering, cannot properly be characterized as an omissions case of the type for which the Affiliated Ute presumption was fashioned. The defendants did not \"stand mute\" in the face of a duty to disclose as did the defendants in Affiliated Ute. 406 U.S. at 153, 92 S.Ct. at 1472, 31 L.Ed.2d at 761. They undertook instead to disclose relevant information in an offering statement now alleged to contain certain misstatements of fact and to fail to contain other facts necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances, not misleading. This is not a case in which difficulties of proof of reliance require the application of the Affiliated Ute presumption. Because the plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of reliance, a jury finding that the plaintiffs relied upon the misstatements and omissions in the prospectus was essential to the plaintiffs' recovery. [11] This circuit, according to Simon v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith, Inc., 482 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1973) , requires \"reasonable reliance\" by the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff; \"subjective alone does not suffice. 482 F.2d at 885. \"(S)ome element of general reliance by plaintiff, even in nondisclosure cases, is essential to a Rule 10b-5 action.\" 482 F.2d at 884 . Subjective reliance is determined by the mental state of the individual. 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 64.01(b)(ii) (Supp.1980). Another measure of reliance used by some courts, \"justifiable reliance,\" requires an objective or \"reasonable man\" test. Id. at s 64.01(b)(iii). Although our prior decisions have not been completely clear on this point, we think \"reasonable reliance,\" the test referred to by the Simon court, contemplates a subjective reliance standard, tempered by the requirement of due diligence on the part of the plaintiff, rather than the objective reliance test applicable under the justifiable reliance concept. See, e. g., Dupuy v. Dupuy, 551 F.2d 1005, 1014 (5th Cir.) , cert. denied, 434 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 312, 54 L.Ed.2d 197 (1977). See also 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 64.01(b)(iii), 3-252 & 3-253 & n.5 (Supp.1980).23 [12] The district court, induced by counsel, confused materiality with reliance. The concepts are distinct and mustbe separately proved or disproved. Materiality does not necessarily imply that, were the truth known, the decision would be different. Thus, recovery is not permitted solely because the investor has relied on an immaterial misstatement or omission. See *549 Project, Recent Developments in Securities Law: Causes of Action Under Rule 10b-5, 26 Buffalo L.Rev. 503, 523 (1977) ; 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 64.01(a), at 3-220 (Supp.1980). On the other hand, even if a misstatement or omission might have been material to a reasonable investor, the plaintiff might not have relied on it, because, for example, he would have considered other factors more important or would have taken the same action even had he known the full truth. Consequently, in a class action, while the materiality element can be established for the class as a whole, reliance, like damages, is a matter of individual proof. See 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 64.01(b)(ii) (Supp.1980). [13] [14] The district court compounded its failure to submit the reliance issue to the jury by failing also to submit the question of causation. Causation is related to but distinct from reliance. Reliance is a causa sine qua non, a type of \"but for\" requirement: had the investor known the truth he would not have acted.24 Causation requires one further step in the analysis: even if the investor would not otherwise have acted, was the misrepresented fact a proximate cause of the loss? Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F.2d 792, 810 (5th Cir. 1970) . The plaintiff must prove not only that, had he known the truth, he would not have acted, but in addition that the untruth was in some reasonably direct, or proximate, way responsible for his loss. The causation requirement is satisfied in a Rule 10b-5 case only if the misrepresentation touches upon the reasons for the investment's decline in value. If the investment decision is induced by misstatements or omissions that are material and that were relied on by the claimant, but are not the proximate reason for his pecuniary loss, recovery under the Rule is not permitted.25 See Management, Inc. (2d 1980) Absent the requirement of causation, Rule 10b-5 would become an insurance plan for the cost of every security purchased in reliance upon a material misstatement or omission. See Marbury Management, Inc. Inc., 418 F.2d 1276, 1292 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 913, 90 S.Ct. 913, 25 L.Ed.2d 93 (1970) ; List v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13LoPatin and Share claim that the failure of TIS and the consequent economic loss of the plaintiff's investment are attributable to the materialization of risks described in the prospectus such as bad weather conditions and lack of spectator attendance at the racetrack. To prevail in their Rule 10b-5 action, the plaintiffs must establish that their economic loss was proximately caused by the fraudulent misstatements and omissions in the prospectus. This issue, *550 the resolution of which is crucial to the plaintiffs' recovery, was not submitted to the trier of fact. Hence the elements of the Rule 10b-5 claim were not established and the judgment against the defendants must be reversed. [15] The plaintiffs urge that LoPatin, Share and H&M did not sufficiently raise the reliance issue and did not submit the \"proper special issue to the court.\" It is helpful for counsel to assist the court by framing the issue in the very terms that pose it most objectively for the jury. However, so long as a party demands the submission of an omitted issue of fact and directs the court's attention to that issue, that party does not waive the right to a jury determination. Rule 49(a), Fed.R.Civ.P . See Ford Motor Co. v. Dallas Power & Light Co., 499 F.2d 400, 407 & n.11 (5th Cir. 1974); Simien v. S.S. Kresge Co., 566 F.2d 551 (5th Cir. 1978) . H&M submitted to the court a proposed special issue phrased as follows: \"Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs relied upon those matters in the T.I.S. prospectus which were false and misleading in purchasing T.I.S. securities? Answer \"They did rely\" or \"They did not rely.\" While the proposal did not discriminate between misstatement and omission in issues, it sufficiently demanded jury consideration of the reliance issue to require the submission of that issue. When a fact question is not submitted to the jury, \"each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the (fact) issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury.\" Rule 49(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. See Guidry v. Kem Manufacturing Co., 604 F.2d 320, 321, supplementing on petition for rehearing, 598 F.2d 402 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 929, 100 S.Ct. 1318, 63 L.Ed.2d 763 (1980) . Before the jury retired, H&M filed exceptions to the proposed special issues, adopted by LoPatin and Share with the trial court's permission, objecting to the failure to submit relianceand causation issues to the jury. Thus, the defendants did not waive their right to a jury determination of the reliance and causation issues. The trial judge stated in the hearing on motions for judgment that the causation issue is \"a matter of law\" and that neither reliance nor causation is a proper issue to be submitted to the jury in this case. We disagree. The trial court's failure to submit the reliance and causation issues to the jury requires us to grant a new trial. We, therefore, pretermit the myriad other issues raised by counsel save those likely to arise on remand. IV THE TEXAS SECURITIES ACT The class also asserted a pendent claim based on Section 33 of the Texas Securities Act (TSA), article 581-33(A)(2), Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat . (Supp.1963). That statute creates liability on the part of \"(a)ny person who ... (o)ffers or sells a security ... by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact ... (in favor of) the person buying the security from him.\" LoPatin, Share and H&M all contend that the Texas statute is inapplicable to them because they did not offer or sell a security. The jury determined that each of these defendants was a seller of securities under the TSA. The trial court charged the jury as to the meaning of the term \"seller\" for purposes of TSA liability using the language of the Texas Supreme Court in Brown v. Cole, 155 Tex. 624, 291 S.W.2d 704 (Tex.1956) .26 In Brown the Texas court drew upon the definition of the term \"sell,\" now codified in article 581-4(E), Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat. (1957) , as meaning \"any act by which a sale is made....\" Brown v. Cole, 291 S.W.2d at 708 . [16]*551 The Texas courts have interpreted the term \"seller\" in the TSA to include those who are not direct vendors, and thus not in strict privity with the claimant. See Bordwine, Civil Remedies Under the Texas Securities Laws, 8 Hous.L.Rev. 657, 673 (1971); Bromberg, Civil Liability Under Texas Securities Act s 33 (1977) and Related Claims, 32 Sw.L.J. 867, 881 (1978) (pre-1977 decisions gave \"seller\" an \"astoundingly broad meaning\"). However, in Stone v. Enstam, 541 S.W.2d 473 (Tex.Civ.App.1976), the TexasHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14court distinguished Brown v. Cole as a case involving an active negotiator whose efforts resulted in the sale and limited the term \"seller\" to the actual seller and one who acts as an agent for either the buyer or seller in carrying out the sale itself. 541 S.W.2d at 480. This decision limits the TSA to those who are actively engaged in the sale process and prevents it from reaching those who merely participate in preparing an offering.27 See Bromberg, Civil Liability Under Texas Securities Act s 33 (1977) and Related Claims, 32 Sw.L.J. 867, 885-90 (1978). There was no evidence here that LoPatin and Share actively participated in instigating the actual sales transactions to any member of the plaintiff class. Patently H&M did not. Indeed, the two class representatives who testified at trial bought their TIS securities on the open market and not from the corporate issuer. To include LoPatin, Share or H&M within Section 33 would throw a net of liability broader than that contemplated by the statutory language or the Texas decisions.28 Thus, the evidence was insufficient to support the jury finding that these defendants were sellers under the TSA. The district judge should, therefore, have directed a verdict for LoPatin, Share and H&M on the Texas Securities Act claim. V EVIDENTIARY MATTERS To assist in the new trial that must ensue, we discuss the principal evidentiary issues raised in this appeal. *552 A. Expert Testimony on Standards and Customs in the Securities Industry [17] The court permitted plaintiffs' expert witness, a lawyer, to testify concerning the interpretation given some of the prospectus boilerplate language in the securities industry.29 The expert testified that the statement in the prospectus concerning the high degree of risk associated with the securities was standard language for a prospectus used in connection with the issuance of a new security. This testimony was relevant to proof of scienter on the part of defendants, i. e., whether the customary treatment of the boilerplate language was such that the defendants, by including such language, were likely to have believed it would negate any misleading effects of the cost estimates.It was also relevant to the issue of materiality of the cost estimates in the prospectus. This testimonial evidence had a \"tendency to make the existence of ... (a) fact ... (consequent) to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, Fed.R.Evid. It was based on technical knowledge that would assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact issue. Rule 702, Fed.R.Evid . See generally 11 Moore's Federal Practice s 702.10(1) (2d ed. Supp.1976). Even if it embraced an ultimate issue, it was not for that reason alone objectionable. Rule 704, Fed.R.Evid. See generally 11 Moore's Federal Practice s 704.10 (2d ed. Supp.1976). It was, therefore, properly admitted. We do not, of course, assess each question and answer but weigh the testimony on the whole. B. Written Comments by Outside Director [18] The notes taken at a January, 1970, TIS board meeting by an outside director, who at the time of the introduction of the notes into evidence was a defendant, were admitted over a hearsay objection by the defendants, presumably on the basis that they were admissible against as admissions against interest. If this was the basis, the trial court should have instructed the jury that they were inadmissible against LoPatin, Share and H&M. Once the outside director was no longer a party, a directed verdict having been rendered in his favor, the notes were no longer admissions of a party. In the absence of any other basis for their use, the notes are double hearsay as to LoPatin, Share and H&M, for they were not under oath and they concerned what was said by a party not under oath. Rule 802, Fed.R.Evid. We express no opinion concerning the admissibility of the notes under Rule 803(1), Fed.R.Evid ., as statements describing or explaining an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter, if a proper foundation is laid. Neither do we rule upon the admissibility at a new trial of the outside director's testimony concerning what was said by a party to the proceedings. Compare Rules 801 and 803(3), Fed.R.Evid . (hearsay exception for state of mind). C. Evidence of Events Occurring After the Class Period [19] The defendants objected to the admission of evidence concerning events that took place after the end of the class period. Of course, evidence that LoPatin and Share failed to fulfill corporate fiduciary duties was not relevant to the securities claim. Unless some adequate basis for theHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15admissibility of this evidence is established, it should be excluded. [20] The fact that TIS gave a lien to Holloway Sand & Gravel Co. in mid-1970 to secure the debt owed to the contractor for construction of the speedway bears on the accuracy of the Use of Proceeds section of the prospectus to the extent that it establishes *553 the amount for which the contractor remained uncompensated from the proceeds of the offering. Although the special issues put to the jury necessarily focused on the accuracy of the Use of Proceeds section as of October 30, 1969, the lien created after the class period was relevant to establish that the cash available after payment of construction costs was misstated in the prospectus. The SEC Form 10K report for the fiscal year ending November 30, 1969, was based on financial data unavailable until March, 1970. However, the 10K report established the financial position of the company during the class period. Portions of it may be admissible as a record of regularly conducted activities, i. e., business records, Rule 803(6), Fed.R.Evid ., if a proper foundation is laid. It may be difficult or impossible to establish that the report in toto is admissible because the Rule requires that the memorandum be made \"at or near the time\" of the event it describes. Rule 803(6), Fed.R.Evid . If its admissibility is established, the court should instruct the jury concerning the limited purpose for which it may be considered. D. Other Memoranda The plaintiffs introduced the deposition of the TIS general manager and construction supervisor to establish that he had not been consulted as to the figures used in the Use of Proceeds section of the Prospectus. He testified that, had he been consulted, he would have questioned the accuracy of the figures in the light of his own June, 1969, estimates. The defendants attempted to introduce other parts of the deposition dealing with a visit by a representative of the underwriters to the construction supervisor in October, 1969, in which the cost figures were apparently discussed, as well as a memorandum prepared by the underwriters' representative concerning his meeting with the construction supervisor which the plaintiffs had introduced at the deposition as an exhibit. [21] The defendant's offer was improperly rejected. When part of a recorded statement is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part of the recorded statement that ought in fairness be considered with it. Fed.R.Evid. 106 . See 21 C. Wright & K. Graham,Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence s 5073, at 350 (1977). The rule is made specifically applicable to depositions by Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(a)(4) . See 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil s 2148 (1970) . Thus, the defendants were entitled to introduce other parts of the deposition dealing with the underwriters' consultation with the construction supervisor regarding the costs of construction. The memorandum written by the underwriters' representative reporting on his meeting with the TIS construction supervisor was, of course, hearsay. Objections to the admissibility of evidence taken at the deposition may be made at the trial when the deposition is introduced into evidence. Fed.R.Civ.P. 32(b). If a proper foundation is laid at the new trial, the memorandum might be admissible under the \"business records\" exception to the hearsay rule. Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) . The admission of other items of evidence is objected to by the defendants. We do not review these in detail because the focus on retrial and the purposes for which the evidence is offered may well be different. VI MEASURE OF DAMAGES [22] Should liability be established, the measure of damages must be considered.30 The amount of damages is a jury issue although the services of a special master31 or the testimony of an expert witness32 in *554 assembling data and making computations may be particularly helpful in a class action. The ultimate question, however, is how much damage did the defendants' fraudulent misstatement or omission cause each individual plaintiff? [23] \"The principle is well settled that federal law, rather than state law, governs the construction of all aspects of Rule 10b-5, such as ... the proper measure of damages, ... and whether prejudgment interest is recoverable ( Wolf v. Frank, 477 F.2d 467, 479 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 975, 94 S.Ct. 287, 38 L.Ed.2d 218 (1973)) ....\" Alley v. Miramon, 614 F.2d 1372, 1381 n.18 (5th Cir. 1980). The Supreme Court has indicated that Section 28(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78bb(a), establishes the proper measure of damages in a Rule 10b-5 case. Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 155, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 1473, 31Huddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16L.Ed.2d 741, 762 (1972) . See Dupuy v. Dupuy, 551 F.2d 1005, 1024 (5th Cir.) , cert. denied, 434 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 312, 54 L.Ed.2d 197 (1977) . See generally 5B A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 260.03(a), at 11-15 (Supp.1980). That statute limits the claimant's recovery to an amount not \"in excess of his actual damages on account of the act complained of.\" 15 U.S.C. s 78bb(a) . The proper measure of the actual damages recoverable by the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff is \"the least formulated and the least reported upon\" of all issues raised by a Rule 10b-5 claim. Jacobs, The Measure of Damages in Rule 10b-5 Cases, 65 Geo.L.J. 1093, 1095 (1977). The district court determined the claimants' losses as the price paid to acquire the TIS securities initially minus the proceeds received on any sale of those securities. TIS securities still held by class members were considered worthless. Thus, the court measured damages to the class members on the basis that each plaintiff who had not sold the securities purchased suffered the loss of his total investment in consequence of the defendants' deceit, calling this a rescissional basis for computing damages. Denominating the remedy \"rescissional,\" however, does not solve the underlying problems in fixing the amount of damages. \"The cases are uniform in stating that one remedy which may be available to a defrauded plaintiff under Rule 10b-5 is to seek rescission of the transaction and ... recover the amount paid for the securities, if he is a buyer....\" Jennings and Marsh at 1085. The \"rescissional damages for a plaintiff buyer equal the fair value of what the plaintiff gave up, measured at the time of the fraudulent purchase, minus the fair value of what the plaintiff received, measured at the time of the sale.\" Jacobs, The Measure of Damages in Rule 10b-5 Cases, 65 Geo.L.J. 1093, 1118-19 (1977) (emphasis added). Rescission is the avoidance or undoing of the transaction. Its purpose is to return the defrauded purchaser to the status quo ante; it contemplates the return of the injured party to the position he occupied before he was wrongfully induced to enter the transaction. Green v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 541 F.2d 1335, 1342 (9th Cir. 1976) (Sneed, J., concurring); 5B A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule s 260.03(c)(vi), at 11-47 and 11-49 (Supp.1980). [24] [25] Use of the rescissional measure is usually limited to cases involving either privity between plaintiff and defendant or some specific fiduciary duty owed by brokers to their customers. See Note, The Measure of Damages in Rule 10b-5 Cases Involving Actively Traded Securities,26 Stan.L.Rev. 371, 376 (1974); Mullaney, Theories of Measuring Damages in Security Cases and the Effects of Damages on Liability, 46 Fordham L.Rev. 277, 285 (1977); Jacobs, The Measure of Damages in Rule 10b-5 Cases, 65 Geo.L.J. 1093, 1110 (1977). There are patent difficulties inherent in the application of this measure to a transaction between a securities purchaser and one who was not the seller of the securities. Section 12(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77l (2) , provides as a remedy for its violation that the seller is liable to the person purchasing from him for the \"consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security *555 ....\" That statute permits rescission if there is a degree of privity between the claimant and the defendant.33 However, if the purchaser did not buy from the defendant or if he no longer owns the security, then the parties cannot be returned to the status quo ante and Section 12(2) provides that damages, not rescission, is the proper remedy. None of the defendants was alleged or proved to have been in privity with the plaintiffs. Moreover, to adopt without qualification the remedy permitted under Section 12(2) in a Rule 10b-5 action would be inequitable, for the plaintiffs in this case chose not to proceed under Section 12(2), presumably because of the defenses available to such an action, including the one year statute of limitations, Section 13 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77m , and the procedural limitations, such as the privity requirement applicable to a Section 12(2) claim. If the Rule 10b-5 claimants have purchased securities on the open market and did not deal face to face with the defendants, the price the purchasers paid did not accrue directly to the defendants. The defendants cannot, in effect, return the purchase price that they never received or rescind a transaction to which they were not party. Green v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 541 F.2d 1335, 1341-43 (9th Cir. 1976) (Sneed, J., concurring). Moreover, the rescissional measure permits the defrauded securities buyer to place upon the defendant the burden of any decline in the value of the securities between the date of purchase and the date of sale even though only a portion of that decline may have been proximately caused by the defendant's wrong. The decline in the value of the securities in this case may have also resulted from other factors like market forces and events unrelated to the deceitHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17that had an economic effect on the enterprise, such as weather, degree of spectator participation and construction problems. Under these circumstances, the rescissional measure is unjust insofar as it compensates an investor for the nonspecific risks which he assumes by entering the market. Note, The Measure of Damages in Rule 10b-5 Cases Involving Actively Traded Securities, 26 Stan.L.Rev. 371, 376 (1974); Green v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 541 F.2d at 1343 (Sneed, J., concurring). Losses thus accruing have no relation to either the benefits derived by the defendants from the fraud or to the blameworthiness of their conduct. The entire loss to the defrauded buyer from the decline in the value of the securities purchased cannot be automatically attributed to the defendants' deceit unless this court were to adopt a theory of damages that views the entire loss as resulting from the fraud because, \"but for\" the deceit, the buyer would not have purchased, and hence would have suffered no loss. The private cause of action under Rule 10b-5 \"is essentially a tort claim.... Thus, the private complainant must show not only a violation of the rule, i. e., an untrue statement or material omission in connection with the sale of a security, but must also show that the omission or untrue statement resulted in or caused the complainant's damage.\" Moody v. Bache & Co., Inc., 570 F.2d 523, 527 (5th Cir. 1978) (emphasis added). The proper measure of damages to reflect the loss proximately caused by the defendants' deceit is the out-of-pocket rule. That rule is the traditional measure of damages in a Rule 10b-5 action, 5B A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 260.03(c)(ii), at 11-23 (Supp.1980), applied by the Supreme Court in Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 155, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 1473, 31 L.Ed.2d 741, 762 (1972) , as the proper measure of damages in the case of the defrauded seller under Rule 10b-5. The out-of-pocket measure is also the usual rule of recovery in the common law action for deceit from which Rule 10b-5 derives.34 *556 We have applied the out-of-pocket measure in actions brought under Rule 10b-5 to allow recovery for an amount of damages equal to the difference between the price paid and the \"real\" value of the security, i. e., the fair market value absent the misrepresentations, at the time of the initial purchase by the defrauded buyer.35 The use of the out-of-pocket measure of damages creates, of course, valuation problems in the determination of the recovery to be awarded to each plaintiff. However, asJudge Sneed recognized in his concurring opinion in Green v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., \"(w)rongdoing defendants should not be mulcted to make simple the management of a class proceeding under rule 10b-5.\" 541 F.2d at 1343. [26] Neither is the application of the out-of-pocket measure too complex to be applied in this case. The use of the out- of-pocket rule will require that a \"true\" or \"real\" value, i. e., the value the security would have had absent the misrepresentation, be established for each date on which members of the class purchased during the ninety-day class period.36 Once those values are obtained, possibly with the help of expert witnesses or a special master, then the determination of each individual plaintiff's recovery becomes a simple matter of subtraction of the \"true\" value of the security on the date of the plaintiff's purchase from the purchase price paid by the plaintiff on that date. The issue of damages is thus an individual matter to be determined separately for each member of the plaintiff class. VII CONTRIBUTION AMONG RULE 10B-5 DEFENDANTS The defendants sought contribution from those co-defendants who had compromised the plaintiffs' claims and entered into settlement agreements approved by the trial court to which LoPatin, Share and H&M were not parties. The district court denied contribution but gave a credit in its final judgment against LoPatin, Share and H&M for the amounts received in settlement. Whether one person who commits a violation of Rule 10b-5 may seek contribution from others who have also participated in the perpetration of the fraud is an issue that has not been decided by this circuit. See Woolf v. S. D. Cohn & Co., 515 F.2d 591, 605 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1975) (recognizing without deciding the issue), vacated and remanded, 426 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 3161, 49 L.Ed.2d 1181 (1976). But see our v. Texstar Corp., 412 F.2d 700, 705 n.7 (5th Cir. 1969). A number of district courts37 and two circuit courts38 have recognized the right to *557 contribution in Rule 10b-5 actions. The commentators are in agreement with this result.39Huddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 18[27] Because the Rule 10b-5 action is implied in a federal statute, the right to contribution under Rule 10b-5 is determined by federal law.40 Early common law recognized no right to contribution41 among intentional joint tortfeasors, while early American courts established the general rule of no contribution between concurrent wrongdoers, whether negligent or intentional.42 The rule against contribution by negligent tortfeasors was later gradually eroded on the equitable basis that it was unfair to require one person to bear the entire loss of an injury that he had not alone caused or to permit the injured person for whatever motive, benign or invidious, to select the one defendant from whom he wished to recover. The no-contribution rule was, therefore, modified by statute or decision to require contribution where the injury was caused by negligence.43 [28] American state courts continue to deny a right to contribution in favor of any tortfeasor who intentionally causes the harm. Restatement (Second) of Torts s 886A(3) (1977). See Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act s 1(c) (1955); W. Prosser, The Law of Torts s 50, at 308 (4th ed. 1971). \"The basis of the rule is the old one that the courts will not aid one who has deliberately done harm, so that no man can be permitted to found a cause of action on his own intentional tort.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts s 886A(3), Comment j (1977). [29] In addition to the tort rule disallowing contribution among intentional *558 wrongdoers, another justification advanced to support the denial of contribution among Rule 10b-5 defendants is the hypothesis that disallowance of any shifting of part of the loss sustained by the Rule 10b-5 defendant to the other participants in the fraud creates a greater deterrent to conduct violative of the Rule. This theory does not consider the alternative possibility that the disallowance of contribution fails to deter those co- conspirators who are not likely to be named as defendants in the Rule 10b-5 action.44 Assuming that an actor consciously takes the possible consequence of a civil action into account when he is deciding whether or not to commit a fraud, he may either be deterred by fear of total liability or encouraged by a knowledge that another co-actor may be the only one sued and thus may bear the entire fault. A rule allowing contribution among Rule 10b-5 defendants is \"buttressed by the fact that of the seven express civil remediesprovided in the Securities Act of 1933 (ss 11, 12 and 15, 15 U.S.C. ss 77k, 77l and 77o ) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ( ss 9, 16, 18 and 20, 15 U.S.C. ss 78i, 78p, 78r and 78t) three of those provide expressly for contribution.\" Heizer Corp. v. Ross, 601 F.2d 330, 332 (7th Cir. 1979) .45 The common law rule precluding intentional wrongdoers from seeking contribution developed long before the evolution of multiparty litigation involving class plaintiffs, numerous defendants, vast monetary claims, lengthy trials and enormous litigation costs. The disallowance of contribution in the context of such modern multiparty litigation encourages the presentation of enormous claims against numerous defendants in the hope that at least some of those named will, merely to avoid the heavy cost of litigation, pay a settlement amount rather than defend the action. Thus, the no-contribution rule promotes a rush to settlement whereby certain defendants can purchase freedom from litigation and the ultimate court judgment, simultaneously providing the plaintiffs with funds to finance the continuation of the suit against the non-settling defendants. Moreover, the settling defendants may well extricate themselves from the litigation in exchange for relatively small settlement amounts, leaving the non-settling defendants to bear a much larger liability in the form of the final court judgment. Persons injured by the willful torts or deceit of others are entitled to full redress but should not be able to play one defendant against another as a gambit. Although the law favors compromise as a means of ending litigation, the type of settlement that is reached on the basis of the denial of contribution neither terminates the litigation nor furthers the goals of efficient court administration. *559 In articulating its reasons for requiring contribution among negligent joint tortfeasors in admiralty, the Supreme Court stated, \"a 'more equal distribution of justice' can best be achieved by ameliorating the common-law rule against contribution which permits a plaintiff to force one of two wrongdoers to bear the entire loss, though the other may have been equally or more to blame.\" Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U.S. 106, 111, 94 S.Ct. 2174, 2177, 40 L.Ed.2d 694, 700 (1974) . We conclude that a rule permitting contribution provides an equitable result that sufficiently satisfies the objective of deterrence under the securities laws. VIIIHuddleston v.

Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), the Supreme Court expressed strong support for the \"American Rule\" which prohibits the imposition of attorney's fees except when authorized by statute or by traditionally recognized exceptions. There is no statutory provision awarding attorney's fees to the successful party in an action brought under Rule 10b-5. See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 211 n.30, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 1389 47 Dominick & Dominick, F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. 1977) . [31] Of the several situations recognized in F. D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 129-30, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d 703, 713 (1974) , in which a deviation from the general principle that each party should bear the cost of his own legal representation is permitted, the trial court in this case relied upon the \"bad faith\" exception. See, e. g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402 n.4, 964, (1968). The \"bad faith\" exception permits an award of attorneys fees to the successful party if an unfounded action or defense is brought or maintained for oppressive reasons, 6 Moore's Federal Practice P 54.77(2), at 1709 (2d ed. Supp.1976), or if the \"opponent has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons....\" F. D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U.S. at 129, 94 S.Ct. at 2165, 40 L.Ed.2d at 713;Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 5, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 1946, 36 L.Ed.2d 702, 707 (1973). The underlying rationale of \"fee shifting\" pursuant to the \"bad faith\" exception is punitive. Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. at 5, 93 S.Ct. at 1946, 36 L.Ed.2d at 707. Because punitive damages are not available in a 10b-5 action,46 thebad faith or vexatious conduct inherent in the fraudulent acts that constituted the cause of action itself cannot be the basis for an attorney's fees award under the bad faith exception. Straub v. Vaisman and Co., Inc., 540 F.2d 591, 599 (3d Cir. 1976). See Note Recovery of Attorneys' Fees Under Rule 10b-5, 53 Notre Dame Law. 320, 338-42 (1977) (discussing Straub holding). The bad faith conduct must occur during the litigation process itself. See Nemeroff v. Abelson, 620 F.2d 339, 348 (2d Cir. 1980) . The trial judge found bad faith in this case that had nothing to do with the conduct of the litigation proceedings.47 It was *560 based only on the conduct of the defendants which gave rise to the cause of action itself. Unless the further proceedings are conducted in a vexatious manner, attorney's fees should not be allowed. [32] On the question of awarding prejudgment interest in a 10b-5 case, this court held in Wolf v. Frank, 477 F.2d 467, 479 (5th Cir.) cert. denied, 414 U.S. 975, 94 S.Ct. 287, 38 L.Ed.2d 218 (1973), that federal law governs. The federal standard is one of fairness and its application rests within the District Court's sound discretion.48 Upon retrial the district court may find it appropriate again to award prejudgment interest. For these reasons the judgment is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. All Citations 640 F.2d 534, Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep.

This court has also formulated the elements of the Section 10(b) claim as follows: (1) conduct by the defendants proscribed by the rule; (2) a purchase or sale of securities by the plaintiffs \"in connection with\" such proscribed conduct; (3) and resultant damages the plaintiffs.

Genesco, Inc., 492 F.2d 750, 759 (5th Cir. 1974). 13The record establishes that the accountants, in a letter written by Mr. Herman in May of 1969, informed Mr. Share that construction costs would exceed available funds, and that this letter was followed shortly thereafter by a June, 1969, meeting of LoPatin, Share and Herman as a result of which certain construction costs, such as paving and seeding, were reduced or eliminated from the construction budget. However, other evidence indicated that bids had already been accepted to undertake the construction work \"eliminated\" from the budget at the June, 1969, meeting. Finally, in October, 1969, before the effective date of the registration statement, H&M refused to provide the underwriters with a comfort letter making reference to the construction cost and administrative expenses detailed in the Use of Proceeds section of the prospectus. The jury was justified in inferring from these facts and the other circumstantial evidence that LoPatin, Share and Herman misstated the estimated construction costs in the prospectus. 14LoPatin and Share claim that the alleged misstatements were immaterial as a \"matter of law.\" Only where the facts are so obviously important (or unimportant) to an investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality may the ultimate materiality issue properly be resolved as a matter of law.

Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 101 S.Ct. 999, 67 L.Ed.2d 69 (1981). The Steadman decision is based on the congressional intent as revealed by the language and legislative history of Section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. s 556(d), and the holdingHuddleston v. Herman & MacLean, 640 F.2d 534 (1981) Blue Sky L. Rep. P 71,642, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P 97,919, 8 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 61 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 22is, therefore, limited to the appropriate burden of proof in an administrative proceeding. There is no suggestion in the Supreme Court's Steadman opinion that the holding has any application in the context of a private cause of action brought in district court. We find the private plaintiff's Rule 10b-5 action comparable to the civil fraud action in which proof of intent to deceive is often a matter of inference, see text at note 21, infra, and judgment for the plaintiff detracts from the defendant's reputation to a far greater extent than in other civil litigation. Thus, the higher burden of proof is appropriate. The Steadman decision is distinguishable and, therefore, not binding in this case. The issue of burden of proof was not raised in the parties' briefs. However, it is inextricably interwoven with the sufficiency of the evidence of scienter and will doubtless arise as an issue in the new trial. 20The defendants all contend that the cost reductions were bona fide and that the later expenditures resulted from unanticipated events. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the adjustment to reduce costs was a sham and that LoPatin, Share and Herman knew from the outset that the work eliminated from the Use of Proceeds section would nonetheless be completed and the concomitant costs incurred. 21The implied cause of action under Rule 10b-5 \"is essentially a tort claim,\" Moody v. Bache & Co., 570 F.2d 523, 527 (5th Cir. 1978), derived from the common law action of deceit. The scienter element in the common law action may be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. See W. Prosser, The Law of Torts s 107, at 701-02 (4th ed. 1971). 22Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. s 240.10b-5 , provides: It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange, (a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. 23We sustained a judgment for the defendant in Simon based on the finding that nothing said by the defendant broker was a factor in causing the plaintiff to buy stock. In a Rule 10b-5 action \"(t)he plaintiff must show that it reasonably relied on the information (or on the notion that it had received all mandated disclosure from the defendant), and exercise due diligence in examining the information otherwise available to it.\" First Virginia Bankshares v. Benson, 559 F.2d 1307, 1314 (5th Cir. 1977) , cert. denied sub nom., 435 U.S. 952, 98 S.Ct. 1580, 55 L.Ed.2d 802 (1978) (emphasis added). 24Courts sometimes consider the reliance component of the Rule 10b-5 action to be a part of the causation element. 5 A. Jacobs, The Impact of Rule 10b-5 s 64.01(a), at 3-221 (Supp.1980). In this context, the term \"transaction causation\" is used to describe the requirement that the defendant's fraud must precipitate the investment decision. Reliance is necessarily closely related to \"transaction causation.\" On the other hand, \"loss causation\" refers to a direct causal link between the misstatement and the claimant's economic loss. See Marbury Management, Inc. Kohn, Penn-Dixie Cement Corp., 507 F.2d 374, 380 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 976, 95 S.Ct. 1976, 44 L.Ed.2d 467 (1975); Moody v.

Cf. Note, Causation and Liability in Private Actions For Proxy Violations, 80 Yale L.J. 107 (1970) . 25For example, an investor might purchase stock in a shipping venture involving a single vessel in reliance on a misrepresentation that the vessel had a certain capacity when in fact it had less capacity than was represented in the prospectus. However, the prospectus does disclose truthfully that the vessel will not be insured. One week after the investment the vessel sinks as a result of a casualty and the stock becomes worthless. In such circumstances, a fact- finder might conclude that the misrepresentation was material and relied upon by the investor but that it did not cause the loss. 26\"(Y)ou are instructed that under the Texas Blue Sky Law (the TSA) a person is a seller of a security if he forms any link in the chain of the selling process or if he performs any act by which a sale is made.\" 27We find further support for this construction of the Texas cases in the TSA's legislative history and analogy to the federal provisions on which the Texas statute was based. The comments to both the 1963 and 1977 amended versions of Section 33 of the TSA refer to Section 12 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77l, which served as the basis for the drafting of the Uniform Securities Act, the model used in the 1963 and 1967 Texas enactments. See Bateman, Securities Litigation: The 1977 Modernization of Section 33 of the Texas Securities Act, 15 Hous.L.Rev. 839, 844-45 (1978); Bordwine, Civil Remedies Under Texas Securities Laws, 8 Hous.L.Rev. 657, 665 (1971).

Walston & Co., Inc., 487 F.2d 617, 621 (5th Cir. 1973) . We have refused to extend Section 12 to include aiders, abettors and controlling persons as sellers. Croy v. F.2d 709, 713 n.5 (5th Cir. 1980) . We have also formulated the test for a Section 12 seller in terms of proximate causation, i. e., whether the injury to the plaintiff flowed directly and proximately from the actions of the defendant or whether the defendant was the motivating force behind the sale. Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., 448 F.2d 680, 693 (5th Cir. 1971) ; Croy v. 624 F.2d 709, 713 Swenson v. Engelstad, 626 F.2d 421 (5th Cir. 1980). We have focused on the circumstances surrounding the sales transaction itself to determine that a defendant is not a Section 12 seller if he did nothing to bring the sale about, Pharo v. Smith, 621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir. 1980) , or if, although involved in the actual sales negotiations, his participation was insufficient to make it a proximate cause of the transaction, Croy v. Campbell, 624 F.2d 709, 714 (5th Cir. 1980) . But see In re Caesars Palace Securities Litigation, 360 F.Supp. 366, 378-83 (S.D.N.Y.1973). See generally Jennings & Marsh at 1095-1100. 28Although LoPatin and Share might have been \"controlling persons\" of TIS, the issuer, and thus subject to liability under Section 15 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77o , the pre-1977 version of the Texas Securities Act, which is applicable in this case, allows reference only to the scope of Section 12 of the 1933 Act. The comments accompanying the 1977 amendments to the TSA indicate that there was no liability for aiders, abettors and controlling persons under the pre-1977 version of the Texas statute. 29We pretermit discussion of this expert's testimony concerning the due diligence that the defendants should have exercised to comply with the standards of the securities industry because, in relation to the jury's answers to interrogatories upon which the judgment against LoPatin, Share and H&M was based, the due diligence issue primarily concerned a party in whose favor judgment was rendered and against whom no appeal was taken. Contrary to defendants' contentions, we do not consider this testimony to have been prejudicial as to the jury's findings against LoPatin, Share and H&M. 30Our disposition of the case allows us to pretermit the issue raised in this appeal whether the trial court improperly determined damages without a separate trial of that issue in light of the statements in the trial court's May 25, 1976, order correcting, modifying and supplementing the class action order, that appear to mandate a bifurcated trial of the liability and damages issues. 31Rule 53, Fed.R.Civ.P .

In that case we determined that the greater deterrent effect is obtained by the imposition of sole liability for the treble damages provided by the antitrust laws upon the violator who is sued. 604 F.2d at 905. We distinguished those cases allowing contribution under Rule 10b-5 of the securities laws, see note 37, supra, by noting that several express liability provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Acts provide specifically for contribution, thus, justifying contribution under Rule 10b-5 by the principle that the securities laws should be read in pari materia. 604 F.2d at 903. 45See Section 11(f) of 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 77k(f) ; Sections 9(e) and 18(b) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78i(e) and s 78r(b). 46Section 28(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. s 78bb(a), denying recovery in excess of actual damages, is applicable to claims for damages under Rule 10b-5.

Opinion Justice FREEMAN delivered the opinion of the court: On April 23, 1992, plaintiffs, Illinois Graphics and State Farm Insurance Company, filed an action in the circuit court of McLean County, denominating their complaint as a \"19(g) Petition to Reduce an Award of the Industrial Commission to a Judgment.\" On May 29, 1992, defendant, Iona Nickum, filed a motion to dismiss the petition, which did not specify any provision of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (see Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-101 et seq.). Following hearing, the circuit court dismissed the petition with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed, and the appellate court affirmed with one dissent ( 240 Ill.App.3d 981, 182 Ill.Dec. 90, 609 N.E.2d 393 ). We granted plaintiffs' petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 315 (134 Ill.2d R. 315) and now reverse.Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3BACKGROUND In January 1988, Iona Nickum filed an application for adjustment of claim with the Industrial Commission (Commission), representing that she had suffered an accidental back injury on October 16, 1987, arising out of and in the course of her employment with Illinois Graphics Company (Illinois Graphics). Pursuant to the terms of the Workers' Compensation Act (Act) (Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.1 et seq.), State Farm Insurance *473 Company (State Farm), Illinois Graphics' workers' compensation insurer, began paying Nickum temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. At the time of the subsequent workers' compensation arbitration, the parties agreed that State Farm had paid Nickum $7,899.95 in TTD benefits. Following hearing on the matter, the arbitrator entered findings of fact, stated within the memorandum of her decision, including: Nickum had alleged in her claim that, on October 16, 1987, she was at work, lifted a box and experienced a sharp pain in her back; Nickum testified that she had telephoned her employer on that date to report that she had \"done something to her back\" and could not work, but she had not, admittedly, indicated that any precipitating incident had occurred while she was at work; Nickum's medical history revealed that she had experienced continual back pain and discomfort commencing in July 1987; in August 1987 she had told her doctor that she was not sure how she might have injured her back; in late August 1987 she was diagnosed as suffering from right lumbar radiculitis; on October 22, 1987, Nickum was seen by her physician, still complaining and indicating that her condition had been continuous and not improved; and her medical records did not indicate an October 16, 1987, incident, nor did her physician learn of any \"incidents\" which might have caused her condition. The arbitrator also found that $7,899.95 in TTD benefits had been paid to Nickum because of the injury. The arbitrator concluded that Nickum failed to prove an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment and failed to demonstrate the necessary causal relationship. The arbitrator, consequently, denied Nickum's claim for compensation, and Nickum appealed the decision to the Commission. The Commission affirmed the arbitrator's decision *474 and adopted and incorporated the arbitrator's memorandum ofdecision into its own decision and opinion. The Commission additionally stated that Illinois Graphics \"shall have credit for all amounts paid\" to Nickum \"on account of said accidental injury\" and ordered Illinois Graphics to pay Nickum interest under the Act. Neither party appealed the Commission's decision. State Farm demanded that Nickum reimburse it the TTD benefits payments. Nickum refused to do so. Plaintiffs then filed the present action in the circuit court. The complaint alleged the aforementioned facts concerning Nickum's claim and incorporated the Commission's decision and opinion by specific reference. The petition cited section 19(g) of the Act as authorizing the circuit court to enter a judgment in accordance with a decision of the Commission. (Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.19(g) .) The petition also cited World Color Press v. Industrial Comm'n (1984), 125 Ill.App.3d 469, 80 Ill.Dec. 818, 466 N.E.2d 270, and **1285 ***466 Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Zambole (1986), 141 Ill.App.3d 803, 96 Ill.Dec. 318, 491 N.E.2d 132 , as authority that \"to hold [p]laintiff to administrative exactness in its payment prior to adjudication and then later deny[ ] it the right to recoup any excess payment that may later occur would frustrate the primary purpose of the Act to provide prompt payment to the employee of benefits.\" The petition prayed that the circuit court enter judgment against defendant in the amount of $7,899.95 and award costs and attorney fees. Nickum moved to dismiss the petition, but did not specify any provision of the Code. The motion, in relevant part, asserted that: (1) the Act was devoid of provisions requiring the repayment of TTD benefits voluntarily paid to a claimant employee prior to arbitration; (2) the Commission's decision and opinion did not constitute an \"award\" or \"decision\" capable of reduction to judgment by the circuit court ( *475 Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.19(g)); (3) the authorities cited by plaintiffs, World Color Press and Liberty Mutual, were factually distinguishable from the instant case; (4) no statutory or case law authorized entry of the requested judgment in plaintiffs' favor; and (5) under Illinois law, money paid under a claim of right with full knowledge of the underlying facts and absent coercion, fraud or superior bargaining position by the transferee, and money paid under a mistake of law, is not recoverable. Defendant did not support the motion with affidavits or other evidence. Following hearing on the motion, the trial court found that no \"award\" had been entered by the Commission, and that the Commission's \"decision\" did not constitute a determinationIllinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4that Nickum was liable to plaintiffs for repayment of the TTD benefits. According to the trial court, the Commission's decision was thus incapable of being reduced to judgment pursuant to section 19(g). The trial court also found that the TTD payments were involuntary in light of certain statutory penalties for nonpayment under the Act, and expressed that the payments ought to be recoverable under the Illinois Constitution. The trial court concluded by stating that section 19(g) of the Act could not provide the vehicle for that relief and dismissed the petition with prejudice. Plaintiffs did not seek leave to amend their complaint at any time prior to or at the time of dismissal. Plaintiffs appealed. Their appellate brief cited Liberty Mutual, but they again made no request for leave to amend the complaint (see 134 Ill.2d R. 366). The appellate court construed section 19(g) as providing a method by which either an employee or an employer might have an award of the Commission reduced to judgment. The appellate court found, however, that the Commission had not granted such an award. Relying on *476 Liberty Mutual and Celeste v. Industrial Comm'n (1990), 205 Ill.App.3d 423, 150 Ill.Dec. 345, 562 N.E.2d 1148 , the appellate court expressed that plaintiffs had correctly argued their right to recover benefits paid to an unentitled employee, but also concluded that section 19(g) did not provide the means for them to do so. At oral argument, plaintiffs requested that the case be remanded to allow them to replead. The appellate court found that plaintiffs had not sought leave to replead at the trial level, and had not raised the issue in their notice of appeal or requested the opportunity to replead in their appellate brief. The appellate court therefore concluded that remand was inappropriate. 240 Ill.App.3d at 985, 182 Ill.Dec. 90, 609 N.E.2d 393 . The appellate court additionally addressed the argument presented by the dissent that a complaint should not be dismissed unless it clearly appeared that no set of facts could be proven entitling the plaintiff to relief. (See Burdinie v. Village of Glendale Heights (1990), 139 Ill.2d 501, 152 Ill.Dec. 121, 565 N.E.2d 654 .) The appellate court qualified this rule to refer to dismissals with prejudice and viewed the rule as applicable only under circumstances where a plaintiff had requested leave to amend. In the appellate court's view, facts may not simply be pleaded with the expectation that a trial court will formulate a theory of relief. \"In the complete absence in this case of any request by plaintiffs to be given the opportunity to reformulate an otherwise defective complaint,the circuit court cannot be expected to act as their counsel.\" 240 Ill.App.3d at 986, 182 Ill.Dec. 90, 609 N.E.2d 393. **1286 ***467 ISSUE The general issue presented is whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. Specifically, we are asked to decide (1) whether section 19(g) of the Workers' Compensation Act allows plaintiffs the right to a judgment to *477 recover TTD benefits paid to an unentitled employee; and (2) whether a valid cause of action for a recovery of those payments was otherwise stated by the complaint or was sufficiently raised as a claim so as to survive a motion to dismiss under section 2-619(9). DISCUSSION I Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of their complaint was in error because they are entitled to judgment under section 19(g) to recover TTD benefits amounts. Preliminarily, we note that the parties disagree over whether the motion to dismiss was brought under section 2-615 or section 2-619(9) of the Code; notably, there are distinct advantages concerning waiver which are attendant to each motion. In order, however, to resolve this issue concerning a section 19(g) judgment, we need not delve into those differences. We may simply determine whether section 19(g) provides plaintiffs a right to recover as a matter of law. We determine that it does not. Section 19(g) of the Act provides in pertinent part: \"Except in the case of a claim against the State of Illinois, either party may present a certified copy of the award of the Arbitrator, or a certified copy of the decision of the Commission when the same has become final, when no proceedings for review are pending, providing for the payment of compensation according to this Act, to the Circuit Court of the county in which such accident occurred or either of the parties are residents, whereupon the court shall enter a judgment therewith. In a case where the employer refuses to pay compensation according to such final award or such final decision upon which such judgment is entered the court shall in entering judgment thereon, tax as costs against him the reasonable costs and attorney fees in the arbitration proceedings and inIllinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5the court entering the judgment for the person in whose favor the judgment is entered * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.19(g). *478 Plaintiffs state that, by the express terms of section 19(g), the judgment remedy offered is available to both employer and employee and may be based upon either an award or decision of the Commission. Plaintiffs additionally rely on Ahlers v. Sears, Roebuck Co. (1978), 73 Ill.2d 259, 22 Ill.Dec. 731, 383 N.E.2d 207 , where this court construed section 19(g) of the Act, determining that the Commission's order in approval of a settlement agreement constituted a \"decision\" and was the equivalent of an \"award.\" In plaintiffs' view, the Commission's order here, which allowed Illinois Graphics \"credit for all amounts paid,\" must also be considered an \"award\" or \"decision\" enforceable under section 19(g). Plaintiffs also point out that the purpose of section 19(g) is to permit the speedy entry of judgment and that a court's inquiry is therefore limited. See Ahlers v. Sears, Roebuck Co. (1978), 73 Ill.2d 259, 22 Ill.Dec. 731, 383 N.E.2d 207 . This court has held that an order of the Commission approving a settlement agreement entered into between a workers' compensation claimant and his employer constitutes a decision or is the equivalent of an award under the Act. Ahlers, 73 Ill.2d at 264-65, 22 Ill.Dec. 731, 383 N.E.2d 207 . In the instant case, the Commission's statement, in its decision, that Illinois Graphics \"shall have credit for all amounts paid, if any,\" to defendant \"on account of said accidental injury\" is inconsistent with the dispositive statement of the Commission. While the Commission specifically affirmed the arbitrator's denial of defendant's claim, it ordered both that Illinois Graphics pay defendant interest under the Act and that Illinois Graphics have a credit if it paid any benefit amounts because of an accidental injury. Both the statement about interest and the statement concerning a credit make sense only if an award had been granted based on the arbitrator's finding of a compensable injury. The same essential language used by **1287 ***468 the Commission in this instance has been viewed as simply the \"customary *479 language\" used by the Commission in an award \"to authorize the deduction of payments made by an employer prior to the hearing or prior to the entry of an award.\" ( McCormick v. McDougal- Hartmann Co. (1970), 47 Ill.2d 340, 342-43, 265 N.E.2d 610 (Commission's statement in order that employer shall \" 'have credit for all sums of money, if any, heretoforepaid petitioner on account of accidental injuries' \" was not authorization that employer could have credit for third party's payments to employee).) In the present, the Commission's statement concerning a credit therefore appears not to be an adjudication of liabilities, so much as an inadvertency. Most certainly, an inadvertent statement could not have been intended to constitute a \"decision\" under the Act. However, even assuming that the Commission's statement was not inadvertent, it cannot form the basis for a judgment under section 19(g). [1] [2] The primary rule of statutory construction is to give effect to the true intent of the legislature. (People ex rel. Baker v. Cowlin (1992), 154 Ill.2d 193, 197, 180 Ill.Dec. 738, 607 N.E.2d 1251 .) The language of the statute is the best indication of the legislative drafters' intent. When the drafters' intent can be ascertained from the statutory language, it must be given effect without resort to other aids for construction. ( People v. Bryant (1989), 128 Ill.2d 448, 455, 132 Ill.Dec. 415, 539 N.E.2d 1221.) In construing a statute, it is never proper for a court to depart from plain language by reading into a statute exceptions, limitations, conditions which conflict with the clearly expressed legislative intent. Certain Taxpayers v. Sheahen (1970), 45 Ill.2d 75, 84, 256 N.E.2d 758 . [3] [4] Applying these principles, we agree with plaintiffs that both an employee and an employer are entitled to judgment relief under the express terms of section 19(g). As recognized by the appellate court below, both parties have an interest in finally ascertaining the extent of the employer's liability. ( 240 Ill.App.3d at 984, 182 Ill.Dec. 90, 609 N.E.2d 393.) We disagree, *480 however, that under the express terms of the statute a judgment may be based on a \"decision\" of the Commission which does not provide for the \"payment of compensation.\" Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.19(g) . The plain language of section 19(g) states that the Commission's decision, on which any judgment is based, be one \"providing for the payment of compensation according to this act.\" (Emphasis added.) While the provision contemplates that either an employee or an employer may seek to obtain entry of a judgment, whether based on an \"award\" or \"decision,\" these express terms fairly limit the type of decisions to those which provide for the payment of compensation benefits. (Cf. Ahlers v. Sears, Roebuck Co. (1978), 73 Ill.2d 259, 22 Ill.Dec. 731, 383 N.E.2d 207 .) This language may not reasonably be interpreted to encompass any full recoupment, restitution or reimbursement \"decision\"Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6even assuming the authorization of that type of Commission decision under the Act. The allowance of a credit within a decision or award merely serves to reduce the total payment of compensation benefits. (See Board of Education of High School District No. 502 v. Industrial Comm'n (1923), 308 Ill. 445, 140 N.E. 39; World Color Press, 125 Ill.App.3d 469, 80 Ill.Dec. 818, 466 N.E.2d 270.) And while the provision does not expressly limit such \"decision[s]\" to those in favor of an employee, quite obviously, under the Act, it is the employer, rather than the employee, who makes payment of compensation benefits. Other express language in section 19(g) evidences an assumption that it is the employer who makes the payment of compensation upon which any judgment is based: \"[W]here the employer refuses to pay compensation according to such final * * * decision upon which such judgment is entered * * *.\" Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.19(g) . This interpretation of the express language of section 19(g) is further supported by the operational definition of an award under the Act. An award may only *481 be comprised of amounts of compensation paid to an employee. (See Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, pars. 138.7, 138.8 (\"[t]he amount of compensation which shall be paid to the employee for an accidental injury * * * is\").) Thus, an \"award,\" under the Act, parallels a \"decision\" which **1288 ***469 \"provid[es] for the payment of compensation.\" Plaintiffs argue that it would be unfair to allow the judgment relief afforded by section 19(g) to be available to an employee, but not an employer, despite that section 19(g) clearly states \"either party\" may enforce an award or decision of the Commission. Plaintiffs remind us that the purpose of section 19(g) is to permit the \"speedy entry of judgement\" and that requiring a separate lawsuit to recover TTD payments will only further burden the courts. (See Ahlers, 73 Ill.2d at 268, 22 Ill.Dec. 731, 383 N.E.2d 207.) We are not persuaded by these several policy arguments. As stated, section 19(g) expressly allows \"either party\" to obtain a judgment. That only awards or decisions, providing for the payment of compensation, may be reduced to judgment under the provision is not unfair. The Act was specifically enacted to provide for the payment of compensation benefits to employees in exchange for a bar on certain liabilities of employers. (See O'Brien v. Rautenbush (1956), 10 Ill.2d 167, 139 N.E.2d 222 (primary purpose of Act is to provide employees prompt, sure, definite compensation, together with quick and efficient remedy, for injuries or death suffered incourse of employment and require cost of injuries to be borne by industry itself and not by individual members); Leach v. Lauhoff Grain Co. (1977), 51 Ill.App.3d 1022, 9 Ill.Dec. 634, 366 N.E.2d 1145 (object of Act was to eliminate common law liability for personal injuries based on negligence of employer); see also Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 48, par. 138.5(a).) The purpose of the Act was to provide a flow of benefits to compensate for lost wages and to compensate workers for the loss of industrial earning capacity. (Freeman United Coal *482 Mining Co. v. Industrial Comm'n (1984), 99 Ill.2d 487, 497, 77 Ill.Dec. 119, 459 N.E.2d 1368; Board of Education v. Industrial Comm'n (1972), 53 Ill.2d 167, 290 N.E.2d 247 (purpose of Act to provide financial protection in various forms, including restoration of lost wages, for workers whose earning power is interrupted or terminated as a result of injury arising out of and in the course of their employment).) Nothing in the Act indicates that the Commission is expected or authorized to adjudicate matters concerning restitution or repayment of benefits to employers. Even the matter of credits under the Act is viewed narrowly. (See Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Industrial Comm'n (1984), 99 Ill.2d 487, 496, 77 Ill.Dec. 119, 459 N.E.2d 1368 (\"[c]redits operate as partial exceptions to the liabilities created by the [Act], and should therefore be narrowly construed where granted and not be extended by implication unless necessary to accomplish the purpose of the Act\").) There is an ample body of common law which already exists that will allow an employer to recover mistakenly made payments which are not voluntarily returned. (See Groves v. Farmers State Bank (1937), 368 Ill. 35, 12 N.E.2d 618 (voluntary payments doctrine); see also Board of Education v. Holt (1976), 41 Ill.App.3d 625, 354 N.E.2d 534 (applying exception to doctrine); Salvati v. Streator Township High School District Number 40 (1964), 51 Ill.App.2d 1, 5, 200 N.E.2d 122 (same).) There is little point in distorting the clear language of section 19(g) to accommodate additional and unintended interests. Our courts will also not be unduly burdened by such litigation because this case is atypical. Here, the workers' compensation claimant failed to offer any proof that her injury arose out of and occurred in the course of her employment. Her failure to meet even that minimal threshold combined with State Farm's apparently minimal investigation. Thus, we find that the Commission did not render a decision upon which a judgment under section 19(g) *483 might be based; and that section 19(g) does not provide a right to judgment to recover TTD benefits paid to an unentitled employee.Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7II Plaintiffs contend that dismissal of their complaint was, nonetheless, in error because the complaint yet stated a valid cause of action under Celeste v. Industrial Comm'n (1990), 205 Ill.App.3d 423, 150 Ill.Dec. 345, 562 N.E.2d 1148 , and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Zambole (1986), 141 Ill.App.3d 803, 96 Ill.Dec. 318, 491 N.E.2d 132 . Plaintiffs **1289 ***470 rely upon the oft-cited rule that dismissal of a cause of action on the pleadings is proper only where it is clearly apparent that no set of facts can be proven entitling the plaintiff to recover. (See Burdinie v. Village of Glendale Heights (1990), 139 Ill.2d 501, 504, 152 Ill.Dec. 121, 565 N.E.2d 654; Meerbrey v. Marshall Field & Co. (1990), 455, 473, 151 Ill.Dec. 560, 564 N.E.2d 1222; Krautstrunk v. Chicago Housing Authority 95 Ill.App.3d 529, 534, 51 Ill.Dec. 15, 420 N.E.2d 429.) Plaintiffs also rely on the rule that a \"mere surplusage\" in pleading, such as the pleading of an additional theory or recovery, does not provide a basis for dismissing a complaint which contains all the factual allegations necessary to state a cause of action. (See Segall v. Berkson (1985), 139 Ill.App.3d 325, 329-30, 93 Ill.Dec. 927, 487 N.E.2d 752.) Plaintiffs argue that the appellate decision below, affirming the dismissal of their complaint with prejudice, conflicts with these several pleading rules. Plaintiffs' arguments assume that the undesignated motion to dismiss here was brought under section 2-615 of the Code. Defendant, in contrast, contends that the motion to dismiss was properly granted because it asserted \"affirmative matter\" which avoided the legal effect of or defeated plaintiffs' claim to judgment under section 19(g) ( Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-619(a)(9) ). Defendant contends that plaintiffs asserted only one claim at the trial level, a right to judgment under section 19(g), which claim was defeated because the express terms of *484 the provision barred that relief. Defendant argues that the motion to dismiss was a section 2-619(a)(9) motion, raising \"affirmative matter,\" rather than a motion under section 2-615, which challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint. Defendant claims that the authorities cited by plaintiffs, Burdinie, Segall and Krautstrunk, are thus distinguishable because they concerned motions to dismiss brought under section 2-615. Defendant claims that there is no conflict between these several decisions and that of the appellate court below.[5] Meticulous practice dictates that a lawyer specifically designate whether her motion to dismiss is pursuant to section 2-615 or section 2-619. (See Galayda v. Penman (1980), 399 N.E.2d 656; Eddings v. Dundee Township Highway Commissioner (1985), 135 Ill.App.3d 190, 199, 88 Ill.Dec. 397, 478 N.E.2d 888; see also Cain v. American National Bank & Trust Co. (1975), 26 Ill.App.3d 574, 325 N.E.2d 799.) The failure to do so may not always be fatal, but reversal is required if prejudice results to the nonmovant. (See Premier Electrical Construction Co. v. La Salle National Bank (1983), 115 Ill.App.3d 638, 642, 71 Ill.Dec. 481, 450 N.E.2d 1360.) When confronted with such an omission, however, reviewing courts typically review the nondesignated motion according to its grounds, its requests, or its treatment by the parties and the trial court. (See Urbaitis v. Commonwealth Edison (1991), 143 Ill.2d 458, 159 Ill.Dec. 50, 575 N.E.2d 548; cf. Gouge v. Central Illinois Public Service Co. (1991), 144 Ill.2d 535, 163 Ill.Dec. 842, 582 N.E.2d 108 (mislabeled motion to dismiss).) Accordingly, in order to decide the propriety of the trial court's ruling concerning defendant's motion, we must examine the motion's grounds as well as treatment below. A motion to dismiss under section 2-615 attacks only the legal sufficiency of a complaint. Such a motion does not raise affirmative factual defenses, but alleges only defects appearing on the face of the complaint. *485 (Kolegas v. Heftel Broadcasting Corp. (1992), 154 180 Ill.Dec. 307, 607 N.E.2d 201; Urbaitis v. Commonwealth Edison (1991), Ill.2d 458, 475, 159 Ill.Dec. 50, 575 N.E.2d 548.) A section 2-615 motion is required to point out the defects complained of and must specify the relief sought. (Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-615(a).) The only matters to be considered in ruling on such a motion are the allegations of the pleadings themselves. Urbaitis, 143 Ill.2d at 475, 159 Ill.Dec. 50, 575 N.E.2d 548 . In comparison, a section 2-619 motion to dismiss allows for an involuntary dismissal of a claim based on certain defects or defenses. The basis of the motion must go to an entire claim or demand. (See Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110, par. 2-619, Historical & Practice Notes, at 662 (Smith-Hurd 1983).) Section 2- 619(a) **1290 ***471 additionally provides that if the grounds for the motion do not appear on the face of the pleading attacked, the motion shall be supported by affidavit. (See Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-619(a) .) Normally, the motion is required to be made within the time for pleading. Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-619(a) .Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8While section 2-619 motions, like those under section 2- 615, attack defects appearing on the face of the pleadings, that ground should be coupled in the motion with a ground based on matter not appearing of record. ( Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110, par. 2-619, Historical & Practice Notes, at 662 (Smith- Hurd 1983).) In practice, however, our courts have not limited section 2-619 motions in this manner, and such motions are normally allowed even though a defect on the face of the pleadings might be the only ground. (See Rowan v. Novotny (1987), 157 Ill.App.3d 691, 110 Ill.Dec. 80, 510 N.E.2d 1111 .) This practice allows for some degree of overlap between motions to dismiss brought under section 2-615 and those brought under section 2-619. See Ill.Rev.Stat.1991, ch. 110, par. 2-619.1 . One of the enumerated grounds for a section 2-619 motion to dismiss is that the claim is barred by affirmative *486 matter which avoids the legal effect of or defeats the claim. (Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-619(a)(9) .) \"[A]ffirmative matter,\" in a section 2-619(a)(9) motion, is something in the nature of a defense which negates the cause of action completely or refutes crucial conclusions of law or conclusions of material fact contained in or inferred from the complaint. (See John v. Tribune Co. (1962), 24 Ill.2d 437, 181 N.E.2d 105.) According to the letter of section 2-619(a), affirmative matter is to be supported by affidavit. In practice, however, some affirmative matter has been considered to be apparent on the face of the pleading. Such motions to dismiss are thus peculiarly within the area of confluence between section 2-615 and section 2-619(a)(9). The grounds asserted within the motion to dismiss here are capable of being characterized as assertions of the legal insufficiency of the complaint, the ground supporting a section 2-615 motion. Defendant's motion asserted that there was no authority in statutory or case law supporting an action to recover voluntarily paid TTD benefits. The motion also asserted that the Commission's \"decision,\" not being a liability determination, was legally incapable of reduction to judgment. The motion further asserted that the TTD payments were voluntary and therefore also incapable of being recovered as a matter of law. At a hearing on the matter, defendant argued that the Commission had not entered a compensation award as required by the express terms of section 19(g). Each one of these asserted defects was apparent on the face of the complaint. The motion was also presented without a supporting affidavit. As such, the motion may be viewed as attacking the complaint for the failure to state a cause of action. (See Delgatto v. Brandon Associates, Ltd.(1989), 131 Ill.2d 183, 189-90, 137 Ill.Dec. 36, 545 N.E.2d 689 (section 2-615 motion to dismiss is used when a party challenges whether a pleading is legally *487 valid or sustainable).) Neither the parties nor the trial court treated the motion in a way which might characterize it. The appellate court, however, apparently viewed the motion as a section 2- 615 motion to dismiss and relied on case law governing that provision. Plaintiffs' claim that the motion was a section 2- 615 motion to dismiss is therefore supportable. Nevertheless, defendant's claim that the motion to dismiss was brought under section 2-619(a)(9) is also supportable. Defendant claims that the motion was a section 2-619(a)(9) motion because it asserted that plaintiffs cause was barred by affirmative matter, in that section 19(g) did not allow for the type of relief requested \"pursuant to the express terms of the statute.\" Certainly, similar defenses at law have been considered \"affirmative matter\" so as to negate completely the asserted claim. (See Ingersoll v. Klein (1970), 46 Ill.2d 42, 262 N.E.2d 593 (choice of law an affirmative matter); Midwest Bank & Trust Co. v. Village of Lakewood (1983), 113 Ill.App.3d 962, 972, 69 Ill.Dec. 671, 447 N.E.2d 1358 (governmental tort immunity); Russo 59 Ill.Dec. 537, 431 preemption by ERISA); Sharp v. Gallagher (1981), 94 Ill.App.3d 1128, 50 Ill.Dec. 335, 419 N.E.2d 443 (the bar of the Workers' Compensation Act in employee liability suits against an employer).) Defendant, however, did not present an affidavit in support of the affirmative matter as required by section 2-619, indicating that the complained-of defect appeared only on the face of the complaint and could be decided on the basis of the pleadings alone. Based on the above-stated grounds and principles, the motion to dismiss is also fully capable of being viewed as a section 2-619(a)(9) motion. To summarize, the grounds and treatment of the motion to dismiss here indicate that the motion may legitimately be viewed as either a section 2-615 or a section 2-619(a) (9) motion. This fact is further apparent *488 from the disagreement within the appellate court below concerning the appropriate standards to apply on review of this motion. While decision on this case has been complicated by the defendant's and the trial and appellate courts' failure to clearly delineate the basis for the motion and the ruling thereon, we endeavor to reach both a just and a judicially economic result. (See Janes v. First Federal Savings & Loan AssociationIllinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9(1974), 57 Ill.2d 398, 407, 312 N.E.2d 605 .) We, accordingly, review the motion on both bases. Section 2-615 [6] The question presented by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action is whether sufficient facts are contained in the pleadings which, if established, could entitle the plaintiff to relief. ( Urbaitis, 143 Ill.2d at 475, 159 Ill.Dec. 50, 575 548, citing Krautstrunk, 95 Ill.App.3d at 534, 51 Ill.Dec. 15, 420 N.E.2d 429.) We adhere to the view that the trial court should dismiss a cause of action on the pleadings only if it is clearly apparent that no set of facts can be proven which will entitle a plaintiff to recover. See Burdinie, 139 Ill.2d at 504, 152 Ill.Dec. 121, 565 N.E.2d 654 ; 564 N.E.2d 1222. [7] [8] While we agree with the appellate court in the case sub judice that this oft-cited rule refers to dismissals with prejudice, we disagree that the rule applies only where a plaintiff has requested leave to amend. A motion to dismiss does not lie as long as a good cause of action is stated even if that cause of action is not the one intended to be asserted by the plaintiff. (See Luethi v. Yellow Cab Co. (1985), 136 Ill.App.3d 829, 833, 91 Ill.Dec. 572, 483 N.E.2d 1058; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. La Salle National Bank (1979), 77 Ill.App.3d 478, 482, 32 Ill.Dec. 812, 395 N.E.2d 1193 (finding cause denominated as an action for trespass to be sufficient as an action to enjoin interference with a leasehold interest); Browning v. Heritage Insurance Co. (1975), 33 Ill.App.3d 943, 947, 338 N.E.2d 912 ; 2 C. Nichols, Illinois Civil Practice \u00a7 1413, at 518-19 (5th rev. ed. 1990).) A complaint need only allege *489 facts which establish the right to recovery; not only are allegations of law or conclusions not required, they are improper. (See 3 R. Michael, Illinois Practice \u00a7 24.2, at 340 (1989); Monroe County Water Cooperative v. City of Waterloo (1982), 107 Ill.App.3d 477, 63 Ill.Dec. 315, 437 N.E.2d 1237; see also Haas v. Mid-America Fire & Marine Insurance Co. (1976), 35 Ill.App.3d 993, 998, 343 N.E.2d 36 .) It is, moreover, the allegations of a complaint which define a cause of action, not the name or title that may be used by the plaintiff. Lovgren v. Citizens First National Bank (1989), 126 Ill.2d 411, 419, 128 Ill.Dec. 542, 534 N.E.2d 987 . Notably, section 2-617 has been applied in such a way that plaintiffs need not amend to more fully state an unintendedtheory. The provision states that where \"relief is sought and the court determines, on motion directed to the pleadings * * * that the plaintiff has pleaded * * * facts which entitled the plaintiff to relief but that the plaintiff has sought the wrong remedy, the court shall permit the pleadings to be amended * * *. \" (Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-617.) The provision is described as codifying and endorsing the prevailing practice, which had been that no amendment was necessary. ( Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110, par. 2-617, Historical & Practice Notes, at 657 (Smith-Hurd 1983); 3 R. Michael, Illinois Practice \u00a7 24.2, at 342 (1989).) Decisions subsequent to section 2-617's enactment continue to allow the practice of not requiring an amendment. See 3 R. Michael, **1292 ***473 Illinois Practice \u00a7 24.2, at 342 (1989); see also Luethi v. Yellow Cab Co., 136 Ill.App.3d 829, 91 Ill.Dec. 572, 483 N.E.2d 1058 (count attempting to state cause of action for willful and wanton misconduct upheld as properly alleging cause for negligent entrustment); Gregor v. Kleiser (1982), 111 Ill.App.3d 333, 67 Ill.Dec. 38, 443 N.E.2d 1162 (cause for violation of duty owed a licensee by property owner sufficient to support cause for cause based on respondeat superior ); Mamolella v. First Bank (1981), 97 Ill.App.3d 579, 53 Ill.Dec. 12, 423 N.E.2d 204 (while cause of action to enjoin a purpresture failed, case could be treated as *490 action in mandamus); Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. La Salle National Bank, 77 Ill.App.3d 478, 32 Ill.Dec. 812, 395 N.E.2d 1193 (although count denominated cause of action for trespass, allegations were sufficient as action to enjoin interference with leasehold interest); Krautstrunk, 95 Ill.App.3d 529, 51 Ill.Dec. 15, 420 N.E.2d 429. Furthermore, the general waiver rule that a party may not raise a new theory in support of the claim for the first time on appeal (see Kravis v. Smith Marine, Inc. (1975), 60 Ill.2d 141, 147, 324 N.E.2d 417 ) is not in conflict with these cases. That rule has been held to be excepted where the issue on appeal is whether a particular theory was raised by the factual allegations in the complaint. (See Cuerton v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (1982), 111 Ill.App.3d 261, 265, 66 Ill.Dec. 906, 443 N.E.2d 1069 (deciding sufficiency of a complaint in the context of a section 2-615 motion to dismiss); Krautstrunk, 95 Ill.App.3d at 534-35, 51 Ill.Dec. 15, 420 N.E.2d 429 (same).) Based on these principles, we must determine whether sufficient facts are stated in plaintiffs' complaint which, if established, would entitle them to relief additional to that alleged under section 19(g). Plaintiffs contend their complaint stated a valid cause of action under the Liberty Mutual and Celeste decisions.Illinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10Plaintiffs characterize Liberty Mutual and Celeste as holding that restitution for overpayment of compensation benefits is a valid cause of action, entitling an employer or its insurer to recover. Plaintiffs contend their complaint alleged a valid cause of action under such theory in addition to the section 19(g) theory which was explicitly stated in the complaint. For support, plaintiffs point to the fact that the appellate court apparently considered these decisions to allow that particular cause of action. We disagree with plaintiffs regarding the scope of the holdings in Liberty Mutual and Celeste. We agree, however, that plaintiffs' complaint, nonetheless, stated a valid cause of action under common law principles addressed in Liberty Mutual. *491 Liberty Mutual allowed a workers' compensation insurer to recover from an employee the amount of an award which had been paid to stop the accrual of interest in accordance with section 19(n) of the Act. In allowing the recovery, the court addressed the common law rule, known as the voluntary payments doctrine, that neither money paid under a claim of right with full knowledge of the underlying facts and absent coercion, fraud or a superior bargaining position by the transferee nor money paid under a mistake of law is recoverable. (See Liberty Mutual, 141 Ill.App.3d at 804, 96 Ill.Dec. 318, 491 N.E.2d 132 , citing Hartford v. Doubler (1982), 105 Ill.App.3d 999, 61 Ill.Dec. 592, 434 N.E.2d 1189 ; see also Commercial National Bank v. Bruno (1979), 75 Ill.2d 343, 350-51, 27 Ill.Dec. 351, 389 N.E.2d 163; Groves v. Farmers State Bank (1937), 368 Ill. 35, 47, 12 N.E.2d 618.) A recognized exception to this long- standing rule provides that where money is paid under a mistake of fact, which would not have been paid had the facts been known to the payor, such money may be recovered. See Board of Education v. Holt (1976), 41 Ill.App.3d 625, 354 N.E.2d 534; Salvati v. Streator Township High School District Number 40 (1964), 51 Ill.App.2d 1, 200 N.E.2d 122 ; Willens v. City of Northlake (1958), 19 Ill.App.2d 316, 152 N.E.2d 486 ; Wolf v. Beaird (1888), 123 Ill. 585, 15 N.E. 161; see also Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. Chicago & Western Indiana R. Co. (7th Cir.1942), 131 F.2d 215 (finding that voluntary payment made under mistake of fact affords better legal basis of recovery than is furnished under mistake of law). While Liberty Mutual did not expressly rely on this mistake- of-fact exception, the court, nonetheless, found the voluntary payments **1293 ***474 rule inapplicable because the payment was not made pursuant to a claim of right or mistake of law. Liberty Mutual additionally found indication in caselaw, discussing section 19(n), that it was implied that an employer might recover an award amount, and that other common law principles, concerning restitution also supported such result. Liberty *492 Mutual held that \"it is implied in section 19(n) of the Workers' Compensation Act that if funds have been tendered by the employer's insurer to avoid the accrual of interest pending appeal by an employee seeking a higher award, upon reversal of the arbitrator's decision, such sum must be returned to the insurer.\" Liberty Mutual, 141 Ill.App.3d at 806, 96 Ill.Dec. 318, 491 N.E.2d 132. Celeste concerned the determination of whether an employee was required to file a bond under section 19(f)(2) of the Act to effect review. The workers' compensation insurer had paid the employee interest, on an award, which the employee was unentitled to receive. By way of dicta, Celeste recognized that \"[r]estitution for overpayment of a Commission award is permitted by separate suit in the event the employee refuses to repay the excess amount\" Celeste, 205 Ill.App.3d at 426, 150 Ill.Dec. 345, 562 N.E.2d 1148, citing Liberty Mutual, 141 Ill.App.3d 803, 96 Ill.Dec. 318, 491 N.E.2d 132. Thus, contrary to plaintiffs' contentions, Liberty Mutual and Celeste do not hold that an employer can maintain a cause of action for recovery of all manner of compensation benefits; these decisions simply establish a cause of action for \"restitution\" where an employee receives either a compensation award or an amount as interest on an award, and it is later determined that the employee is unentitled to those amounts. While Liberty Mutual may have relied, in part, on certain exceptions to the voluntary payments doctrine, the holding is, nonetheless, confined to recognizing a cause of action for the recovery of award amounts paid under section 19(n). Celeste additionally recognizes that cause of action by way of dicta. [9] What can be said, however, is that Liberty Mutual referred to and relied on the voluntary payments doctrine. And a cause of action for the recovery of voluntary payments made because of a mistake of fact has long been recognized. In the present case, plaintiffs' complaint stated that cause of action. *493 By way of incorporation, plaintiffs' complaint alleged that Nickum claimed a back injury, occurring on October 16, 1987, while she was at work. The complaint set forth the undisputed fact that State Farm paid Nickum $7,899.95 in TTD benefits as a result of that claimed workers' compensation injury. The complaint further alleged thatIllinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11Nickum's medical records failed to report a work-related injury, occurring on October 16, 1987, but her medical history revealed continual back pain and discomfort prior to that date. The complaint also alleged that the arbitrator found Nickum's claimed injury to be noncompensable under the Act. Finally, the complaint alleged that State Farm had requested Nickum to reimburse the monies, but she had refused to do so. Although the complaint did not state that the payment of the TTD benefits was based upon a mistake of fact, it can reasonably be inferred that State Farm made the payments based on incorrect and incomplete information regarding the circumstances of the claimed injury. (See Board of Education v. Holt (1976), 41 Ill.App.3d 625, 354 N.E.2d 534 (cause of action based on mistake of fact stated where pleading showed that board erroneously paid teacher her salary even though she had resigned).) Based on the allegations in the complaint (Krautstrunk, 95 Ill.App.3d at 534-35, 51 Ill.Dec. 15, 420 N.E.2d 429 ), we conclude that a valid cause of action was stated under the theory of a mistake of fact. Thus, viewing the motion to dismiss as a section 2-615 motion, which challenges the legal sufficiency of a complaint, we conclude that the motion was improperly granted because a valid cause of action was stated by the complaint. Section 2-619(a)(9) [10] The motion to dismiss was also improperly granted if viewed as raising affirmative matter which had the effect of precluding plaintiffs' claim. *494 If a cause of action is dismissed during hearing on a section 2-619 motion on the **1294 ***475 pleadings and affidavits, the question on appeal is whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (See In re Marriage of Musa (1982), 103 Ill.App.3d 189, 58 Ill.Dec. 695, 430 N.E.2d 727 ; Glass Specialty Co. v. 147 Ill.App.3d 653, 101 Ill.Dec. 552, 498 N.E.2d 876.) As previously discussed, the defendant's motion to dismiss correctly asserted that section 19(g) does not provide the procedural means for plaintiffs to recover amounts paid for TTD benefits; plaintiffs did not overcome this assertion. And according to defendant, because plaintiffs did not raise at trial any claim additional to that based on section 19(g), and because the motion raised affirmative matter negating completely that claim, the complaint was properly dismissed. Defendant asserts that plaintiffs did not raise a theory additional to section 19(g)until the appellate court referred the parties to Celeste during oral argument. Defendant additionally argues that plaintiffs did not take advantage of certain provisions under the Code or under Supreme Court Rule 366 to either seek leave to amend their complaint to add an additional theory of recovery or to change their theory. (See Ill.Rev.Stat.1989, ch. 110, par. 2-616 (allowing amendment), par. 2-617 (permitting amendment where facts established which entitle a plaintiff to relief, but wrong remedy sought); 134 Ill.2d R. 366 (reviewing court may exercise powers of amendment of the trial court). ) Defendant directs our attention to Kennedy v. First National Bank (1985), 129 Ill.App.3d 633, 85 Ill.Dec. 236, 473 N.E.2d 604, Criscione v. Roebuck & (1978), 66 Ill.App.3d 664, 23 Ill.Dec. 455, 384 N.E.2d 91, and Krachock v. Department of Revenue (1949), 403 Ill. 148, 85 N.E.2d 682. In sum, defendant argues that plaintiffs have waived on appeal any claim, which conceivably might survive a section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss, by failing to raise that *495 claim at trial and by failing to seek amendment of their complaint. We disagree. The record shows that, at the trial court's hearing on the motion to dismiss, plaintiffs' counsel argued that Nickum's claim was not made pursuant to a claim of right or as the result of a mistake of law. Such arguments were attempts to raise exception to the voluntary payments rule. Counsel additionally argued that State Farm was without full knowledge of the facts surrounding Nickum's injury at the time the benefits were paid; that such information was unavailable until the time of arbitration; and that, while there might not have been fraud on Nickum's part, she had, nonetheless, represented her injury as resulting from an on- the-job accident. Counsel also analogized plaintiffs' case to that of Liberty Mutual, in that both cases involved payments to avoid some sort of penalty, both concerned payments which were not made because of a mistake of law or made under a claim of right, both concerned an absence of express statutory language under the Act authorizing repayment, and both required reimbursement so as to avoid frustrating the purposes and legislative intent underlying the Act, i.e., the encouragement of prompt benefits payments by employers. Although plaintiffs' counsel did not appear to completely grasp the theory, his arguments clearly raised a claim based on mistake of fact. Plaintiffs' counsel, however, failed to recognize that an independent claim under the mistake of fact theory was viableIllinois Graphics Co. v. Nickum, 159 Ill.2d 469 (1994) 639 N.E.2d 1282, 203 Ill.Dec. 463 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12under the circumstances presented by this case. Counsel stated, \"In the case of [Liberty Mutual] * * * it was pursued on the basis of summary judgment. In this case, I am pursuing it under Section 19(g) * * *.\" Plaintiffs' counsel apparently thought that the common law principles supporting recovery in Liberty Mutual could apply as well in the context of an action under *496 section 19(g); he apparently did not understand that his statement, rather, constricted the avenue of recovery under those principles. In considering this apparent blunder by plaintiffs' counsel, we note that waiver principles operate as a limitation on the parties and not on the courts. ( In re Marriage of Sutton (1990), 136 Ill.2d 441, 446, 145 Ill.Dec. 890, 557 N.E.2d 869.) Further, in the exercise of its responsibility for a just result and the maintenance of a sound and uniform body of precedent, a reviewing court may consider issues not properly preserved by the parties. ( **1295 ***476 Jackson Jordan, Inc. v. Leydig, Voit & 786, 633 N.E.2d 627 .) Although the claim based on a mistake of fact was raised rather unclearly, we will consider whether it survived the motion to dismiss reviewed under section 2-619(a)(9). This is not a case of an intentional choice of trial strategy by counsel. Moreover, our consideration of this claim is proper in the furtherance of a just result. Here, plaintiffs' complaint stated a good cause of action based on a theory of mistake of fact; defendant's motion to dismiss indicated that defendant had notice of that possible theory of recovery; plaintiffs' trial counsel strenuously attempted to articulate clearly the theory, but failed; and, although not prejudicial, defendant's motion to dismiss did not clearly indicate its grounds. Significantly also, the trial court ruled on the general applicability of the voluntary payments doctrine, finding that that rule did not preclude a recovery. These total circumstances support consideration of the claim. In this regard, we are not persuaded by defendant's arguments that plaintiffs' failure to seek leave to amend indicated waiver of the mistake-of-fact claim. Whether deciding the legal sufficiency of plaintiffs' complaint or deciding waiver of plaintiffs' mistake-of-fact claim, under the challenge posed by this possible section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss, we have found that a *497 claim based on a mistake-of-fact theory was stated and thereby raised in the pleading. ( Cf. Eagan v. Chicago Transit Authority (1994), 158 Ill.2d 527, 199 Ill.Dec. 739, 634 N.E.2d 1093 (theory not raised in pleading waived for purposes of deciding section 2-619 motion to dismiss).) By failing to seek leave to amend, plaintiffs did nothing less than stand on their complaint as it was stated. See Krachock v. Department of Revenue, 403 Ill. 148, 85 N.E.2d 682 .In light of these principles and under the circumstances presented here, we determine that plaintiffs sufficiently raised, at trial, a claim based on the theory of mistake of fact. Furthermore, that claim, based on mistake of fact, survived the motion to dismiss as reviewed under section 2-619(a)(9). Defendant's motion alleged that State Farm voluntarily paid the TTD benefits and that, therefore, under the voluntary payments doctrine, the monies could not be recovered. Assuming that voluntariness of the payments was raised as affirmative matter, that matter did not negate completely plaintiffs' claim based on mistake of fact. Under a mistake- of-fact theory, payments are recoverable whether voluntary or not. (See 29 Ill.L. & Prac. \u00a7 56, at 521 (1957) (fact that payment may be deemed a voluntary one will not preclude recovery where there was a mistake as to a material fact).) The rule is that in the absence of fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake of fact money voluntarily paid under a claim of right to the payment, with full knowledge of the facts by the person making the payment, cannot be recovered unless the payment was made under circumstances amounting to compulsion. (See Commercial National Bank v. Bruno, 75 Ill.2d at 350-51, 27 Ill.Dec. 351, 389 N.E.2d 163 .) Of course, the correlative rule or exception is that money paid under a mistake of fact is recoverable by the payor. (See Hartford v. Doubler, 105 Ill.App.3d at 1001, 61 Ill.Dec. 592, 434 N.E.2d 1189 .) Based on these principles, the assertion of the payments' voluntariness *498 does not negate completely plaintiffs' claim based on mistake of fact. We therefore conclude that the motion to dismiss was improperly granted if viewed as asserting affirmative matter under section 2-619(a) (9). Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the circuit and appellate courts, and remand this cause to the circuit court for further proceedings. Judgments reversed; cause remanded.

OPINION Justice MURPHY delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion. **701 \u00b6 1 This appeal follows the trial court's August 31, 2011, order directing the issuance of a tax deed to petitioner, Z Financial, LLC, for the subject property, unit A-33 in the 405 North Wabash Avenue parking condominium. Respondent, ALSJ, Inc. (ALSJ), asserts that the trial court erred in granting the petition for tax deed. Additionally, respondent contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to deem facts admitted and denying its motion for summary judgment. **702 *191 For the following reasons, we find the trial court erred in finding petitioner complied with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 216(c) (eff. May 30, 2008), reverse its order denying respondent's motion to deem facts admitted and remand the matter for further proceedings. \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND \u00b6 3 The property at issue is unit A-33 in the 405 North Wabash Parking Condominium located at 405 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois (property). On June 22, 2007, the Cook County collector sold the property to petitioner for nonpayment of 2005 general taxes. On December 30, 2009, petitioner filed its petition for tax deed. Petitioner noted that the final date of redemption from the tax sale was June 4, 2010; therefore, the notice serving period pursuant to section 22-10 of the Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/22-10 (West 2010) ) was December 4, 2009, through March 4, 2010.Exhibit B to the petition was a copy of the notice required by law to be sent to all interested parties. \u00b6 4 On August 26, 2010, petitioner filed its application for an order directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed for the property. Petitioner listed Strug, LLC (Strug), ALSJ, Austin Bank of Chicago, and \"405 N. Wabash Parking Condominium Association,\" as the parties who were owners, occupants, and parties interested in the property. Of note, \"D. Giljen, 405 N. Wabash Ave. # 807\" is listed as one of the addresses of service for Strug. This name and address are listed for the grantor on the mortgage agreement for the subject parking space, signed as Daniel Giljen, a/k/a Dragoljub Giljen1. \u00b6 5 The subsequent section of the petition contained a list of the manner and date of service of each of these parties and the address for which that service was effected. As addressed by petitioner, the sheriff's return affidavits of service for this case were originally filed in the incorrect case file. Prior to the hearing on this case, the returns were located, placed in the correct file, and are of record here on appeal. \u00b6 6 A tract index search conducted by Five Star Abstracting & Paralegal Services was attached to the petition. The search indicated that the property was deeded to Strug, LLC, in February 2006. A mortgage on the property to ALSJ, Inc., from Strug, LLC, was filed on November 8, 2006. The mortgage attached to the petition to Austin Bank of Chicago from Strug is shown on the search as filed May 16, 2007. Finally, the search indicated that a lis pendens action was recorded on October 23, 2009, relating to the mortgage between ALSJ and Strug. \u00b6 7 Respondent filed an appearance and objected to petitioner's application. Respondent alleged that there was no sheriff's return filed with the clerk of the court indicating that Strug, the owner of record, was served. Respondent added that the sheriff's return of service indicated that Brian Levay was served as agent for Strug, but he was described as a 50-year-old black male. Respondent attached an affidavit of Robert Nothstein, averring that Levay is a registered agent for Strug, as identified in the Illinois Secretary of State records, but that Strug had been involuntarily dissolved by the Secretary of State and that Levay is a 46-year-old Caucasian male. *192 **703 \u00b6 8 Respondent added that Dragoljub Giljen was the member manager of Strug. Moreover, respondentIn re County Treasurer, 2012 IL App (1st) 112897 (2012) 977 N.E.2d 189, 364 Ill.Dec. 700 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3noted that Giljen was listed as the party to receive tax bills for the property, as well as an interested party in the lis pendens action, and the signator for Strug in its mortgage with ALSJ. In addition, respondent stated that the address of the subject property was listed inconsistently by petitioner on its section 22 -5 notice, on the complaint for foreclosure, and its section 22 -10 notices. Accordingly, respondent asserted that petitioner failed to comply with the notice and due diligence requirements of the Property Tax Code and prayed the petition for tax deed be denied. \u00b6 9 On November 17, 2010, respondent propounded a request for admission of facts on petitioner. Petitioner filed an answer on December 14, 2010, signed by counsel, Richard Glickman. The answer was without any supporting affidavit swearing to the responses. On January 13, 2011, respondent filed a motion to deem facts admitted for petitioner's attorney's failure to include the required sworn statement per Rule 216(c) . On February 25, 2011, the trial court set a briefing schedule as well as a hearing date of April 15, 2011, for respondent's motion. \u00b6 10 On March 31, 2011, petitioner filed a \"supplemental\" answer to petitioner's request to admit. The supplemental answer included a photocopy of the original answer and sworn affidavits from Glickman and Keith Moll, manager of Z Financial, LLC, verifying the responses. Following argument on respondent's motion, the trial court denied the motion. The court found that counsel for petitioner had direct knowledge of the facts. Therefore, it concluded that counsel's affidavit was sufficient to meet the requirements of the rule and it was proper to not have a corporate representative of petitioner verify the contents. A briefing schedule was set for respondent's motion for summary judgment. \u00b6 11 Respondent asserted that petitioner violated the notice requirements of the Property Tax Code by failing to serve or provide proof of service of notice by the sheriff on ALSJ, Austin Bank of Chicago, and 405 N. Wabash Parking Condominium Association. Respondent also alleged that petitioner failed to provide proof of service of the Cook County clerk. Next, respondent asserted that petitioner filed to identify, provide notice to and serve Dragoljub Giljen as an interested party and occupant of the property. Respondent contended that petitioner failed to provide complete and consistent addresses in its section 22 -5, section 22-10, and section 22 -25 notices. Finally, respondent asserted that petitioner failed to provide proper proof of service on the owner of the property, Strug, because service on Brian Levaywas indicated by the sheriff to be on a black male and Levay is a white male. \u00b6 12 The trial court found that there were contested issues of fact and set the case for a hearing. At the hearing, Keith Moll testified that he was office manager for petitioner and inspected the property. Moll testified that he identified the property address and unit from a Sidwell map and documents from the assessor's office. Moll testified that he went to the building on December 28, 2009, and found that the entrance to the garage was blocked by garage doors. When Moll talked with the guard at the service desk, he was denied access. He did not return to the site to try to gain access. Moll memorialized this in his notes on his inspection sheet report, which was entered into evidence. \u00b6 13 Colin Luce, a clerk with the Cook County sheriff's office, testified that he was responsible for \"pinning\" the tax deed work that came into the office. This included **704 *193 receiving take notices, printing and organizing sheriff's affidavits, completing computer filings, and speaking with attorneys concerning case problems. Luce testified that a sheriff's number is attributed to each individual case and documentation is organized via computers utilizing this number. In the event an incorrect number is entered, the office could fix the issue\u2014but a notation would not be made if a correction was made. Luce testified to the affidavits in the file for the instant matter and stated that the sheriff's office follows the assumption that the court case numbers are properly indicated on the forms. Luce also testified to two affidavits for service on Brian Levay, one indicating that he was a black male and one indicating that he was a white male. \u00b6 14 Richard Glickman, counsel for petitioner, testified next that he had been practicing in the area of tax deeds for 30 to 35 years. Glickman testified that he prepared an application for an order to direct the county clerk to issue a tax deed and filed the case on December 30, 2009. In determining who was to receive a take notice, Glickman had Moll order a tract search for the property and do a physical search of the property. Glickman also searched the recorder's office for any recordings against the property and reviewed various site and Web site searches to determine the parties to serve. \u00b6 15 Glickman testified that two mortgages were found for the property. Strug was identified as the owner of the property with Brian Levay as its agent for service. Dragoljub Giljen, also known as Dan Giljen, was identified as a member of Strug and had a listed address at the condominium complexIn re County Treasurer, 2012 IL App (1st) 112897 (2012) 977 N.E.2d 189, 364 Ill.Dec. 700 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4where the property at issue is located. Approximately 12 to 13 take notices were prepared and copied and given to the sheriff for service. After the initial service attempts, Glickman checked with the sheriff's office to ascertain if service was effectuated and attempted to re-serve parties that were not served in February and March 2010. He indicated that he could only find the two addresses for Giljen and attempted service at those addresses. \u00b6 16 On cross-examination, Glickman stated that the notice period was from December 4, 2009, through March 4, 2010. He indicated that he did not review the complaint for foreclosure of mortgage against Dragoljub Giljen. Glickman admitted that Giljen was listed as personally liable for the deficiency on the property and whose right to possess was sought to be terminated. \u00b6 17 Respondent called Shirley Vesey to testify. Vesey testified that she is the facility manager for the parking garage where the property is located. She testified that during the notice period, Giljen was occupying the subject property and that he resided in unit 3504 of the building. Vesey testified that to get into the garage, a person needs a key for the door to the lobby or a key card to enter through the garage door entrance for vehicles. \u00b6 18 Following closing arguments, the court took the matter under advisement. On August 4, 2011, the trial court entered an order finding that petitioner strictly complied with the requirements of the Property Tax Code. On August 31, 2011, following petitioner's presentment of the report of proceedings and proof of payment of property taxes, the trial court entered an order directing the county clerk to issue a tax deed. This appeal followed. \u00b6 19 II. ANALYSIS \u00b6 20 Supreme Court Rule 216 [1] [2] \u00b6 21 Respondent asserts that the trial court erred in failing to grant its **705 *194 motion to deem facts admitted for petitioner's failure to include a verified statement by a company representative with its answer pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 216 . Respondent asserts that the standard of review for this issue is de novo, citing to the standard of review for summary judgment issues. When considering the construction of a supreme court rule, we follow the same standard as for statutes and our review is denovo. Vision Point of Sale, Inc. v. Haas, 226 Ill.2d 334, 342, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065 (2007). However, requests for admission are part of the discovery process; therefore, we review a trial court's decision concerning the course and conduct of the pretrial discovery process for an abuse of discretion. Id. at 345-47, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065. \u00b6 22 Rule 216 states, in pertinent part: \"(c) Admission in the Absence of Denial. Each of the matters of fact and the genuineness of each document of which admission is requested is admitted unless, within 28 days after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission either (1) a sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters or (2) written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part. If written objections to a part of the request are made, the remainder of the request shall be answered within the period designated in the request. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission. If good faith requires that a party deny only a part, or requires qualification, of a matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and deny only the remainder. Any objection to a request or to an answer shall be heard by the court upon prompt notice and motion of the party making the request.\" Ill. S.Ct. R. 216(c) (eff. May 30, 2008). \u00b6 23 Respondent notes that our supreme court rules are not aspirational but have the force of law. Bright v. Dicke, 166 Ill.2d 204, 209 Ill.Dec. 735, 652 N.E.2d 275 (1995). Citing to this court's decision in Brookbank v. Olson, 389 Ill.App.3d 683, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426 (2009) , respondent argues that the rule clearly requires that the party provide the sworn-to verification of its response to requests to admit. Respondent notes that the Brookbank court highlighted that Vision Point and Moy v. Ng, 341 Ill.App.3d 984, 276 Ill.Dec. 160, 793 N.E.2d 919 (2003) , stand for the requirement that a corporate representative must provide the sworn statement required by rule. Respondent adds that petitioner's attempt to cure this failure through its supplemental answer was not only untimely, but improperly filed. As a result, it concludes that this court must reverse the trial court's order and the facts contained within the request to admit should be considered admissions by petitioner.In re County Treasurer, 2012 IL App (1st) 112897 (2012) 977 N.E.2d 189, 364 Ill.Dec. 700 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5\u00b6 24 Petitioner argues that the trial court ruling was proper because it is vested with broad discretionary power over the discovery process. It contends that the requests sought by respondent were matters within the direct knowledge of counsel who performed the necessary due diligence to serve parties in this case. Further, when apprised of the procedural defect, counsel secured and filed an affidavit from a company representative. Petitioner argues that this precise scenario was envisioned by this court when it stated **706 *195 that in responding to Rule 216 requests it is safe to assume that an overwhelming number of cases involve corporate officials relying on attorney guidance, including having the attorney conduct investigations. Skotticelli v. Club Misty, Inc., 406 Ill.App.3d 958, 964, 346 Ill.Dec. 646, 941 N.E.2d 204 (2010). Accordingly, the Skotticelli court answered in the negative the certified question of whether a denial under Rule 216 must be admitted when not based on the personal knowledge of the party affiant, but on an investigation conducted by his attorney. Id. at 960, 346 Ill.Dec. 646, 941 N.E.2d 204. \u00b6 25 Petitioner argues that the same logic followed by the Skotticelli court applies here because the information sought by respondent in its requests was all directly related to counsel's actions and investigations. Accordingly, it maintains that the denials should stand, especially considering that counsel later provided the affidavit of a corporate representative affirming the responses. Petitioner adds that respondent's reliance on Brookbank is misplaced because that case involved the distinguishable scenario where the defendant could not be found, because in this case, Z Financial simply adopted the answers of counsel. Further, petitioner contends that even if the trial court erred, it was harmless error because the facts sought to be admitted by respondent were not material facts affecting compliance with the Property Tax Code. [3] \u00b6 26 Unfortunately, respondent failed to provide any reply to petitioner's arguments on this issue. Despite respondent's failure, we agree that the trial court erred in denying its motion to deem facts admitted. Case law on this issue is not on all fours with the facts of this case and can be distinguished from the instant matter. However, the analysis from these cases, particularly that provided by the Brookbank court, leads us to the conclusion that petitioner's failure to provide the sworn statement of a party within the required 28 days was fatal. [4] [5] \u00b6 27 While a part of the discovery process, the purpose of Rule 216 is not to discover, but to establishmaterial facts that do not require formal proof at trial. This procedure allows for a more streamlined and efficient case where disputed issues may be clearly and succinctly presented. Vision Point, 226 Ill.2d at 345-46, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065. The requirements of Rule 216, particularly providing a timely sworn response, must be strictly complied with, and the failure to comply will result in a judicial admission that is considered incontrovertible, withdrawing that fact from contention. Tires 'N Tracks, Inc. v. Dominic Fiordirosa Construction Co., Inc., 331 Ill.App.3d 87, 91, 264 Ill.Dec. 908, 771 N.E.2d 612 (2002) . Although the Vision Point court noted that the cases analyzing Rule 216 have developed the \"unduly harsh\" strict compliance rule that does not forgive mistake, inadvertence, or attorney neglect, a party may receive an extension to file pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 183 if good cause can be shown for the delay. Vision Point, 226 Ill.2d at 349-52, 314 Ill.Dec. 778, 875 N.E.2d 1065. However, as respondent points out, petitioner did not file a motion pursuant to Rule 183 in this case, but simply filed its supplemental answer. Therefore we only consider whether counsel may file a response to a request to admit without a party swearing to the response. \u00b6 28 Both Brookbank and Skotticelli followed the Vision Point decision and both involved certified questions. In Brookbank, the plaintiff served a request to admit on the defendant and defendant's counsel filed a timely response objecting to the requests and stating that he could not admit or deny the requests because he was unable to locate or contact the defendant. *196 **707 Brookbank, 389 Ill.App.3d at 684, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. The plaintiff moved to strike the response and have matters admitted, but the trial court denied the motion, granting defense counsel leave to serve an amended response certified by counsel only. Id. at 685, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. Following mandatory arbitration, the plaintiff renewed the motion to strike the defendant's response. The trial court again denied the motion, but certified the following question for this court's review: \" 'Whether the trial court has authority to allow only a party's attorney to sign and verify a [r]esponse to a Rule 216 [r]equest to [a]dmit facts, when the attorney cannot locate the party, i.e., his client.' \" Id. at 684, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. \u00b6 29 In answering the question, this court provided a comprehensive review of our courts' treatment of Rule 216. The court noted that this court had considered the verification question in Moy v. Ng, 341 Ill.App.3d 984, 989, 276 Ill.Dec. 160, 793 N.E.2d 919 (2003), holding that although counselIn re County Treasurer, 2012 IL App (1st) 112897 (2012) 977 N.E.2d 189, 364 Ill.Dec. 700 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6may respond to pleadings on behalf of a party, Rule 216 required response by the parties and not counsel. Brookbank, 389 Ill.App.3d at 686. The Brookbank court noted that the Vision Point court clarified Moy, holding that the party's verification was sufficient and a lack of signature from the party on the response was not fatal. Id. The court then noted that both Moy and Vision Point stand for the proposition that a party or corporate representative of a corporate party must provide the sworn-to denial of a request to admit under the rule. Id. at 686-87, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. Furthermore, analyzing the plain language of the rule as well as support from review of similar cases and rules from foreign and federal jurisdictions, the court found confirmation of this conclusion. Id. at 687, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. In particular, the court noted that following the 1970 amendment to Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed.R.Civ.P. 36) , which eliminated the similar requirement that a party swear to a response, our supreme court has chosen not to alter Rule 216 in this way. Brookbank, 389 Ill.App.3d at 687, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. \u00b6 30 Following this analysis, the Brookbank court considered the certified question before it. It noted that Rule 183 grants discretion to the trial court to allow an extension of time to file, but does not provide any discretion to alter the procedural framework of Rule 216. This necessarily precludes allowing counsel to provide the sworn-to denial, because \"[w]ithout any client contact, there is no indication by counsel's sworn statement that the responding party has adopted or substantiated the answers provided or even authorized the attorney to enter a denial.\" Id. at 688, 329 Ill.Dec. 835, 907 N.E.2d 426. Accordingly, the court answered the certified question in the negative. \u00b6 31 In Skotticelli, this court considered the following certified question: \" 'Where a trial court finds that a corporate defendant denied a request to admit, based on the lack of knowledge of the subject requests on the part of the corporate president, and the corporate president's lack of any of the investigation or inquiry on his own part, and where the corporation is out of business and had no employees at the time the requests were propounded, and the corporation asserts that its denials of the requests to admit were based on information learned by defense counsel from interviewing the prior employees of the corporation, can the trial court properly strike the corporation['s] denials of the requests to admit and deem the request to be admitted?'\" *197 **708 Skotticelli, 406 204 . \u00b6 32 In Skotticelli, the defendant corporation had ceased doing business and was no longer operating the business where the plaintiff sustained his injuries. Counsel prepared a response to the plaintiff's requests to admit denying all requests with the president of the defendant corporation at the time of the incident, Matthew Schulte, signing the response. The plaintiff moved to strike the response and deem the requests admitted. The plaintiff argued that Schulte had admitted that he had no personal knowledge of the factual circumstances surrounding the incident at issue and therefore violated the rule. Id. at 960, 346 Ill.Dec. 646, 941 N.E.2d 204. The trial court granted the motion and subsequently certified the above question. \u00b6 33 The Skotticelli court distinguished Brookbank based on the fact that a representative of the dissolved defendant corporation in Brookbank could be and was located. Furthermore, unlike in Brookbank, the attorney did not certify the response, but Schulte signed the response in his official capacity as the president of the dissolved corporation. Id. at 963-64, 346 Ill.Dec. 646, 941 N.E.2d 204. Therefore, the court stated that a fair reading of Vision Point and section 1-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/1-109 (West 2006) ) \"allows for Rule 216 responses to be certified by a person with knowledge of the facts at issue, including the party's attorney.\" Skotticelli, 406 Ill.App.3d N.E.2d 204 . \u00b6 34 The court continued to state that it is not a violation of Rule 216 for counsel to perform an investigation on behalf of his client or for a client to deny a request based on information learned by counsel. The court found that this was \"especially true\" for the specific scenario in Skotticelli, where the client was a dissolved corporation. Id. Therefore, the court answered the certified question in the negative. Id. \u00b6 35 We find that there is no reason to depart from the sound analysis provided by the Brookbank court in this case. Petitioner's attempts to distinguish Brookbank and bolster the language of Skotticelli are unavailing. While the Skotticelli court does state that Rule 216 allows for responses to be certified by a person with knowledge of the facts at issue, including an attorney, this statement is dicta. The court ultimately only decided the issue of whether a party may deny a request based on its attorney's investigation. Petitioner claims that counsel's knowledge base was directly related to the requests sought and the supplemental affidavit providedIn re County Treasurer, 2012 IL App (1st) 112897 (2012) 977 N.E.2d 189, 364 Ill.Dec. 700 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7simply affirmed counsel's original answer. The fact remains that no affidavit was timely filed as required by the rule. \u00b6 36 Petitioner also argues that this matter is distinguishable from Brookbank because the supplemental response simply affirmed counsel's filing. This argument also fails. Brookbank clearly holds that a party must provide timely sworn-to affidavits, not counsel, and our supreme court has specifically considered and affirmed this provision. Absent a Rule 183 motion and showing of good cause, a party failing to strictly comply with the rule faces the \"unduly harsh\" consequence of having all responses deemed admitted. \u00b6 37 Because of this harsh consequence, petitioner's unsupported claim that this court may consider the court's error harmless is rejected. Petitioner asserts that some matters are not material facts affecting compliance and some are in contradiction to notices and references filed in its application and attached exhibits. However, as addressed above, failure to comply with Rule 216 will result in a judicial admission that is considered incontrovertible, withdrawing that fact from contention. Accordingly, the requests to admit arenow **709 *198 considered incontrovertible judicial admissions and it is for the trier of fact to consider the effect on the credibility of witnesses at trial and whether petitioner met the due diligence and statutory requirements of the Property Tax Code. \u00b6 38 III. CONCLUSION \u00b6 39 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings. \u00b6 40 Reversed and remanded.

GIBSON, Senior Judge: I. INTRODUCTION This discovery dispute raises the following related issues\u2014 (i) whether or not plaintiff should be required to provide discovery (in the form of responses to defendant's requests for admission and through the production of documents) concerning the amount of the casualty loss sustained by plaintiff-taxpayer to its timber resources as a consequence of a 1979 hurricane; and (ii) whether or not defendant should be precluded from raising a factual dispute relative to said casualty loss amount. These issues are presented to the court by twin motions, now before the court. First, the court has before it plaintiff's motion for a protective order, filed June 3, 1996, in which plaintiff seeks an order protecting it from the disputed discovery and prohibiting defendant from raising any factual dispute concerning the amount of its casualty loss (i.e., the volumes and fair market values of the timber damaged or destroyed by the hurricane). Second, the court also has before it defendant's motion to compel the contested discovery, filed July 11, 1996, wherein defendant requests an order compelling plaintiff to answer its requests for admission and to produce the documents requested in its fourth set of requests for production of documents. Clearly, these two motions simply represent obverse sides of the same fundamental question\u2014is defendant entitled to the requested discovery? Resolution of this question and its related sub-issues will resolve both motions. As detailed below, we find that defendant is entitled to pursue discovery relative to the amount of the casualty loss sustained by plaintiff in 1979. Accordingly, the court denies plaintiff's motion for a protective order and grants defendant's motion to compel discovery.International Paper Co. v.

BACKGROUND International Paper Company is a New York corporation and the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations (collectively \"IP\" or \"plaintiff\") engaged in two primary businesses: (i) growing and managing timber; and (ii) manufacturing paper and other wood products. On February 6, 1990, IP filed a complaint in this court, seeking a refund of federal income taxes, premised on nine substantive grounds or \"issues.\" This discovery dispute relates to one such issue, identified by the parties as \"the Hurricane Frederic Casualty Loss Issue.\" In September 1979, Hurricane Frederic struck the Gulf Coast, allegedly damaging or destroying certain interests in timber owned by plaintiff in Alabama and Mississippi. As a result thereof, IP claimed a casualty loss deduction for the tax year 1978, in accordance with Rev.Rul. 79-426, 1979-2 Cum.Bul. 85 (allowing a casualty loss deduction to be taken in the year preceding the casualty event for losses caused by, inter alia, Hurricane *316 Frederic). According to the complaint, plaintiff allegedly subdivided its timber interests into depletion blocks for federal income tax purposes. IP avers that it sustained approximately $26 million in property damage to its timber, in the alleged affected depletion blocks, from the hurricane. IP further alleges that it erroneously claimed a deduction of roughly $4.5 million; and that the correct deductible amount should have been roughly $24.5 million, i.e., its adjusted basis in the affected depletion blocks. See I.R.C. \u00a7 165; Tres.Reg. \u00a7 1.165-7(b)(1) (limiting taxpayers casualty loss deduction to the adjusted basis in the affected property). In 1988, after an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit and administrative appeal, IP and the IRS jointly executed a Form 870-AD,1 settling plaintiff's tax liabilities for 1972 through 1979 and reflecting an overassessment of $582,200 for 1978. However, the Form 870-AD expressly reserved IP's right to file refund claims with respect to nine issues, including the Hurricane Frederic Casualty Loss Issue. On June 21, 1989, IP filed eight administrative refund claims (one for each of the years 1972-1979) based on the aforementioned nine issues. These claims were subsequently denied in full by the Commissioner on January 10, 1990. Shortly thereafter, as previously noted, IP filed its complaint in this court on February 6, 1990.Discovery in this case was closed on March 1, 1992, by order of the court, dated December 20, 1991. However, in light of this court's decision in Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States, 32 Fed.Cl. 80 (1994) (holding that the single, identifiable property for casualty loss purposes was dependent on the facts and circumstances of any given case), aff'd in part, rev'd in part and remanded, 92 F.3d 1148 (Fed.Cir.1996) (reversing the lower court's determination of the SIP), the parties agreed to seek to reopen discovery on the Hurricane Frederic Casualty Loss Issue. On September 11, 1995, this court ordered that \"[t]he parties may engage in voluntary discovery regarding the Hurricane Casualty Loss Issue ... to the extent that both parties agree that the factual inquiry is reasonable and not unduly burdensome.\" On or about May 24, 1996, the government tendered to plaintiff defendant's fourth set of document requests and first set of requests for admission, seeking the damage assessment plan, tally sheets, and timber salvage records used by IP in quantifying its casualty loss or, at least, an admission by IP that such documents are irretrievably lost. Thereafter, on June 3, 1996, plaintiff filed the instant motion for a protective order. The government then filed its motion to determine the sufficiency of plaintiff's objections to defendant's requests for admission and to compel discovery on July 11, 1996. These twin motions have been fully briefed, and oral argument was heard thereon on July 22, 1996. Accordingly, we now turn to address the subject motions. III. CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES A. Plaintiff IP contends that defendant's requested discovery is unreasonable and unduly burdensome for three reasons. First, plaintiff asserts that defendant has previously judicially admitted the volumes and fair market values of its damaged and destroyed timber. This assertion is premised on plaintiff's interpretation of certain of the government's admissions obtained in response to plaintiff's requests for admission. As such, IP maintains that the quantum of its casualty loss is conclusively established and that, accordingly, further factual development of this issue is irrelevant and impermissible. Second, IP alleges that the volumes and fair market values of the damaged and destroyed timber were established and agreed upon at the administrative level, before the IRS. After an extensive audit, the IRS accepted the amount of the casualty loss, avers plaintiff. Moreover, plaintiff notes,International Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5the IRS and IP jointly executed a Form 870-AD, wherein, contends plaintiff, the IRS allowed *317 it a casualty loss deduction premised on the established volumes and fair market values. Thus, IP asserts that the acceptance by the IRS of the volumes and fair market values constitutes a determination by the Commissioner that is entitled to a presumption of correctness, as a matter of law. Moreover, plaintiff charges that the IRS continued to agree with plaintiff's figures and that defense counsel may not take a position contrary to his client. Finally, plaintiff avers that it has never agreed to provide the disputed discovery and that discovery has been closed in this case for some time. Furthermore, contends plaintiff, discovery was only reopened on a limited, voluntary basis. If the government is allowed to pursue this discovery and to dispute the amount of the casualty loss, IP represents that it will be seriously prejudiced by the time and expense necessary to prepare and present evidence on a factual issue that it regards as settled. In IP's view, the sole issue for trial is\u2014what is the single, identifiable property for purpose of determining the casualty loss and the adjusted basis limitation? Thus, IP prays for a protective order precluding the government from raising other issues at trial. B. Defendant In response, the government counters that it has not judicially admitted the substantive correctness of the volumes and fair market values in question, but only that certain verifiable events occurred at the administrative level. Moreover, observes defendant, at least one of the admissions relates to a method of calculating casualty losses, used prior to the Court of Claims' decision in Westvaco Corp. v. United States, 639 F.2d 700 (Ct.Cl.1980) , that is no longer valid. Defendant concludes on this point by arguing that, to the extent that plaintiff's requests for admission are ambiguous, they must be construed against the drafter, IP. Next, the government contends that any reliance on any so- called agreement at the administrative level is unreasonable. A tax refund suit in this court is a de novo proceeding in which plaintiff bears the burden of proof as to all of the elements of its claim, maintains defendant. Accordingly, the government asserts that plaintiff is required to prove the amount of its casualty loss and that defendant is entitled to discover any information in the possession of IP on this issue. Lastly, defendant argues that IP has agreed to the discovery sought by the government both in a status report and at astatus conference. The government vigorously contends that it needs the information it has sought through discovery in order to evaluate the damage assessment methodology used by IP in quantifying its casualty loss. Accordingly, defendant asks that the court order plaintiff to provide the requested discovery. IV. DISCUSSION In considering the motions now before the court, and the positions of the parties, we are mindful of the fact that a party moving for a protective order (at bar, plaintiff) bears the burden of showing \"good cause\" in support of such motion \"to protect a party or person from ... undue burden or expense.\" RCFC 26(c) . Moreover, we are similarly mindful of the generally broad scope of discovery in this court, within which the \"[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action....\" RCFC 26(b) . However, the court will not allow discovery that is \"unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\" RCFC 26(b)(iii). In addition, discovery will be limited where \"the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought....\" RCFC 26(b)(ii) . With these principles firmly in mind, we now proceed to examine the competing contentions of the parties. A. Defendant's Responses to Plaintiff's Requests for Admission [1] We begin by considering defendant's admissions, secured in response to plaintiff's requests for admission, which plaintiff contends constitute judicial admissions on the *318 part of the government of the volumes and fair market values (FMVs) of the damaged timber. Specifically, IP points to defendant's admission of the following statements: 285. The Internal Revenue Service audited and accepted both the estimates of timber damaged by Hurricane Frederic and the fair market values detailed in Exhibit 23- W[, listing volumes of damaged timber, fair market values per unit, and fair market values for different types of timber in each of IP's depletion blocks]. 286. Both the Internal Revenue Service and International agree that the per unit fair market value of timber damagedInternational Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6or destroyed by Hurricane Frederic was in excess of its appropriate depletion rate. 287. Both the Internal Revenue Service and International agree that taking into account the IRS audit adjustments, International realized the following damage from Hurricane Frederic: [list of dollar values for each depletion block omitted.] Because we disagree with plaintiff's strained interpretation of these admissions, we hold that they do not foreclose further factual development respecting the amount of the casualty loss suffered by IP, even though they may be judicial admissions. [2] [3] A judicial admission is a \"formal act, done in the course of judicial proceedings, which waives or dispenses with the production of evidence, by conceding for purposes of litigation that the proposition of fact alleged by the opponent is true.\" Weyerhaeuser, 32 Fed.Cl. at 118 (quoting Hofer v. Bituminous Casualty Corp., 260 Iowa 81, 148 N.W.2d 485, 486 (1967) ). Furthermore, a judicial admission is \"conclusively binding\" and is, therefore, beyond the power of evidence to controvert. Id. Clearly, the government's admissions made in response to a discovery request are formal acts, done in the course of judicial proceedings, conceding the truth of the propositions laid out above. However, the parties disagree over the content of the propositions. Plaintiff attempts to give these requests for admission a construction broader than their plain and unambiguous terms will admit, contending that they conclusively establish the truth of the volumes and FMVs of damaged timber set forth therein. Each of the three statements admitted by the government to be true speaks of the IRS and not \"defendant,\" the \"government,\" or \"the United States.\" None of the statements purports to affirm the truth or accuracy of the underlying volumes or fair market values. Rather, all that defendant has facially admitted is that the IRS \"audited and accepted\" and \"agrees\" with the figures detailed in the requests for admission. While this fact may or may not be significant, it is not the same thing as an admission that IP's volumes and FMVs are in fact correct. Quite simply, the admitted propositions do not say what IP contends that they say. Request for admission 285, which states that the IRS \"audited and accepted\" IP's figures, obviously relates to what occurred at the audit level before the IRS. And, requests 286 and 287 again relate to a verifiable occurrence at the administrative level, i.e., before the IRS. The fact that these latter twostatements are worded in the present tense cannot change the fact that they expressly address the administrative level through the use of the term \"Internal Revenue Service.\" Moreover, plaintiff drafted two proposed stipulations of fact, never assented to by the government, which unequivocally stated that \"the parties agree\" with the estimates of timber damage put forth by IP. This shows that plaintiff knew full well how to unambiguously elicit an admission of the substantive correctness of the volumes and fair market values of damaged timber. That IP chose not to do so in its requests for admission weighs conspicuously against plaintiff's asserted interpretation of said requests. [4] Furthermore, even if the court were less than certain as to the proper interpretation of these requests for admission, we would be required to construe any ambiguity therein against IP, the drafter of these requests, under the well-established principle of contra proferentum.2 Assuming, arguendo, *319 that plaintiff's requests for admission are unclear on whether they relate solely to the administrative level or whether they establish the substantive correctness of the volumes and FMVs of damaged timber, the requests should be construed against the drafter. See Talley v. United States, 990 F.2d 695, 699 (1st Cir.1993); Ortho Diagnostic Sys. Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073, 1079 (S.D.N.Y.1994). In this light, the court would interpret the admitted propositions as narrowly addressing what transpired at the administrative level, before the IRS. [5] Finally, we observe that plaintiff's proposed construction of the admitted statements is in tension with established precedent. First, as explained in Weyerhaeuser, identification of the single, identifiable property (SIP) is the first step in determining the amount of a casualty loss. 32 Fed.Cl. at 109. Only after the SIP has been identified can the fair market value of the SIP be determined, both immediately before and after the casualty event. IP's attempt to conclusively establish the amount of its loss prior to ascertaining the SIP, which plaintiff concedes is an open issue, is thus somewhat backwards. Apparently, plaintiff seeks to extrapolate from per unit FMVs, multiplying that figure by the number of units determined to have been lost in each SIP, once identified. However, the Court of Claims, in Westvaco Corp. v. United States, 639 F.2d 700 (Ct.Cl.1980), counselled against such an approach. In Westvaco, the court held that, because of its holding that the SIP was the depletion block, \"an aggregation of the value of destroyed units of merchantable timber, together withInternational Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7the value of partial losses resulting from nonfatal injuries to merchantable trees, does not necessarily measure the reduction in fair market value of the property.\" Id. at 707. This was due to the fact that other intangible factors might possibly affect the FMV of the SIP, without affecting the per unit FMV of timber, \"e.g., changes in access to and changes in density, changes in supply and demand, and possible offsetting benefits such as pine release.\"3 Id. For this reason, the court remanded the case to the trial judge to determine \"the difference in fair market value of each of the various affected management districts immediately before and immediately after the respective casualties,\" id. at 721, even though, in that case, \"[t]he parties [had] agree[d] on the volume of timber destroyed, and on the fair market value of the merchantable units represented by the destroyed timber,\" id. at 703, just as IP contends has been done in this case. Not only does the foregoing analysis persuade the court that it is highly unlikely that the parties intended the requested admissions to bear the meaning that plaintiff would ascribe to them, even if the admissions related to the substantive correctness of the volumes and FMVs, said admissions would not necessarily correspond to the amount of the casualty loss sustained by IP. Accordingly, even if plaintiff was correct concerning the interpretation of the requested admissions, the amount of the casualty loss ( i.e., the reduction in FMV) would not be conclusively established. For all of the foregoing reasons, then, the court holds that the requested admissions relate exclusively and only to what evolved at the administrative level, before the IRS, and not to the underlying accuracy of the volumes and FMVs delineated therein. Therefore, we turn next to examine the significance of the events that occurred before the IRS. B. Actions of the IRS Re: the Volumes and FMVs of IP's Damaged and Destroyed Timber 1. Audit & Determination of the Commissioner [6] [7] Plaintiff avers that the IRS accepted IP's volumes and FMVs of damaged timber after an extensive audit. As such, contends plaintiff, the Commissioner's determination on this factual issue is entitled to a *320 presumption of correctness. The court cannot agree with plaintiff's argument. While it is certainly true that the determination of the Commissioner is entitled to a presumption of correctness, that presumption attaches only to the determination of the tax liability ( i.e., the assessment), giving rise to the taxpayer'sburden of proving ( i.e., producing evidence sufficient to show) that it is entitled to a refund of taxes paid. Moreover, while \"[t]his presumption may appear to give evidential weight to the Service's action, ... this is not the case.\" IRS Practice and Procedure \u00b6 1.05[2][c]. \"No weight is given to findings of fact that the IRS may have made in its administrative processing of the case.\" Id. As stated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in Pierson v. United States, 428 F.Supp. 384, 390 (D.Del.1977) , \"[t]he reasons for the Commissioner's determination are not relevant for the Court does not review those reasons.\" This precept was later echoed by the district court for the Eastern District of Michigan, in Garity v. United States, 88,005-006 (E.D.Mich.1980) , in Estate of Akin v. United States, 31 Fed.Cl. 89, 97 (1994), wherein the court explained that the \"conclusions and reasoning of IRS agents are irrelevant to the validity of the assessment....\" We concur in the view that the factual findings, if any, underlying the Commissioner's determination of tax liability are irrelevant and entitled to no evidentiary weight. This position is, of course, fully consistent with the de novo nature of tax refund proceedings in the Court of Federal Claims (as well as in the district courts), in which the taxpayer bears the full burden of proof (i.e., both the burden of production and of persuasion). See Part IV.C, infra. In an analogous case, Sara Lee Corp. v. United States, 29 Fed.Cl. 330 (1993), the taxpayer argued that a revenue agent's report embodied an agreement by the IRS that certain favorable adjustments were not at issue. The court held as follows: Plaintiff completely ignores the fact that by initiating this lawsuit it placed \"at issue\" all of the 170 favorable adjustments underlying its refund claim ... Thus, contrary to plaintiff's belief, defendant is not required to provide evidence that the agreed adjustments are \"in issue.\" Id. at 337 (citations omitted). Just as a plaintiff, by litigating his claim, places at issue all favorable adjustments underlying his refund claim, so too does he place at issue any factual determination made by the IRS underlying the determination of his tax liability. Therefore, by bringing this action, IP has placed the amount of its casualty loss ( i.e., the volumes and FMVs of timber damaged or destroyed) at issue.International Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8Finally, we note that, even if the factual determinations of the IRS were entitled to a presumption of correctness, such a presumption would surely be rebuttable. Thus, defendant would be entitled to adduce evidence to rebut said presumption. It is precisely this type of evidence that the government is seeking, through discovery, in the case at bar. Accordingly, because the factual findings of the IRS carry no weight in this court, we hold that the IRS's audit and alleged acceptance of IP's volumes and FMVs of damaged timber did not and could not conclusively settled that factual issue in this tax refund action. However, under certain circumstances, the IRS can conclusively settle issues with taxpayers at the administrative level. One potential means of doing so is the execution of a Form 870-AD. 2. Form 870-AD [8] IP maintains that the execution of a Form 870-AD by the government precludes defendant from disputing the volumes and FMVs of damaged timber that plaintiff asserts were agreed to. According to plaintiff, the overassessment reflected for the 1978 tax year on the Form 870-AD was derived using the volumes and FMVs that it claims may not now be disputed. On its face, however, the Form 870- AD says nothing about timber volumes or FMVs. Rather, it merely states that IP is entitled to a specific dollar amount ($582,200) for the 1978 tax year. Moreover, IP's right to file a refund claim for the Hurricane Frederic Casualty Loss Issue is expressly reserved by the terms of the agreement. Lastly, there is no evidence in the record (as opposed to counsel's unsupported *321 assertion) to support the averment that the specific dollar amount corresponding to the overassessment for 1978 was arrived at using the figures advanced by plaintiff. [9] Furthermore, even assuming that said overassessment was in fact premised on IP's figures, the Form 870-AD does not preclude further factual development on the amount of plaintiff's casualty loss. Indeed, as noted above, this issue is expressly left open by the agreement, and, in any event, the parties to a settlement agreement \"are bound to the terms agreed upon and not to the premises underlying their agreement.\" Pack v. United States, 992 F.2d 955, 959-60 (9th Cir.1993) (citing Zaentz v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 753, 761, 1988 WL 34876 (1988) , and discussing a closing agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS). In other words, \"general contract law principles govern tax case settlements,\" Treaty Pines Invs. Partnership v. Commissioner, 967 F.2d 206, 211 (5th Cir.1992) , and nothing in the language of the Form 870-AD prohibits defendant from contesting (or dispenses with plaintiff's burden of proof respecting) the amount of IP's casualty loss, now that IP has chosen to bring this tax refund action. Therefore, we hold that the Form 870-AD executed by the parties does not conclusively establish the volumes and FMVs of timber damaged by Hurricane Frederic. Thus, further factual development of the amount of the alleged casualty loss by defendant is appropriate.4 3. Current \"Agreement\" by the IRS with IP's Volumes and FMVs of Damaged Timber [10] Relying on the admission by defendant that the IRS \"agree[s]\" that IP realized certain damage from Hurricane Frederic, plaintiff argues that defense counsel may not now take a position contrary to that of his client, the IRS. Evidently, plaintiff construes the use of the present tense to refer to an agreement by the IRS concurrent with this litigation before the court and after the completion of all administrative proceedings before the IRS. To the extent that plaintiff's interpretation is correct, however, we must reject this line of argument. First of all, the IRS is not the defendant in this tax refund case; the United States is. Moreover, after a case leaves the administrative level and a tax refund case is filed in the Court of Federal Claims, the IRS no longer has primary responsibility over that case. Rather, the Department of Justice bears the responsibility for speaking on behalf of the government and conducting the proceedings in this court. See United States Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 138, 109 S.Ct. 2841, 2844-45, 106 L.Ed.2d 112 (1989) . Put another way, it is beyond the scope of the IRS's authority to settle unilaterally a factual issue in a case pending in this court, after administrative proceedings are complete and the case has been referred to the Department of Justice. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7122(a) (1994).5 See 1132, 1139 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (\"Once a tax matter is referred to the Department of Justice, only the Attorney General or a person to whom authority has been delegated may settle the matter.\"). Cf. Sanders v. Commissioner, 225 F.2d 629, 633 (10th Cir.1955) (holding that only Treasury officials could compromise a tax case prior to *322 a reference of the matter to the Department of Justice). Thus, we regard a post-administrative \"agreement\" by the IRS with IP's volumes and FMVs the same way we would an identical \"agreement\" by the Department of Veteran'sInternational Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9Affairs, for example. Accordingly, any current agreement or agreement in 1992, when plaintiff's requests for admission were admitted by defendant, is nonbinding at a minimum and possibly wholly irrelevant. Moreover, the admitted statement is noticably silent on several points: who at the IRS \"agree[d]\"; on what grounds, if any, was that person authorized to do so; and was the agreement memorialized in writing, or was it merely, an informal, oral agreement? All this, of course, supports the view that the requests for admission refer to the events at the administrative level, which we have already determined do not conclusively bind defendant. C. Tax Refund Litigation in the Court of Federal Claims [11] [12] It is well-settled that a tax refund suit in the Court of Federal Claims \"is a de novo proceeding, in which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof\" with respect to each and every element of its claim. Sara Lee, 29 Fed.Cl. at 334. See also Helvering v. Taylor, 293 U.S. 507, 514, 55 S.Ct. 287, 290, 79 L.Ed. 623 (1935) (burden of proof); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933) (burden of proof); Young & Rubicam, Inc. v. United States, 410 F.2d 1233, 1238 (Ct.Cl.1969) (burden of proof); George E. Warren Corp. v. United States, 141 F.Supp. 935, 940 (Ct.Cl.1956) (\"The tax laws contemplate a trial de novo \"); L.W. Hardy Co. v. United States, 1 Cl.Ct. 465, 470 (1982) ( \"taxpayer has the burden of proof\"). Plaintiff's burden is that of production as well as persuasion. Sara Lee, 29 Fed.Cl. at 334. \"This means that the taxpayer must come forward with enough evidence to support a finding contrary to the Commissioner's determination ... Even after satisfying this burden, the taxpayer must still carry the ultimate burden of proof.\" Danville Plywood Corp. v. United States, 899 F.2d 3, 7-8 (Fed.Cir.1990) (citations omitted). In other words, plaintiff must prove not only that the Commissioner's determination was erroneous but also the precise dollar amount of the refund to which it is entitled. United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 440, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3025, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976) ; Eli Lilly & Co. v. United States, 372 F.2d 990, 997 (Ct.Cl.1967) ; Missouri Pac. R.R. v. United States, 338 F.2d 668, 671 (Ct.Cl.1964). [13] [14] Given the foregoing, it is uncontrovertible that plaintiff must adduce sufficient evidence at trial to carry its burden of proving the amount of its casualty loss (as well as the resultant deduction). This means that IP must prove the diminution in the FMV of its damaged timber property occasioned by Hurricane Frederic in 1979, as well as its adjusted basis in the damaged property.Moreover, as explained above, plaintiff may rely neither on administrative findings nor on defendant's admissions to conclusively establish the quantum of its casualty loss. This is a trial de novo, in which plaintiff is expected to produce evidence supporting a refund, \" not a quasi appellate review of an administrative determination.\" Hearst Corp. v. United States, 28 Fed.Cl. 202, 230 (1993) (emphasis added). \"When a suit is brought for the recovery of taxes, the taxpayer must affirmatively show that he has overpaid his taxes since 'an overpayment must appear before refund is authorized.' \" Missouri Pac., 338 F.2d at 671 (quoting Lewis v. Reynolds, 284 U.S. 281, 283, 52 S.Ct. 145, 146, 76 L.Ed. 293 (1932) ). D. Reasonableness of Defendant's Discovery Requests [15] [16] As noted previously, discovery in this case had been closed until the court ordered, on September 11, 1995, that \"[t]he parties may engage in voluntary discovery regarding the Hurricane Casualty Loss Issue ... to the extent that both parties agree that the factual inquiry is reasonable and not unduly burdensome.\" At bar, IP alleges that the factual inquiry defendant seeks to pursue through discovery is unreasonable and unduly burdensome. However, the only prejudice that plaintiff alleges it will suffer if the government is permitted to obtain the contested discovery is the expense and time of litigation *323 associated with proving every element of its tax refund claim. Unfortunately, it is a simple fact of life that litigation can be expensive and time- consuming, especially when attempting to prove a claim of substantial dollar value in a de novo proceeding. Since this is precisely what it should have been prepared to do all along, the \"prejudice\" to plaintiff does not amount to an undue burden, especially \"taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\" RCFC 26(b)(ii) . Conversely, we find on this record that defendant's requested discovery is not unreasonable, given the issues at bar. Counsel for IP has indicated that it intends to prove the amount of its casualty loss using a casualty loss damage report (supplemented by testimony) prepared by IP using a random sample methodology. The government asserts that it needs the requested discovery so that it may test the accuracy and validity of the methodology used by IP to determine its casualty loss and, if necessary, rebut plaintiff's report and witnesses. Such a request is not unreasonable given that plaintiff bears the burden of proving the quantum of its casualty loss, for which it seeks a tax deduction.International Paper Co. v. U.S., 36 Fed.Cl. 313 (1996) 78 A.F.T.R.2d 96-6075, 96-2 USTC P 50,686 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10Moreover, it appears that the government's latest discovery requests were generated as a result of depositions taken of certain IP employees ( e.g., deposition of Arthur Verdel, May 2, 1996). In addition, defendant requires the documents sought through discovery in order to gain a complete understanding of the damage report already provided voluntarily by IP to the government. Finally, both parties agreed that this court's September 1, 1994 decision in Weyerhaeuser, supra, merited a reopening of discovery. The only dispute now is the extent of that reopening. Plaintiff concedes that identification of the SIP is an appropriate area for discovery. Given that the identification of the SIP is the analytical first step in determining the quantum of a casualty loss, see Weyerhaeuser, 32 Fed.Cl. at 109, the ultimate issue of quantifying the diminution in FMV of each SIP is necessarily open if the SIP is in contention. Furthermore, on August 2, 1996, the Federal Circuit decided the appeal in Weyerhaeuser, wherein the court framed the issue as the \"determination of what measure of Weyerhaeuser's property is the appropriate single identifiable property.\" Weyerhaeuser, 92 F.3d at 1150 (emphasis added). In this connection the Federal Circuit, in Weyerhaeuser, held that \"[t]he determination of the single identifiable property as set forth in Westvaco controls this case. \" Id. at 1151 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the Federal Circuit embraced the following holding in Westvaco: We hold that the single, identifiable property damaged or destroyed in the case of this plaintiff was all of the standing timber in the area ofthe individual district [i.e., depletion block] directly affected by each casualty. Westvaco, 639 F.2d at 720 (emphasis added), quoted in Weyerhaeuser, 92 F.3d at 1151. Thus, the court of appeals found that the operative facts established Weyerhaeuser's SIP, like Westvaco's, as the depletion block. That decision obviously sheds new light on the issues in the instant case. Therefore, we do not regard defendant's requested discovery as untimely. V. CONCLUSION Plaintiff bears the burden of showing \"good cause\" in support of the entry of a protective order. RCFC 26(c). For all of the foregoing reasons, the court finds that IP has failed to establish good cause in support of its motion. Thus, plaintiff's motion for a protective order is hereby DENIED. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, defendant's motion to compel discovery is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall respond to ( i.e., admit or deny) defendant's requests for admission and shall produce the documents identified in defendant's fourth request for the production of documents forthwith. IT IS SO ORDERED.

Because the court found that her employment was not terminated in violation of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief, and because Title VII did not then authorize any other form of relief, the court dismissed her complaint. While her appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) became law, \u00a7 102 of which includes provisions that create a right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination violative of Title VII (hereinafter \u00a7 102(a)), and authorize any party to demand a jury trial if such damages are claimed (hereinafter \u00a7 102(c)). In affirming, the Court of Appeals rejected Landgraf's argument that her case should be remanded for a jury trial on damages pursuant to \u00a7 102. Held: Section 102 does not apply to a Title VII case that was pending on appeal when the 1991 Act was enacted. Pp. 1489- 1508. (a) Since the President vetoed a 1990 version of the Act on the ground, among others, of perceived unfairness in the bill's elaborate retroactivity provision, it is likely that the omission of comparable language in the 1991 Act was not congressional oversight or unawareness, but was a compromise that made the Act possible. That omission is not dispositive here because it does not establish precisely where the compromise was struck. For example, a decision to reach only cases still pending, and not those already finally decided, might explain Congress' failure to provide in the 1991 Act, as it had in the 1990 bill, that certain sections would apply to proceedings pending on specified preenactment dates. Pp. 1489-1493. (b) The text of the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expression of congressional intent as to whether \u00a7 102 applies to cases arising before the Act's passage. The provisions on which Landgraf relies for such an expression\u2014 \u00a7 402(a), which states that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment,\" and \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for prospective application in limited contexts \u2014cannot bear the heavy *245 weight she would place upon them by negative inference: Her statutory argument would require the Court to assume that Congress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressedLandgraf v.

Moreover, the relevant legislative history reveals little to suggest that Members of Congress believed that an agreement had been tacitly reached on the controversial retroactivity issue or that Congress understood or intended the interplay of the foregoing sections to have the decisive effect Landgraf assigns them. Instead, the history conveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagree about whether and to what extent the Act would apply to preenactment conduct. Pp. 1493-1496. (c) In order to resolve the question left open by the 1991 Act, this Court must focus on the apparent tension between two seemingly contradictory canons for interpreting statutes that do not specify their temporal reach: the rule that a court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, see Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476, and the axiom that statutory retroactivity is not favored, see Bowen v. **1487 Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 208, 109 S.Ct. 468, 471, 102 L.Ed.2d 493. Pp. 1496-1497. (d) The presumption against statutory retroactivity is founded upon elementary considerations of fairness dictating that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly. It is deeply rooted in this Court's jurisprudence and finds expression in several constitutional provisions, including, in the criminal context, the Ex Post Facto Clause. In the civil context, prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule unless Congress has made clear its intent to disrupt settled expectations. Pp. 1497-1501. (e) Thus, when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events giving rise to the suit, a court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. Where the statute in question unambiguously applies to preenactment conduct, there is no conflict between the antiretroactivity presumption and the principle that a court should apply the law in effect at the time of decision. Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of a new statute to cases arising before its enactment is unquestionably proper in many situations. However, where the new statute would have a genuinely retroactive effect\u2014i.e., where it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed\u2014the traditional presumption teaches that the statute does not govern absentclear congressional intent favoring such a result. Bradley did not displace the traditional presumption. Pp. 1501-1505. *246 f) Application of the foregoing principles demonstrates that, absent guiding instructions from Congress, \u00a7 102 is not the type of provision that should govern cases arising before its enactment, but is instead subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Section 102(b)(1), which authorizes punitive damages in certain circumstances, is clearly subject to the presumption, since the very labels given \"punitive\" or \"exemplary\" damages, as well as the rationales supporting them, demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions, and therefore would raise a serious question under the Ex Post Facto Clause if retroactively imposed. While the \u00a7 102(a)(1) provision authorizing compensatory damages is not so easily classified, it is also subject to the presumption, since it confers a new right to monetary relief on persons like Landgraf, who were victims of a hostile work environment but were not constructively discharged, and substantially increases the liability of their employers for the harms they caused, and thus would operate \"retrospectively\" if applied to preenactment conduct. Although a jury trial right is ordinarily a procedural change of the sort that would govern in trials conducted after its effective date regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred, the jury trial option set out in \u00a7 102(c)(1) must fall with the attached damages provisions because \u00a7 102(c) makes a jury trial available only \"[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages.\" Pp. 1505-1508. 968 F.2d 427 (CA5 1992) , affirmed.

[1] The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) creates a right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for certain violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1977A(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(a) (1988 ed., Supp. IV), as added by \u00a7 102 of the 1991 Act, Pub.L. 102- 166, 105 Stat. 1072. The Act further provides that any party may demand a trial by jury if such damages are sought.1 We granted certiorari to decide whether these provisions apply to a Title VII case that was pending on appeal when the statute was enacted. We hold that they do not. I From September 4, 1984, through January 17, 1986, petitioner Barbara Landgraf was employed in the USI Film *248 Products (USI) plant in Tyler, Texas. She worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift operating a machine that produced plastic bags. A fellow employee named John Williams repeatedly harassed her with inappropriate remarks and physical contact. Petitioner's complaints to her immediate supervisor brought her no relief, but when she reported the incidents to the personnel manager, he conducted an investigation, reprimanded Williams, and transferred him to another department. Four days later petitioner quit her job. Petitioner filed a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission). The Commission determined that petitioner had likely been the victim of sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., but concluded that her employer had adequately remedied the violation. Accordingly, the Commission dismissed the charge and issued a notice of right to sue. On July 21, 1989, petitioner commenced this action against USI, its corporate owner, and that company's successor in interest.2 After a bench trial, the District Court found that Williams had sexually harassed petitioner causing her to suffer mental anguish. However, the court concluded that she had not been constructively discharged. The court said:\"Although the harassment was serious enough to establish that a hostile work environment existed for Landgraf, it was not so severe that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. This is particularly true in light of the fact that at the time Landgraf resigned from her job, USI had taken steps ... to eliminate the hostile working environment arising from the sexual harassment. Landgraf voluntarily resigned *249 from her employment with USI for reasons unrelated to the sexual harassment in question.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. B-3-4. Because the court found that petitioner's employment was not terminated in violation of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief, and because Title VII did not then authorize any other form of relief, the court dismissed her complaint. On November 21, 1991, while petitioner's appeal was pending, the President signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that her case should be remanded for a jury trial on damages pursuant to the 1991 Act. Its decision not to remand rested on the premise that \"a court must 'apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.' Bradley [ v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) ].\" 968 F.2d 427, 432 (CA5 1992). Commenting **1489 first on the provision for a jury trial in \u00a7 102(c), the court stated that requiring the defendant \"to retry this case because of a statutory change enacted after the trial was completed would be an injustice and a waste of judicial resources. We apply procedural rules to pending cases, but we do not invalidate procedures followed before the new rule was adopted.\" Id.,, at 432-433. The court then characterized the provision for compensatory and punitive damages in \u00a7 102 as \"a seachange in employer liability for Title VII violations\" and concluded that it would be unjust to apply this kind of additional and unforeseeable obligation to conduct occurring before the effective date of the Act. Id., at 433. Finding no clear error in the District Court's factual findings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for respondents. We granted certiorari and set the case for argument with Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994). Our order limited argument to the question whether \u00a7 102 of the 1991 *250 Act applies to cases pending when it became law. 507 U.S. 908, 113 S.Ct. 1250, 122 L.Ed.2d 649 (1993). Accordingly, for purposes of our decision, we assume that the District Court and the Court of Appeals properly applied the law in effect at the time ofLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters.

We therefore assume that petitioner was the victim of sexual harassment violative of Title VII, but that the law did not then authorize any recovery of damages even though she was injured. We also assume, arguendo, that if the same conduct were to occur today, petitioner would be entitled to a jury trial and that the jury might find that she was constructively discharged, or that her mental anguish or other injuries would support an award of damages against her former employer. Thus, the controlling question is whether the Court of Appeals should have applied the law in effect at the time the discriminatory conduct occurred, or at the time of its decision in July 1992. II Petitioner's primary submission is that the text of the 1991 Act requires that it be applied to cases pending on its enactment. Her argument, if accepted, would make the entire Act (with two narrow exceptions) applicable to conduct that occurred, and to cases that were filed, before the Act's effective date. Although only \u00a7 102 is at issue in this case, we preface our analysis with a brief description of the scope of the 1991 Act. The 1991 Act is in large part a response to a series of decisions of this Court interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1964. Section 3(4), 105 Stat. 1071, note following 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, expressly identifies as one of the Act's purposes \"to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\" That section, as well as a specific finding in \u00a7 2(2), identifies *251 Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 1989), as a decision that gave rise to special concerns.3 Section 105 of the Act, entitled \"Burden of Proof in Disparate Impact Cases,\" is a direct response to Wards Cove. Other sections of the Act were obviously drafted with \"recent decisions of the Supreme Court\" in mind. Thus, \u00a7 101 (which is at issue in Rivers, 511 U.S. 298, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994)) amended the 1866 Civil Rights Act's prohibition of racial discrimination in the \"mak[ing] and enforce[ment] [of] contracts,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1988 ed., Supp. IV) , in response to Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989); \u00a7 107 responds to **1490 Price Waterhouse v.

Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989) , by prohibiting certain challenges to employment practices implementing consent decrees; \u00a7 109 responds to EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991), by redefining the term \"employee\" as used in Title VII to include certain United States citizens working in foreign countries for United States employers; \u00a7 112 responds to Lorance v. AT & T Technologies, Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 109 S.Ct. 2261, 104 L.Ed.2d 961 (1989), by expanding employees' rights to challenge discriminatory seniority systems; \u00a7 113 responds to West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991) , by providing that an award of attorney's fees may include expert fees; and \u00a7 114 responds to Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986), by allowing interest on judgments against the United States. A number of important provisions in the Act, however, were not responses to Supreme Court decisions. For example, \u00a7 106 enacts a new prohibition against adjusting test *252 scores \"on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\"; \u00a7 117 extends the coverage of Title VII to include the House of Representatives and certain employees of the Legislative Branch; and \u00a7\u00a7 301-325 establish special procedures to protect Senate employees from discrimination. Among the provisions that did not directly respond to any Supreme Court decision is the one at issue in this case, \u00a7 102. Entitled \"Damages in Cases of Intentional Discrimination,\" \u00a7 102 provides in relevant part: \"(a) Right of Recovery.\u2014 \"(1) Civil Rights.\u2014In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5 ) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) prohibited under section 703, 704, or 717 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2 or 2000e-3), and provided that the complaining party cannot recover under section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981 ), the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages ... in addition to any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, from the respondent. . . . . .Landgraf v.

See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418-422, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2372-2374, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). However, the new compensatory damages provision of the 1991 Act is \"in addition to,\" and does not replace or duplicate, the backpay remedy allowed under prior law. Indeed, to prevent double recovery, the 1991 Act provides that compensatory damages \"shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, or any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" \u00a7 102(b)(2). Section 102 significantly expands the monetary relief potentially available to plaintiffs who would have been entitled to backpay under prior law. Before 1991, for example, monetary relief for a discriminatorily discharged employee generally included \"only an amount equal to the wages the employee would have earned from the date of discharge to the date of reinstatement, along with lost fringe benefits such as vacation pay and pension benefits.\" United States v. Burke, 504 U.S. 229, 239, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992). Under \u00a7 102, however, a Title VII plaintiff who wins a backpay award may also seek compensatory damages for \"future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses.\" \u00a7 102(b)(3). In addition, *254 when it is shown that the employer acted \"with malice or with reckless indifference to the [plaintiff's] federally protected rights,\" \u00a7 102(b)(1), a plaintiff may recover punitive damages.6 Section 102 also allows monetary relief for some forms of workplace discrimination that would not previously have justified any relief under Title VII. As this case illustrates, even if unlawful discrimination was proved, under prior law a Title VII plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unless the discrimination was also found to have some concrete effect on the plaintiff's employment status, such as a denied promotion, a differential in compensation, or termination.See Burke, 504 U.S., at 240, 112 S.Ct., at 1873. (\"[T]he circumscribed remedies available under Title VII [before the 1991 Act] stand in marked contrast not only to those available under traditional tort law, but under other federal antidiscrimination statutes, as well\"). Section 102, however, allows a plaintiff to recover in circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1),7 even though the discrimination did not involve a discharge or a loss of pay. In short, to further Title VII's \"central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination,\" Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U.S., at 421, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, \u00a7 102 of the *255 1991 Act effects a major expansion in the relief available to victims of employment discrimination. In 1990, a comprehensive civil rights bill passed both Houses of Congress. Although similar to the 1991 Act in many other respects, the 1990 bill differed in that it contained language expressly calling for application of many of its provisions, including the section providing for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination, to cases arising before its (expected) enactment. **1492 8 The President vetoed *256 the 1990 legislation, however, citing the bill's \"unfair retroactivity rules\" as one reason for his disapproval.9 Congress narrowly failed to override the veto. See 136 Cong.Rec. S16589 (Oct. 24, 1990) (66 to 34 Senate vote in favor of override). The absence of comparable language in the 1991 Act cannot realistically be attributed to oversight or to unawareness of the retroactivity issue. Rather, it seems likely that one of the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991 version was an agreement not to include the kind of explicit retroactivity command found in the 1990 bill. The omission of the elaborate retroactivity provision of the 1990 bill\u2014which was by no means the only source of political controversy over that legislation\u2014is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the compromise was struck in the 1991 Act. The Legislature might, for example, have settled in 1991 on a less expansive form of retroactivity that, unlike the 1990 bill, did not reach cases already finally decided. See n. 8, supra. A decision to reach only cases still pending might explain Congress' failure to provide in the *257 1991 Act, as it had in 1990, that certain sections would apply to proceedings pending on specific preenactment dates. Our first question, then, is whether the statutory text on whichLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9petitioner relies manifests an intent that the 1991 Act should be applied to cases that arose and went to trial before its enactment. **1493 III Petitioner's textual argument relies on three provisions of 1991 Act: \u00a7\u00a7 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c). Section 402(a), the only provision of the Act that speaks directly to the question before us, states: \"Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon enactment.\" That language does not, by itself, resolve the question before us. A statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.10 *258 Petitioner does not argue otherwise. Rather, she contends that the introductory clause of \u00a7 402(a) would be superfluous unless it refers to \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for prospective application in limited contexts. The parties agree that \u00a7 402(b) was intended to exempt a single disparate impact lawsuit against the Wards Cove Packing Company. Section 402(b) provides: \"(b) CERTAIN DISPARATE IMPACT CASES. \u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, nothing in this Act shall apply to any disparate impact case for which a complaint was filed before March 1, 1975, and for which an initial decision was rendered after October 30, 1983.\" Section 109(c), part of the section extending Title VII to overseas employers, states: \"(c) APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS. \u2014The amendments made by this section shall not apply with respect to conduct occurring before the date of the enactment of this Act.\"According to petitioner, these two subsections are the \"other provisions\" contemplated in the first clause of \u00a7 402(a), and together create a strong negative inference that all sections of the Act not specifically declared prospective apply to pending cases that arose before November 21, 1991. Before addressing the particulars of petitioner's argument, we observe that she places extraordinary weight on two comparatively minor and narrow provisions in a long and complex statute. Applying the entire Act to cases arising from preenactment conduct would have important consequences, including the possibility that trials completed before its enactment *259 would need to be retried and the possibility that employers would be liable for punitive damages for conduct antedating the Act's enactment. Purely prospective application, on the other hand, would prolong the life of a remedial scheme, and of judicial constructions of civil rights statutes, that Congress obviously found wanting. Given the high stakes of the retroactivity question, the broad coverage of the statute, and the prominent and specific retroactivity provisions in the 1990 bill, it would be surprising for Congress to have chosen to resolve that question through negative inferences **1494 drawn from two provisions of quite limited effect. Petitioner, however, invokes the canon that a court should give effect to every provision of a statute and thus avoid redundancy among different provisions. See, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U.S. 825, 837, and n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2189, and n. 11, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) . Unless the word \"otherwise\" to either \u00a7 402(b) or \u00a7 109(c), she contends, the first five words in \u00a7 402(a) are entirely superfluous. Moreover, relying on the canon \" [e]xpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\" see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993) , petitioner argues that because Congress provided specifically for prospectivity in two places (\u00a7\u00a7 109(c) and 402(b)), we should infer that it intended the opposite for the remainder of the statute. Petitioner emphasizes that \u00a7 402(a) begins: \"Except as otherwise specifically provided.\" A scan of the statute for other \"specific provisions\" concerning effective dates reveals that \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c) are the most likely candidates. Since those provisions decree prospectivity, and since \u00a7 402(a) tells us that the specific provisions are exceptions, \u00a7 402(b) should be considered as prescribing a general rule of retroactivity. Petitioner's argument has some force, but weLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10find it most unlikely that Congress intended the introductory clause to carry the critically important meaning petitioner assigns it. Had Congress wished \u00a7 402(a) to have such a determinatemeaning, *260 it surely would have used language comparable to its reference to the predecessor Title VII damages provisions in the 1990 legislation: that the new provisions \"shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment of this Act.\" S. 2104, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 15(a)(4) (1990). It is entirely possible that Congress inserted the \"otherwise specifically provided\" language not because it understood the \"takes effect\" clause to establish a rule of retroactivity to which only two \"other specific provisions\" would be exceptions, but instead to assure that any specific timing provisions in the Act would prevail over the general \"take effect on enactment\" command. The drafters of a complicated piece of legislation containing more than 50 separate sections may well have inserted the \"except as otherwise provided\" language merely to avoid the risk of an inadvertent conflict in the statute.11 If the introductory clause of \u00a7 402(a) was intended to refer specifically to \u00a7\u00a7 402(b), 109(c), or both, it is difficult to understand why the drafters chose the word \"otherwise\" rather than either or both of the appropriate section numbers. We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that both \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c) merely duplicate the \"take effect upon enactment\" command of \u00a7 402(a) unless all other provisions, including the damages provisions of \u00a7 102, apply to pending cases. That argument depends on the assumption that all those other provisions must be treated uniformly for purposes of their application to pending cases based on preenactment conduct. That thesis, however, is by no *261 means an inevitable one. It is entirely possible\u2014indeed, highly probable\u2014that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of the 1990 legislation, Congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolved by the courts. Our precedents on retroactivity left doubts about what default rule would apply in the absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisions might apply to cases **1495 arising before enactment while others might not.12 Compare Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988), with Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) . See also Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 105 S.Ct. 1555, 84 L.Ed.2d 572 (1985). The only matters Congress did not leave to the courts were set out with specificity in \u00a7\u00a7 109(c) and 402(b). Congressionaldoubt concerning judicial retroactivity doctrine, coupled with the likelihood that the routine \"take effect upon enactment\" language would require courts to fall back upon that doctrine, provide a plausible explanation for both \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c) that makes neither provision redundant. Turning to the text of \u00a7 402(b), it seems unlikely that the introductory phrase (\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act\") was meant to refer to the immediately preceding subsection. Since petitioner does not contend that any other provision speaks to the general effective date issue, the logic of her argument requires us to interpret that phrase to mean nothing more than \"Notwithstanding \u00a7 402(a).\" Petitioner's textual argument assumes that the indefinite word \"otherwise\" in \u00a7 402(a) to identify two *262 specific subsections and the even more indefinite term \"any other provision\" in \u00a7 402(b) to 402(b)'s next-door neighbor\u2014\u00a7 402(a). Here again, petitioner's statutory argument would require us to assume that Congress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressed message concerning the Act's effect on pending cases. The relevant legislative history of the 1991 Act reinforces our conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) cannot bear the weight petitioner places upon them. The 1991 bill as originally introduced in the House contained explicit retroactivity provisions similar to those found in the 1990 bill.13 However, the Senate substitute that was agreed upon omitted those explicit retroactivity provisions.14 The legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.15 The history reveals no evidence that Members *263 believed that an agreement had been tacitly struck on the controversial retroactivity **1496 issue, and little to suggest that Congress understood or intended the interplay of \u00a7\u00a7 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c) to have the decisive effect petitioner assigns them. Instead, the history of the 1991 Act conveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagree about whether and to what extent the Act would apply to preenactment conduct. Although the passage of the 1990 bill may indicate that a majority of the 1991 Congress also favored retroactive application, even the will of the majority does not become law unless it follows the path charted in Article I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2, of the Constitution . See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 946- 951, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 2781-2784, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983). InLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11the absence of the kind of unambiguous directive found in \u00a7 15 of the 1990 bill, we must look elsewhere for guidance on whether \u00a7 102 applies to this case. IV It is not uncommon to find \"apparent tension\" between different canons of statutory construction. As Professor Llewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional canons have equal opposites.16 In order to resolve the question left open by the 1991 Act, federal courts have labored to *264 reconcile two seemingly contradictory statements found in our decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes in the law. Each statement is framed as a generally applicable rule for interpreting statutes that do not specify their temporal reach. The first is the rule that \"a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,\" Bradley, 416 U.S., at 711, 94 S.Ct., at 2016. The second is the axiom that \"[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law,\" and its interpretive corollary that \"congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\" Bowen, 488 U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471. We have previously noted the \"apparent tension\" between those expressions. See Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 1577, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990) ; see also Bennett, 470 U.S., at 639-640, 105 S.Ct., at 1560. We found it unnecessary in Kaiser to resolve that seeming conflict \"because under either view, where the congressional intent is clear, it governs,\" and the prejudgment interest statute at issue in that case evinced \"clear congressional intent\" that it was \"not applicable to judgments entered before its effective date.\" 494 U.S., at 837- 838, 110 S.Ct., at 1577. In the case before us today, however, we have concluded that the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expression of intent on \u00a7 102's application to cases arising before the Act's enactment. We must, therefore, focus on the apparent tension between the rules we have espoused for handling similar problems in the absence of an instruction from Congress. We begin by noting that there is no tension between the holdings in Bradley and Bowen, both of which were unanimous decisions. Relying on another unanimous decision \u2014Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969) \u2014we held in Bradley that a statute authorizing the award of attorney's fees to successfulcivil rights plaintiffs applied in a case that was pending on appeal at the time the statute was enacted. Bowen held that the Department of Health and Human Services lacked statutory authority to *265 promulgate a rule requiring private hospitals to refund Medicare payments for services rendered before promulgation of the **1497 rule. Our opinion in Bowen did not purport to overrule Bradley or to limit its reach. In this light, we turn to the \"apparent tension\" between the two canons mindful of another canon of unquestionable vitality, the \"maxim not to be disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821). A [2] As Justice SCALIA has demonstrated, the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.17 Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.18 For that reason, the \"principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.\" Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 855, 110 S.Ct., at 1586 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In *266 a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial and artistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions. [3] [4] [5] [6] It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity principle finds expression in several provisions of our Constitution. The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation.19 Article I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, prohibits States from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws \"impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\" The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for a \"public use\" and upon payment of \"just compensation.\" The prohibitions on \"Bills of Attainder\" in Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9- 10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437, 456-462, 85Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12S.Ct. 1707, 1719-1722, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965) . The Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justification sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause \"may not suffice\" to warrant its retroactive application. Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976) . These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutes raise particular concerns. The Legislature's unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration. Its responsivity to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall observed in his opinion for **1498 the Court in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only ensures *267 that individuals have \"fair warning\" about the effect of criminal statutes, but also \"restricts governmental power by restraining arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation.\" Id., at 28-29, [7] [8] The Constitution's restrictions, of course, are of limited scope. Absent a violation of one of those specific provisions, the potential unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its intended scope.21 Retroactivity provisions often serve entirely *268 benign and legitimate purposes, whether to respond to emergencies, to correct mistakes, to prevent circumvention of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage, or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law Congress considers salutary. However, a requirement that Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness. While statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored, deciding when a statute operates \"retroactively\" is not always a simple or mechanical task. Sitting on Circuit, Justice Story offered an influential definition in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F.Cas. 756 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814), a case construing a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that broadly prohibits \"retrospective\" laws both criminal and civil.22 Justice Story first rejected the notion that the provision bars only explicitly retroactive legislation, i.e., \"statutes ... enacted to take effect from a time anterior to their passage.\" Id., at 767. Such a construction, he concluded,**1499 would be \"utterly subversive of all the objects\" of the prohibition. Ibid. Instead, the ban on retrospective legislation embraced \"all statutes, which, though operating only from their passage, affect vested *269 rights and past transactions.\" Ibid. \"Upon principle,\" Justice Story elaborated, \"every statute, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective....\" Ibid. (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798), and Dash v. Van Kleeck, 7 Johns. *477 (N.Y.1811) ). Though the formulas have varied, similar functional conceptions of legislative \"retroactivity\" have found voice in this Court's decisions and elsewhere.23 [9] [10] A statute does not operate \"retrospectively\" merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment, see Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U.S. 80, 100, 113 S.Ct. 554, 565-566, 121 L.Ed.2d 474 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), or upsets expectations based in prior law.24 Rather, the court must ask *270 whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. The conclusion that a particular rule operates \"retroactively\" comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have \"sound ... instinct[s],\" see Danforth v. Groton Water Co., 178 Mass. 472, 476, 59 N.E. 1033, 1034 (1901) (Holmes, J.), and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance. Since the early days of this Court, we have declined to give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights unless Congress had made clear its intent. Thus, in United States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399, 2 L.Ed. 479 (1806) , we refused to apply a federal statute reducing the commissions of customs collectors to collections commenced before the statute's enactment because the statute lacked \"clear, strong, and imperative\" language requiring retroactive application, **1500 id., at 413 (opinion of Paterson, J.).

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the fact. Indeed, at common law a contrary rule applied to statutes that merely removed a burden on private rights by repealing a penal provision (whether criminal or civil); such *271 repeals were understood to preclude punishment for acts antedating the repeal. See, e.g., United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 223-224, 54 S.Ct. 434, 435-436, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934) ; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Dennis, 224 U.S. 503, 506, 32 S.Ct. 542, 543, 56 L.Ed. 860 (1912) ; United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 93-95, 20 L.Ed. 153 (1871); Norris v.

United States, 5 Cranch 281, 284, 3 L.Ed. 101 (1809) . But see 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 (repealing common-law rule). The largest category of cases in which we have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual or property rights, matters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance.25 The presumption has not, however, been limited to such cases. At issue in Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U.S. 536, 5 S.Ct. 255, 28 L.Ed. 770 (1884), for example, was a provision of the \"Chinese Restriction Act\" of 1882 barring Chinese laborers from reentering the United States without a certificate prepared when they exited this country. We held that the statute did not bar the reentry of a laborer who had left the United States before the certification requirement was promulgated. Justice Harlan's opinion for the Court observed that the law in effect before the 1882 enactment had accorded laborers a right to reenter without a certificate, and invoked the \"uniformly\" accepted rule against \"giv[ing] to statutes a retrospective *272 operation, whereby rights previously vested are injuriously affected, unless compelled to do so by language so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt that such was the intention of the legislature.\" Id., at 559, 5 S.Ct., at 266-267. Our statement in Bowen that \"congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result,\" 488 U.S., at 208, 109 S.Ct., at 471, was in step with this long line of cases.26 Bowen itself was a paradigmatic case of retroactivity in which a federal agency sought to recoup, under cost limit regulations issued in 1984, funds that had been paid to hospitals for services rendered earlier, see id., at 207, 109 S.Ct., at 471; our search for clear congressional intentauthorizing retroactivity was consistent with the approach taken in decisions spanning two centuries. [11] The presumption against statutory retroactivity had special force in the era in which courts tended to view legislative interference with property and contract rights circumspectly. In this century, legislation has come to supply the dominant means of **1501 legal ordering, and circumspection has given way to greater deference to legislative judgments. See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S., at 15-16, 96 S.Ct., at 2892- 2893; Home Building & 78 L.Ed. 413 (1934) . But while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil legislation are now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay for the countervailing benefits. Such a requirement allocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes, and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate. B [12] Although we have long embraced a presumption against statutory retroactivity, for just as long we have recognized that, in many situations, a court should \"apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,\" Bradley, 416 U.S., at 711, 94 S.Ct., at 2016, even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit. There is, of course, no conflict between that principle and a presumption against retroactivity when the statute in question is unambiguous. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801) , illustrates this point. Because a treaty signed on September 30, 1800, while the case was pending on appeal, unambiguously provided for the restoration of captured property \"not yet definitively condemned,\" id., at 107 (emphasis in original), we reversed a decree entered on September 23, 1800, condemning a French vessel that had been seized in American waters. Our application of \"the lawLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14in effect\" at the time of our decision in Schooner Peggy was simply a response to the language of the statute. Id., at 109. [13] [14] Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations. When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive. Thus, in American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U.S. 184, 42 S.Ct. 72, 66 L.Ed. 189 (1921) , we held that \u00a7 20 of the Clayton Act, enacted while the case was pending on appeal, governed the propriety of injunctive relief against labor picketing. In remanding the suit for application of the intervening statute, *274 we observed that \"relief by injunction operates in futuro,\" and that the plaintiff had no \"vested right\" in the decree entered by the trial court. 257 U.S., at 201, 42 S.Ct., at 75-76. See also, e.g., Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 48, 90 S.Ct. 200, 201-202, 24 L.Ed.2d 214 (1969) ; Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 464, 41 S.Ct. 172, 175, 65 L.Ed. 349 (1921) . [15] We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed. Thus, in Bruner v. United States, 343 U.S. 112, 116-117, 72 S.Ct. 581, 584-585, 96 L.Ed. 786 (1952) , relying on our \"consisten[t]\" practice, we ordered an action dismissed because the jurisdictional statute under which it had been (properly) filed was subsequently repealed.27 See also **1502 Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U.S. 506, 36 203-204, 60 L.Ed. 409 (1916); L.Ed. 748 (1870). Conversely, in Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., 436 U.S. 604, 607-608, n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 2002, 2005, n. 6, 56 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978), we held that, because a statute passed while the case was pending on appeal had eliminated the amount-in- controversy requirement for federal-question cases, the fact that respondent had failed to allege $10,000 in controversy at the commencement of the action was \"now of no moment.\" See also United States v. Alabama, 362 U.S. 602, 604, 80 S.Ct. 924, 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 982 (1960) (per curiam ); Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 478, 19 S.Ct. 722, 734, 43 L.Ed. 1041 (1899) . Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually \"takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.\" Hallowell, 239 U.S., at 508, 36 S.Ct., at 202. Present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional statutes \"speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of theparties,\" Republic Nat. Bank of Miami, 506 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct., at 565 (THOMAS, J., concurring). [16] [17] [18] [19] *275 Changes in procedural rules may often be applied in suits arising before their enactment without raising concerns about retroactivity. For example, in Ex parte Collett, 337 U.S. 55, 71, 69 S.Ct. 944, 952-953, 93 L.Ed. 1207 (1949) , we held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) governed the transfer of an action instituted prior to that statute's enactment. We noted the diminished reliance interests in matters of procedure. 337 U.S., at 71, 69 S.Ct., at 952-953.28 Because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct, the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive. Cf. McBurney v. Carson, 99 U.S. 567, 569, 25 L.Ed. 378 (1879) .29 *276 Petitioner relies principally upon Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974) , and Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969), in support of her argument that our ordinary interpretive rules support application of \u00a7 102 to her case. In Thorpe, we held that an agency circular requiring a local housing authority to give notice of reasons and opportunity to respond before evicting a tenant was applicable to an eviction proceeding commenced before the regulation issued. Thorpe shares much with both the \"procedural\" and \"prospective-relief\" cases. See supra, at 1501-1502. Thus, we noted in Thorpe that new hearing procedures did not affect either party's obligations under the lease agreement between the housing authority and the petitioner, 393 U.S., at 279, 89 S.Ct., at 524-525, and, because the tenant **1503 had \"not yet vacated,\" we saw no significance in the fact that the housing authority had \"decided to evict her before the circular was issued,\" id., at 283, 89 S.Ct., at 527. The Court in Thorpe viewed the new eviction procedures as \"essential to remove a serious impediment to the successful protection of constitutional rights.\" Ibid.30 Cf. Youakim v. Miller, 425 U.S. 231, 237, 96 S.Ct. 1399, 1402-1403, 47 L.Ed.2d 701 (1976) (per curiam ) (citing Thorpe for propriety of applying new law to avoiding necessity of deciding constitutionality of old one). Our holding in Bradley is similarly compatible with the line of decisions disfavoring \"retroactive\" application of statutes. In Bradley, the District Court had awarded attorney's fees and costs, upon general equitable principles, to parents who had prevailed in an action seeking to desegregate the public schools of Richmond, Virginia. While the *277 case wasLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15pending before the Court of Appeals, Congress enacted \u00a7 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which authorized federal courts to award the prevailing parties in school desegregation cases a reasonable attorney's fee. The Court of Appeals held that the new fee provision did not authorize the award of fees for services rendered before the effective date of the amendments. This Court reversed. We concluded that the private parties could rely on \u00a7 718 to support their claim for attorney's fees, resting our decision \"on the principle that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.\" 416 U.S., at 711, 94 S.Ct., at 2016. Although that language suggests a categorical presumption in favor of application of all new rules of law, we now make it clear that Bradley did not alter the well-settled presumption against application of the class of new statutes that would have genuinely \"retroactive\" effect. Like the new hearing requirement in Thorpe, the attorney's fee provision at issue in Bradley did not resemble the cases in which we have invoked the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Attorney's fee determinations, we have observed, are \"collateral to the main cause of action\" and \"uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial.\" White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U.S. 445, 451-452, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1166, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). See also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 695, n. 24, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2576, n. 24, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978). Moreover, even before the enactment of \u00a7 718, federal courts had authority (which the District Court in Bradley had exercised) to award fees based upon equitable principles. As our opinion in Bradley made clear, it would be difficult to imagine a stronger equitable case for an attorney's fee award than a lawsuit in which the plaintiff parents would otherwise have to bear the costs of desegregating their children's public schools. See 416 U.S., at 718, 94 S.Ct., at 2019-2020 (noting that the plaintiffs had brought the school board \"into compliance with its constitutional mandate\") (citing Brown v. Board *278 of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954)). In light of the prior availability of a fee award, and the likelihood that fees would be assessed under pre-existing theories, we concluded that the new fee statute simply \"d [id] not impose an additional or unforeseeable obligation\" upon the school board. Bradley, 416 U.S., at 721, 94 S.Ct., at 2021. In approving application of the new fee provision, Bradley did not take issue with the long line of decisions applying the presumption against retroactivity. Our opinion distinguished,but did not criticize, prior cases **1504 that had applied the antiretroactivity canon. See id., at 720, 94 S.Ct., at 2020-2021 (citing Greene v. United States, 376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S.Ct. 615, 621-622, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 (1964); Claridge Apartments Co. v. Commissioner, 323 U.S. 141, 164, 65 S.Ct. 172, 185, 89 L.Ed. 139 (1944) , and Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S.Ct. 101, 102, 58 L.Ed. 179 (1913) ). The authorities we relied upon in Bradley lend further support to the conclusion that we did not intend to displace the traditional presumption against applying statutes affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties to conduct arising before their enactment. See Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 849- 850, 110 S.Ct., at 1583-1584 (SCALIA, J., concurring). Bradley relied on Thorpe and on other precedents that are consistent with a presumption against statutory retroactivity, including decisions involving explicitly retroactive statutes, see 416 U.S., at 713, n. 17, 94 S.Ct., at 2017, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, 17 L.Ed. 160 (1865)),31 the retroactive application of intervening judicial decisions, see 416 U.S., at 713-714, n. 17, 94 S.Ct., at 2017, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 600, 607, 55 S.Ct. 575, 578, 79 L.Ed. 1082 (1935)),32 statutes *279 altering jurisdiction, 416 U.S., at 713, n. 17, 94 S.Ct., at 2017, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Alabama, 362 U.S. 602, 80 S.Ct. 924, 4 L.Ed.2d 982 (1960)), and repeal of a criminal statute, 416 U.S., at 713, n. 17, 94 S.Ct., at 2017, n. 17 (citing United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934) ). Moreover, in none of our decisions that have relied upon Bradley or Thorpe have we cast doubt on the traditional presumption against truly \"retrospective\" application of a statute.33 **1505 [20] *280 When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 16V We now ask whether, given the absence of guiding instructions from Congress, \u00a7 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is the type of provision that should govern cases arising before its enactment. As we observed supra, at 1494- 1495, and n. 12, there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of the Act must be treated uniformly for such purposes. To the contrary, we understand the instruction that the provisions are to \"take effect upon enactment\" to mean that courts should evaluate each provision of the Act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the application of new rules to pending cases and preenactment conduct. [21] Two provisions of \u00a7 102 may be readily classified according to these principles. The jury trial right set out in \u00a7 102(c)(1) is plainly a procedural change of the sort that would ordinarily govern in trials conducted after its effective date. If \u00a7 102 did no more than introduce a right to jury trial in Title *281 VII cases, the provision would presumably apply to cases tried after November 21, 1991, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.34 However, because \u00a7 102(c) makes a jury trial available only \"[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages,\" the jury trial option must stand or fall with the attached damages provisions. Section 102(b)(1) is clearly on the other side of the line. That subsection authorizes punitive damages if the plaintiff shows that the defendant \"engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.\" The very labels given \"punitive\" or \"exemplary\" damages, as well as the rationales that support them, demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions. Retroactive imposition of punitive damages would raise a serious constitutional question. See Turner Elkhorn, 428 U.S., at 17, 96 S.Ct., at 2893 (Court would \"hesitate to approve the retrospective imposition of liability on any theory of deterrence ... or blameworthiness\"); De Veau v. Braisted, 363 4 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1960) (\"The mark of an ex post facto law is the imposition of what can fairly be designated punishment for past acts\"). See also Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Spencer Handbags Corp., 765 F.2d 966, 972 (CA2 1985) (retroactive application of punitive treble damages provisions of Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 \"would present a potential ex post **1506 facto problem\"). Before we entertained that question, we wouldhave to be confronted with a statute that explicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment conduct. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 contains no such explicit command. The provision of \u00a7 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of compensatory damages is not easily classified. It does not *282 make unlawful conduct that was lawful when it occurred; as we have noted, supra, at 1490-1491, \u00a7 102 only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concerns about a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that such discrimination was in many cases (although not this one) already subject to monetary liability in the form of backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend that the compensatory damages provisions smack of a \"retributive\" or other suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Congress' desire to afford victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules established more than a generation ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At least with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then, \u00a7 102 is not in a category in which objections to retroactive application on grounds of fairness have their greatest force. [22] Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision would operate \"retrospectively\" if it were applied to conduct occurring before November 21, 1991. Unlike certain other forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintessentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may be intended less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victims whole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not \"compensate\" by distributing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particular employers to pay for harms they caused. The introduction of a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal change that would have an impact on private parties' planning.35 In this case, the event to which the new damages *283 provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that provision would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct. The new damages remedy in \u00a7 102, we conclude, is the kind of provision that does not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent. [23] In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief, \u00a7 102 can be seen as creating a new cause of action, and its impact on parties' rights is especially pronounced. Section 102 confers a new right to monetary relief on persons like petitioner who were victims of a hostile work environment but were not constructively discharged, and the novel prospect of damages liability for their employers. Because Title VIILandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 17previously authorized recovery of backpay in some cases, and because compensatory damages under \u00a7 102(a) are in addition to any backpay recoverable, the new provision also resembles a statute increasing the amount of damages available under a preestablished cause of action. Even under that view, however, the provision would, if applied in cases arising **1507 before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly impose on employers found liable a \"new disability\" in respect to past events. See Society for Propagation of the Gospel, 22 F.Cas., at 767. The extent of a party's liability, in the civil context as well as the criminal, is an important legal *284 consequence that cannot be ignored.36 Neither in Bradley itself, nor in any case before or since in which Congress had not clearly spoken, have we read a statute substantially increasing the monetary liability of a private party to apply to conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. See Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U.S. 296, 301, 33 S.Ct. 273, 273-274, 57 L.Ed. 518 (1913) (statute creating new federal cause of action for wrongful death inapplicable to case arising before enactment in absence of \"explicit words\" or \"clear implication\"); United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States ex rel. Struthers Wells *285 Co., 209 (1908) (construing statute restricting subcontractors' rights to recover damages from prime contractors as prospective in absence of \"clear, strong and imperative\" language from Congress favoring retroactivity).37 [24] [25] It will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully.38 That consideration, **1508 *286 however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and compromises necessary to their enactment may require adopting means other than those that would most effectively pursue the main goal. A legislator who supported a prospective statute might reasonably oppose retroactive application of the same statute. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the omission of the 1990 version's express retroactivity provisions was a factor in the passage of the 1991 bill. Section 102 is plainly not the sort of provision that must be understood to operate retroactively because a contrary reading would render it ineffective. The presumption against statutory retroactivity is founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with long held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation. We are satisfied that it applies to \u00a7 102. Because we have found no clear evidenceof congressional intent that \u00a7 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 should apply to cases arising before its enactment, we conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. It is so ordered. *294 Justice BLACKMUN , dissenting. Perhaps from an eagerness to resolve the \"apparent tension,\" see Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 1577, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990) , between Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974), and Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988), the Court rejects the \"most logical reading,\" Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 838, 110 S.Ct., at 1577, of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071 (Act), and resorts to a presumption against retroactivity. This approach seems to me to pay insufficient fidelity to the settled principle that the \"starting point for interpretation of a statute 'is the language of the statute itself,' \" Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 835, 110 S.Ct., at 1575, quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) , and extends the presumption against retroactive legislation beyond its historical reach and purpose. A straightforward textual analysis of the Act indicates that \u00a7 102's provision of compensatory damages and its attendant right to a jury trial apply to cases pending on appeal on the date of enactment. This analysis begins with \u00a7 402(a) of the Act, 105 Stat. 1099: \"Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act *295 shall take effect upon enactment.\" Under the \"settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has operative effect,\" United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 36, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 1015, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992), citing United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 519- 520, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955), \u00a7 402(a)'s qualifying clause, \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided,\" cannot be dismissed as mere surplusage or an \"insurance policy\" against future judicial interpretation. Cf. Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F.2d 886, 890 (CADC 1992). Instead, it most logically refers to the Act's two sections \"specifically provid[ing]\" that the statute does not apply to cases pending on the date of enactment: (a) \u00a7 402(b), 105 Stat. 1099, which provides, in effect, that **1509 the Act did not apply to the then-pending case of Wards Cove Packing Co. v.

Thus, the clear implication is that, while \u00a7\u00a7 402(b) and 109(c) do not apply to pending cases, other provisions\u2014including \u00a7 102\u2014 do.1 \" 'Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [this] language must ... be regarded as conclusive.' \" Kaiser, 494 U.S., at 835, 110 S.Ct., at 1575, quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S., at 108, 100 S.Ct., at 2056. The legislative history of the Act, featuring a welter of conflicting and \"some frankly partisan\" floor statements, ante, at 1495, but no committee report, evinces no such contrary *296 legislative intent.2 Thus, I see no reason to dismiss as \"unlikely,\" ante, at 1494, the most natural reading of the statute, in order to embrace some other reading that is also \"possible,\" ibid. Even if the language of the statute did not answer the retroactivity question, it would be appropriate under our precedents to apply \u00a7 102 to pending cases.3 The well- established presumption against retroactive legislation, which serves to protect settled expectations, is grounded in a respect for vested rights. See, e.g., Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of Jurisprudence, 20 Minn.L.Rev. 775, 784 (1936) (retroactivity *297 doctrine developed as an \"inhibition against a construction which ... would violate vested rights\"). This presumption need not be applied to remedial legislation, such as \u00a7 102, that does not proscribe any conduct that was previously legal. See Sampeyreac v. United States, 7 Pet. 222, 238, 8 L.Ed.665 (1833) (\"Almost every law, providing a new remedy, affects and operates upon causes of action existing at the time the law is passed\"); Hastings v.

At no time within the last generation has an employer had a vested right to engage in or to permit sexual harassment; \" 'there is no such thing as a vested right to do wrong.' \" Freeborn v.

Section 102 of the Act expands the remedies available for acts of intentional discrimination, but does not alter the scope of the employee's basic right to be free from discrimination or the employer's corresponding legal duty. There is nothing unjust about holding an employer responsible for injuries caused by conduct that has been illegal for almost 30 years. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

See infra, at 1493-1496. 4We have not decided whether a plaintiff seeking backpay under Title VII is entitled to a jury trial. See, e.g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 549, n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 1331, 1335, n. 1, 108 L.Ed.2d 504 (1990) (assuming without deciding no right to jury trial); Teamsters v.

Because petitioner does not argue that she had a right to jury trial even under pre-1991 law, again we need not address this question. 5\"If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in ... an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may ... order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay ... or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.

Thus, the sum of such damages awarded a plaintiff may not exceed $50,000 for employers with between 14 and 100 employees; $100,000 for employers with between 101 and 200 employees; $200,000 for employers with between 200 and 500 employees; and $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees. 7See Harris v.

See Memorandum of the Attorney General to the President (Oct. 22, 1990) in App. to Brief for Petitioner A-13 (\"And Section 15 unfairly applies the changes in the law made by S. 2104 to cases already decided \") (emphasis added). 10The history of prior amendments to Title VII suggests that the \"effective-upon-enactment\" formula would have been an especially inapt way to reach pending cases. When it amended Title VII in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Congress explicitly provided: \"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act and all charges filed thereafter.\" Pub.L. 92-261, \u00a7 14, 86 Stat. 113. In contrast, in amending Title VII to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy in 1978, Congress provided: \"Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendment made by this Act shall be effective on the date of enactment.\" \u00a7 2(a), 92 Stat. 2076. The only Courts of Appeals to consider whether the 1978 amendments applied to pending cases concluded that they did not. See Schwabenbauer v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. of Olean, 667 F.2d 305, 310, n. 7 (CA2 1981) ; Condit v. United Air Lines, Inc., 631 F.2d 1136, 1139-1140 (CA4 1980). See also Jensen v. Gulf Oil Refining & Marketing Co., 623 F.2d 406, 410 (CA5 1980) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act amendments designated to \"take effect on the date of enactment of this Act\" inapplicable to case arising before enactment); Sikora v. American Can Co., 622 F.2d 1116, 1119-1124 (CA3 1980) (same). If we assume that Congress was familiar with those decisions, cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 698-699, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1958-1959, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), its choice of language in \u00a7 402(a) would imply nonretroactivity. 11There is some evidence that the drafters of the 1991 Act did not devote particular attention to the interplay of the Act's \"effective date\" provisions. Section 110, which directs the EEOC to establish a \"Technical Assistance Training Institute\" to assist employers in complying with antidiscrimination laws and regulations, contains a subsection providing that it \"shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\" \u00a7 110(b). That provision and \u00a7 402(a) are unavoidably point also diminishes the force of petitioner's \"expressio unius \" argument. Once one abandons the unsupported assumption that Congress expected that all of the Act's provisions would be treated alike, and takes account of uncertainty about the applicable default rule, \u00a7\u00a7 109(c) and 402(b) do not carry the negative implication petitioner draws from them. We do not read either provision as doing anything more than definitively rejecting retroactivity with respect to the specific matters covered by its plain language. 13See, e.g., H.R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 113 (1991), reprinted in 137 Cong.Rec. H3924-H3925 (Jan. 3, 1991). The prospectivity proviso to the section extending Title VII to overseas employers was first added to legislation that generally was to apply to pending cases. See H.R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st 137 Cong.Rec. H3925- H3926 (June 5, 1991). Thus, at the time its language was introduced, the provision that became \u00a7 109(c) was surely not redundant. 14On the other hand, two proposals that would have provided explicitly for prospectivity also foundered. See 137 Cong.Rec. S3021, S3023 (Mar. 12, example, in an \"interpretive memorandum\" introduced on behalf of seven Republican sponsors of S. 1745, the bill that became the 1991 Act, Senator Danforth stated that \"[t]he bill provides that, unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this legislation shall take effect upon enactment and shall not apply retroactively. \" Id., at 29047. (emphasis added). Senator Kennedy responded that it \"will be up to the courts to determine the extent to which the bill will apply to cases and claims that were pending on the date of enactment.\" Ibid. (citing Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974)). The legislative history reveals other partisan statements on the proper meaning of the Act's \"effective date\" provisions. Senator Danforth observed that such statements carry little weight as legislative history. As he put it: \"[A] court would be well advised to take with a large grain of salt floor debate and statements placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD which purport to create an interpretation for the legislation that is before us.\" 137 Cong.Rec. S15325 (Oct. 29, 1991). 16See Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons about How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vand.L.Rev. 395 (1950). Llewellyn's article identified the apparent conflict between the canon that \"[a] statute imposing a new penalty or forfeiture, or a new liability or disability, or creating a new right of action will not be construed as having a retroactive effect; and the countervailing rule that \"[r]emedial statutes are to be liberally construed and if a retroactive interpretation will promote the ends of justice, they should receive such construction.\" Id., at 402 (citations omitted).Landgraf v.

The constitutional prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of private citizens.

United States, 366 U.S. 213, 247, n. 3, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1052, n. 3, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) (retroactive punitive measures may reflect \"a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty against specific persons or classes of persons\"). James Madison argued that retroactive legislation also offered special opportunities for the powerful to obtain special and improper legislative benefits. According to Madison, \"[b]ills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts\" were \"contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation,\" in part because such measures invited the \"influential\" to \"speculat[e] on public measures,\" to the detriment of the \"more industrious and less informed part of the community.\" The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). See Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive statute \"may be passed with an exact knowledge of who will benefit from it\"). 21In some cases, however, the interest in avoiding the adjudication of constitutional questions will counsel against a retroactive application. For if a challenged statute is to be given retroactive effect, the regulatory interest that supports prospective application will not necessarily also sustain its application to past events. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717, 730, 104 S.Ct. 2709, 2718, 81 L.Ed.2d 601 (1984) ; Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 17, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2893, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). In this case the punitive damages provision may raise a question, but for present purposes we assume that Congress has ample power to provide for retroactive application of \u00a7 102. 22Article 23 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights provides: \"Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws, therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes or the punishment of offenses.\" At issue in the Society case was a new statute that reversed a common-law rule by allowing certain wrongful possessors of land, upon being ejected by the rightful owner, to obtain compensation for improvements made on the land. Justice Story held that the new statute impaired the owner's rights and thus could not, consistently with Article 23, be applied to require compensation for improvements made before the statute's enactment.

Roland, How. 581, 589, 11 387 (1844) . 27In Bruner, we specifically noted: \"This jurisdictional rule does not affect the general principle that a statute is not to be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication. Compare United States v. St. Louis, S.F. & T.R. Co., 270 U.S. 1, 3 [46 S.Ct. 182, 183, 70 L.Ed. 435] (1926) , Gallardo, [48 S.Ct. 23, 23-24, 72 L.Ed. 152] (1927) .\" 343 U.S., at 117, n. 8, 72 S.Ct., at 584, n. 8. 28While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibit application of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after the fact, we have upheld intervening procedural changes even if application of the new rule operated to a defendant's disadvantage in the particular case. See, e.g., Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282, 293-294, 97 S.Ct. 2290, 2298-2299, 53 L.Ed.2d 344 (1977); 497 U.S. 37, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990) ; Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 46 S.Ct. 68, 70 L.Ed. 216 (1925). 29Of course, the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it applies to every pending case. A new rule concerning the filing of complaints would not govern an action in which the complaint had already been properly filed under the old regime, and the promulgation of a new rule of evidence would not require an appellate remand for a new trial. Our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules reflect the commonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarily depends on the posture of the particular case. See, e.g., Order Amending Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 495 U.S. 969 (1990) (amendments applicable to pending cases \"insofar as just and practicable\"); Order Amending Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 456 U.S. 1015 (1982) (same); Order Amending Bankruptcy Rules and Forms, 421 U.S. 1021 (1975) (amendments applicable to pending cases \"except to the extent that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular proceeding then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice\"). Contrary to Justice SCALIA's suggestion, 511 U.S. at 290, 114 S.Ct. at 1524 , we do not restrict the presumption against statutory retroactivity to cases involving \"vested rights.\" (Neither is Justice Story's definition of retroactivity, quoted supra, at 1499, so restricted.) Nor do we suggest that concerns about retroactivity have no application to procedural rules. 30Thorpe is consistent with the principle, analogous to that at work in the common-law presumption about repeals of criminal statutes, that the government should accord grace to private parties disadvantaged by an old rule when it adopts a new and more generous one. Cf. DeGurules v. INS, 833 F.2d 861, 862-863 (CA9 1987) . Indeed, Thorpe twice cited United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934) , which ordered dismissal of prosecutions pending when the National Prohibition Act was repealed. See Thorpe, 393 U.S., at 281, n. 38, 89 S.Ct., at 526, n. 38; id., at 282, n. 40, 89 S.Ct., at 526, n. 40. 31In Bradley, we cited Schooner Peggy for the \"current law\" principle, but we recognized that the law at issue in Schooner Peggy had expressly called for retroactive application. See 416 U.S., at 712, n. 16, 94 S.Ct., at 2016, n. 16 (describing Schooner Peggy as holding that Court was obligated to \"apply the terms of the convention,\" which had recited that it applied to all vessels not yet \" definitively condemned\") (emphasis in convention).Landgraf v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2332At the time Bradley was decided, it was by no means a truism to point out that rules announced in intervening judicial decisions should normally be applied to a case pending when the intervening decision came down. In 1974, our doctrine on judicial retroactivity involved a substantial measure of discretion, guided by equitable standards resembling the Bradley \"manifest injustice\" test itself. See Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 106-107, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355-356, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971) ; 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1741, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965) . While it was accurate in 1974 to say that a new rule announced in a judicial decision was only presumptively applicable to pending cases, we have since established a firm rule of retroactivity. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) ; Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987). 33See, e.g., Treasury Employees v.

See n. 29, supra. Thus, customary practice would not support remand for a jury trial in this case. 35As petitioner and amici suggest, concerns of unfair surprise and upsetting expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimination, which has been unlawful for more than a generation. However, fairness concerns would not be entirely absent if the damages provisions of \u00a7 102 were to apply to events preceding its enactment, as the facts of this case illustrate. Respondent USI's management, when apprised of the wrongful conduct of petitioner's co- worker, took timely action to remedy the problem. The law then in effect imposed no liability on an employer who corrected discriminatory work conditions before the conditions became so severe as to result in the victim's constructive discharge. Assessing damages against respondents on a theory of respondeat superior would thus entail an element of surprise. Even when the conduct in question is morally reprehensible or illegal, a degree of unfairness is inherent whenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past. Cf. Weaver, 450 U.S., at 28-30, 101 S.Ct., at 963-965 (Ex Post Facto Clause assures fair notice and governmental restraint, and does not turn on \"an individual's right to less punishment\"). The new damages provisions of \u00a7 102 can be expected to give managers an added incentive to take preventive measures to ward off discriminatory conduct by subordinates before it occurs, but that purpose is not served by applying the regime to preenactment conduct. 36The state courts have consistently held that statutes changing or abolishing limits on the amount of damages available in wrongful-death actions should not, in the absence of clear legislative intent, apply to actions arising before their enactment. See, e.g., Dempsey v. State, 451 A.2d 273 (R.I.1982) (\"Every court which has considered the issue ... has found that a subsequent change as to the amount or the elements of damage in the wrongful-death statute to be substantive rather than procedural or remedial, and thus any such change must be applied prospectively\"); Kleibrink v.Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1483, 64 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 820, 64 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 42,947... \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters.

Co., 224 Kan. 437, 444, 581 P.2d 372, 378 (1978) (holding, in accord with the \"great weight of authority,\" that \"an increase, decrease or repeal of the statutory maximum recoverable in wrongful death actions is not retroactive\" and thus should not apply in a case arising before the statute's enactment) (emphasis in original); Bradley v. Knutson, 62 Wis.2d 432, 436, 215 N.W.2d 369, 371 (1974) (refusing to apply increase in cap on damages for wrongful death to misconduct occurring before effective date; \"statutory increases in damage[s] limitations are actually changes in substantive rights and not mere remedial changes\"); State ex rel.

Proulx, 113 N.H. 698, 701, 313 A.2d 723, 725 (1973) (\"To apply the increased limit after the date of the accident would clearly enlarge the defendant's liability retrospectively. In the absence of an express provision, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended retrospective application\"). See also Fann v. McGuffy, 534 S.W.2d 770, 774, n. 19 (Ky.1975) ; Muckler v. Buchl, Minn. 490, 150 N.W.2d 689, 697 (1967) . 37We have sometimes said that new \"remedial\" statutes, like new \"procedural\" ones, should presumptively apply to pending cases. See, e.g., Ex parte Collett, 337 U.S., at 71, and n. 38, 69 S.Ct., at 952-953, and n. 38 (\"Clearly, \u00a7 1404(a) remedial provision applicable to pending actions\"); Beazell, 269 U.S., at 171, 46 S.Ct., at 69 (Ex Post Facto Clause does not limit \"legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance\"). While that statement holds true for some kinds of remedies, see supra, at 1501-1502 (discussing prospective relief), we have not classified a statute introducing damages liability as the sort of \"remedial\" change that should presumptively apply in pending cases. \"Retroactive modification\" of damages remedies may \"normally harbo[r] much less potential for mischief than retroactive changes in the principles of liability,\" Hastings v. Earth Satellite Corp., 628 F.2d 85, 93 (CADC), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 905, 101 S.Ct. 281, 66 L.Ed.2d 137 (1980) , but that potential is nevertheless still significant. 38Petitioner argues that our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992), supports application of \u00a7 102 to her case. Relying on the principle that \"where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong,' \" id., at 66, 112 S.Ct., at 1033 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, 777, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946)), we held in Franklin that the right of action under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 included a claim for damages. Petitioner argues that Franklin supports her position because, if she cannot obtain damages pursuant to \u00a7 102, she will be left remediless despite an adjudged violation of her right under Title VII to be free of workplace discrimination. However, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not a statute to which we would apply the \"traditional presumption in favor of all available remedies.\" 503 U.S., at 72, 112 S.Ct., at 1036. That statute did not create a \"general right to sue\" for employment discrimination, but instead specified a set of \"circumscribed remedies.\" See United States v. Burke, 504 U.S. 229, 240, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992) . Until the 1991 amendment, the Title VII scheme did not allow for damages. We are not free to fashion remedies that Congress has specifically chosen not to extend. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77, 97, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 1583-1584, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981) . 1It is, of course, an \"unexceptional\" proposition that \"a particular statute may in some circumstances implicitly authorize retroactive [application].\" Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 223, 109 S.Ct. 468, 479, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (concurring opinion) (emphasis added). 2Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the application of the 1991 Act to pending cases has concluded that the legislative history provides no reliable guidance. See, e.g., Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F.2d 886 (CADC 1992); Mozee v. American Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F.2d 929 (CA7 1992). The absence in the Act of the strong retroactivity language of the vetoed 1990 legislation, which would have applied the new law to final judgments as well as to pending cases, see H.R. 4000, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 15(b)(3) (1990), reprinted 136 Cong.Rec. H6829 (Aug. 3, 1990) (providing that \"any final judgment entered prior to the date of the enactment of this Act as to which the rights of any of the parties thereto have become fixed and vested ... shall be vacated in whole or in part if justice requires\" and the Constitution permits), is not instructive of Congress' intent with respect to pending cases alone. Significantly, Congress also rejected language that put pending claims beyond the reach of the 1990 or 1991 Act. See id., at H6747 (Michel-LaFalce amendment to 1990 Act) (\"The amendments made by this Act shall not apply with respect to claims arising before the date of enactment of this Act\"); id., at H6768 (Michel- LaFalce amendment rejected); 137 Cong.Rec. S3023 (daily ed. Mar. 12, 1991) (Sen.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 253Directly at issue in this case are compensatory damages and the right to a jury trial. While there is little unfairness in requiring an employer to compensate the victims of intentional acts of discrimination, or to have a jury determine those damages, the imposition of punitive damages for preenactment conduct represents a more difficult question, one not squarely addressed in this case and one on which I express no opinion.

Out of the funds thus coming into her hands, Mrs. Waller accumulated some $12,000, which she used to construct a house at a cost of approximately $34,000 upon a lot which she had acquired in her name. The construction cost in excess of the $12,000 cash she had accumulated, was financed through a mortgage loan. Thereafter, largely out of her husband's funds coming into her hands, she regularly made payments upon the mortgage. At all relevant times, sheknew of the existence of the unsatisfied judgment against her husband. The judgment creditor instituted this action against Mrs. Waller to subject the equity in her house to its judgment against the husband. The action was commenced more than three years after the construction of the house and the disbursement of the $12,000. Originally, the District Court held that there had been a fraudulent transfer of the $12,000, and that the house should be subjected to the payment of the judgment. It held that the applicable period of limitations was not the three years governing actions founded upon fraud, but ten years governing actions to enforce resulting trusts.1 On appeal, we took a different view of the limitations question, holding that the applicable limitations period was three years, but we remanded the case for further consideration since it appeared on the record that the wife, within the period of limitations, had made a number of payments on the principal of the mortgage out of the funds of her husband.2 Upon the remand, the District Court found that during the 3- year period immediately preceding the filing of this action, the sum of $6,075.06 had been paid upon the principal of the mortgage, of which $2,000 had been paid by a son of the Wallers, while the remaining $4,075.06 had been paid by Mrs. Waller out of funds supplied her by her husband. In addition, there had been paid to the mortgagee some $2,188.94 in interest. The District Court subtracted from the $4,075.06 paid by Mrs. Waller upon the principal of the mortgage debt the sum of $500, being the amount of the personal property exemption of a judgment debtor under Article X, \u00a7 1 of the North Carolina Constitution . Judgment was thus entered for the judgment creditor in the amount of $3,575.06, with interest from the date upon which the complaint was filed. The defendant, on her appeal, contends that the plaintiff should recover nothing, for it should not have been allowed to shift the theory of its case. She also contends that no interest should have been allowed. On its appeal, the plaintiff contends that it had insufficient notice of the fraudulent transfers to start the running of the Statute of Limitations until shortly before the action was commenced, and that it is thus entitled to recover the $12,000 cash fund expended by the defendant, as well as the mortgage payments made more than three years before the action was commenced. It contends it is entitled to recover the interest paid by Mrs.New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (1963) \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5Waller to the mortgagee and should be allowed interest on all payments made on the mortgage from the date of payment. It objects to the reduction of the judgment by the amount of the personal property exemption, and contends it should have been allowed to file a supplemental complaint bringing *24 into question all payments on the mortgage subsequent to the filing of the complaint and up to the date of the hearing. Generally, we affirm the rulings of the District Court, though we think the judgment should not have been reduced by the amount of the personal property exemption, and that leave to file a supplemental complaint should have been granted. I Stipulation, Bearing on Theory of Case, as Bar to Recovery In Michael v. Moore, 157 N.C. 462, 73 S.E. 104, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held on comparable facts that the judgment creditor was entitled to recover the value of the improvements notwithstanding a jury's finding that there was no actual intent to defraud when the husband's funds were used to improve the wife's property. It held that the wife was a constructive trustee and held her to account as such. The Court in Michael v. Moore was not concerned with the question of limitations, but the plaintiff here, in an effort to avoid the shorter 3-year limitations period, insisted that it was not claiming any actual fraud, that it was entitled to judgment even though there was no actual fraud, and that the limitations period applicable to actions founded upon fraud did not govern the case. It stipulated that it was 'not depending upon' the North Carolina statutes governing fraudulent conveyances.3 In disposing of the limitations question, we held that the cause of action was based upon fraud. It is dependent upon the statutes, though the North Carolina statutes are substantially a reenactment of 13 Eliz. c. 5 \u00a7 2,4 which, with respect to the rights of existing creditors, was declarative of the common law.5 The defendant, therefore, insists that a judgment may not now be entered for the plaintiff when it is supportable only upon a theory which the plaintiff had disclaimed in its formal stipulation. [1] [2] [3] [4] A judicial admission is usually treated as absolutely binding, but such admissions go to matters of fact which, otherwise, would require evidentiary proof. They serve a highly useful purpose in dispensing with proof of formal matters and of facts about which there is no real dispute. Once made, the subject matter ought not to be reopened in the absence of a showing of exceptionalcircumstances, but a court, unquestionably, has the right to relieve a party of his judicial admission if it appears that the admitted fact is clearly untrue and that the party was laboring under a mistake when he made the admission.6 [5] [6] The doctrine of judicial admissions has never been applied to counsel's statement of his conception of the legal theory of the case. When counsel speaks of legal principles, as he conceives them and which he thinks applicable, he makes no judicial admission and sets up no estoppel which would prevent the court from applying to the facts disclosed by the proof, the proper legal principles as the Court understands them. [7] [8] This is the whole theory of modern developments in rules of pleading and procedure. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which govern here, a plaintiff in his complaint is required only to set forth 'a short and plain statement of the claim.'7 He need not set forth any theory or demand any particular relief for the court will award appropriate relief if the plaintiff is entitled *25 to it upon any theory.8 Under this liberalized practice, a party's misconception of the legal theory of his case does not work a forfeiture of his legal rights.9 [9] [10] The defendant's suggestion, that counsel's adherence to an insupportable legal theory is an irrevocable judicial admission, is a reversion to an earlier day when claims and defenses of merit were forfeited by a misstep in the negotiation of tortuous procedural paths. Then, in Many contexts, misconception of the substantive right could lead to procedural mistakes which controlled the court's decision. The present rules, however, have relegated such perils to the past. The purpose of their adoption was broader than the simplification of procedures for the convenience of lawyers and judges. They were designed for the protection of the diligent litigant who has a just cause, but who, during some stage of the proceedings, misconceived the nature of his cause or mistook his remedy. In this day, a party ought not and does not lose his right when his counsel, however formally, advances an erroneous legal theory. If, on the facts disclosed, the party is entitled to some relief, it is the duty of the court to award it. [11] The question with which we dealt on the previous appeal had not been considered in any illuminating opinion by the Supreme Court of North Carolina. If its answer was not obscure, there was more than superficial support for theNew Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (1963) \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6plaintiff's theory in isolated statements of that court that a constructive trust might arise in the absence of fraud, actual or constructive. The very fact that the District Court, in the first instance, agreed with the plaintiff on the limitations question attests the fact that the plaintiff's original legal position was not beyond the range of arguability. But whatever may now be said of its merit or demerit, it was simply the plaintiff's notion of a legal theory which would support its recovery of all that it claimed. The fact that we refused to accept its theory, is no basis for withholding the more limited relief available on the legal theory that the court does approve, though the theory which the court was persuaded to accept had been disclaimed by the plaintiff when it sought the whole loaf. II Plaintiff's Notice of the Fraudulent Transfer The plaintiff contends that it did not have sufficient notice of the fraudulent transfers until shortly before commencement of this action on December 28, 1959. In proceedings supplemental to the original action in which it obtained its judgment, however, the plaintiff had examined Mr. Waller on August 27, 1956. It now contends that some of Mr. Waller's answers were untruthful and misleading, and, on that account, it was not sufficiently informed of the actual situation to start the running of the statute. Mr. Waller, however, plainly stated that his employer, at his request, sent all of his salary checks to Mrs. Waller which she deposited to her account, and that he never saw them. It also appeared that she made the payments on the mortgage. Though Mr. Waller claimed in 1957 that his son and the two daughters made contributions to a fund out of which mortgage payments were made, it clearly appeared that some of his funds had *26 been used by his wife for the construction of the house or curtailment of the mortgage. Indeed, in a stipulation in this action, the parties agreed that the facts alleged in the complaint were derived, in the main, from the adverse examination of Mr. Waller in 1956. That is a judicial admission, which the plaintiff should not now be allowed to controvert. [12] [13] [14] The 3-year period of limitations governing actions based upon fraud does not commence to run until the plaintiff has notice of the fraud, but the notice which starts the running of the statute is not complete information of all details of the transaction. The statute starts to run when the plaintiff acquires sufficient information to give rise to a reasonable belief that a fraudulent conveyance has occurred. It is enough when he has sufficient information to put a reasonable person on notice that further inquiry is called for. The plaintiff couldnot tell from what Mr. Waller disclosed in 1956 how much of Mrs. Waller's equity in the house had been purchased with her husband's funds, but it knew that some of the husband's funds had been used for that purpose, and that Mrs. Waller had no other income or means of support. What the plaintiff then knew was quite enough to put it on notice that a fraudulent transfer had occurred and to put upon it the onus of further inquiry. III The Constitutional Exemption from Levy [15] In the first appeal, Mrs. Waller contended that North Carolina's constitutional provision,10 granting to a judgment debtor an exemption from levy of personal property equal in value to $500, immunized the husband's gifts to her since he gave her no more than $500 at any one time. We summarily disposed of the contention, for the exemption can be claimed only at the moment of levy and is not a sword for the frustration of the laws relating to fraudulent conveyances. On remand, the same exemption was again asserted, now in a different context, and the District Court reduced the judgment it otherwise would have entered by $500, the amount of the constitutional exemption. In doing so, we think it was mistaken. We would not have supposed that the fraudulent donee could claim the personal property exemption of the fraudulent donor. If he has given away his property so that, as between him and the donee, he has no legal or equitable claim to it, he hardly has standing to say that his creditor may not have a portion of it. If there were a resulting trust, if donor and donee had agreed that the property was actually the husband's placed in the wife's name only to circumvent his creditors and would be reconveyed by the wife to the husband upon his demand, then, of course, it was not a fraudulent conveyance in the sense that we have used the term, and the wife, rather than being a constructive trustee would be the trustee of a resulting trust. In that event, the property would be the husband's and the 10-year period of limitations would be applicable, rather than the three. In that event, the husband could claim his personal property exemption at the time of levy, but the plaintiff would not be embarrassed by the shorter period of limitations and the $500 exemption would be the only limiting factor upon its recovery.11 Nevertheless, in Michael v. Moore, 157 N.C. 462, 73 S.E. 104, the North Carolina Supreme Court has apparently held,New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (1963) \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7under such circumstances, that the fraudulent donee is entitled to claim the personal property exemption of the fraudulent donor. It was not applied as the District Court applied it here, however, and what was done in Michael v. Moore is not a precedent for the reduction of the judgment. *27 The plaintiff in Michael v. Moore had a judgment against the fraudulent donor for $348.15. The fraudulent conveyance was of $2,000, which the fraudulent donee had used in the construction of a house. The court reasoned that had there been no fraudulent conveyance, the judgment debtor having retained the $2,000 in his hands, the personal property exemption would have entitled him to keep $500 of it. Though he had not chosen to keep it, the court thought that the creditor should take from the fraudulent donee no more than it could have got from the fraudulent donor if there had been no fraudulent transfer. It thus directed that the fraudulent donee's equity available for the satisfaction of the claim of the judgment creditor should not exceed $1500. Since the judgment creditor's claim was only $348.15, it probably was not embarrassed by the Court's application of the personal property exemption. Clearly, however, the court did not reduce the judgment by the amount of the personal property exemption. Otherwise, the judgment would have been completely wiped out, and the court would have held the judgment creditor entitled to no relief. Since the court in Michael v. Moore granted the judgment creditor all the relief it sought, the case is clearly no authority for what was done here. If we accept what was done in Michael v. Moore as declarative of the law of North Carolina, Mrs. Waller would be entitled to claim the personal property exemption of her husband, and, apparently, to treat her equity in the real estate as his personalty. The $500 personal property exemption would be subtracted from the value of her equity to the extent that it was attributable to funds supplied by her husband to determine the amount available for the satisfaction of her husband's creditors. Since, because of the Statute of Limitations, the judgment creditor can reach only a part of the fraudulent transfers, however, such an application of the personal property exemption is academic. Mrs. Waller's equity attributable to the funds she obtained from her husband, reduced by $500, far exceeds the aggregate amount of the fraudulent transfers which the plaintiff can attack in this proceeding within the confines of the 3-year statute of limitations. [16] The plaintiff's judgment should not have been reduced by the amount of the constitutional personal property exemption.IV Interest Paid on the Mortgage Debt [17] The plaintiff contends that its recovery should be measured by the total of all mortgage payments, including their interest increment. The District Court had measured the recovery by the amount by which the principal indebtedness had been reduced with funds derived from the husband, and that we think was clearly proper: In this kind of proceeding, the fraudulent donee is required to disgorge what she has. Upon the suit of the judgment creditor, she should be required to surrender what she holds to her unjust enrichment and which should have been applied by her donor to the payment of his debt. As a general rule, however, she cannot be required to surrender more than she has, and what she has expended in the payment of interest, real estate taxes and for maintenance and repair of the house, though necessary to her use and enjoyment of the house, has not enhanced the value of the property in her hands. When she used her husband's funds to reduce the principal of the mortgage debt, she enhanced her equity in the house in that exact amount, but her payments of interest to the building and loan association had no such effect. V Interest on the Plaintiff's Claim [18] The District Judge awarded interest from the date of the filing of the complaint in this action. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the interest should run from the date of each payment made *28 by Mrs. Waller to the building and loan association out of funds supplied by her husband. The defendant contends, on the other hand, that no prejudgment interest should have been allowed. We agree with the District Judge. [19] [20] [21] These fraudulent transfers, perfectly valid as between the immediate parties, are subject to attack by the creditor. At the instance of the creditor the donee may be compelled to surrender what she has received, but the creditor is under no duty to attack the transaction, and, unless it makes some demand upon the donee, the donee has every right to receive and enjoy the benefit of what she has been given by her donor in fraud of his creditors. By affirmance, the creditors can validate the transactions completely, and, until some demand is made upon the donee, the donee ought not to be responsible for interest.New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (1963) \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8The filing of the complaint in this action, however, was clearly a formal demand upon the donee. The transfers were plainly in violation of the statute, and the source of the funds which she had used in the construction of her house and the curtailment of her mortgage was known to her and their amount readily ascertainable. For such reasons, the District Court quite properly awarded prejudgment interest beginning with the date upon which the complaint was filed. VI Permission to File a Supplemental Complaint [22] Finally, the plaintiff complains that it should have been allowed to file a supplemental complaint so as to reach transfers of the husband's funds to the wife to the extent that they were used to reduce the mortgage debt during the period between the filing of the complaint and the hearing. We think such permission should have been granted. The essential legal and factual questions have been settled in this action. The substantive rights of the plaintiff have been declared and adjudicated. It is clear that, substantively, the defendant is accountable to the plaintiff for all reductions in the principal of the mortgage debt, to the extent that they were effected with funds supplied by her husband, and this is true of payments during the period after the filing of the complaint, as well as of those during the period of three years preceding the filing of the complaint. Unless the plaintiff is allowed to file a supplemental complaint requiring the defendant to account for such payments in this action, it will be necessary for the plaintiff to commence an entirely new proceeding, and since there would then be no independent ground of federal jurisdiction, the new proceeding would have to be brought in another court. Since all the relief to which the plaintiff is substantively entitled can be awarded in this action, the filing of a supplemental complaint should have been allowed. While the defendant foresees great practical problems arising from the allowance of a supplemental pleading, we see none. The allowance of such a supplemental pleading presents no new substantive controversy. Its allowance would only require that Mrs. Waller prove the source of the funds which were utilized to reduce the mortgage debt during the period covered by the supplemental complaint. Except that some question may arise as to whether or not the supplemental pleading canbring into question transfers occurring more than three years earlier, the original complaint having been filed more than three years ago, we foresee no unusual problem or difficulty arising out of the allowance of the supplemental pleading. [23] [24] Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for such a supplemental pleading. It is a useful device, enabling a court to award complete relief, or more nearly complete relief, in one action, and to avoid the cost, delay and waste of separate actions which must be separately tried and prosecuted. So useful they are and of such service in the efficient administration *29 of justice that they ought to be allowed as of course, unless some particular reason for disallowing them appears, though the court has the unquestioned right to impose terms upon their allowance when fairness appears to require them. We thus conclude the supplemental pleading should have been allowed. Conclusion On most of these several points advanced on appeal, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the District Court. Its reduction of the judgment by the amount of the personal property exemption, we find unwarranted, and we think, upon remand, a motion of the plaintiff to file a supplemental complaint should be granted, so that all relief to which the plaintiff is entitled up to the date of the filing of the supplemental pleading can be awarded. For those purposes, the judgment below, while generally correct, is vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Vacated and remanded. The late Judge HARRY E. WATKINS expressed his approval of the result of the foregoing opinion, but died before the opinion was prepared. ALBERT V. BRYAN, Circuit Judge (dissenting in part). My only disagreement with the opinion of the Court is its failure to allow recovery by the plaintiff of the mortgage interest payments made from the donor's moneys. I do not think it can be said that the satisfaction of the interest obligation failed to enhance the value of the property in the donee's hands. To my mind, it increased her equity as much pro tanto as did the payments on the principal. The interest was as much a mortgage debt and lien as the principal. IfNew Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (1963) \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters.

CONNER , Senior District Judge: Plaintiff Ortho has moved for judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new trial in this action charging infringement by defendant Miles of two patents owned by plaintiff and covering apparatus and methods for photoanalysis of small particles such as blood cells entrained in a thin, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The action was tried before a jury beginning July 5, 1994. On July 22, 1994, the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement and invalidity of all of the patent claims sued upon. Defendant Miles has counter-moved for amendment of the judgment entered July 27, 1994 to include findings of inequitable conduct in the prosecution of one of the two patents in suit and of \"exceptional circumstances\" supporting the award of attorneys fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 . For the reasons stated hereinafter, both motions are denied.THE PATENTS IN SUIT AND THE APPLICATIONS THEREFOR The two patents in suit are U.S. Patent No. 3,705,771 , issued December 12, 1972 on Photoanalysis Apparatus (\"the '771 patent\") and U.S. Patent No. 3,785,735, January 15, 1974 on Photoanalysis Method (\"the '735 patent\"). Both derive from the same original application Serial No. 2,750, filed January 14, 1970 in the names of three inventors, Mitchell Friedman, Louis A. Kamentsky and Isaac Klinger. On January 19, 1972, that application was divided, with the apparatus claims being retained in the original application and a divisional application Serial No. 219,187 being filed containing the method claims. Both patents in suit have expired so that this action is for damages only. THE PATENTED INVENTIONS The specification and drawings of both patents, which are substantially identical, describe and show an apparatus for focusing a beam of light from a source, such as a helium- neon laser, on the liquid containing the particles, such as blood cells, to be analyzed, which liquid is flowing within the cylindrical bore of a glass tube oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the beam. The liquid in which the particles are entrained is surrounded by another liquid, which forms a sheath around the entraining liquid and confines it to an *1076 area near the central axis of the bore in a stream which is of such narrow diameter as to permit the particles to cross the beam axis only one at a time. The light beam is focused on such a small longitudinal portion of the bore that it illuminates only one of the passing particles at a time. However, the beam is oblong at the focal point, being sufficiently wide, in the plane transverse to the axis of the bore, to assure that no particles can pass the beam axis without being illuminated, even though the position of the particle stream might shift laterally within the bore due, for example, to jarring of the apparatus or ambient temperature changes causing expansion or contraction of its components. Depending upon certain characteristics of the particles, for example, the type of the blood cells, they selectively absorb the incident light or scatter it to different angles from the beam axis. The light transmitted through or from the particles is simultaneously detected by several photoresponsive devices respectively arranged to receive light at different angular positions relative to the beam axis.

The dye affects the absorption of the incident light by the cells, and the difference in absorption is detected, for example by a photoresponsive pickup element positioned along the optical axis on the side of the sample chamber opposite from that of the source of light. INFRINGEMENT OF THE '771 PATENT Of the 38 claims of the '771 patent , plaintiff charges that Claims 1, 3, 6, 7, 16 and 32 have been infringed by defendant's manufacture, use and sale of its H-1 family of instruments. Of the six claims in suit, only Claims 1 and 16 are independent claims; Claims 3, 6 and 7 are dependent on Claim 1 and Claim 32 is dependent on Claim 16. The parties stipulated that if either of the two independent claims is infringed, all of the claims dependent on it are also infringed. Claim 1 has been regarded by both parties as typical. It reads (with the elements numbered for convenient reference, and with the only portions in dispute, insofar as concerns the issue of infringement, emphasized): 1. Apparatus for simultaneous optical measurement of several characteristics of each particle of a group of small particles such as blood cells while the particles are suspended in a liquid, comprising (1) a source of light, (2) a housing comprised of a material which transmits light from said source and defining an optical chamber, (3) means for moving the particle suspending liquid through said housing in a thin narrow stream to convey the particles in sequence through the stream one by one, (4) means for directing light from said source into one side of said housing to intersect with the thin stream of particles in a narrow beam substantially converging atthe intersection with the stream of particles and operable to intersect the entire particle stream, and (5) at least two photoresponsive pickup elements positioned outside the housing at different angular positions with respect to the direction of said beam when measured from the intersection with the stream of particles, (6) said photoresponsive pickup elements being effective to simultaneously detect different optical reactions of each particle to illumination from the beam. Claim 16 is similar to Claim 1 except that: (a) Claim 16 requires only one photoresponsive pickup element; and (b) Claim 16 describes the light-directing means of element (4) as: *1077 \"being operable in cooperation with said side of said housing to converge said light beam into a substantially elliptical shape ... the major axis of the elliptical shape of said beam being substantially perpendicular to the direction of the stream of particles and the dimension of said beam at said major axis being substantially greater than the transverse dimension of said particle stream.\" Claim 1 Defendant originally contended that its H-1 instruments did not infringe Claim 1 and the claims dependent on it because, instead of having two photoresponsive pickup elements positioned \"at different angular positions with respect to the direction of said beam;\" they have one pickup element positioned on the axis of the beam and only one whose position is angularly displaced from the axis. Shortly before trial, defendant made a motion for summary judgment of non- infringement of Claim 1 on that ground. In an opinion filed April 8, 1994, the Court denied that motion on the ground that in the patent claims, as properly interpreted in light of the specification and the prosecution history of the patent, the \"photoresponsive pickup elements\" include not only the light sensors themselves, but the mirrors, lenses and other optical elements which pick up the light and direct it to the sensors, and the location of the photoresponsive elements is not determined by the location of the sensors but by the point at which light is picked up for transmission to them. In defendant's H-1 machines, although one of the sensorsOrtho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (1994) 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1263 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5is located on the light beam axis, a dark stop in the light path, having an annular aperture, allows only light picked up at a predetermined range of angular displacement from the beam axis to reach the sensor. Thus the Court determined that Claim 1 should be so construed that this \"photoresponsive pickup element\" could be one of two such elements in the H-1 apparatus \"located at different angular positions with respect to the direction of said beam.\" [1] Although, in a jury case, the issue of infringement is one of fact to be decided by the jury, the construction of the claims is a matter of law to be resolved by the court. Hormone Research Foundation v. Genentech, Inc., 904 F.2d 1558, 1563 n. 7 (Fed.Cir.1990), cert. dismissed, 499 U.S. 955, 111 S.Ct. 1434, 113 L.Ed.2d 485 (1991), citing 885 F.2d 1574, 1579-80 (Fed.Cir.1989) . Accordingly, at the trial, the Court instructed the jury that, as properly interpreted in light of the specification and the prosecution history of the patent, this element of the claims should be given the same construction given it by the Court in its opinion denying defendant's motion for summary judgment, as discussed above. As might be expected, this instruction was specifically approved by plaintiff. Less expectedly, it was apparently accepted by defendant because, in his final argument to the jury, defendant's counsel did not ask for a finding of non-infringement based on the absence of this element in the H-1 instruments. In his opening statement to the jury at the start of the trial, defendant's counsel stated that none of the claims in suit should be found to have been infringed for the additional reason that in defendant's H-1 instruments the light beam is not \"substantially converging at the intersection with the stream of particles,\" as called for in Claim 1 and, in somewhat different words, in the other independent claims of both patents in suit. Defendant's counsel contended that in the H-1 apparatus, the beam converges, in the plane transverse to the particle stream, to a focal point located within the sample housing but slightly in front of the particle stream so that, before the beam reaches the particle stream it has started to diverge again. In its charge at the end of the trial, the Court instructed the jury that the claim language in question requires substantial convergence of the light beam only in the longitudinal plane, so that only one particle at a time is illuminated, and that substantial convergence in the transverse plane is not required; indeed, insofar as the transverse plane is concerned, the claims specify that the beam is sufficiently wide \"to intercept the entire particle stream.\" Again, plaintiff expressly approved this instruction,and defendant apparently accepted it because, in his final argument, defendant's counsel did not ask for a finding of non-infringement based *1078 on the absence of this element in the H-1 instruments. [2] This leaves only one basis on which the jury might properly have found non-infringement of Claim 1, namely the element which calls for \"means for directing light from said light source into one side of said housing....\" Defendant properly contends that the last sentence of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 requires that such a means-plus-function claim element \"shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure ... described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\" The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized that, \"The statute means exactly what it says: ... the court must compare the accused structure with the disclosed structure, and must find equivalent structure as well as identity of claimed function....\" Pennwalt Corp. v. Durand-Wayland, Inc., 833 F.2d 931, denied, 485 961, 108 S.Ct. 1226, 99 L.Ed.2d 426 (1988) . In its charge to the jury in this case, the Court gave appropriate instructions concerning the determination of infringement of means-plus-function claim elements, and the meaning of equivalence in accordance with Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605, 608, 70 S.Ct. 854, 856, 94 L.Ed. 1097 (1950) and its progeny. Plaintiff expressed approval of the charge. Although the jury was not asked to return a special verdict on the issue of equivalence, their verdict of non-infringement was apparently based on a finding that the light system in the accused H-1 instruments is not the equivalent of that disclosed in the patents in suit. [3] Equivalence, or the lack of it, is an issue of fact for a properly instructed jury. Id. at 609, 70 S.Ct. at 856-57. A motion for judgment notwithstanding a jury verdict must be considered under the strict standard set by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Perkin-Elmer Corporation v. Computervision Corp., 732 F.2d 888, 893 (Fed.Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 857, 105 S.Ct. 187, 83 L.Ed.2d 120 (1984): When a party moves for JNOV, the trial court must consider all the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-mover, must draw reasonable inferences favorable to the non-mover, must not determine credibility of witnesses, and must not substitute its choice for that of the jury between conflicting elements of the evidence.Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (1994) 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1263 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6[citations omitted] Following those guidelines, the court determines whether the evidence so viewed constitutes \"substantial evidence\" in support of the jury's findings and, if so, whether those findings can support the legal conclusions necessarily drawn by the jury in accord with its instructions enroute to its verdict. [citation omitted] \"Substantial\" evidence is such relevant evidence from the record taken as a whole as might be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the finding under review. At the trial of this case, defendant introduced evidence of differences between the structure of the light-directing means of its H-1 instruments and that disclosed in the '771 patent and between the results obtained by these means. That evidence established that in the apparatus disclosed in the patent the light beam is focused, by a combination of spherical lenses and a pair of cylindrical lenses oriented perpendicularly to one another, into an elliptical area at the particle stream which is so narrow in the longitudinal plane relative to the stream that it illuminates only one of the passing particles at a time, while being sufficiently broad in the transverse plane that it illuminates the entire particle stream. There was evidence that this optical system produces a distribution of light across the width of the elliptical area which is Gaussian or bell- shaped, with maximum intensity at the center which tapers off toward the lateral edges of the illuminated area, and that particles which pass through outer portions of the target area are therefore illuminated at lower levels of intensity, which might result in a erroneous output reading. The evidence showed that in the optical system of the H-1 instruments, by contrast, the light is focussed on a rectangular slit in a mask, and the image of that rectangular slit is focused on the sample chamber. Defendant's expert witness testified that the mask containing the rectangular slit blocks about 80% of the circular beam *1079 which is directed against it and allows only light from the central portion of the beam to pass through and be imaged at the sample chamber, with the result that the particle stream is illuminated more uniformly across its width and there is less possibility of a erroneous output reading. As noted above, on a motion for JNOV, the Court is limited to a determination of whether such evidence might be accepted by a reasonable juror. I cannot conclude that the evidence referred to above could not be so accepted. It is of noconsequence that, in a non-jury trial, I would have resolved the issue differently. Plaintiff demanded a jury trial and must accept the consequences of that choice. [4] In its Memorandum in support of the motion, plaintiff does not argue the equivalence of the optical system of the H-1 instruments with that disclosed in the patents in suit. Instead, plaintiff merely argues that the issue was foreclosed by defendant's answer to a request for admissions served upon it by plaintiff and by the opening statement of defendant's counsel. Plaintiff's request to admit No. 13 asked defendant to admit that: \"The H-1 has a means for directing light from the light source into one side of the housing.\" [5] Defendant admitted this statement, because the H- 1 instruments undeniably have \"a means\" for directing light into one side of the housing. Plaintiff understandably construed the answer as an admission that the H-1 included the means for directing light called for in Claim 1, because the request which was answered was one of a series which tracked the elements of that claim. However, the way the request was worded gave defendant no alternative but to admit it. It is unfortunate that plaintiff was misled by the answer, but the fault lay in the wording of the request which plaintiff's counsel had drafted. Any ambiguity in a request to admit is construed against the drafter. Talley v. United States, 990 F.2d 695, 699 (1st Cir.) , cert. denied, 510 U.S. 867, 114 S.Ct. 190, 126 L.Ed.2d 148 (1993) . The misleading effect of defendant's answer was compounded by defendant's summaries of the anticipated testimony of its expert witness, Gregory Colella, which were served on plaintiff. In the first summary, dated March 30, 1994, it was stated that: \"Claim 1 of the '771 patent as properly interpreted required a light beam which is shaped by a lens system to converge on a particle stream. The accused devices illuminate a rectangular slit or aperture which is imaged on a flow cell and thus do not have this feature and therefore do not infringe on this basis.\" Because this statement left unclear the reason why this rendered the language of the light-directing element of Claim 1 unreadable on the accused instruments, and because the entire summary was duplicated, in haec verba, in the summary of the anticipated testimony of another witness, inOrtho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (1994) 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1263 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7violation of my local rule against redundant expert testimony, I directed defendant to file amended summaries. The amended summary of Colella's testimony, served on June 10, 1994, added the clause emphasized below: \"The accused device illuminates a rectangular slit or aperture which is imaged on a flow cell, the light beam diverging as the image is formed. \" Thus defendant gave specific notice that, in contending against the readability of the light-directing element of Claim 1 to the H-1 instruments, it would rely upon the divergence of the beam before it reaches the particle stream, with no mention of the claimed advantage that forming an image of an aperture has in enabling more uniform distribution of light intensity across the width of the particle stream. Defendant's misdirection as to its contentions was reinforced by the opening statement of defendant's counsel at the trial that, \"There is [sic] just two things you will be hearing from me about on the infringement.... We don't converge, we diverge. We don't have their pickups, we have our pickups.\" This was an obvious reference to the second and third portions of Claim 1 emphasized above, with no mention of the first emphasized portion. It appears obvious that at that point defendant had decided to base its *1080 contention of non- infringement only on the facts that in the H-1 instruments (1) the beam is diverging in the transverse plane at the point where it impinges on the particle stream and (2) one of the two sensors is located on the axis of the beam. However, during the trial defendant devoted considerable time to the evidence discussed above, to the effect that the light-directing means in the H-1 instruments functions in a different way from the means disclosed in the patents in suit, and with different results, so that the means-plus-function element (4) in Claim 1 is inapplicable to the H-1 instruments. Plaintiff's counsel neither objected to this evidence nor moved for a continuance to permit time to prepare for presentation of evidence to the contrary. Moreover, as mentioned above, after the Court had informed counsel at the charging conference the day before the final arguments were made that it would instruct the jury that the second and third portions of Claim 1 emphasized above should be construed contrary to defendant's contention for a construction that would render these two portions of the claim unreadable on the H-1 instruments, defendant'scounsel did not discuss these elements in his summation, but based his entire argument of non-infringement on the first emphasized portion. This was likewise done without objection from plaintiff's counsel. Thus the jury had before it, without objection, not only evidence on which they could reasonably base a finding of non-equivalence, but also a summation of that evidence. After they have ruled on the evidence, the Court is reluctant to nullify that ruling because they received too much evidence, when all of the evidence was relevant, competent and indisputably admissible but for the lack of proper notice of defendant's intention to introduce it, an omission unremarked at the trial. See Bradford Trust Co. v. Merrill Lynch, 805 F.2d 49, 53 (2d Cir.1986), and Sadowski F.2d 615, 618 (7th Cir.1976) . For these reasons, the Court concludes that the jury's verdict of non-infringement of Claim 1 and the claims dependent on it should not be set aside. Claim 16 [6] Claim 16 includes a \"means for directing light\" element similar to that of Claim 1, and the jury's finding of non- infringement of Claim 16 must therefore be allowed to stand for the reasons given above, and for the additional reason that Claim 16 further requires that the beam is converged \"into a substantially elliptical shape ... at the point of intersection with the position of the thin stream of particles.\" There was evidence that in the H-1 instruments the image of the aperture formed at the particle stream is rectangular, not elliptical, and the jury could reasonably have found that this means-plus- function element was inapplicable to those instruments for lack of equivalence of such a light system to that disclosed in the patents in suit. INFRINGEMENT OF THE '735 PATENT [7] Defendant's only substantial defense against the charge of infringement of the '735 patent was that it had an implied license under that patent by virtue of an express license it had taken under a group of plaintiff's patents covering the use of certain monoclonal antibodies for staining blood cells to permit their differentiation as to cell type. Although, the license agreement recited that no license was granted under any of plaintiff's patents not specifically listed therein, plaintiff knew at the time that defendant intended to use the licensed materials in its H-1 instruments, which would constitute infringement of the '735 patent if there were noOrtho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (1994) 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1263 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8license thereunder, but said nothing to discourage such use. Later defendant wrote plaintiff a letter which clearly indicated defendant's belief that plaintiff had consented to such use and plaintiff apparently did not respond to that letter. That evidence could have convinced a reasonable jury that plaintiff had acquiesced in defendant's use of the patented method and thus is sufficient to defeat plaintiff's motion for JNOV. VALIDITY OF THE '771 AND '735 PATENTS Because both of the patents in suit have expired, the Court's decision to leave undisturbed the jury's finding that neither patent *1081 has been infringed by defendant makes it unnecessary to consider whether to set aside the jury's finding that both patents are invalid. DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR AMENDMENT OF THE JUDGMENT Defendant seeks amendment of the judgment to include findings of inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the application of the '771 patent and of \"exceptional circumstances\" supporting the award of attorneys fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. The inequitable conduct is said to consist of failing to make a timely disclosure to the Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") of two prior patents and one prior publication which were known to the applicants and which disclosed elements of the claimed apparatus which were not disclosed by any of the prior art cited by the PTO. The withheld references include (1) the applicant Kamentsky's own prior U.S. patent No. 3,413,464 issued in 1968 (\"Kamentsky '464\"); (2) an article by Kamentsky and others published in Cancer in 1968; and (3) an article by P. Crosland-Taylor and others published in Blood in 1958. [8] [9] In the seminal case of Precision Instruments Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806, 65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed. 1381 (1945), the Supreme Court established the principle that patent applicants have an \"uncompromising duty of candor\" which requires them to bring to the attention of the PTO any information known to them which might reasonably affect the decision whether to grant a patent on the application. In 1977, this principle was codified in the PTO Rules of Practice, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.56(a), and has been applied by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in a long series of decisions beginning, in the first year of the Court's existence, with Kansas Jack, Inc. v. Kuhn, 719F.2d 1144, 1151 (Fed.Cir.1983). This duty of candor requires applicants to disclose to the PTO any prior art not cited by it which is \"material,\" in the sense that \"a reasonable examiner would consider [it] important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent.\" A.B. Dick Co. (Fed.Cir.1986). [10] [11] The withholding of known, material prior art with the intent of influencing the prosecution of the application constitutes inequitable conduct which renders the resulting patent unenforceable. La Bounty Mfg. Co. v. United States Int'l Trade Commission, 958 F.2d 1066, 1070 (Fed.Cir.1992). In determining whether an applicant has been guilty of inequitable conduct, a court must determine \"whether the withheld references satisfy a threshhold level of materiality\" and \"whether the applicant's conduct satisfies a threshhold showing of intent to mislead.\" Halliburton Co. v. Schlumberger Technology Corp., 925 F.2d 1435, 1439 (Fed.Cir.1991). These two determinations are interrelated and must be balanced against one another. \"The more material the omission, the less culpable the intent required, and vice versa.\" Id. Because inequitable conduct carries the severe consequence of unenforceability of the patent, it must be proved by evidence which is clear and convincing. Tol-O- Matic, Inc. v. Proma Produkt-Und Marketing Gesellschaft, 945 F.2d 1546, 1554 (Fed.Cir.1991). Inequitable conduct must be regarded as the rare exception, and not as \"a magic incantation to be asserted against every patentee.\" FMC v. Manitowoc Co., 835 F.2d 1411, 1415 (Fed.Cir.1987) . Plaintiff here contends (1) that the three references which the applicants allegedly withheld from the PTO were not material in the sense defined above but merely cumulative of the art cited against the application for the '771 patent, and (2) that the applicants, in a Rule 312 amendment filed after a notice of allowance of the application had been mailed, called to the attention of the PTO two of the three references, the Kamentsky '464 patent and the Crosland-Taylor article in Blood. [12] A comparison of the art cited by the PTO with the three references in question and a review of the prosecution history of the '771 patent convinces me that the PTO's failure to consider at least some of the latter references could reasonably have affected the decision to issue the patent. The Crosland-Taylor article discloses an electronic blood- *1082 cell-counting apparatus in which sheath flow is employed to confine the cell-entraining liquid in a stream only about 20 microns in width (as compared to the diameterOrtho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v. Miles Inc., 865 F.Supp. 1073 (1994) 35 U.S.P.Q.2d 1263 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9of blood cells, which ranges from 5 to 15 microns) and convey it at high speed across the optical axis so that only one cell passes the axis at a time and the cells are counted by means of light flashes picked up by a microscope which focuses them on a photoresponsive device connected to an electronic counter. There was no reference cited by the PTO which is as relevant as Crosland-Taylor to the feature described in element (3) of Claim 1 of the '771 patent. The closest cited reference was the Sloan U.S. patent not. 2,816,479. However, as the applicants pointed out in their argument to overcome a rejection of Claim 1 based on Sloan, \"particles do not pass through the Sloan chamber one by one.\" Defendant also argues that the Kamentsky '464 patent and the Kamentsky et al. article in Cancer are more relevant to element (4) of Claim 1 of the '771 patent than any of the art cited by the PTO. The record does not make that apparent. Although, as the applicants pointed out during prosecution of the application for the '771 patent, in the Sloan reference the beam is not \"substantially converging at the intersection with the stream of particles,\" so that only one particle is illuminated at a time, none of the allegedly withheld references contains a clear disclosure of that feature. In the Kamentsky '464 patent, for example, the light is directed by a condenser lens onto an apparently wide area of the flow cell, and an objective lens on the opposite side of the flow cell images a 100-micron section at the center of the flow channel onto an aperture. Nevertheless, the combination of the uncited Crosland-Taylor article with Sloan and/or the cited Parker et al. U.S. patent No. 2,875,666 is a more relevant combination of references than any that was considered by the PTO. The Court therefore concludes that the element of materiality of the allegedly withheld references has been satisfied. Plaintiff urges that an intent on the part of the applicants to mislead the PTO cannot be shown because two of the three references in question were brought to the attention of the PTO in a Rule 312 amendment filed after the Notice of Allowance had been mailed. Defendants correctly point out that, in addition to the lateness of its filing, the amendment did not comply with the PTO requirements for the disclosure of such information and that applicants' experienced patent attorney knew or should have known that in these circumstances the additional art would not be considered by the PTO. Rule 707.05(b) of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, which was in effect during prosecution of the application for the '771 patent, states that such disclosures should be accompanied by a copy of the references and a detailed discussion of them and of themanner in which the claimed subject matter distinguishes over them. None of those requirements was met in this case. Moreover, Rule 707.05(b) provides that disclosures which do not comply with those requirements \"will merely be placed in the file\" and not considered by the PTO. Here applicants were expressly notified that the prior art listed in their late and informal disclosure \"has not been considered since the prosecution in this case has been terminated.\" They could, of course, have insured that this art would be considered by filing a continuation application with a proper and timely information disclosure statement, but they did not avail themselves of that opportunity. [13] However, it remains to be decided whether this is a sufficient showing of intent to support a finding of \"exceptional circumstances\" supporting an award of attorneys fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. As Judge Nies stated in her concurring opinion in Argus Chemical Corp. v. Fibre Glass-Evercoat Co., Inc., 812 F.2d 1381, 1387 (Fed.Cir.1987) : ... our cases reflect three standards for judging the misconduct by a patentee dependent upon the extent of relief which the opposing litigant seeks: (1) misconduct which makes a patent unenforceable (which we have termed \"inequitable conduct\"); (2) misconduct which is sufficient to make a case \"exceptional\" under 35 U.S.C. 285 so as to warrant, in the discretion of the trial judge, an award of attorney fees, and (3) misconduct which rises to the level of common law fraud and which *1083 will support an antitrust claim. As a litigant moves from a purely defensive position, to a recoupment request, to an affirmative claim for damages, it is reasonable to impose more stringent requirements. After thorough consideration of the evidence in this case, I conclude that, even though it might support a finding of inequitable conduct which would bar enforcement of the patent, it falls short of establishing the level of culpability necessary for a finding of \"exceptional circumstances\" which would justify ordering plaintiff to reimburse the attorneys fees paid by defendants. In reaching this determination, I have weighed defendant's own conduct, including its successiveOrtho Diagnostic Systems Inc. v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10changes of position on the issue of infringement, and its failure to give notice in advance of trial that it would adduce evidence in support of its final theory of non-infringement, so that plaintiff was taken by surprise on that issue. SUMMARY I have considered the other attacks made by plaintiff against the jury's verdict, including the charge of an improper summation by defendant's counsel, but find them to bewithout sufficient merit to warrant upsetting the verdict or granting a new trial. For the reasons stated above, both plaintiff's motion for JNOV or for a new trial and defendant's motion for amendment of the judgment are denied in their entirety. So ordered.

Appellate Prosecutors, Elgin, for the People. James O'Dea , Palos Hills, for Barbara Mindham. Opinion Justice GEIGER delivered the opinion of the court: In January 1992, the defendant, Barbara Mindham, was charged with two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) ( Ill.Rev.Stat.1991, ch. 95\u00bd, par. 11-305(a) (now 625 ILCS 5/11-305(a) (West 1992))). These charges arose from the defendant's arrest on January 8, 1992, and the record discloses that a confirmation of a three-month statutory summary suspension of the defendant's driving privilege was issued to her as a first offender. **837 ***682 The State appeals, contending that the trial court erred in considering as admitted the defendant's unanswered written request for the admission of certain facts under Supreme Court Rule 216 (134 Ill.R. 216) and in finding that the defendant's summary suspension should be rescinded. We affirm. Under Rule 216, a party may serve on another party \"a written request for the admission by the latter of the truth of any specified *794 relevant fact set forth in the request.\" (134 Ill.2d R. 216(a) .) Each of the matters of fact requested to be admitted \"is admitted unless, within 28 days after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission either (1) a sworn statement denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit or deny those matters or (2) written objections on the ground that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part. * * * Any objection to a request or to an answer shall be heard by the court upon prompt notice and motion of the party making the request.\" 134 Ill.2d R. 216(c) .People v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3Defendant filed her \"Request to Admit\" on January 21, 1992. In the request, the defendant sought to have admitted 10 statements which are purported to be statements of fact. The defendant raised the issue of the admission of facts before proceeding with the summary suspension hearing held on February 21, 1992. At the hearing, the defendant tendered the original request and the certificate of service. The State conceded that it did not respond to the request to admit, made no formal objection to the use of the admissions or to the service upon it, and did not request additional time to respond to the request. Instead, the State elected to proceed with the hearing, and the defendant stood on her request to admit. The State's witness, Officer Scott Pavlock of the Addison police department, testified regarding the stop of the defendant on January 8, 1992, over the defendant's objections that the facts leading to the stop were admitted. Pavlock observed that defendant's vehicle was traveling eastbound through a gas station at the intersection of Lake Street and Mill Road. The car traveled over a raised median and, instead of turning left, turned northbound on Mill Road in the left turn lane, entered the intersection and continued in the northbound lane of Mill Road. Pavlock saw the vehicle weave several times and travel through two stop signs, slowing down at each stop sign. Pavlock stopped the defendant's vehicle and asked for her driver's license. After fumbling or shuffling through some papers, the defendant located and presented her license. Pavlock observed a strong odor of alcohol; the defendant's eyes appeared bloodshot, glassy and watery, and her speech appeared slurred. In response to Pavlock's questions, the defendant stated she had had three glasses of wine. As she exited the vehicle, she staggered and was unable to *795 walk straight ahead. After conducting field sobriety tests, Pavlock placed her under arrest for DUI. Pavlock further stated that, at the police station booking room, he read the \"Warning to Motorists\" verbatim to the defendant and did not add or delete anything. He gave her a copy of the warning. The defendant later took the test whose result showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.13. Defense counsel refused to cross-examine the witness so as not to waive the use of the admissions. (See Magee v. Walbro, Inc. (1988), 171 Ill.App.3d 774, 780, 121 Ill.Dec. 668, 525 N.E.2d 975 .) The State rested.The trial court deemed the facts in the request admitted into evidence and, upon considering the evidence including that presented by the State, ruled that the defendant's summary suspension must be rescinded on the third ground (of three grounds) specified in the petition to rescind, namely, whether the defendant had been (properly) advised by the arresting officer that her privilege to operate a motor vehicle **838 ***683 would be suspended if she refused to submit and complete a test or tests and whether she refused to submit to or complete such a test or tests. Just prior to the ruling, the defendant argued that statement No. 10 in the request was dispositive because it was deemed admitted and that statement was made by the officer in addition to the warning to motorists which the officer claimed to have read to the defendant. Item No. 10 in the request to admit reads: \"That the officer when warning the Defendant, stated that Defendant's driving's license would be suspended for one year if Defendant refused to submit to breath testing.\" The court's written order granting rescission states: \"Improper warning given.\" The State filed a motion to \"reconsider\" arguing for the first time that the request to admit should have been deemed denied by virtue of the traffic citations and the statements in the law officer's sworn report; the State further argued that the factual statements in the request were improperly admitted because they consisted of \"ultimate facts\" which were \"fairly disputed.\" The State relied on v. Strasbaugh 1012, 141 Ill.Dec. 752, 551 N.E.2d 1095 . On March 19, 1992, the trial court denied the State's motion, noting that its ruling relied \"on one aspect of the Request to Admit and not the ultimate issues.\" This timely appeal followed. On appeal, the State argues that the court's ruling was erroneous because the admissions requested \"clearly went to ultimate issues.\" In addition to item No. 10, the request to admit contained the following items: *796 \"1. That on or about Jan. 8, 1992, Defendant Barbara A. Mindham was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .10 or more, and disobeying a traffic control device. 2. That the officer effectuating the initial stop of Defendant's vehicle did so based upon his observation of the Defendant's vehicle driving into and out of a closed gas station parking lot, located at the intersection of Mill and Lake Street in Addison, IL.People v. Mindham, 253 Ill.App.3d 792 (1993) 625 N.E.2d 835, 192 Ill.Dec. 680 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 43. That as the Defendant approached the intersection of Mill and Lake streets, the traffic control device for traffic traveling in Defendant's direction was green. 4. That prior to entering the gas station parking lot, Defendant had been traveling eastbound on Lake Street. 5. That Defendant drove into the gas station parking lot, and emerged traveling northbound on Mill Street. 6. That Defendant stopped for a red traffic signal for northbound Mill Rd. traffic. 7. That after the aforementioned light turned green, Defendant began to drive northbound on Mill Rd. 8. That Defendant's actions were not in violation of any law of the State of Illinois, or any local ordinance. 9. That the Defendant's actions were not probable cause to effectuate a traffic stop.\" [1] The State contends that item Nos. 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 all \"go to the ultimate issues that would be addressed in a hearing to rescind a statutory summary suspension.\" The State further argues that, under Strasbaugh, the traffic citations and the officer's sworn report act as an immediate denial of the facts raised in the request to admit and that this procedure should not be used where \"ultimate facts are fairly disputed.\" Strasbaugh, . Notwithstanding the State's arguments that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the factual matters in the request to admit, we affirm the trial court's decision for reasons that we will explain further. First, the State ignores the procedural posture of this case on appeal. Second, the State reads Strasbaugh too expansively and appears to rely on dictum found in that case. [2] [3] A statutory summary suspension hearing is civil in nature and proceeds in the same manner as other civil proceedings. **839 ***684 (People v. Gerke (1988), 123 Ill.2d 85, 93, 121 Ill.Dec. 262, 525 N.E.2d 68.) The provisions allowing for requests to admit are well established and have been said to apply in *797 all civil actions unless there is a special statute to the contrary. (Wintersteen v. National Cooperage & Woodenware Co. (1935), 361 Ill. 95, 109-10, 197 N.E. 578 .) The purposes of these provisions are to expedite litigation, to obviate the difficulty andexpense in procuring evidence, and to compel an admission by the adverse party of evidence which is generally of incontrovertible character. (Wintersteen, 361 Ill. at 108, 110, 197 N.E. 578 .) Rule 216 enables \"the parties and the court to limit the issues and to reduce the production of unnecessary proof at trial.\" Smoot v. Knott An admission pursuant to a request to admit operates as a judicial admission which is binding and is considered incontrovertible. ( Rosbottom v. Hensley (1965), 61 Ill.App.2d 198, 215, 209 N.E.2d 655.) A judicial admission in turn is defined as \"a formal act of the party or his attorney in court, dispensing with proof of a fact claimed to be true and is used as a substitute for legal evidence at the trial.\" ( Rosbottom, 61 Ill.App.2d at 215, 209 N.E.2d 655.) It has even been stated that judicial admissions \" 'are not evidence at all but rather have the effect of withdrawing a fact from contention.' \" Brummet v. Farel (1991), 217 Ill.App.3d 264, 267, 160 Ill.Dec. 278, 576 N.E.2d 1232, quoting M. Graham, Evidence Text, Rules, Illustrations and Problems, at 146 (1983). [6] [7] [8] Under the modern rule, the effect of ignoring a request to admit is that the matters contained in the request automatically stand admitted. (Iversen v. Iversen (1960), 28 Ill.App.2d 45, 55, 169 N.E.2d 822; see, e.g., Koca v. Gavin (1990), 145 Ill.Dec. 557 N.E.2d 432; Antonovich 102 Ill.Dec. 150, 499 N.E.2d 707; Homer G. Dickson & Co. 5, 70 Ill.Dec. 643, 449 N.E.2d 990 .) More recently, the strictness of the rule seems to have been mollified to permit the trial court discretion in allowing a party who has failed to respond or object to the request to move for an extension of time to answer for good cause shown. ( Koca, 558 794 (and numerous cases cited therein).) However, mere inadvertence in responding or objecting to a request to admit would not ordinarily equate with good cause shown. (See Smoot, 200 Ill.App.3d at 1099, 146 Ill.Dec. 831, 558 N.E.2d 794.) Thus, in appropriate cases, where a request to admit concerns the central issue in the case and the requesting party cannot show prejudice from a late response, the court may allow a late response. Thomas v. Village of Westchester (1985), 132 Ill.App.3d 190, 194, 87 Ill.Dec. 448, 477 N.E.2d 49 .People v. Mindham, 253 Ill.App.3d 792 (1993) 625 N.E.2d 835, 192 Ill.Dec. 680 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5[9] [10] In the case at bar, the State conceded that it did not respond to the request to admit; it made no specific, formal objection to the use of the admissions or to the service upon it and did not request an extension of time to respond to the request. Instead, after *798 the hearing was concluded, the State argued that the admissions were improperly admitted. The State failed to avail itself of the proper remedy and acquiesced in conducting the hearing with the factual matters admitted (see People v. Miller (1983), 120 Ill.App.3d 495, 501, 75 Ill.Dec. 814, 457 N.E.2d 1373 (acquiescence to procedure amounts to waiver)). Since the State failed to avail itself of the proper recourse, the State has waived any objection to the propriety or relevance of the admissions requested in the notice. (Banks v. United Insurance Co. of America (1975), 28 Ill.App.3d 60, 63, 328 N.E.2d 167.) The failure to object to the admission of evidence operates as a waiver of the right to consider the question on appeal. (People v. Carlson (1980), 79 Ill.2d 564, 576, 38 Ill.Dec. 809, 404 N.E.2d 233 .) \"The law does not allow parties to lawsuits to sit by and permit allegedly improper evidence to be introduced without objection and then claim error on appeal.\" ( **840 ***685 Lawing v. Chicago Transit Authority (1986), 142 Ill.App.3d 119, 123, 96 Ill.Dec. 331, 491 N.E.2d 145.) Neither may a party attempt to preserve error by first raising the objection in a post-trial motion and then on appeal. Lawing, 142 Ill.App.3d at 123, 96 Ill.Dec. 331, 491 N.E.2d 145. Even if we reach the merits of the State's argument that the admissions were improperly considered by the trial court, we conclude that the court properly considered the admissions. We also do not find Strasbaugh dispositive of the State's contention. Through the use of the procedure to request admissions of fact, \"a party is able to ascertain what facts are to be disputed and what may be admitted.\" (2 S. Gard, Illinois Evidence Manual, Comment, at 277 (2d ed. 1979) (hereinafter Gard).) If the opposing party denies or objects to the existence of the fact, \"the party serving the demand is put on notice that his adversary has information which conflicts with his and he may wisely proceed\" with further discovery. (Gard, at 277.) Furthermore, the \"scope of a request for admissions of fact is not limited except that it must be a clear expression of the fact that is asserted, must not call for conclusions or opinions of law, and must be confined to relevant matters. It need not be confined to ultimate issues.\" Gard, at 277. [11] We agree that this procedure should not be used to admit conclusions or opinions of law. (See Sims v. City of Alton (1988), 172 Ill.App.3d 694, 699, 122 Ill.Dec. 538, 526N.E.2d 931 .) While the use of the procedure to request the admission of controverted facts should be avoided ( Sims, 172 Ill.App.3d at 699, 122 Ill.Dec. 538, 526 N.E.2d 931 ), it will frequently not be known until the opposing party responds whether a given fact will be controverted. We are not persuaded that, because the facts sought to be admitted \"clearly went to the ultimate issues,\" as the State argues, they were necessarily considered improperly. Rule 216 requires that the *799 facts sought to be admitted be relevant; therefore, those facts will necessarily go to the \"ultimate issues\" of the case. Indeed, the cases discussing the court's discretion to allow an opposing party's request for an extension of time to respond require that the facts concern a \"central issue in the case.\" Thomas v. Village of Westchester, 132 Ill.App.3d at 194, 87 Ill.Dec. 448, 477 N.E.2d 49. In Strasbaugh, a summary suspension case, defense counsel filed a request to admit certain facts which included conclusions of law such as these: that at the time of the stop the arresting officer did not have probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed any offense; that the officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe the defendant was driving while under the influence of alcohol; that the defendant was not properly warned that her privilege to drive would be suspended; and that the defendant did not refuse to take a breath test at the request of the arresting officer. At the hearing, the defendant presented a motion for summary judgment based on the State's failure to respond to the request for admission of facts under Rule 216. The trial court ruled that Rule 216 did not apply to summary suspension cases, that the defendant was not entitled to file such a request, and that the State had no obligation to respond. The cause was then heard on the merits, and the court denied the defendant's petition to rescind. On appeal, the issues in Strasbaugh were (1) whether the trial court improperly denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the request to admit and (2) whether the court's findings were against the manifest weight of the evidence. The reviewing court first held that the denial of a motion for summary judgment was not reviewable under the circumstances, particularly where there was an evidentiary hearing on the merits. Without deciding whether Rule 216 applied in this type of case and in what appears to be dictum, the court went on to add that the facts sought to be admitted were the \"ultimate facts of the case.\" Without citation to authority, the reviewing court concluded that the traffic citation and the officer's swornPeople v. Mindham, 253 Ill.App.3d 792 (1993) 625 N.E.2d 835, 192 Ill.Dec. 680 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6report constituted a denial of the facts sought to be admitted and the request improperly sought the admission **841 ***686 of N.E.2d 1095.) Citing historical and practice notes, the court stated that a \"request to admit facts is designed to eliminate the need to prove facts which are not in dispute, and it is not appropriate for a party to prove her case by use of this procedure where ultimate facts are fairly disputed.\" (Strasbaugh, 194 Ill.App.3d Historical & Practice *800 Notes, at 366 (Smith- Hurd 1985).) Finally, the court held that the trial court's determination on the merits was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. [12] Because of the significant factual differences between the case at bar and those of Strasbaugh, we do not find Strasbaugh controlling here. First, unlike the factual matters sought to be admitted in the present case (excepting possibly item Nos. 8 and 9 upon which the court did not rely), the facts sought to be admitted in Strasbaugh were clearly in the nature of conclusions of law which the court would have to decide after a hearing, i.e., whether the officer had probable cause or whether a warning was properly given. We agree with the comments in Strasbaugh concerning \"ultimate facts\" only to the extent that they suggest that conclusions of law turning on disputed facts should not be included in a request to admit. However, as we have pointed out, it will frequently be unknown to the requesting party beforehand whether a fact will be controverted. To avoid the admission of such facts, the opposing party's remedy is to deny or object to the matters sought to be admitted in conformance with the rule. Next, statement No. 10 upon which the court relied requested the State to admit or deny whether the officer had made a statement which appears not to have been included in the officer's sworn report or in the traffic citations. Defense counsel argued that the statement was made in addition to the matters contained in those documents. Therefore, those documents could not serve a priori as a denial of that statement. Additionally, item Nos. 1 through 7 were factual statements which could readily be admitted or denied asthey concerned background facts leading to the arrest of the defendant and do not appear inconsistent with the matters contained in the citations or sworn reports or even the officer's testimony. Furthermore, since the statements relied on by the court were not clearly and specifically denied by the State's previously filed documents, those documents should not be viewed as responsive to the request to admit. Permitting such previously filed documents to stand as specific denials of the factual matters in the request would not comport with the intent of Rule 216 . See Homer G. Dickson & Co. v. Barraza, 115 Ill.App.3d at 8, 70 Ill.Dec. 643, 449 N.E.2d 990 (specific factual matters in the request to admit were not contained in the complaint, and defendant's answer denying material allegations in the complaint could not be viewed as answer to the request and a denial of the particular facts stated in the request). *801 We conclude that, by failing to respond or object to the defendant's request to admit or to seek an extension of time to do so, the State waived any objection to the admissions of fact. Additionally, even in the absence of waiver, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to treat as admitted the facts stated in the defendant's request to admit. The State's failure to respond to the request to admit operated as an admission of the facts included in the request, and the admitted facts relied on by the court were not conclusions of law. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. Affirmed. BOWMAN and COLWELL, JJ., concur.

Opinion Chief Justice HARRISON delivered the opinion of the court: Following a jury trial in the circuit court of Hancock County, defendant, Daniel Ramsey, was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, three counts of attempted first degree murder, and one count each of aggravated criminal sexual assault, home invasion and residential burglary. In finding defendant guilty of these offenses, the jury rejected defendant's claim that he was insane under section 6-2 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as amended **534 ***883 by section 15 of Public Act 89-404 (720 ILCS 5/6-2 (West 1996)). The jury also determined that defendant was eligible for the death penalty based on the cold, calculated and premeditated manner of the crimes. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(b)(11) (West 1996). After a sentencing hearing, the jury found that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of a death sentence. The trial court then sentenced defendant to death. In addition, the court sentenced defendant to terms of imprisonment on his convictions for attempted murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, home invasion, and residential burglary. Defendant's death sentence has now been stayed pending direct review by this court. Ill. Const.1970, art. VI, \u00a7 4 (b); 134 Ill.2d Rs. 603, 609(a). For the reasons that follow, we reverse defendant's convictions and remand for a new trial. [1] At issue in this appeal is the law governing defendant's *156 insanity defense. The trial proceedings utilized the version of the insanity defense statute as amended by section 15 of Public Act 89-404 because that was the version of the law in effect when the crimes were allegedly committed. The amended version of the law was significant because it altered the definition of insanity. Under the amendment, a defendant could no longer raise an insanity defense based on his inability \"to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\"1 In addition, the amendment increased a defendant's burden of proof for an insanity defense from \"a preponderance of the evidence\" to \"clear and convincing evidence.\" See Pub. Act 89-404, \u00a7 15 (eff. August 20, 1995), codified at 720 ILCS 5/6-2(a), (e) (West 1996). When defendant's insanity defense failed, he argued in his post-trial motion that the amended version of the insanitydefense statute was unconstitutional and should not have been followed because Public Act 89-404 violated the single subject rule in article IV, section 8, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const.1970, art. IV, \u00a7 8(d)). Defendant asserted that because of Public Act 89-404's constitutional infirmities, he should have been tried under the former version of the law with its broader definition of insanity and its less stringent burden of proof. Although the trial court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge, its ruling came before our opinion in People v. Reedy, 186 Ill.2d 1, 237 Ill.Dec. 74, 708 N.E.2d 1114 (1999) , which was filed while this appeal was pending. In Reedy our court held that Public Act 89-404 does violate the single subject rule and is unconstitutional in its entirety. Reedy, 186 Ill.2d at 12, 237 Ill.Dec. 74, 708 N.E.2d 1114 . As a result, the law is void ab initio; \" '[i]t is * * * as though no such law had ever been passed.' \" People v. *157 Gersch, 135 Ill.2d 384, 399, 142 Ill.Dec. 767, 553 N.E.2d 281 (1990) , quoting People v. Schraeberg, 347 Ill. 392, 394, 179 N.E. 829 (1932) . Section 6-2 of the Criminal Code therefore remained as it was before the adoption of Public Act 89-404's amendments (Gersch, 135 Ill.2d at 390, 142 Ill.Dec. 767, 553 N.E.2d 281 ), and those amendments should not have been applied at defendant's trial. The judgment of the circuit court must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with the version of the law in effect prior to Public Act 89-404. [2] In reaching this conclusion, we note that the General Assembly has now enacted new legislation containing the same revisions to the insanity defense statute originally included in Public Act 89-404. The new legislation, set forth in Public Act 90-593, section 15, is not claimed to suffer from the same single subject rule problems that rendered Public Act 89-404 invalid, and we must presume it to be constitutional **535 ***884 (see People v. Hickman, 163 Ill.2d 250, 257, 206 Ill.Dec. 94, 644 N.E.2d 1147 (1994) ). The new law, however, cannot be applied on retrial. [3] Application of criminal or penal measures to events occurring before their enactment is restricted by article I, section 10, of the United States Constitution, which provides that \"[n]o State shall * * * pass any * * * ex post facto Law\" (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10) and by article I, section 16, of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const.1970, art. I, \u00a7 16), which contains similar language. Our court has held that a \"law is ex post facto if it makes criminal an act that was innocent when done, if it increases the punishment for a previously committed offense, or if it alters the legal rules of evidencePeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3to make conviction easier.\" People v. Shumpert, 126 128 Ill.Dec. 18, 533 N.E.2d 1106 (1989); accord People v. Ill.2d 78, 107, 142 Ill.Dec. 152, 552 N.E.2d 743 (1990) ; see Brewer v. Peters, 262 Ill.App.3d 610, 613, 198 Ill.Dec. 555, 633 N.E.2d 17 (1994). A law which abolishes an affirmative defense of justification or excuse constitutes an ex post facto law because \"it expands the scope of a criminal prohibition after the act *158 is done.\" Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 49, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2723, 111 L.Ed.2d 30, 43 (1990) ; see also Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 169, 46 S.Ct. 68, 68, 70 L.Ed. 216, 217 (1925) (a law is ex post facto if it \"deprives one charged with [a] crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed\"). Under these standards, application of Public Act 90-593 to defendant's case would violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws for two reasons. First, it would deprive defendant of an affirmative defense he possessed under the former version of the statute, namely, that he is not guilty because he lacked the capacity \" 'to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.' \" See United States v. Samuels, 801 F.2d 1052, 1054 & n. 1 (8th Cir.1986) (holding ex post facto clause precludes retroactive application of amendment to federal insanity defense statute eliminating identical prong of insanity defense), quoting United States v. Frazier, 458 F.2d 911, 918 (8th Cir.1972); United States v. Kowal, 596 F.Supp. 375, 378 610 F.Supp. 210, 212-13 (S.D.Tex.1985) (same). Second, by increasing the burden of proof a defendant must meet in order to establish that he was insane at the time of the offense, the amendment makes it easier for the State to secure a conviction. See, e.g., People v. Eckhardt, 156 Ill.App.3d 1077, 1080, 109 Ill.Dec. 349, 509 N.E.2d 1361 (1987) (holding that shift in burden of proof relating to insanity defense would be improper ex post facto application of statute if applied to a trial for an offense committed prior to the amendment to the law); People v. Ahmad, 206 Ill.App.3d 927, 937, 151 Ill.Dec. 866, 565 N.E.2d 137 (1990) (same). In a supplemental brief ordered by our court, the State agrees with this conclusion and concedes that an application of Public Act 90-593's provisions at defendant's retrial would violate ex post facto principles. For the foregoing reasons, defendant's convictions *159 and sentences are reversed, and this cause is remanded for a new trial. On retrial, defendant shall be allowed to assert an insanity defense in accordance with section 6-2 of theCriminal Code as it existed prior to the amendments contained in Public Acts 89-404 and 90-593. Specifically, defendant shall be allowed to present an insanity defense based on his inability to conform his conduct to the law. In addition, he shall only be required to prove his insanity at the time of the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. Reversed and remanded with directions. Justice BILANDIC , specially concurring: I agree with the holding that Public Act 89-404 is void ab initio. **536 ***885 During the pendency of this appeal, the General Assembly enacted a different act, Public Act 90- 593. Public Act 90-593 reenacted the amendment to the insanity defense statute that was originally included in the void act. The parties' initial briefs did not address the effect of Public Act 90-593 on this case. Consequently, this court sua sponte ordered supplemental briefing. We directed the parties to brief the issues of \"whether Public Act 90-593 applies retroactively to [defendant] and, if so, whether retroactive application of Public Act 90-593 would violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto application of the law.\" The parties complied. Defendant maintains that Public Act 90-593 does not apply retroactively to him under principles of statutory construction. In the alternative, defendant asserts that retroactive application would result in ex post facto violations. The State does not address whether Public Act 90-593 applies retroactively to defendant. Nonetheless, the State concedes that retroactive application would violate the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The majority opinion determines that the constitutional *160 prohibitions against ex post facto laws prohibit retroactive application of Public Act 90-593 to defendant. I would not address the ex post facto issue, for the reasons explained below. Ex post facto literally means after the fact. Black's Law Dictionary 520 (5th ed. 1979). Both the United States and Illinois Constitutions prohibit the state from enacting an ex post facto law. U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10 (providing that \"[n]o State shall * * * pass any * * * ex post facto Law\"); Ill.People v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4Const.1970, art. I, \u00a7 16 (providing that \"[n]o ex post facto law * * * shall be passed\"). Essentially, this prohibition means that the legislature cannot change a criminal or penal law, after the fact, to be less favorable to a defendant regarding events that occurred before the change. See generally Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 120 S.Ct. 1620, 146 L.Ed.2d 577 (2000) (discussing meaning of prohibition). It therefore follows that the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws are not implicated unless the legislature is changing a law after the fact. Here, because legislative intent is clear that Public Act 90-593 is not to be applied retroactively, there is no reason to conduct an ex post facto analysis. The principle is well established that courts will not consider a constitutional question if the cause can be determined on other grounds. E.g., People ex rel. Waller v. 1990 Ford Bronco, 158 Ill.2d 460, 464, 199 Ill.Dec. 694, 634 N.E.2d 747 (1994) . Consequently, I would determine this cause solely on the basis that Public Act 90-593 does not apply retroactively to defendant. I. Applicable Precedent This case is analogous to People v. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d 24, 50, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 (1997). There, this court was presented with an issue of whether an amendment to a statute would apply in that appeal. Defendant was convicted of the offense of obstructing justice. The State, however, failed to prove at trial the venue in which the offense occurred. Because venue was an established element of the *161 offense, this failure necessitated reversal of that conviction. After defendant's trial, the venue statute was amended to remove the necessity of proving venue to obtain a criminal conviction. The State argued that the amended statute should be applied on appeal to sustain defendant's conviction. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d at 49-50, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 . In resolving this issue, this court in Digirolamo followed a long line of Illinois cases where, in determining whether the amendment applied, we utilized the legislative intent approach and its substantive-procedural distinction. Under this approach, an amendment to a statute is generally construed to apply prospectively and not retroactively, unless the legislature intended a retroactive application of the **537 ***886 amendment and the amendment affects only procedure or remedies. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d at 50, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116. Accordingly, this test begins with the presumption that a new statute will not beapplied on appeal unless the legislature expressly provides for such application. The language of the amendment at issue showed that the legislature did not intend a retroactive application. Also, the amendment effected a change in more than procedure or remedies. We therefore held that the amendment could not be applied retroactively to defendant, and we reversed his conviction for that offense. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d at 50-52, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 . Given that the amendment was not applied retroactively to defendant, there was no possibility of an ex post facto violation. In the present case, there is no indication that the legislature intended Public Act 90-593 to apply retroactively. Also, the statutory amendment at issue affects substantive rights, not procedure or remedies. Therefore, pursuant to Digirolamo, Public Act 90-593 cannot be applied retroactively to defendant. This appeal could be resolved on that basis alone. II. Inapplicable Precedent As noted, this case turns on whether the amendment *162 to the insanity defense statute contained in Public Act 90- 593 may be applied retroactively to defendant. Digirolamo and First of America Trust Co. v. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d 282, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (1996) , contain seemingly contradictory statements concerning when to apply an amended statute on appeal. Digirolamo provides that, \"[g]enerally, an amendment to a statute will be construed to apply prospectively and not retroactively\" unless the legislature intended a retroactive application of the amendment and the amendment affects only procedure or remedies. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d at 50, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 . Armstead states that, with regard to statutory amendments, \"a reviewing court should simply apply the law as it exists at the time of the appeal, unless doing so would interfere with a vested right.\" Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 290, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 . Thus, each of these statements appears to be a generally applicable canon of statutory construction for courts to follow when determining whether an amended statute will be applied on appeal. On their face, the canon in Digirolamo favors prospective application whereas the canon in Armstead favors retroactive application. Although these canons are opposed on their face, there is no conflict between the holdings of Digirolamo and Armstead. Each decision relied on a line of case law thatPeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5supported its outcome and that followed its pertinent canon of statutory construction. The United States Supreme Court recently observed, \"It is not uncommon to find 'apparent tension' between different canons of statutory construction. As Professor Llewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional canons have equal opposites.\" Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 263, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1496, 128 L.Ed.2d 229, 251 (1994). Therefore, \"another canon of unquestionable vitality\" useful to remember when faced with this scenario is \"the 'maxim * * * that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which *163 those expressions are used.' \" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 265, 114 S.Ct. at 1497, 128 L.Ed.2d at 252, quoting Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257, 290 (1821) . As discussed above, the present appeal is analogous to Digirolamo. Both this case and Digirolamo involved statutory amendments to a criminal statute and potential ex post facto violations. Armstead, on the other hand, is not applicable to this appeal. Unlike the present case, Armstead concerned a statutory amendment to a civil statute that possibly implicated rights vested under our due process clause (Armstead, 171 Ill.2d 282, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 ). See **538 Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29-30, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964-65, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, 23-24 (1981) ***887 (explaining that, in addressing whether application of a statutory amendment would violate ex post facto principles, it is not relevant whether the statutory change touches on any vested right). Nevertheless, given the confusion that has resulted from the two canons, I take this opportunity to explain the legal history behind the canons. I then propose that this court adopt a new test for determining when a new or amended statute will be applied on appeal to pending cases. In Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), the United States Supreme Court similarly was faced with seemingly contradictory canons of statutory construction for determining when a new federal statute will be applied on appeal to pending cases. The Supreme Court successfully reconciled the principles underlying the two canons into a single test. We should do likewise here. III. Historical Presumption Against the Retroactive Application of StatutesHistorically, there has been a presumption against the retroactive application of statutes. Both this court and the United States Supreme Court have discussed this presumption. *164 This court has reviewed the origin and rationale of the presumption as follows. \"As a general matter it is clear that prospective application of statutes is to be preferred to retroactive, or retrospective, application. This preference has existed from time out of mind. 'The doctrine that legislation must be prospective in character is traceable to Coke and Bracton, who recognized it as a rule of construction founded on doctrines of natural law, and it was incorporated into American jurisprudence by the learned jurists Kent and Story.' ( Orlicki v. McCarthy (1954), 4 Ill.2d 342, 346 [122 N.E.2d 513].) The doctrine has sometimes been treated as a constitutional restraint on legislation, and sometimes as a rule of statutory construction. [Citations.] The preference for prospectivity is founded upon: '[the] fundamental principle of jurisprudence that retroactive application of new laws is usually unfair. There is a general consensus that notice or warning of the rule should be given in advance of the actions whose effects are to be judged * * *. * * * ' 1A A. Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.02, at 340-41 (4th ed. 1986). It has thus been our general rule of construction that an amendatory act will be construed as prospective. [Citations.] * * * * * * Since no statute will violate the Constitution merely because it operates prospectively, prospectivity is to be preferred.\" Rivard v. Chicago Fire Fighters Union, Local No. 2, 122 Ill.2d 303, 308-09, 119 Ill.Dec. 336, 522 N.E.2d 1195 (1988) . The United States Supreme Court has also explained the basis for its traditional presumption against the retroactive application of statutes. \"The presumption against the retroactive application of new laws is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual citizen. That presumption 'is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.' [Citation.]\" Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 439, 117 S.Ct. 891, 895, 137 L.Ed.2d 63, 71 (1997). \"Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity *165 to know whatPeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 6the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 265, 114 S.Ct. at 1497, 128 L.Ed.2d at 252. \"This doctrine finds expression in several provisions of our Constitution. The specific prohibition on ex post facto laws is only one aspect of the broader constitutional protection against arbitrary changes in the law. In both the civil and the criminal context, the Constitution **539 ***888 places limits on the sovereign's ability to use its lawmaking power to modify bargains it has made with its subjects.\" Lynce, 519 U.S. at 439-40, 117 S.Ct. at 895, 137 L.Ed.2d at 71 . The Supreme Court has elaborated on the various federal constitutional provisions that possibly may be violated by a retroactive application of new statutes. \" 'The Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits retroactive application of penal legislation. Article I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 , prohibits States from passing another type of retroactive legislation, laws 'impairing the Obligation of Contracts.' The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving private persons of vested property rights except for a 'public use' and upon payment of 'just compensation.' The prohibitions on 'Bills of Attainder' in Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10, prohibit legislatures from singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. [Citation.] The Due Process Clause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose that may be compromised by retroactive legislation....' [Citation.]\" Lynce, 519 U.S. at 440 n. 12, 117 S.Ct. at 895 n. 12, 137 L.Ed.2d at 71 n. 12 , quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 266, 114 S.Ct. at 1497, 128 L.Ed.2d at 253 . The above list of potential constitutional problems is not exhaustive. For example, both this court and the Supreme Court have concluded that retroactive application of a statute may violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995) ; In re Marriage of Cohn, 93 Ill.2d 190, 203-04, 66 Ill.Dec. 615, 443 N.E.2d 541 (1982). *166 As the foregoing discussion shows, a general presumption against the retroactive application of statutes is deeply embedded in our legal history. This presumption initially was rooted in fairness and freedom from arbitrary governmental actions. Later, this presumption was expressed in various constitutional provisions. Consequently, applying statutes prospectively has been the preferred practice becauseit avoids the myriad constitutional problems that may arise from applying a statute retroactively. IV. Historical Exceptions to the Presumption Against the Retroactivity of Statutes For nearly as long as the general presumption against the retroactive application of statutes has existed, jurists have also recognized that the retroactive application of a statute is desirable in certain situations. Hence, legal history records the development of a number of exceptions to the general presumption against retroactivity. The following discussion demonstrates that certain exceptions have long existed to the general presumption against the retroactive application of statutes. This list is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. Illinois has, for example, long recognized the exception that a new or amended statute may be applied retroactively on appeal where the legislature intended a retroactive application of the statute and the statute affects only procedure or remedies. See, e.g., People v. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d 24, 50, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 (1997); Rivard v. Chicago Fire Fighters Union, Local No. 2, 122 Ill.2d 303, 310, 119 Ill.Dec. 336, 522 N.E.2d 1195 (1988); Orlicki v. (1954); Theodosis v. Express Co., 341 Ill.App. 8, 92 N.E.2d 794 (1950) ; see also In re Pronger, 118 Ill.2d 512, 522, 115 Ill.Dec. 390, 517 N.E.2d 1076 (1987) (noting that our General Assembly incorporated part of this exception into the Illinois Statute on Statutes), quoting Orlicki, 4 Ill.2d at 346, 122 N.E.2d 513, quoting Ill.Rev.Stat.1953, ch. 131, par. 4. This court's decision in Digirolamo illustrates *167 the application of this exception. The United States Supreme Court continues to recognize a principle that is similar in application. See **540 Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273-74, 275, 114 1502, 128 L.Ed.2d at 257, 258 ***889 (allowing statutory changes in procedure or in prospective relief to be applied on appeal, but characterizing those changes as not truly retroactive in effect). Another exception found in Illinois law is that a statutory amendment may be applied \"retroactively\" where the legislature enacted the amendment merely to clarify an existing law that was ambiguous, rather than to change the law. In re Marriage of Cohn, 93 Ill.2d 190, 202, 66 Ill.Dec. 615, 443 N.E.2d 541 (1982); see, e.g., Varelis v. Memorial 461-63, 212 Ill.Dec. 652, 97 Ill.2d 533, 540-People v. Ramsey, 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 741, 74 Ill.Dec. 34, 455 N.E.2d 64 (1983) ; People ex rel. Spitzer v. County of La Salle, 20 Ill.2d 18, 28, 169 N.E.2d 521 (1960). Like the exception discussed above, this exception gives effect to the legislature's intent in drafting the statute. A third exception long recognized in Illinois law concerns \"nonvested rights.\" This exception is best understood by discussing its origin. Justice Story, the same learned jurist who has been credited with incorporating into American jurisprudence the general presumption against the retroactive application of statutes, in 1814, wrote Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F.Cas. 756 (C.C.N.H.1814) (No. 13,156). There, sitting on circuit, Justice Story was construing a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that broadly prohibited all \"retrospective\" laws. In doing so, he offered what today remains the basic definition of a statutory law that is operating with truly retroactive effect. \"Justice Story first rejected the notion that the provision bars only explicitly retroactive legislation, i.e., 'statutes ... enacted to take effect from a time anterior to their passage.' [Citation.] Such a construction, he concluded, would be 'utterly subversive of all the objects' *168 of the prohibition. [Citation.] Instead, the ban on retrospective legislation embraced 'all statutes, which, though operating only from their passage, affect vested rights and past transactions.' [Citations.]\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 268- 69, 114 S.Ct. 128 L.Ed.2d at 254 . Justice Story elaborated: \"Upon principle, every statute, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective.\" Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, 22 F.Cas. at 767 . Both this court and the Supreme Court have long utilized Justice Story's definition of what constitutes a retroactive law. See, e.g., Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 268-70, 114 S.Ct. at 1498-99, 128 L.Ed.2d at 254-55; First of America Trust Co. v. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d 282, 290, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (1996) (and cases cited therein); Theodosis v. Keeshin Motor Express Co., 341 Ill.App. 8, 92 N.E.2d 794 (1950) . Unlike New Hampshire, Illinois has never had an express constitutional prohibition of retrospective laws. See Theodosis, 341 Ill.App. at 12, 92 N.E.2d 794 . Nonetheless, our legislature in 1874 set forth a general presumption against statutory retroactivity in our Statute on Statutes ( Orlicki v. McCarthy, 4 Ill.2d 342, 346, 122 N.E.2d 513 (1954), quoting Ill.Rev.Stat.1953, ch. 131, par.4), which still appears on the books today (see 5 ILCS 70/4 (West 1998) ). In the same manner that Justice Story limited the reach of New Hampshire's constitutional prohibition of \"retrospective\" laws to only those laws with truly retroactive effect, this court has limited the reach of Illinois' statutory presumption against retroactive laws to only those laws with truly retroactive effect. This court did this by creating a broad exception to the Statute on Statute's presumption against statutory retroactivity for \"nonvested rights.\" . This \"nonvested rights\" exception to the general presumption against the retroactive application of *169 statutes remains in Illinois, **541 ***890 though, over time, it came to be treated in a line of cases as its own general rule. See Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 289-90, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (and cases cited therein). Stated as a general rule, or canon, this exception came to provide that \"a reviewing court should * * * apply the law as it exists at the time of the appeal, unless doing so would interfere with a vested right.\" Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 290, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36. First of America Trust Co. v. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d 282, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (1996), typifies application of this third exception. In Armstead, this court was presented with an issue of whether an amendment to a statute would apply in that appeal. Plaintiff wanted to register its underground storage tanks pursuant to the Gasoline Storage Act (Act) (430 ILCS 15/0.01 et seq. (West 1992)) so that it would qualify for monies for cleanup. The Act was amended during the appeal. The amendment expressly stated that underground storage tanks taken out of operation before January 2, 1974, could not be registered. It was undisputed that plaintiff's tanks were taken out of operation before that date and, thus, could not be registered if the new amendment applied. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 284-87, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 . The amendment implicated plaintiff's due process rights. In determining whether the amendment would be applied on appeal to the parties' existing controversy, this court in Armstead defined retroactivity in words nearly identical to those used by Justice Story nearly two centuries before: \"The application of an amendment to an existing controversy does not necessarily constitute retroactivity. '[I]t is well settled that a statute is not retroactive just because it relates to antecedent events, or because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.' [Citation.] Instead, this court has defined a retroactive change in the law as ' \"one that takes away or impairs vested rights acquiredPeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past.\" ' [Citation.]\" Armstead, 171 Ill.2d opinion further stated: \"With this understanding of retroactivity, there is little reason to focus on legislative intent. The legislature is without constitutional authority to enact a law that is truly retroactive, in that it impairs vested rights, even if that is its expressed intention. [Citation.] Moreover, where an amendment has no such retroactive impact, there is simply no need to apply further rules of construction to determine legislative intent because the amendment by definition has only prospective application. Thus, a reviewing court should simply apply the law as it exists at the time of the appeal, unless doing so would interfere with a vested right.\" Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 290, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36. The opinion determined that plaintiff did not have a vested right to register its underground storage tanks under the preamended Act. Since no vested right was at issue, the opinion held that the amended Act would be applied to the appeal. Under the amended Act, plaintiff did not have the right to register its tanks. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 290-93, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 . In reviewing past decisions regarding when a statutory amendment would be applied to an existing controversy on appeal, the opinion stated that the jurisprudence was not consistent. Sometimes this court would apply a \"legislative intent approach\" to the question, and at other times would apply a \"vested rights approach\" to the question. Under the vested rights approach, this court did not look at legislative intent. Rather, this court simply applied the law as it exists at the time of the appeal, unless doing so would interfere with a vested right. The opinion defined a \"vested right\" as an interest that is protected **542 ***891 from interference by our due process clause. The opinion then described the vested rights approach as \"the better approach.\" Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 289, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36. There is no doubt that Armstead correctly held that the amended Gasoline Storage Act applied in that appeal. Some jurists, however, have understood the language *171 in Armstead as suggesting a categorical presumption in favor of application of all new rules of law, with the sole exceptionbeing that \"unless doing so would interfere with a vested right\" (Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 290, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 ). In my view, Armstead was never intended as having a universal application. Rather, Armstead was meant to apply only to those cases raising due process concerns. See Armstead, 171 Ill.2d at 289, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (defining \" vested right\" as an interest that is protected by our due process clause). It is true, as Armstead intimated, that the legislature lacks the authority to enact a retrospective statute in violation of our due process clause. This truth, though, was never intended to be extended to mean that all other new statutes (i.e., those that do not violate the due process clause if applied retroactively) shall be applied on appeal, regardless of legislative intent. Such an understanding of Armstead would turn the general presumption against the retroactivity of statutes on its head. It would fail to account for the myriad constitutional problems other than due process that may arise from applying a statute retroactively. Finally, it would conflict with the primary rule of statutory construction that, in interpreting a statute, courts are to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. See, e.g., Kraft, Inc. v. Edgar, 138 Ill.2d 178, 189, 149 Ill.Dec. 286, 561 N.E.2d 656 (1990) . V. Adoption of New Test The United States Supreme Court recently set forth the following test for determining when a new federal statute will be applied on appeal to pending cases. \"When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party *172 possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern * * *.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. at 1505, 128 L.Ed.2d at 261-62 . See also Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 352, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 2003, 144 L.Ed.2d 347, 356-57 (1999) (restating the same test).People v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9In the above test, the Supreme Court has successfully harmonized the legislative intent approach with Justice Story's definition of a truly retroactive law. First, the test reconfirms the \"traditional rule\" that \"new statutes do not apply retroactively unless Congress expressly states that they do.\" (Emphasis in original.) Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 237, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 1461-62, 131 L.Ed.2d 328, 354 (1995) . In reaffirming this principle for the modern era, the Court explained: \"The presumption against statutory retroactivity had special force in the era in which courts tended to view legislative interference with property and contract rights circumspectly. In this century, legislation has come to supply the dominant means of legal ordering, and circumspection has given way to greater deference to legislative judgments. [Citations.] But while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil legislation are now modest, prospectivity **543 ***892 remains the appropriate default rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits. Such a requirement allocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes, and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against *173 which to legislate.\" (Emphasis in original.) Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 272-73, 114 S.Ct. at 1500-01, 128 L.Ed.2d at 256-57 . Second, the test also continues to adhere to Justice Story's definition of a retroactive law. The Court explained, \"Even absent specific legislative authorization, application of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations.\" (Emphasis added.) Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. at 1501, 128 L.Ed.2d at 257. This means that, where the legislature is silent as to the temporal reach of a statute, a court must proceed to a determination of whether application of the new statute would have a truly retroactive effect. If there is no truly retroactive effect, then application of the new statute on appeal is proper. Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273-74, 275, 114 S.Ct. at 1501, 1502, 128 L.Ed.2d at 257, 258 . As examples of statutory changes that have no truly retroactive effect, the Court mentioned those changesconcerning prospective relief and many, but not all, changes to procedural rules. Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273-74, 275 & n. 29, 114 S.Ct. at 1501, 1502 & n. 29, 128 L.Ed.2d at 257, 258 & n. 29. The Court elaborated further on the subject of retroactivity: \"A statute does not operate 'retrospectively' merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment [citation] or upsets expectations based in prior law. Rather, the court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment. The conclusion that a particular rule operates 'retroactively' comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event. Any test for retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which *174 judges tend to have 'sound ... instinct[s],' [citation] and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.\" Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 269-70, 114 S.Ct. at 1499, 128 L.Ed.2d at 254-55. This court should adopt the Supreme Court's test for determining when a new or amended statute will be applied on appeal to pending cases. Applying that test to the present case yields the following analysis. First, we must determine whether the General Assembly has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach; if the General Assembly has done so, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. at 1505, 128 L.Ed.2d at 261-62. Here, with respect to the insanity provisions at bar, the General Assembly expressly prescribed that they were to take effect over six months after the effective date of the enactment, i.e., on January 1, 1999. See Pub. Act 90-593, \u00a7 99 (eff. June 19, 1998). Because the General Assembly was clear that it did not intend for a retroactive application of these amendments to the insanity defense statute, our inquiry ends. These amendments, therefore, shall not be applied on retrial. **544 ***893 For the above reasons, I agree that defendant is entitled to a new trial in which he must be permitted to assert an insanity defense in accordance with the insanity defense statute as it existed before Public Act 89- 404. I would not reach the ex post facto issue.People v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10Justice FREEMAN , also specially concurring: I agree with the court that defendant is entitled to a new trial. I also agree that on retrial any insanity defense raised by defendant must be done so in accordance with section 6-2 of the Criminal Code of 1961 as it existed prior to the amendments contained in Public Act 89-404. I do so, however, for reasons other than those stated in today's opinion. *175 The record reveals that defendant sought to refute the State's murder charges by asserting the affirmative defense of insanity, i.e., he was not guilty because he was insane at the time of the crimes. At trial, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Public Act 89-404 in its entirety by claiming that the Act had been passed in violation of the single subject rule contained in our state constitution. See Ill. Const.1970, art. IV, \u00a7 8(d). Defendant's motive in challenging the Act is not difficult to discern\u2014section 15 of Public Act 89-404 amended the Illinois insanity provision to make it more difficult for criminal defendants to establish the defense. Specifically, the amendment (i) disallowed a claim of insanity premised on the defendant's inability to conform conduct to the requirements of the law, and (ii) increased the defendant's burden of proof from a preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence. Thus, if Public Act 89-404 were to be declared unconstitutional on single subject grounds, the law would be void, and the changes it wrought to the insanity statute would not apply to defendant. In essence, defendant argued that because the Act was a nullity by virtue of its unconstitutional passage, he should be tried under the former version of the law with its broader definition of insanity and its less stringent burden of proof. The circuit court rejected defendant's single subject rule challenge, and eventually the jury rejected defendant's claim that he was insane. On appeal, defendant raises a number of issues that he believes mandate the reversal of his convictions. First among these is his renewal of his single subject rule challenge to Public Act 89-404. In fact, as originally briefed by the parties, the issue was simply whether Public Act 89-404 was enacted in contravention of the single subject rule. Defendant argued in his brief that the rule was violated because the Act contains discordant provisions *176 that have no legitimate relation to each other. The State, in its brief, responded that all of the measures within the Act are legitimately interrelated because each of the sections addresses governmental matters that fall under the purview of the various county State's Attorneys. If this court were to find that the Act violated the single subject rule, the State alternatively asked that this court holdthat the Act's subsequent codification served to close the window of time within which single subject rule challenges can be made. In other words, the State invited this court to adopt the so-called \"codification rule,\" a rule adopted by the judiciary in some states where the state constitution requires that legislation relate to a single subject. On January 22, 1999, while this case was pending, we issued our opinion in People v. Reedy, 186 Ill.2d 1, 237 Ill.Dec. 74, 708 N.E.2d 1114 (1999). Reedy presented this court with the very same arguments vis \u00e0 vis Public Act 89-404 and the single subject rule. After considering those arguments, we declared Public Act 89-404 unconstitutional on the ground that it was passed in violation of the single subject rule. Reedy, 186 Ill.2d at 11-12, 237 Ill.Dec. 74, 708 N.E.2d 1114 (rejecting notion that single subject rule met where all sections related to matters within control of county State's Attorneys). Moreover, we **545 ***894 refused to adopt the \"codification rule.\" See Reedy, Ill.2d at 12-13, 237 Ill.Dec. 74, 708 N.E.2d 1114 (declining to adopt codification rule). In light of Reedy, Public Act 89-404 is invalid. This means, as the court today correctly observes, that it is as \" ' \"though no such law had ever been passed.\" ' \" 192 Ill.2d at 156, 248 Ill.Dec. at 883, 735 N.E.2d at 534, quoting People v. Gersch, 135 Ill.2d 384, 399, 142 Ill.Dec. 767, 553 N.E.2d 281 (1990) , quoting People v. Schraeberg, 347 Ill. 392, 394, 179 N.E. 829 (1932). Defendant's trial was conducted in accordance with the changes to the insanity defense contained in Public Act 89-404 because those provisions were in effect at the time defendant allegedly committed the *177 crimes in question.2 We now know, however, that those provisions were enacted in contravention of our state constitution. Due to the constitutional infirmity, we must act as though those provisions had never been passed. Based on these principles, we must conclude that the insanity defense provisions applicable in the present case are not the more stringent amendments of Public Act 89-404, but the more lenient provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961. Compare 720 ILCS 5/6-2 (West 1996) with 720 ILCS 5/6-2 (West 1992). Thus, defendant, as it turns out, was correct all along when he argued to the trial judge that the \"tougher\" insanity provisions should not have been used due to the single subject violation. Our decision in Reedy, however, was not the only event that occurred during the pendency of this appeal. A new wrinkle developed when our General Assembly sought toPeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11reenact the amendments to the insanity defense statute that were contained in Public Act 89-404. This legislative action took place on June 19, 1998, well after defendant had filed his opening brief in this court on April 3, 1998. Although the State filed its responding brief on October 30, 1998, and defendant filed a reply brief on December 14, 1998, none of these briefs that post-dated the passage of the new legislation, Public Act 90-593, mentioned the General Assembly's action. As a result, this court on its own motion ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs. Specifically, our order, entered October 21, 1999, directed the parties to address \"whether Public Act 90-593 applies retroactively to appellant and, if so, whether retroactive application of Public Act 90-593 would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto application of the law.\" In response to our query, the State asserted that because Public Act 89-404 was void at the time of trial, *178 the changes it wrought to the insanity statute were inapplicable to defendant. Moreover, the State conceded that the application of the newly enacted Public Act 90-593 \"to any retrial of Defendant on the same charges would violate ex post facto principles.\" The defendant agreed with the State, but posited that the constitutional ex post facto question need not be addressed because Public Act 90-593 cannot be given a retroactive application. Defendant maintained that the statute does not contain language, express or implied, indicative of anything other than a legislative intent for forward application of the amendments. He pointed out that section 99 of Public Act 90-593 provides that \"[t]his Act takes effect upon becoming law [June 19, 1998], except that the amendatory changes to Sec. 18-5 of the Criminal Code of 1961 take effect January 1, 1999.\" Pub. Act 90-593, \u00a7 99 (eff. June 19, 1998). The excepted \"amendatory changes\" referred to in section 99 are the insanity defense provisions at issue in this case. In light of the above, the question we must resolve now is which insanity provisions will apply at defendant's retrial. Our task has been made easier because the **546 ***895 State and the defendant both agree that the law as it existed prior to the enactment of Public Act 89-404 applies. Despite the agreement of the parties, the court today nevertheless undertakes an ex post facto analysis and concludes that the ex post facto clause prohibits application of the amendments to defendant on retrial. As an initial matter, I question whether, in view of the fact that neither party argues that the provisions are to be applied on retrial, the court's discussion is warranted. In other words, should this court decide the constitutional issue in the absence of a legal question disputed by theparties? Notwithstanding the apparent absence of a legally disputed issue in this case, the court reaches and considers the constitutional ex post facto question without first *179 determining whether the amendments at issue even apply to conduct occurring before their enactment. Stated differently, if the amendments do not apply to the events in question in the first instance, then, necessarily, no ex post facto problem would exist in this case. Thus, if the court wishes to consider the matter further (despite the State's concession), then the court's initial consideration should rest upon the temporal reach of the amendments of question, which is a question of statutory retroactivity. As I noted several months ago in my special concurrence in Premier Property Management, Inc. v. Chavez, 191 Ill.2d 101, 116-17, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (2000) (Freeman, J., specially concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.), however, our case law on the issue of statutory retroactivity is unclear. This is so because one line of cases in our jurisprudence espouses a \"vested rights\" approach while another line of cases embraces a \"legislative intent\" approach to the same question. Compare First of America Trust Co. v. Armstead, 171 Ill.2d 282, 215 Ill.Dec. 639, 664 N.E.2d 36 (1996), with People v. Digirolamo, 179 Ill.2d 24, 227 Ill.Dec. 779, 688 N.E.2d 116 (1997) ; see also Premier, 191 Ill.2d at 115-17, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (Freeman, J., specially concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.) (discussing cases). One could argue that the conflict between Armstead and Digirolamo is reason enough for this court to address the retroactivity issue in this case even in the face of the concession made by the State. I have previously pointed out the dichotomy between Armstead and Digirolamo and have noted that other courts and jurists have commented upon it as well. Premier, 191 Ill.2d at 117-18, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (Freeman, J., specially concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.), citing White v. Sunrise Healthcare Corp., 295 Ill.App.3d 299, 230 Ill.Dec. 197, 692 City of Elmhurst, 193 F.3d 894, 906 (7th Cir.1999) (Posner, C.J., dissenting). To resolve the conflict, I suggested in Premier that this court follow the lead of the United States Supreme Court in this area because that Court had addressed a similar conflict *180 within its own jurisprudence. See Premier, 191 Ill.2d at 120, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (Freeman, J., specially concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.), quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1505, 128 L.Ed.2d 229, 261-62 (1994).3 I continue to believe that our adoption of the federal principles would go a long way in settling the question of which rule will apply in the facePeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12of legislative silence on the issue. The federal rule looks first to the language of the statute to determine whether the legislative branch has defined the statute's temporal reach. If it has, the court's inquiry ends. Premier, 191 Ill.2d at 121, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (Freeman, J., specially concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.). As I stated in Premier, the presumption against statutory retroactivity discussed in Landgraf has no force in cases where the legislature's intent is clear. See **547 ***896 Premier, 191 Ill.2d at 121, 245 Ill.Dec. 394, 728 N.E.2d 476 (Freeman, J., concurring, joined by McMorrow, J.). In the absence of any express indication as to the statute's proper reach, Landgraf directs a court to resort to a series of judicial default rules to determine whether the new provision should have retroactive effect. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. at 1505, 128 L.Ed.2d at 262. (\"[I]f the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result\"). I strongly believe that the need for guidance from this court is manifold and goes beyond mere confusion in our lower courts. I note that prior to the United States Supreme Court's issuance of Landgraf, one of the federal courts of appeal pointed out that the federal judiciary's lack of a clear, definitive retroactivity rule provided incentive for Congress to avoid explicitly addressing whether a new statute will have prospective or retroactive effect. *181 See Luddington v. Indiana Bell Telephone Co., 966F.2d 225, 227 (7th Cir.1992) (noting that when Congress could not agree on retroactivity, it \"dumped the question into the judiciary's lap without guidance,\" a \"politically convenient solution\" \"facilitated by the fact that the courts do not have a consistent rule for deciding [retroactivity]\" thereby allowing \"[e]ither of the contending factions in Congress\" to \"hope that statutory silence would work in its favor\"). Two years later, the Supreme Court provided the needed definitiveness in Landgraf when it reaffirmed the traditional presumption in favor of prospectivity. It is my hope that this court will soon do likewise. In addition, by failing to clarify which analysis is to be utilized in the face of legislative silence on the temporal operation of a statute, i.e., Armstead 's vested rights analysis or Digirolamo 's legislative intent approach, this court runs the risk of blurring the line between vested rights concerns and ex post facto concerns, a point on which the United States Supreme Court has specifically warned state courts against. The Court spoke to this problem at length in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 101 S.Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981) . At issue in that case waswhether a Florida statute that reduced the amount of \"gain time\" to be deducted from a convicted prisoner's sentence was unconstitutional as applied to those prisoners whose crimes were committed before the statute's enactment. The Florida Supreme Court had previously held that the statute could be given a retroactive application because the \" 'gain time' \" allowance was \" 'an act of grace rather than a vested right and may be withdrawn, modified, or denied.' \" Weaver, 450 U.S. at 28, 101 S.Ct. at 963, 67 L.Ed.2d at 22 , quoting Harris v. Wainwright, 376 So.2d 855, 856 (Fla.1979). In reversing the Florida Supreme Court, the Court noted the following: \"In using the concept of vested rights [citation], the Florida court apparently drew on the test for evaluating *182 retrospective laws in a civil context. See 2 C. Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.06 (4th ed. 1973); Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 692, 696 (1960); Smead, The Rule Against Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of Jurisprudence, 20 Minn.L.Rev. 775, 782 (1936). Discussion of vested rights has seldom appeared in ex post facto analysis, as in identifying whether the challenged change is substantive rather than procedural. [Citation.] When a court engages in ex post facto analysis, which is concerned solely with whether a statute assigns more disadvantageous criminal or penal consequences to an act than did the law in place when the act occurred, it is irrelevant whether the statutory change touches any vested rights. Several state courts have properly distinguished vested rights from ex post facto concerns. [Citations.].\" (Emphasis added.) **548 Weaver, 450 U.S. at 29 n. 13, 101 S.Ct. at 964 n. 13, 67 L.Ed.2d at 23 n. 13 . ***897 The Court stated that, in contrast to the Florida Supreme Court's reasoning, \"a law need not impair a 'vested right' to violate the ex post facto prohibition.\" Weaver, 450 U.S. at 29, 101 S.Ct. at 964, 67 L.Ed.2d at 23. The court explained this at length: \"Evaluating whether a right has vested is important for claims under the Contracts or Due Process Clauses, which solely protect pre-existing entitlements. [Citations.] The presence or absence of an affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant, however, to the ex post facto prohibition, which forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred. Critical to relief under the Ex Post Facto Clause is not an individual's right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint whenPeople v. Ramsey, 192 Ill.2d 154 (2000) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated. Thus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.\" Weaver, 450 U.S. at 29-31, 101 S.Ct. at 964-65, 67 L.Ed.2d at 23-24 . *183 Weaver thus demonstrates that a judicial default rule premised solely on vested rights will not always ensure against an ex post facto violation. This case then, like Premier before it, presents us with the opportunity to bring needed clarity to this area of the law. The court, as it did in Premier, unfortunately lets this chance pass. As Landgraf makes clear, when the question of a statute's temporal reach is at issue, the court must begin with the language contained in the statute. Likewise, in this case, the language of Public Act 90-593 is important. This is particularly true in criminal cases because section 4 of the construction of statutes act (5 ILCS 7 0/4 (West 1998)) states that the law which was in effect at the time of the commission of an offense is controlling in a criminal proceeding. Thus, we should first look to the language of Public Act 90- 593 in order to ascertain whether the legislature explicitly indicated that such was not to be the case. Public Act 90- 593 does not contain any express statement that the General Assembly intended for the act to have retroactive operation. Indeed, a reading of the entire Act compels the opposite conclusion. First of all, when the General Assembly wanted a specific provision of Public Act 90-593 to apply to cases pending on the effective date of the enactment, the General Assembly specifically so stated. See, e.g., Pub. Act 90-593, \u00a7 45 (eff. June 19, 1998). This occurred in only one instance throughout the entire Act. Moreover, with respect to the insanity provisions at issue in this case, the General Assembly explicitly stated that these were to take effect six months after the effective date of the enactment. Courts have held that the legislature's postponement of an effective date is direct evidence that a retroactive application was not intended. See, e.g., United States v. Brebner, 951 F.2d 1017, 1022- 23 (9th Cir.1991) (noting that congressional intent against retroactivity was manifested by its express delaying of the effective *184 date for six months); Ocean & Atmospheric Science, Inc. v. Smyth Van Line, Inc., 446 F.Supp. 1158, 1159 (S.D.N.Y.1978); Twiss 468, 591 A.2d 913, 916 (1991); Jordan District, 42 A.D.2d 1043, 348 N.Y.S.2d 620 (1973); see also 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.04, at 352 (5th ed. 1993). Giventhe lack of language expressly indicating that the insanity provisions were to apply retroactively, along with the explicit statement that the effective date of those provisions was to be postponed, it seems clear that the legislature did not intend the insanity provision to apply retroactively to crimes occurring before the effective date. In other words, the plain language of the statute cannot be construed **549 ***898 to have anything other than a prospective operation, which thereby precludes any possible ex post facto problem in this case. As the foregoing demonstrates, the language of Public Act 90-593 speaks definitively to the temporal reach of the Act. But let us suppose that Public Act 90-593 lacked such a statement. In other words, would the same result (prospective application of the insanity provisions) obtain if the legislature had been silent on the question? I believe it would. If the legislature had been silent on the question, the traditional rule of prospectivity, discussed in Landgraf, would operate because the changes to the insanity defense statute are more than just procedural in nature. Given this fact, I would not construe the statute to have retroactive reach absent a clear expression from the legislature that such an operation was in fact intended. I would reach this result based on the following observations. As one commentator has explained, absent constitutional restriction, \"there is no question of the legislature's general power to enact laws which operate retrospectively or retroactively.\" N. Singer, Sutherland *185 on Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.04, at 350 (5th ed. 1993).4 Courts have generally applied strict construction to prevent retroactive operation in order to ensure that the statute would not violate constitutional prohibitions. As explained in Sutherland: \"The principal explanation offered by courts is that the statute must be construed to sustain its constitutionality and thus prospective operation will be presumed where a retroactive operation would produce invalidity.\" 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.04, at 350 (5th ed. 1993). To this end, the following principles have been recognized by the judiciary: \"Where a statute affects inchoate rights or is remedial in nature, it will be construed retroactively if the legislative intent clearly indicates that retroactive operation is intended. A remedial statute that does not take away vested rights can operate retroactively in the absence of language manifesting a contrary intent. Likewise, where a new statute deals only with procedure, prima facie itPeople v. Ramsey, 192 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14applies to all actions-to those which have accrued or are pending and to future actions. It has been held that there is a presumption that procedural statutes apply retroactively. But steps already taken, including pleadings, and all things done under the old law continue effective, unless an intent to the contrary is plainly manifested. Absent a clearly expressed legislative purpose to the contrary, pending cases are only affected in relation to future proceedings from the point reached when the new law becomes operative.\" 2 N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.04, at 351 (5th ed. 1993). *186 Courts, therefore, will allow a retroactive law if such a law does not contravene a preexisting contractual right or a vested right enjoyed by the parties. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273-75, 114 S.Ct. at 1501-02, 128 L.Ed.2d at 257- 58 (giving examples of types of laws that can be applied to conduct occurring before enactment). As illustrated above, in civil cases, the only bar to retroactive legislation is whether the change in law impairs preexisting contractual rights or impairs vested rights protected from state interference by the due process clause. In the criminal context, however, the focus on vested rights does not always prevent an ex post facto **550 ***899 problem because, as mentioned previously, the United States Supreme Court has warned that \"a law need not impair a 'vested right' to violate the ex post facto prohibition.\" Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 S.Ct. 960, 964, 67 L.Ed.2d 17, 23 (1981). The Court has defined an ex post facto law as one that \"must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.\" Weaver, 450 U.S. at 29, 101 S.Ct. at 964, 67 L.Ed.2d at 23. In a thoughtful analysis, the Supreme Court of California explained the concerns that arise in this area: \"Beyond [the Weaver ex post facto definition], the picture is much less clear. To begin with no guidance can be found in the concept of vested rights * * *. Somewhat more helpful is the procedural-substantive distinction, but even that traditional tool must be used with great care in [the ex post facto context]: 'Changes which may be designated as procedural do not, as a rule come within the ex post facto doctrine, but that in itself is not the true test.' [Citations.] Likewise, the United States Supreme Court recently reiterated in Weaver that 'no ex post facto violation occurs if the change effected is merely procedural' [citation], but immediately qualified the rule by the caveat that 'Alteration of a substantial right, however, is not merely procedural, even if the statute takes a seemingly procedural form.' [Citation.] This is because 'it is the effect, not the form, of *187 the law thatdetermines whether it is ex post facto.' [Citation.] Yet the high court did not undertake to define what is a 'substantial right' for this purpose, less still to prepare an inclusive list of such rights.\" (Emphasis added.) People v. Smith, 34 Cal.3d 251, 259-60, 667 P.2d 149, 153, 193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 696 (1983) . In the footnote which accompanies the last line of the above quotation, the California court noted that \"[a] few kinds of statutes, even though procedural in appearance, have consistently been held subject to the ex post facto clause because of their substantial effect on a defendant's rights: e.g., statutes deleting elements of the crime, lowering the prosecution's burden of proof, or impairing a defense.\" Smith, 34 Cal.3d at 260 n. 5, 667 P.2d at 153 n. 5, 193 Cal.Rptr. at 696 n. 5. These comments, in my view, demonstrate that caution must be used in criminal cases when courts, in the face of legislative silence on the temporal reach of statute, apply presumptions based on the procedural-substantive distinction. The changes to the insanity defense provisions cannot be considered merely procedural due to the fact that if applied to this defendant they would narrow the definition of insanity and in essence would deprive defendant of an affirmative defense that existed at the time he allegedly committed the offenses in question. Moreover, the amendment raises the quantum of proof required of defendant from the preponderance of the evidence to the more demanding \"clear and convincing standard.\" The recent United States Supreme Court decision in Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 120 S.Ct. 1620, 146 L.Ed.2d 577 (2000) demonstrates that the Court has retained the long-held recognition that \"a law which changes the rules of evidence by which less or different testimony is sufficient to convict\" than was previously required does in fact violate the ex post facto clause. See Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 45-46, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2721, 111 L.Ed.2d 30, 41 (1990) (citing favorably *188 Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U.S. 377, 14 S.Ct. 570, 38 L.Ed. 485 (1894)). Because I believe that the amendments at issue deal with substantive and not procedural matters, I would presume a prospective application of the amendments in this case had the legislature not expressly indicated the temporal operation of the amendments. To construe Public Act 90-593 in any other way would call the statute's constitutionality into question. I note that one of the cardinal rules of statutory construction is **551 ***900 that courts will discard an interpretation which would render a statute unconstitutional. See People v. Williams, 119 Ill.2d 24, 28, 115 Ill.Dec. 611, 518 N.E.2d 136 (1987) 735 N.E.2d 533, 248 Ill.Dec. 882 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 15this rule of statutory construction here would therefore require that this court presume a prospective application of the amendment in the face of the legislature's silence on the question. This case represents the second case in the past six months in which this court has had an opportunity to speak clearly on the issue of statutory retroactivity. Once again, however, a majority has chosen to let the opportunity pass even though several members of the court have broached the topic inseparate opinions. It is my hope that a majority of this court will soon confront the issue and resolve the questions that have arisen under our current case law. Justice McMORROW joins in this special concurrence.

See 192 Ill.2d at 172-73, 248 Ill.Dec. at (Bilandic, J., specially concurring). 4For example, in this case, had the legislature stated explicitly that the amendments in question were to be applied to conduct occurring before the Act's passage, this court would have been duty-bound to give effect to that intent to the extent that the Constitution does not bar such an application. In such a case, the constitutional ex post facto issue could not be avoided. In other words, the case would have presented the court with a straightforward ex post facto question. As the case currently stands, the question is one of statutory construction. End of Document \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.People v.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2Opinion Justice SPITZ delivered the opinion of the court: This is an appeal by defendant Sharon Strasbaugh from an order of the circuit court of Sangamon County denying defendant's petition to rescind the statutory summary suspension of defendant's driver's license. On May 22, 1989, traffic citations were issued against defendant for failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident (docket No. 89-T-13528) and for driving while under the influence of alcohol (docket No. 89-T-13529) (Ill.Rev.Stat.1987, ch. 95\u00bd, pars. 11-601(a), 11-501(a)(3).) On May 24, 1989, a law-enforcement sworn report was filed indicating that on May 29, 1989, a notice of a six-month summary suspension of driving privileges was issued to defendant for refusing to submit to or failing to complete chemical testing. The notice further provided that if defendant was determined not to be a first offender, suspension will be for a minimum of 12 months. On the report, arresting officer Robert D. Byrne of the Springfield police department explained his reasonable grounds for believing defendant was driving under the influence as follows: \"Subject ran into the rear of a moving vehicle. Had a strong odor of alcohol beverage coming from her, seemed very disoriented wobbling and swaying.\" On June 5, 1989, a confirmation of statutory summary suspension was filed. This document indicated summary suspension was to become effective July 7, 1989, and last for a minimum of 12 months. On June 7, 1989, defendant's attorney entered an appearance in the traffic case on behalf of defendant. Also on June 7, 1989, a request for admission of facts was filed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 216(a) (107 Ill.2d R. 216(a)) requesting the **1097 ***754 State to respond *1014 thereto within 28 days. The facts the State was requested to admit were: \"1. At the time my vehicle was stopped, the arresting officer did not have probable cause to believe that I had committed any offense. 2. At the time of my arrest, the arresting officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe that I was driving, or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway while under the influence of alcohol.3. I was not properly warned by the arresting officer that my privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if I refused to submit to and complete a breath test. 4. I was not advised by the arresting officer that if I submitted to a breath test and the reading was .10 or greater that my privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended. 5. I did not refuse to take a breath test at the request of the arresting officer.\" On June 9, 1989, the trial court entered an order directing the State to disclose to defendant's attorney a list of witnesses, copies of written confessions and a list of witnesses thereto, a list of witnesses to oral confessions, evidence negating defendant's guilt, and the results of any scientific tests for the presence of alcohol or drugs in defendant. On July 11, 1989, defendant filed her petition to rescind statutory summary suspension. As grounds therefore she alleged (1) she was not properly arrested for an offense defined by section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (Code) ( Ill.Rev.Stat.1987, ch. 95\u00bd, par. 11-501); (2) the arresting officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe defendant was driving or in actual physical control of the motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; (3) she was not properly warned by the arresting officer pursuant to section 11-501.1(c) of the Code (Ill.Rev.Stat.1987, ch. 95\u00bd, par. 11-501.1(c)); (4) she did not refuse to submit to or fail to complete the required chemical tests; and (5) she submitted to the test or tests and the blood-alcohol concentration did not indicate a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more. The cause came on for hearing July 28, 1989. On that date, defendant presented a motion for summary judgment based on the failure of the State to respond to the request for admission of facts. The trial judge denied the motion for summary judgment, ruling that Rule 216(a) did not apply to summary suspension cases, and therefore, defendant was not entitled to file a request to admit facts and the *1015 State had no obligation to respond. The matter then proceeded to hearing. The defendant called Byrne as an adverse witness. Byrne testified no field tests were given to the defendant. He stated she had a strong odor of alcohol, red, watery eyes, her balance was poor, and she could not find her purse at the scene. Defendant had been in a two-car accident and the front end of the car was heavily damaged. The accident occurred at approximately 11:45 p.m.People v. Strasbaugh, Ill.Dec. 752 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3Byrne acknowledged it is not uncommon for people involved in automobile accidents to be shaken up and unsteady. The defendant's mother, Dorothy Thein, testified. She stated she had been with her daughter at a restaurant known as Wayne's Red Coach Inn from approximately 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the night the defendant was arrested. She stated her daughter's speech, walking, and balance were fine in the restaurant. Thein kissed defendant when Thein left the restaurant at approximately 11 p.m. At that time, Thein did not smell any odor of alcohol on defendant's breath. She did not think defendant was intoxicated. Miriam Marshall, the defendant's aunt, also testified. She confirmed the defendant and other family members had dinner at Wayne's Red Coach Inn the night of the defendant's arrest. She stated defendant's speech, walking, and balance were fine throughout the evening. Marshall and her husband left the restaurant with the defendant at approximately 11:30 p.m. The defendant's walking was fine at that point. Marshall did not notice anything unusual **1098 ***755 about the defendant's actions. She did not think the defendant was intoxicated. The defendant testified she had dinner at Wayne's Red Coach Inn with several family members. She arrived at approximately 7 p.m. and left at approximately 11:30 p.m. During the course of the evening, she had three vodka and Seven Up drinks. Two drinks were before dinner and one drink was after dinner. Defendant testified her car was heavily damaged in the automobile accident and that although she did not seek medical treatment after the accident, she was very shaken up and felt \"funny\" for several days after it. The trial court denied defendant's petition to rescind statutory summary suspension. The trial judge stated the testimony of the defendant, her mother and aunt were of no significance in the summary suspension hearing. He ruled the scope of the inquiry was what the officer observed at the scene of the arrest and whether those observations demonstrated reasonable grounds to believe defendant was under the influence of alcohol. The trial court ruled the officer did not have to try to determine if any actions he observed which he thought were indications of intoxication could or might have been related to *1016 the trauma of the accident itself rather than alcohol. The first issue raised by defendant is whether the trial court improperly denied defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the State's failure to answer a request for admissionof facts made pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 216. Rule 216(a) states: \"A party may serve on any other party a written request for the admission by the latter of the truth of any specified relevant fact set forth in the request.\" 107 Ill.2d R. 216(a). At the inception of her argument concerning this issue, defendant's brief states \"although ordinarily, denial of summary judgment matters are not appealable after a party has proceeded to hearing on the merits, this case presents an exception to that general rule.\" However, defendant does not explain why this case is an exception to the general rule and cites no authority to support that proposition. [1] The general rule is that denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable (In re Estate of Luther (1972), 3 Ill.App.3d 357, 277 N.E.2d 735 (abstract of opinion)), and if there is a hearing on the merits, there is a merger of issues such that the denial of the motion is not reviewable after judgment is entered. (Banwart v. Okesson (1980), 83 Ill.App.3d 222, 38 Ill.Dec. 630, 403 N.E.2d 1234 .) The denial of a motion for summary judgment may be reviewed on appeal where there has been no evidentiary hearing and the party seeking review of the denial of the motion for summary judgment has done nothing to avoid trial. (See Cedric Spring & Associates, Inc. v. N.E.I. Corp. (1980), 81 Ill.App.3d 1031, 37 Ill.Dec. 462, 402 N.E.2d 352 .) In Cedric Spring, the court held that failure to comply with discovery caused the sanction of granting judgment for plaintiff and, therefore, defendant caused the avoidance of trial and could not appeal the denial of defendant's motion for summary judgment. Most cases involving a review of the denial of the motion for summary judgment involve cross-motions for summary judgment and the granting of summary judgment to the opposing party. (See Novak v. Insurance Administration Unlimited, Inc. (1980), 91 Ill.App.3d 148, 46 Ill.Dec. 536, 414 N.E.2d 258; Reznick Insurance Ill.App.3d 1058, 4 Ill.Dec. 525, 360 N.E.2d 461.) As was pointed out in In re Marriage of Adams (1988), 174 Ill.App.3d 595, 607, 124 Ill.Dec. 184, 190-91, 528 N.E.2d 1075, 1081-82: \"The rationale behind the court's refusal to review the denial of a motion for summary judgment appears to be that such review would be unjust to the party that was victorious at trial, which won judgment after the evidence was more completely presented, where cross- examination played its part and wherePeople v. Strasbaugh, Ill.Dec. 752 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4witnesses were seen and appraised. Otherwise, a decision based *1017 upon less evidence would prevail over a verdict reached on more evidence, and judgment would be **1099 ***756 taken away from the victor and given to the loser despite the victor having the greater weight of evidence. This would defeat the fundamental purpose of judicial inquiry. Home Indemnity Co. v. Reynolds & Co. (1962), 38 Ill.App.2d 358 [187 N.E.2d 274].\" Nevertheless, the court in Adams reversed the denial of the motion for summary judgment because the motion addressed a factual question which was not addressed in the hearing on the merits. [2] This case does not fit into an exception to the general rule. The failure of defendant to cite authority to support the proposition that the denial of the motion for summary judgment is reviewable in this case is a waiver of that argument. Moreover, the facts sought to be admitted were the ultimate facts of the case. The traffic citation and the statements on the law-enforcement sworn report clearly constitute a denial of the facts sought to be admitted. So, without deciding whether Rule 216 applies to these types of cases, it is clear that not only had the State already denied the facts sought to be admitted, but the request to admit facts improperly sought the admission of ultimate facts. A request to admit facts is designed to eliminate the need to prove facts which are not in dispute, and it is not appropriate for a party to prove her case by use of this procedure where ultimate facts are fairly disputed. (See Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110A, par. 216, Historical and Practice Notes, at 366 (Smith-Hurd 1985); see also Wintersteen v. National Cooperage & Woodenware Co. (1935), 361 Ill. 95, 197 N.E. 578 .) As was stated in Cedric Spring, the purpose of discovery sanctions is to compel cooperation rather than to dispose of litigation as a punishment to the other party, and the just result would insure discovery and a trial on the merits unless noncompliance with orders or rules of discovery is unreasonable. [3] The remaining issue to consider is whether the finding of the trial court that the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant was operating a motor vehicle whileunder the influence of alcohol was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant contends the order of the trial court is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the trial court did not consider the extent to which the trauma and shock of the automobile accident contributed to the signs of intoxication observed by the arresting officer. A decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence if, after a review of the evidence, it is clearly evident that the conclusion opposite to the one reached by the trial court was the proper disposition. *1018 (Stone v. City of Arcola (1989), 181 Ill.App.3d 513, 130 Ill.Dec. 118, 536 N.E.2d 1329.) The trial court, having observed the witnesses, is in a much better position than is this court to assess credibility of witnesses and weigh the evidence. (In re J.H. (1987), 153 Ill.App.3d 616, 106 Ill.Dec. 569, 505 N.E.2d 1360.) Therefore, reviewing courts generally will not reverse on issues of credibility of witnesses. Section 2-118.1(b) of the Code limits the scope of the hearing on a petition to rescind to consideration of the following issues: \"(1) Whether the person was placed under arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket; and (2) Whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that such person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway while under the influence of alcohol, other drug, or combination thereof; and (3) Whether such person, after being advised by the arresting officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or complete such test or tests to determine the person's alcohol or drug concentration; or (4) Whether the person, after being advised by the arresting officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person submits to a chemical test, or tests, and such test discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, and such person did submit **1100 ***757 to and complete such test or tests which determined an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more.\" (Ill.Rev.Stat.1987, ch. 95\u00bd, par. 2-118.1(b).) In this appeal, the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is only directed at section 2-118.1(b)(2). Had there beenPeople v. Strasbaugh, Ill.Dec. 752 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 5evidence that defendant was not driving the vehicle, as in People v. Wireman (1989), 181 Ill.App.3d 385, 130 Ill.Dec. 135, 536 N.E.2d 1346, then rescission of the suspension would have been appropriate. But that was not the evidence here. Nor was the trial court required to find incredible the testimony of defendant's witnesses. It may well have been that defendant's witnesses, who had been at the restaurant with her, did not observe any signs of intoxication, but that a short time later such signs were noted by the arresting officer. Except for defendant and the police officer, none of the witnesses were present at the scene of the accident or the police station. Defendant testified she was shook up after the accident. Nevertheless, the trial court found that there *1019 were sufficient reasonable grounds for the police officer to believe that defendant was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway whileunder the influence of alcohol to ask her to submit to a test. See People v. Bafia (1983), 112 Ill.App.3d 710, 68 Ill.Dec. 234, 445 N.E.2d 878 . Based on the record, a contrary result is not more appropriate than the determination of the trial court.

Migdalia Serrano (plaintiff) alleged that Dr. Carlos Rotman was negligent in his care and treatment, and that such negligence was a proximate cause of her injury. A jury found in favor of Dr. Rotman. Plaintiff now appeals, alleging that (1) the trial court's ruling in regard to Dr. Rotman's Illinois Supreme Court Rule 216 (Ill. S.Ct. R. 216 (eff.Aug.1, 1985) (hereinafter Rule 216)) answer to plaintiff's requests to admit was improper, (2) the trial court's denial of plaintiff's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was improper, (3) the trial court's refusal to submit Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 10.01 (2006) was an abuse of discretion, and (4) the trial court's rulings as to the admissions of evidence were improper. For the following reasons, we affirm. BACKGROUND In 1984, plaintiff had a tubal ligation . On March 26, 1996, plaintiff visited Dr. Rotman's office, where she expressed a desire to reverse the tubal ligation . She was provided with medical history forms to complete. Plaintiff answered \"no\" to having any \"bleeding tendencies.\" She completed the section regarding her children and did not indicate that her son was a hemophiliac. Plaintiff left the section titled ***274 **1184 \"any other information you would like us to know,\" blank. Dr. Rotman then performed an ultrasound on plaintiff and noted that everything was normal. Plaintiff chose not to undergo the reversal surgery at that time because of finances. *903 On January 13, 1998, plaintiff returned to Dr. Rotman's office and completed a new patient registration form. She met with certified medical assistant (CMA) Sandra Gutierraz. Gutierraz testified that had plaintiff advised her of any changes or any additional medical history from her prior visit, or that she was a hemophilia carrier, Gutierraz would have documented and flagged such information.Serrano v. Rotman, 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 7Dr. Rotman examined plaintiff. Plaintiff indicated that she was experiencing pelvic pain. Dr. Rotman discovered that plaintiff had developed endometriosis and indicated that he could treat that at the same time as her reverse tubal ligation surgery. Plaintiff's surgery was schedule for March 18, 1998. Plaintiff testified that she returned to Rotman's office prior to surgery to make payments and to have blood drawn for \"pre-op\" tests including a blood-clotting time test. Plaintiff testified that she told Gutierraz during one of her visits that she had spoken with her son's hematologist about the surgery and that a shipment of Factor IX was being delivered to her home. Subsequently, she called Gutierraz and told her that she needed the Factor IX injected one hour before and one hour after surgery. Plaintiff testified that the day before surgery, Gutierraz called and told her to bring the Factor IX to the surgery. On March 18, 1998, plaintiff took a limousine to the Surgical Center. Plaintiff's daughter, Celeste, testified that she saw her mother leave the house that morning with nine boxes of Factor IX packed in a large see-through bag. At the Surgical Center, a nurse completed a \"preoperative checklist\" on plaintiff. No medications were labeled or indicated in plaintiff's admitting form, but CMA Gutierraz testified that had plaintiff brought medication in, it would have been labeled. Prior to surgery, plaintiff met with the anesthesiologist, Dr. Jay Kiokemeister. Plaintiff testified that the bag containing Factor IX was placed on a table next to her. Plaintiff further testified that she told Dr. Kiokemeister that she needed the Factor IX one hour before surgery and one hour after surgery because she was a hemophiliac carrier. Dr. Kiokemeister noted on his pre-anesthesia form that \"patient has [a] son with history of Factor IX deficiency . Has brought Factor IX in case of urgent matters.\" Dr. Kiokemeister stated in his deposition that he understood this to mean that the condition was unique to her son, and not applicable to plaintiff. Dr. Kiokemeister further noted that plaintiff's clotting times were within normal range. According to Dr. Rotman, Dr. Kiokemeister never advised him about plaintiff's Factor IX medication, and Dr. Rotman never saw Factor IX in the operating room. *904 Dr. Nasiruddin Rana assisted Dr. Rotman with plaintiff's surgery. Dr. Rana testified at trial that he had noknowledge of plaintiff's hemophilia / Factor IX condition and did not recall seeing Factor IX in the operating room. The surgery was completed at 12:15 p.m., and anesthesia was completed at 1 p.m. Plaintiff did not have any complications during the surgery and was discharged from the recovery room at 5:20 p.m. Plaintiff testified that Dr. Rotman saw her in recovery and told her the surgery ***275 **1185 went well and that it was not necessary to use her medication. Plaintiff further testified that the bag of Factor IX was returned to a family member in the waiting area of the Surgical Center. On March 23, 1998, plaintiff arrived at Dr. Rotman's for a postoperative examination. Gutierraz removed her stitches. On March 28, 1998, plaintiff called Dr. Rotman's office and complained of \"oozing\" and pain. Dr. Rotman was out of town, but CMA Gutierraz had plaintiff come in to the office. Gutierraz cleaned the wound and prescribed antibiotics and Vicodin. Plaintiff testified that Gutierraz advised her to see the doctor in Oakbrook if she got worse and to return to Dr. Rotman's on Monday. Gutierraz, on the other hand, testified that she told plaintiff to see Dr. Rana in Oakbrook, but that plaintiff wanted to try the prescriptions first, and that plaintiff would call if her condition changed. Later that day, plaintiff went to the emergency room for a hematoma and was then admitted to the hospital where she received intravenous antibiotics. Gutierraz called Dr. Rana to notify him of plaintiff's emergency room visit and admission to the hospital. Dr. Rana called the hospital and learned that plaintiff had an infected hematoma . Plaintiff's initial complaint, which was filed on March 15, 2000, claimed that she has not worked since March of 1998, and that she is only able to stand, walk, or sit with her leg down for short time periods without pain and swelling. She named as defendants Dr. Rotman, Dr. Kiokemeister, MacNeal Hospital, Oakbrook Surgical Center, Dr. Brian Ralston, Dr. Rana, Dr. Jose Rodriguez, and Dr. Lawrence Schilder. On December 1, 2000, the court dismissed Oakbrook Surgical Center as a defendant. Thereafter, both Dr. Rana's and Dr. Kiokemeister's motions to dismiss were granted. Plaintiff then voluntarily dismissed the remainder of her case. On October 11, 2005, plaintiff refiled her cause of action sounding in negligence against MacNeal Hospital and Dr. Rotman. Plaintiff settled with the hospital. Plaintiff allegedSerrano v. Rotman, 406 Ill.App.3d 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8that Dr. Rotman was *905 negligent in her care and treatment, and that he deviated from the standard of care in obtaining her medical history and failing to administer Factor IX before or after her surgery. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of Dr. Rotman, and plaintiff now appeals. ANALYSIS A. Rule 216 Admission The following appeared in Dr. Rotman's response to plaintiff's Rule 216 requests for admission, which was signed by his attorney: \"Request: You elected not to infuse [plaintiff] with Factor IX Concentrate prior to, during or following surgery. Response: Admitted.\" During cross-examination of Dr. Rotman, plaintiff's counsel moved to read into evidence Dr. Rotman's answer to plaintiff's request to admit and asked the trial court to instruct the jury that such admission was a judicial admission. Plaintiff's counsel argued that such admission \"clearly implies that he made a conscious decision\" not to administer Factor IX. Defense counsel countered that it was only a judicial admission as to his election not to administer Factor IX, not as to his knowledge that plaintiff had a Factor IX deficiency. The trial court stated that \"[w]hat [Dr. Rotman] can say is the reason I didn't elect to infuse her is I didn't know anything about it or whatever medical reason he has, but * * * it is an admitted fact that he elected not to infuse her.\" The trial court went on to say that \"the doctor ***276 **1186 may say that I didn't know anything about it, so * * * I did not elect to infuse for whatever reason.\" Dr. Rotman's response to plaintiff's request to admit was then published to the jury. During cross-examination, Dr. Rotman testified that he never learned that plaintiff's Factor IX was available at the surgical center. Plaintiff's counsel requested that the trial court \"formally instruct the jury that the matter admitted in the request to admit is a judicial and binding admission and cannot be contested in this trial.\" The trial court stated, \"It's an admission of fact,\" and that the debate was not whether Dr. Rotman elected to give the Factor IX, because that was an admission of fact, but rather what his reason was for not electing to administer Factor IX. The trial court specifically found that Dr. Rotman's reason for not electing to give theFactor IX could certainly have been that he had no knowledge of plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency . Plaintiff's counsel then resumed cross-examination of Dr. following complained-of colloquy took place: \"[Plaintiff's counsel]: Now, just so we understand what you're telling us, are you saying that you remember that there was no medication there when you spoke to [plaintiff]? *906 [Defense counsel]: Objection. It's been asked and answered. He said he never knew at any time about this Factor IX. THE COURT: He's said that. Let's move on. Asked and answered. [Plaintiff's Counsel]: I couldn't understand if he says he doesn't remember or if he knows it wasn't there, your Honor. [Defendant Counsel]: I don't know how he can be more specific, your Honor. * * * [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Did you recognize, at the time of this surgery, that a patient who has hemophilia could bleed at any time during and after the surgery and is a higher risk after that? [Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor. The doctor said repeatedly he never knew about hemophilia or Factor IX. So it has no relevance to this surgery whatsoever from the standpoint\u2014 [Plaintiff's Counsel]: That's contested. THE COURT: I understand that. But he may\u2014you can ask academic questions along those lines. [Defense Counsel]: Was he asking it generally, or was he asking it trying to infer that [Dr. Rotman] knew when [he] said he never knew\u2014 [Plaintiff's Counsel]: He doesn't need to make speeches. THE COURT: I thought I ruled. * * *Serrano v. Rotman, 406 Ill.App.3d 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 9[Plaintiff's Counsel]: It has been established that you have admitted in this case that you elected not to give Factor IX \u2014 [Witness]: That's not true. * * * You're playing with words. I never said that. I cannot elect not to do something that I have no knowledge of. [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Were you sitting here and did you hear this presented to the jury, that it was admitted? [Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor. [Witness]: Admitted by you, not by me. [Defense Counsel]: How could he do something he knows nothing about? That's how he answered it. How many times do we have to go through this? THE COURT: I know what the record shows. This was gone into. Let's go into something else.\" **1187 ***277 On appeal, plaintiff argues that Dr. Rotman's Rule 216 answer was improperly treated as an evidentiary admission, rather than a judicial admission. Plaintiff further argues that Dr. Rotman should not have been able to explain the judicial admission, or disavow it, on the witness stand. Dr. Rotman counters that his answer was given proper treatment at trial and that, in any event, plaintiff was permitted to publish his answer to the jury and argue to the jury that such *907 answer should be interpreted to mean Dr. Rotman had knowledge of plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency .

Pavlovich, 394 Ill.App.3d at 468, 333 Ill.Dec. 446, 914 N.E.2d 1258 . [8] A trial court may exclude evidence on an issue which has been judicially admitted because: (1) the evidence is no longer relevant to the issues remaining in the case; (2) the evidence may be superfluous and confusing; and (3) the other party may not necessarily be entitled to the additional dramatic force of the evidence. Rath v. Carbondale Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, Inc., 374 Ill.App.3d 539, 312 Ill.Dec. 722, 871 N.E.2d 122 (2007) . The rule is not absolute however, and a trial court is afforded discretion in evidentiary rulings. Rath, 374 Ill.App.3d at 539, 312 Ill.Dec. 722, 871 N.E.2d 122 . [9] In the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in its ruling on Dr. Rotman's Rule 216 answer. The Rule 216 request to admit at issue was not clear or unequivocal. Rather, it was ambiguous. As such, the trial court opted to treat the statement as an evidentiary admission rather than a judicial admission, allowing Dr. Rotman to explain the basis for his admission. The basis for Dr. Rotman's answer that he \"elected not to administer Factor IX\" to plaintiff was that he had no knowledge that it existed, nor that plaintiff was Factor IX deficient. The trial court likewise allowed plaintiff to argue to the ***278 **1188 jury that the basis for Dr. *908 Rotman's answer that he \"elected not to administer Factor IX\" was that he had knowledge of plaintiff's condition and chose not to give her medicine despite such knowledge. Plaintiff urges us to find that Dr. Rotman should have argued ambiguity prior to trial and should not have answered the request as \"admitted\" if he thought it was ambiguous. However, we note that it is not our position that Dr. RotmanSerrano v. Rotman, 406 Ill.App.3d 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 10thought the Rule 216 request to admit was ambiguous. Rather, it is our position that Dr. Rotman believed the Rule 216 request to admit had no bearing on knowledge of plaintiff's condition and only went to the fact of whether he administered Factor IX to plaintiff prior to the surgery. At trial, it became apparent that plaintiff meant for the word \"election\" to mean that Dr. Rotman knew of the Factor IX and made a conscious decision not to administer it. Because such ambiguity did not present itself until trial, we find that the trial court's treatment of Dr. Rotman's admission did not constitute an abuse of discretion. We cannot say that no reasonable person would have adopted the same view. See Pavlovich, 394 Ill.App.3d at 468, 333 Ill.Dec. 446, 914 N.E.2d 1258 . [10] Plaintiff further argues that her motion for a directed verdict based on Dr. Rotman's Rule 216 admission should have been granted, and that the trial court committed reversible error in not granting such motion. At the close of evidence, plaintiff moved for a directed verdict based solely upon the judicial admission that Dr. Rotman elected not to give Factor IX to plaintiff. The trial court found that Dr. Rotman's knowledge as to plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency was an issue for the jury to decide. [11] [12] [13] [14] A directed verdict is properly entered in those limited cases where all of the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors the movant so that no contrary verdict based on the evidence could ever stand. Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill.2d 445, 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508 (1992) . In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, a court does not weigh the evidence, nor is it concerned with the credibility of the witnesses; rather, it may only consider the evidence, and any inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting the motion, which is Dr. Rotman in this case. See Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. A directed verdict is improper where \" 'there is any evidence, together with reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, demonstrating a substantial factual dispute, or where the assessment of credibility of the witnesses or the determination regarding conflicting evidence is decisive to the outcome.' \" City of Mattoon v. Mentzer, 282 Ill.App.3d 628, 633, 218 Ill.Dec. 117, 668 N.E.2d 601 (1996) (quoting Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 454, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508). We review a trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict de novo. Mentzer, 282 Ill.App.3d at 633, 218 Ill.Dec. 117, 668 N.E.2d 601.*909 In viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Dr. Rotman, we cannot say that all of the evidence overwhelmingly favors plaintiff. The issue to be determined for the trial court was whether Dr. Rotman had knowledge of plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency. The Rule 216 admission stating that Dr. Rotman admitted that he elected not to administer Factor IX to plaintiff did not conclusively establish that he had knowledge of plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency. To the contrary, as has been discussed above, the only fact such admission established was that Dr. Rotman elected not to administer Factor IX. The basis for such election was very much in dispute. Accordingly, because there was a ***279 **1189 \"substantial factual dispute,\" the trial court properly denied plaintiff's motion for a directed verdict. See Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. B. Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict [15] Plaintiff next contends that the \"evidence in this case, when taken as a whole, so overwhelmingly established Dr. Rotman's liability, that, when coupled with the uncontested evidence on causation and damages, a judgment in plaintiff's favor was warranted.\" Plaintiff therefore argues that her motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.) should have been granted. Dr. Rotman counters that there was conflicting evidence and thus a judgment n.o.v. was improper. [16] [17] [18] We review de novo a trial court's denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v. Ford v. Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d 639, 650, 924 N.E.2d 531 (2010). A judgment n.o.v. is properly entered where all the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party (Dr. Rotman), so overwhelmingly favors the moving party that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. In ruling on a motion for a judgment n.o.v., the court does not weigh the evidence, nor is it concerned with the credibility of the witnesses. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. Instead, the court may only consider the evidence, and any rational inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, N.E.2d 508 . [19] [20] Further, a judgment n.o.v. may not be granted merely because a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 453, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. \"A trial court has no right to enterSerrano v. Rotman, 406 Ill.App.3d 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 11a judgment n.o.v. if there is any evidence demonstrating a substantial factual dispute or where the assessment of the witnesses' credibility or the determination regarding conflicting evidence is decisive to the outcome at the trial.\" Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d at 650, N.E.2d 508). [21] [22] [23] Alternatively, on a motion for a new trial, a court will weigh the evidence and set aside the verdict and order a new trial if the verdict is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. *910 Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d at 651, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508). A verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite result is clearly evident or where the jury's findings are unreasonable, arbitrary, and not based on the evidence. Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d at 651, 338 Ill.Dec. 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508). We will not reverse a trial court's ruling on a motion for a new trial unless it is affirmatively shown that the court clearly abused its discretion, because the trial judge had the benefit of observing the witnesses firsthand at the trial. Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d at 651, 338 Ill.Dec. 325, 924 151 Ill.2d at 455, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, we must consider whether the jury's verdict was supported by the evidence and whether the losing party was denied a fair trial. Grizzle, 398 Ill.App.3d at 651, 338 Ill.Dec. 325, 924 151 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508). [24] After a careful review of the evidence adduced at trial, as set forth above, ***280 **1190 we cannot find that the jury's findings were unreasonable, arbitrary, and not based upon the evidence. The jury in this case heard conflicting testimony regarding whether Dr. Rotman knew about plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency . CMA Gutierraz testified that she did not recall ever being advised of plaintiff's condition and that if she was so advised, it would have been in plaintiff's medical chart. Dr. Rotman repeatedly testified that he never had knowledge of plaintiff's condition from any source. Plaintiff, on the other hand, testified that she brought the medication with her to the surgery and that it was present in the surgical room with her. Since the witnesses' testimony in this case conflicted, the question of whom to believe and what weight to give to all the evidence was a decision for the trier of fact, whose determinations should not be upset on review unless manifestly erroneous. Jackson v. Seib, 372Ill.App.3d 1061, 1069, 310 Ill.Dec. 502, 866 N.E.2d 663 (2007). It is the province of the jury to resolve conflicts in the evidence, to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses, and to decide the weight to be given to the witnesses' testimony. Maple, 151 Ill.2d at 452, 177 Ill.Dec. 438, 603 N.E.2d 508. For these reasons, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in denying plaintiff's requests for a judgment n.o.v. or a new trial. C. Illinois Pattern Jury Instruction [25] Plaintiff's next contention on appeal is that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing her Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 10.01 (2006) (hereinafter, IPI Civil (2006) No. 10.01), concerning the conduct of CMA Gutierraz. IPI Civil (2006) No. 10.01 is the instruction for ordinary negligence as to an unlicensed person. Plaintiff asserts that one of her theories of recovery was vicarious liability: that Dr. Rotman was liable for the actions or omissions of CMA Gutierraz; and, as such, the trial court committed reversible error *911 by disregarding plaintiff's theory of vicarious liability based on CMA Gutierraz's negligence. Dr. Rotman responds that the trial court's refusal of plaintiff's tendered IPI Civil (2006) No. 10.01 was proper and not an abuse of discretion because the sole defendant in this case was Dr. Rotman. [26] [27] [28] [29] The determination to provide a particular jury instruction is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion. York v. Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, 222 Ill.2d 147, 203, 305 Ill.Dec. 43, 854 N.E.2d 635 (2006) . Specifically, the trial court has the discretion to determine if a particular jury instruction is applicable, supported by evidence in the record, and an accurate statement of the law. Lewis v. Haavig, 337 Ill.App.3d 1081, 1085-86, 273 Ill.Dec. 167, 788 N.E.2d 758 (2003). \"The standard for deciding whether a trial court abused its discretion is whether, taken as a whole, the instructions fairly, fully, and comprehensively apprised the jury of the relevant legal principles.\" Schultz v. Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter R.R. Corp., 201 Ill.2d 260, 273, 266 Ill.Dec. 892, 775 N.E.2d 964 (2002). On appeal, a trial court will not be reversed \"for giving faulty instructions unless they clearly misled the jury and resulted in prejudice to the appellant.\" Schultz, 201 Ill.2d at 274, 266 Ill.Dec. 892, 775 N.E.2d 964.Serrano v. 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 12In the case at bar, the trial court gave the jury a modified version of Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 105.01 (2006) (hereinafter, IPI Civil (2006) No. 105.01), which defined professional negligence as to a gynecological surgeon. The court also gave plaintiff's tendered agency instruction, which stated: \"Sandra Gutierraz was the agent of the defendant Carlos ***281 **1191 Rotman, M.D., at and before the time of this occurrence. Therefore, any act or omission of the agent at that time was in law the act or omission of the defendant, Carlos Rotman, M.D.\" Plaintiff tendered IPI Civil (2006) No. 10.01, which defined ordinary negligence as to an unlicensed person. The trial court deferred ruling, stating, \"The doctor is the only one here.\" Later, the trial court reconsidered IPI Civil (2006) No. 10.01. Plaintiff argued that what Gutierraz did in the operating room was incompatible with the training and experience of a CMA. The trial court found that delegating responsibility to Gutierraz was Dr. Rotman's responsibility, which is part of the allegations of Dr. Rotman's negligence which, in turn, goes to the jury. The trial court also struck count II of plaintiff's second amended complaint, which alleged vicarious liability against Dr. Rotman for the conduct of CMA Gutierraz. The issues presented to the jury only reference Gutierraz in the following context: \"The plaintiff claims that she was injured and sustained damages, and that the defendant was negligent in one or more of the following aspects: * * * (d) improperly delegated to Sandra Gutierraz the task of observing and reporting the *912 plaintiff's post-operative condition.\" The jury was not presented with any issue related to a finding that CMA Gutierraz was negligent, and thus there would be no need for an instruction on ordinary negligence. Rather, the only defendant was Dr. Rotman, and the jury was free to find that he was professionally negligent in his delegation of duties to CMA Gutierraz, but not that Gutierraz herself was negligent, especially considering the fact that the vicarious liability count was struck from the second amended complaint. Therefore, the issues presented to the jury solely involved Dr. Rotman's conduct, which was covered by IPI Civil (2006) No. 105.01. Plaintiff's reliance on Petre v. Cardiovascular Consultants, S.C., 373 Ill.App.3d 929, 313 Ill.Dec. 53, 871 N.E.2d 780 (2007) , does not persuade us otherwise. In Petre, the plaintiff's theory against a hospital was based on vicarious liability for some negligent act or omission of a hospital employee. The jury was only given instructions pertainingto a vicarious liability theory, and not regarding institutional negligence. The court held that because the jury ultimately found that the doctor did not act negligently, a vicarious liability negligence claim against the hospital could only be based on the negligent act or omission of some other employee of the hospital. Therefore, the court found that because there was no competent testimony regarding the standard of care for such an employee, the jury's verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Petre, 373 Ill.App.3d at 944, 313 Ill.Dec. 53, 871 N.E.2d 780 . In the case at bar, the jury was not given instructions pertaining to vicarious liability, as that count was stricken from plaintiff's second amended complaint. Rather, they were only given instructions pertaining to Dr. Rotman's conduct, and the professional negligence standard covered by IPI Civil (2006) No. 105.01. The only mention of CMA Gutierraz was whether Dr. Rotman was negligent in his delegation of duties to her; not whether Dr. Rotman was vicariously negligent for her acts or omissions. As such, Petre is distinguishable from the case at bar. We find that, taken as a whole, the instructions fairly, fully, and comprehensively apprised the jury of the relevant legal principles, and, thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give an instruction on ordinary negligence. See ***282 **1192 Schultz, 201 Ill.2d at 273, 266 N.E.2d 964 . D. Hearsay [30] Plaintiff's final contention on appeal is that the trial court committed reversible error when it barred her testimony of out-of-court statements made by Dr. Kiokemeister concerning plaintiff's need for Factor IX, and when it barred her daughter's testimony regarding statements made by an employee at the Oakbrook Surgical Center. *913 Plaintiff argues that the out-of-court statements either fell into an exception to the rule against hearsay, or were not offered to prove the matters asserted. Dr. Rotman responds that the trial court properly barred the out-of-court statements from being admitted into evidence. [31] [32] \" 'Hearsay evidence is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it is generally inadmissible due to its lack of reliability unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.' \" People v. Caffey, 205 Ill.2d 52, 88, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163 (2001) (quoting People v. Olinger, 176 Ill.2d 326, 357, 223 Ill.Dec. 588, 680 N.E.2d 321 (1997)). The parties agree asSerrano v. Rotman, 406 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 13to the standard of review. \"Evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed unless the trial court has abused that discretion.\" Caffey, 205 Ill.2d at 89, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163. \"An abuse of discretion will be found only where the trial court's ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court.\" Caffey, 205 Ill.2d at 89, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163. 1. Plaintiff's Testimony Prior to trial, plaintiff made an offer of proof of her testimony concerning her pre-op conversation with Dr. Kiokemeister for the purpose of showing his state of mind. Following a hearing, the trial court allowed plaintiff's statements to Dr. Kiokemeister but not his responses to her. In her brief, plaintiff states that \"[t]he first statement at issue was that, after learning that plaintiff brought Factor IX to her surgery, Dr. Kiokemeister told her that he was going to speak with Dr. Rotman. He then left for about 20 minutes.\" These two sentences are unsupported by record citations. Nevertheless, plaintiff argues that she should have been allowed to testify as to Dr. Kiokemeister's statement regarding his desire to talk to Dr. Rotman because such statement fell within the \"state of mind\" exception to hearsay. [33] [34] Statements that indicate the declarant's state of mind are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule when the declarant is unavailable to testify, there is a reasonable probability that the proffered hearsay statements are truthful, and the statements are relevant to a material issue in the case. Caffey, 205 Ill.2d at 91, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163 (citing People v. Floyd, 103 Ill.2d 541, 546, 83 Ill.Dec. 335, 470 N.E.2d 293 (1984)). The state of mind exception applies only to the state of mind of the declarant and not the state of mind of someone other than the declarant. People v. Lawler, 142 Ill.2d 568 N.E.2d 895 (1991) . Here, plaintiff seems to be arguing that Dr. Kiokemeister's statement that he was going to talk to Dr. Rotman indicates that his state of mind was such that he knew about plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency and, thus, the statement goes to the ultimate issue of whether Dr. *914 Rotman knew plaintiff had a Factor IX deficiency . We agree with the trial court's finding that such a statement was offered to prove Dr. Rotman's state of mind, rather than Dr. Kiokemeister's state of mind, and that the prejudice ***283 **1193 to thatstatement far outweighed the probative value. We certainly cannot say that the trial court's ruling was arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or that no reasonable person would have taken the view adopted by the trial court. See Caffey, 205 Ill.2d at 89, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not admitting Dr. Kiokemeister's alleged testimony. Plaintiff also contends that a second statement should have been admitted, specifically, what Dr. Kiokemeister said to her when he returned 20 minutes later: \"that he spoke with Dr. Rotman and learned that plaintiff's clotting levels were fine, and that her Factor IX would be taken into surgery in case it was needed.\" Plaintiff argued that such statement was not offered for its truth, but to show her reasonable belief that Dr. Rotman understood her treatment needs before surgery. Again, plaintiff is offering Dr. Kiokemeister's statement to show another person's state of mind. In this instance, it is to show plaintiff's state of mind. As stated above, the state of mind exception only applies to the declarant's state of mind. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in barring testimony regarding Dr. Kiokemeister's alleged statements. 2. Celeste's Testimony [35] [36] Plaintiff's final contention is that her daughter, Celeste, should have been allowed to testify that when she was in the Oakbrook Surgical Center, an employee came out with the bag of Factor IX and stated that \"they did not 'need to use this.' \" Plaintiff argued that the statement was not being offered to establish that the Factor IX was not needed, but rather to show that the employee knew the product was available to treat plaintiff. Plaintiff has failed to show how the state of mind of this alleged employee is relevant as to whether Dr. Rotman had knowledge of plaintiff's Factor IX deficiency . Moreover, we find that there was no prejudice here where the statement would be merely cumulative. See Caffey, 205 Ill.2d at 92, 275 Ill.Dec. 390, 792 N.E.2d 1163 (even if hearsay statement was admissible to show state of mind, error would be harmless where excluded evidence is merely cumulative of other evidence presented by the parties). Celeste testified that she saw the Oakbrook Surgical Center nurse hand the bag of Factor IX to the family member and that it appeared that none of the medication had been used. Accordingly, we find thatSerrano v. Rotman, 406 Ill.App.3d 900 (2011) 943 N.E.2d 1179, 348 Ill.Dec. 269 \u00a9 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 14the trial court did not abuse its discretion in barring Celeste from testifying as to the employee's out-of-court statement. *915 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County.Judgment affirmed.
