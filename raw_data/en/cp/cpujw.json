As Earthlings, we have come to rely on Earth's gravity as a fundamental reference that tells us which way is down. Our very survival depends on our ability to discern down so that we can walk, run, jump, and otherwise move about without falling. To accomplish this, we evolved specialized motion-sensing receptors in our inner ears\u2014receptors that act like biological guidance systems. Among other things, these receptors sense how well our heads are aligned with gravity. Our brains combine these data with visual information from our eyes, pressure information from the soles of our feet (and the seats of our pants), and position and loading information from our joints and muscles to continuously track the orientation of our bodies relative to gravity. Knowing this, our brains can work out the best strategies for adjusting our muscles to move our limbs and bodies about without losing our balance. And, we don't even have to think about it. At the end of launch phase, astronauts find themselves suddenly thrust into the microgravity environment. Gravity, the fundamental up/down reference these astronauts relied on throughout their lives for orientation and movement, suddenly disappears. As you might expect, there are a number of immediate consequences. Disorientation, perceptual illusions, motion sickness, poor eye-head/eye- hand coordination, and whole-body movements are issues each astronaut has to deal with to some degree. One thing we learned during the shuttle era, though, is that astronauts' nervous systems adapt very quickly. By the third day of flight, most crew members overcame the loss of gravitational stimulation. Beyond that, most exhibited few functionally significant side effects. The downside to this rapid adaptation was that, by the time a shuttle mission ended and the astronauts returned to Earth, they had forgotten how to use gravity for orientation and movement. So, for the first few days after return, they suffered again from a multitude of side effects similar to those experienced at the beginning of spaceflight. During the Earth-readaptation period, these postflight affects limited some types of physical activities, such as running, jumping, climbing ladders, driving automobiles, and flying planes. The Space Shuttle--particularly when carrying one of its Spacelab or Spacehab modules and during the human-health-focused, extended-duration Orbiter medical missions (1989 through 1995)-- provided unique capabilities to study neurological adaptation to space. By taking advantage of the shuttle's ability to remove and then reintroduce the fundamental spatial orientation reference provided by gravity, many researchers sought to understand the brain mechanisms responsible for tracking and responding to this "}
