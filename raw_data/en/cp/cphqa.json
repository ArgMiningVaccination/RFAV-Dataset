Growing immunization programs and their increasing coverage, growing research in the field of vaccination, increasing government support and investment, development of novel vaccines, and various campaigns and initiatives are some of the key factors that are contributing to the growth of the market. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies in partnership with governments across the globe are working towards the strategy for supply chain challenges in vaccine delivery and the development of effective vaccinations. The urgency to locate and oversee a [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/covid-19-vaccines-market) has generated interest in providing an effective and safe viral delivery system, or preferably, multiple delivery systems. In January 2022, to facilitate the urgency of transforming vaccine doses into protected and vaccinated communities, UNICEF, Gavi, and the WHO launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP). The partnership is aimed at providing immediate operational support to 34 countries that had 10% or below vaccination coverage as of January 2022. Overall, the partnership targets vaccine delivery and [supply chain management](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/supply-chain-management-market-report) for 92 countries. Increasing demand for the treatment of hepatitis A and B, meningitis, and influenza has propelled the market growth. Additionally, the global surge in demand for COVID-19 vaccination provided a significant opportunity for the market. Overall, the COVID-19 epidemic had a positive impact on the market and is expected to further fuel growth due to the introduction of booster vaccination doses. Immunization coverage is expanding with financial support from international organizations such as GAVI Alliance, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Path. More [vaccines](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/vaccine-market) including those for life-threatening diseases are being increasingly available to the population. In developing nations, innovative funding mechanisms are implemented to increase vaccination coverage and provide new vaccines. In June 2017, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) extended its support for the introduction of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) till 2020 in low- and middle-income countries. This will make the vaccine available to millions of children via the routine immunization program aimed at eradicating polio. Increasing research and investment in the development of vaccines is also one of the key drivers of the market. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research Institute of Infection and Immunity supports and funds research activities aimed at reducing the burden of infectious diseases, allergies, and immune-mediated diseases. The institute invests around USD 1 million per year to support the research of hepatitis C, USD 45.7 million through partnerships for pandemic influenza research, and USD 22.5 million to support the CIHR HIV/AIDS Research Initiative. Furthermore, technological advancements for the efficient delivery of vaccines are expected to propel market growth. The need for needle-free delivery of these products has risen owing to needle stick injuries, risk of infections due to reuse of needles, and transmission of blood-borne infections due to improper sterilization of [needles](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/needles-market). The growing interest of key players and various international organizations and institutions in novel delivery technologies such as jet injectors and microneedles is also expected to drive the market in the future. In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that it is developing a new microneedle patch, along with the Georgia Institute of Technology for vaccination against measles and a few other vaccine-preventable diseases. In 2021, the syringes segment held the largest revenue share of over 85.0%. Syringes are most commonly used to administer vaccines. They are largely used in routine immunization and mass vaccination programs as they are inexpensive and effective. Novel and technologically advanced syringes such as auto-disposable syringes and [prefilled syringes](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/pre-filled-syringes-market) are gaining popularity. However, many people have a phobia of needles used in syringes because of the pain caused by them. Improper sterilization of needles and their reuse increases the risk of various infections. Thus, auto-disable syringes, which are safe and meant for single use, are being widely used in immunization campaigns. Adoption of prefilled syringes is also increasing due to various advantages associated with their usages such as operational efficiency, minimized vaccine wastage, and improved patient safety. In 2021, the intradermal segment held the largest revenue share of more than 60.0%. This route of vaccine delivery has attracted interest in the past few years owing to benefits such as dose sparing, improved safety, and improved access to vaccines. These factors are expected to contribute to the growth of this segment over the following years. Furthermore, an increase in the studies of alternative methods for intradermal administration with novel devices such as jet injectors and microneedles is anticipated to drive the segment. Intramuscular vaccination is projected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. The majority of vaccines are administered through the intramuscular route. Delivery through this route reduces adverse reactions at the injection site. Intramuscular injections are widely adopted because they deliver medications deep inside muscle tissues, which results in quick absorption. North America dominated the market in 2021 with a revenue share of over 30.0%. Growing immunization coverage, increasing investments in R&D for new vaccines, and the high prevalence of infectious diseases are key contributors to the growth of the market. In addition, sophisticated healthcare infrastructure and high awareness among the public as well as healthcare professionals have contributed to the large share of the market. MEA is expected to register the fastest growth rate over the forecast period owing to a large patient pool, growing target population, high unmet needs, and improving infrastructure in the region. Unhealthy lifestyles and growth in the aging population who are susceptible to infectious diseases are leading to the increased occurrence of diseases. Technological infrastructure developments and increased awareness regarding vaccination benefits are also expected to boost the market growth. Many governments worldwide are increasing their spending on vaccination and demonstrating strong and effective leadership and ownership of immunization programs. Vaccine-preventable diseases are among the major contributors to illness and long-term disabilities in developing nations. However, increasing funding, emerging vaccine manufacturers in developing regions, the presence of key players, and increasing efforts to promote the use of vaccines in middle- and low-income countries are expected to fuel growth in developing nations. Significant funding for R&D and new product launches are crucial strategies adopted by leading companies to capture a larger share of the global market. For instance, in August 2021, Vaccines developed by the Serum Institute of India acquired a 50% share in a pharma packing firm, Schott Kaisha. This initiative positions the Serum Institute of India in a joint venture with Schott AG, a specialty glass company based in Germany. Additionally, various initiatives taken by government agencies to develop new vaccines provide opportunities for growth in the market. For instance, in March 2022, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) launched a clinical trial for the evaluation of three HIV vaccines in their experimental phase. The vaccines are based on a messenger RNA (mRNA) platform, which is a technology previously used in multiple approved Covid-19 vaccines.
