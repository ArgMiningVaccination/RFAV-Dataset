Asthma is a chronic (long-lasting) disease affecting the lungs' airways. The tubes that let air into and out of your lungs are called airways which may occasionally swell and restrict if you have asthma. As a result, it is more difficult for air to leave your airways when you exhale. It results in recurrent coughing episodes at night or in the early morning, shortness, chest tightness, and wheezing. Asthma affects 17.23 million people nationwide in India, with a 2.05% total prevalence. Asthma can be triggered by allergens, i.e., substances that cause allergies. Asthma symptoms could appear if you inhale anything to which you are allergic. Therefore, avoiding contact with recognized allergens is recommended to lessen or prevent asthma episodes. Environmental irritants can trigger an asthma attack. Even though people are not allergic to these things like strong perfumes, etc., they can irritate inflamed airways. Our treatment includes medications and a dietary routine that help control the symptoms so that you can lead a regular, active life. As per the Asthma specialists, following symptoms are observed: Asthma causes inflammation and blockages, which can lead to shortness of breath as one of its primary symptoms. If you feel like your chest is tight, it may be tough to take deep breaths and move air in and out of your chest. Wheezing, a whistling sound when you breathe. It is most obvious when you breathe out. 40% of asthma sufferers experience this symptom nightly. Coughing induced by asthma can happen after physical activity, exposure to certain triggers, laughter. There are several types of Asthma: Asthma can develop at any age, and adult-onset asthma is a description used for adults who develop asthma. This form of asthma is triggered by physical activity. It is caused by irritants in the air not related to allergies such as burning wood, cigarette smoke, cold air, air fresheners, perfumes. It is caused by triggers in the workplace such as dust, dyes, gases and fumes, industrial chemicals, animal proteins, and rubber latex. In this type of Asthma, symptoms get worse at night. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a collection of lung diseases that cause breathing problems and obstruct airflow. Most people with asthma will not develop COPD, and many people with COPD don't have asthma. Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome occurs when a person has these two diseases at once. In this type of Asthma, symptoms are triggered by medications. This type of asthma is characterized by a persistent, dry cough The following are a few diagnostic techniques for identifying asthma: Lung function tests, sometimes known as pulmonary function tests, determine whether you have asthma. The effectiveness of your ability to breathe in and out is measured by lung function testing. In addition, these examinations track your respiration. To evaluate the immune system, blood tests are prescribed. Eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, and immunoglobulin E(IgE), an antibody, will be measured. A severe case of asthma may be present if the levels are high. Any exposure to environmental conditions at work or home can exacerbate asthma. For instance, pollen, dust mites, mold, cockroaches, and particular foods may cause allergies in some people. In addition, asthma can be brought on by environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke and cleaning products. Keep asthma under control with these tips: Are you not convinced yet?

The causes of asthma are minimized by homeopathic treatment, which also decreases the recurrence of symptoms. For the purpose of prescribing asthma medications, a homeopath keeps a record of your physical and psychological characteristics, family history, and medical history. The choice of medicine used in the homeopathic treatment of asthma differs from patient to patient because the symptoms may sometimes vary. The bronchi of the lungs are promptly relaxed by homeopathic medicine, and the excessive mucus secretion is stopped. The duration of activity exceeds that of the ineffective allopathic drug. According to extensive scientific research, homeopathic asthma treatment is more advantageous and result-oriented than allopathic asthma treatment.
