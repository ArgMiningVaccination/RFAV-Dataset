Summer Issue submissions for fellowship news must be submitted by 1 July 2023to Steve Fouch at:communications@cmf.org.uk3 SPRING 2023 My mother had a saying whenever the news proudly proclaimed thatscientists had made a major newdiscovery of what some might call the 'blooming obvious', such as that babies need touch andsmiles to thrive. She would roll her eyes, pronounce a loud 'Ha!', and retort, 'Mothers have known that foryears!' We have known much since time immemorialthat science is 'discovering' to be true. One of the latest such 'truths' is the growing body of research suggesting that thankfulness is integral to maintaining and promoting mentalhealth. 1 Over the last decade, research has shown that expressing gratitude toanother person helps build wellbeing and social bonds. Expressing gratitude, in general, is associated with lower levelsof anxiety, stress, and depression. 2 I can hear my mother saying 'Ha!' and rolling her eyes once again. But we should not be surprised or roll our eyes. All truth is God's truth, as bothAugustine and Calvin wisely observed. 3 Today in our culture the scientic methodis seen as the most effective way ofuncovering how the universe works. Butthe same is true in reverse - just because knowledge is ancient and not drawn from modern science doesnot necessarily make it invalid. So, while I do have to ask who an agnostic or atheist is thankful to when practising 'dailygratitudes', 4 Scripture urges Christians to give thanks constantly and for all things to God, 5 the one in whom all things have their origin. Thankfulness for all God's gifts has been one of the central features ofChristian prayer since before the time of Jesus himself. The Jewish hymn 'Dayenu', sung at Passover for centuries (if not millennia!), sums up thisthankfulness. Dayenu roughly translates as 'it would have been enough' . In recounting the story of theExodus, in each of the hymn's fteen stanzas, the refrain says, 'Lord, it would have been enough' . If he had split the sea for us,and had not brought us through to dry land,Lord, it would have been enough 6 I wonder how often we pray that way? Lord, it would have been enough that I woke and started my day with breakfast, but you showed methat sunrise on my walk to work through the car park. Lord, it would have been enough that we saved that patient, but you let me see his family's relief and joy. Lord, it would have been enough to have made it through my shift in one piece, but you gave me afriend with whom to talk and pray it over. God is a generous giver. Twelve-basketfuls-of- leftovers generous. 7 The current narrative in the media and our professions is about crisis and stress,overload and despair. While this challenging time canneither be denied nor ignored, neither can we forget thankfulness for the blessings with which God still daily showers us. In editing this edition of Triple Helix, I have much to be thankful for. Firstly the topic of new technology.The authors in this edition have reminded me that wehave so much to thank God for in modern medicine,from the pioneering surgery of John Hunter andChristian Barnard in previous centuries to thepotential of AI and genome sequencing in diagnostics,robotics in surgery, and computers powered byneurones, in this. The authors have done a wonderful job of balancing the potential for goodand evil as they explore these emergingtechnologies. We hope you are similarlystimulated to thanksgiving and prayerfulwatchfulness. I am also thankful to God for the fantastic creative team who pulled this edition together. The authors, inparticular, deserve considerable credit for grappling with such complex, dense,and fast-moving ideas. I am alsothankful for our Editor, David Smithard,for his creativity in networking,commissioning, and exploration of new ideas; Kevina Kiganda, our Digital Communications Coordinator, for advising on thedigital and social media aspects of the new design;Jennie Pollock, our Head of Public Policy, with herkeen proofreader's eyes, and Darren Southworth of S2 Design, our designer who has redesigned this,CMF's flagship magazine. Also, many thanks to the Triple Helix Editorial Committee who have allinputted into this edition in too many ways to list. It would have been enough if the Lord had given us good writers, but he also gave us all these othercreative individuals. We hope you like what theircombined efforts have produced. Finally, our prayer is that we all nd encouragement and thankfulness in our day-to-day lives, as weremember all God's abundant goodness to us amidstour trials and hardships. \u00a2All truth is God's truth, as bothAugustine andCalvin wiselyobservedEDITORIAL Steve Fouch is CMF Head of Communications references (accessed 10/3/23) 1.

SCAN FOR MORENEWS & COMMENT On On 27 February 2023, BBC's Panorama ran an 'investigation'into pregnancy advice centres,claiming that they give misleading information to pregnant women.They found 57 centres listed online, couldfind no fault with 34 of them and sent anundercover journalist in to investigate three.The journalist presenting it spoke only towomen who were unhappy with the centres,and not the many who were satisfied withthe support they had received. And whilethere were causes for concern in the practiceand advice giving of the three centres visited,overall the piece was biased and very one-sided. In 1968, when the abortion law came into effect, there were nearly 3,000 abortionseach month. Just three years later, in 1971,that number had risen to 10,500 per month.It has never dropped below that rate since,reaching nearly 18,000 (17,906/month) in2021 (the last year for which data isavailable). That is a lot of women choosing to terminate their pregnancies - a lot of babiesbeing killed. For context, there were justover 52,000 live births per month in 2021. Inpregnancies where the mother had a choice,one in four chose to end it by abortion. Of course, many women and their partnerssuffer the tragedy of the miscarriage orstillbirth of their much-wanted babies. And there are, equally tragically, too manyexamples of women being forced or coercedinto having an abortion against their will. One quote from the commentators in the documentary (who all seemed to work forabortion providers or agencies referring tothem) stood out. Jo Holmes, of the BritishAssociation for Counselling andPsychotherapy (BACP), proclaimed, 'It's nota baby when you've got a choice - it's apregnancy, it's an unplanned pregnancy, 4 SPRING 2023 'podbabies' who are they kidding? Trevor Stammers CMF Public Policy Associate women experience deep feelings of regret, guilt, and sadness, often for many yearsafter an abortion. Yes, these things are likely to be distressing for a woman with an unwantedpregnancy. Yes, they should becommunicated sensitively and gently. No,they should not be exaggerated or shared in a pushy way, trying to scare women intokeeping their babies. But as for any othermedical procedure, the woman should begiven sufficient evidence about theprocedure, its outcome, and its possible sideeffects in order to enable her to make aninformed choice. Coercion and manipulation work both ways, and both should be stopped. \u00a2Ectogenesis - the gestation ofchildren in articial wombs - haslong been considered by manyfeminist writers as the ultimate liberation for women from the tyranny ofreproduction. If a concept video, misleadinglyentitled EctoLife: The World's First Articial Womb Facility is anything to go by thenectogenesis is so superior to conventionalpregnancy no one would ever think ofcarrying a child themselves ever again. Ectogenesis of lambs for up to four weeks in a Biobag was rst reported in 2017, andmore recently, mouse embryos have beengrown in an articial womb for up to 12 days- half their gestational age. However, theheadline writers cannot resist adding,'humans could be next' . They certainly won'tbe! A recent article, quoting Matt Kemp,who runs the perinatal lab at WesternAustralia's Women and Infants ResearchFoundation, claries, '...clinical trialsinvolving human babies are a long way off '. Some comment on the Ectolife vision has been highly critical, not primarily about thetimescale of the project, but the wisdom ofit. A recent, insightful blog entitled an unexpected pregnancy, or an unwantedpregnancy' . Blatantly saying that unless youwant it, what is growing inside you is not ababy. To show evidence to the contrary (egfrom a fetal ultrasound) is 'misinformation' . What was abundantly clear in the Panorama programme was that whileHolmes and other commentators wantedwomen to be able to have a choice, theystrongly objected to that being an informedchoice. They didn't want women to be toldthat having a medical abortion at homemeant that the pills would kill their babyand then cause them to pass it, usually intothe toilet. They didn't want them to beoffered ultrasounds in order to see the babythey were making choices about. Theydidn't want them to be told that many'Podbabies: coming to a womb facility nearyou' concludes, 'A mother's devotion to her baby is the template for our (wavering) beliefthat all human life has value. When we stopmaking mothers, we hack at the foundationsof that value. Pity the factory-made infants,newborn and helpless in such a world .' The God of the Bible alludes to the devotion of a mother as an analogy of hisown dedication and commitment to hispeople. 'Can a mother forget the baby at herbreast and have no compassion on the childshe has borne? Though she may forget, I willnot forget you! ' (Isaiah 49:15). In our secular age, a mother's love for her baby is rightlyappealed to as an indicator of the intrinsic value and dignity of all human life. But the Scriptures reveal that even that love, for allits burning intensity, is but a reflection ofdivine love. In future decades, we may eventually physiologically replicate gestation in a pod,but the maternal bonds wrought in amother's womb never can be. They can, ofcourse, be despised or dismissed, but it willbe at the next generations' peril. \u00a2when is a baby not a baby? changing the language of abortion Jennie Pollock CMF Head of Public Policy Full story at cmf.li/3yfMHlOFull story at cmf.li/3BylRY15 SPRING 2023 Recent months have seen a steady stream of alarmingreports from Canada about theprogress and implementation of their Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD)programme. In the wake of media stories, such as those of the disabled man who applied forMAiD out of fear of being made homeless, 1 the army veteran suffering from PTSD whowas offered MAiD by an employee ofVeterans Affairs Canada, 2 and the woman suffering from multiple chemicalsensitivities who died by MAiD after herpleas for suitable accommodation wentunheeded, 3 Professor Leonie Herx came to the UK in January to urge legislators, medicsand campaigners to heed Canada's warning. Speaking at public and private events in Jersey, Scotland and the Isle of Man, Herxhighlighted these and many other stories ofMAiD being sought or offered for conditionsfar outside the strict boundaries of theoriginal legislation. At an event hosted byCMF, Herx noted that MAiD must be fundedfrom within existing healthcare budgets,which most often means drawing from thealready-stretched palliative care sector. Herx is also one of dozens of signatories to a response to February's Report of theSpecial Joint Committee on MedicalAssistance in Dying. 4 The letter states that the committee 'ignored much of the input of the ... experts and individuals with livedexperience who expressed concern andcaution. ...[T]hese invited witnesses wereroutinely talked over, ignored, argued with,and at times, openly disparaged by committeemembers', and the resulting report reflectsthis bias in favour of MAiD's expansion. 5 Canada is the 'canary in the coalmine', alerting the world to the sobering reality ofthe inevitable expansion of assisted suicidelaws once introduced. We hope and praythat Scotland, the Isle of Man and Jerseywill heed the warning. \u00a2human organs is a tempting alternative. And there are plenty willing to source humanbody parts for a price to meet that need. At the other end of the 'supply chain', a worsening global economic situationmeans the poorest in the world will beincreasingly vulnerable to the lure ofpromises of work and a few thousandpounds in exchange for a kidney. Whilst the Scriptures obviously do not refer to organ donation per se, they dospecically refer to the giving of one's life for another (John 15:13). Live kidney donation,though not without some risks, rarely resultsin the loss of the donor's life. Deceaseddonation should surely not be problematic for those who know that the eternal destiny of their souls is not dependent on the stateof the 'earthly tent' (2 Corinthians 5:1) thatwe leave behind at our death. The more general principles of kindness (Ephesians 4:32), love towards anotherin honour (Romans 12:10), all surely pointtowards an attitude of being open todeceased donation as a minimum moralrequirement. Living donation should also be something that Christians ought to be at least raising from time to time in their fellowships and churches. Tackling organ trafficking is a massively complex task, but reducing the demand fororgans by all ethical means has to be a part of that solution. I have been a regularlyworshipping Christian for over a half acentury, and not once have I ever heardreference made to organ donation at anychurch event. While some Christiansadvocate for altruistic organ donation (ie notfor gain and to a stranger - as in John 15:3 - giving one's life (or kidney) for another),deceased donation is far more common. Faith in Operation is a network for Christians in the UK interested in donatingorgans altruistically. Their founder, JoeWalsh, shared his story on the CMF blogs back in 2020. We need to share more storiesand see more responses like this across theglobal church. \u00a2references (accessed 15/03/2023) 1. Mulligan C, Bond M.

We don't need to be aware of all the intricate details of whatever proceduresare involved to understand the basic moralconsiderations. We all recognise that every area ofmedicine, including research such as clinical trialsetc., are subject to strict ethical scrutiny. Although we recognise that careful ethical considerations govern allforms of clinical work (and one wouldin no way wish to disparage this), it must be remembered that theseethical standards generally stem froma mindset that does not necessarilyconform with a Christian viewpoint.Science (including medicine) andsociety today are very stronglyinfluenced by Darwinian evolutionarythinking. They are resistant, often veryvocally, to the biblical account of theorigin of humankind and its account of the origin of the earth and the solar system. The divine is thus excluded from human thought processes. This leads to humanity assigning the honour for our achievements to ourselves and ourselves alone.Like the residents of Babel, 2 we want to construct a tower to reach the heavens and make a name forourselves. There is nothing wrong with ambition or a wish to improve one's lot, but an attitude of selshpride is contrary to biblical teaching. 3 All this is unsurprising as humankind opposes God and the things of God. 4 Fallen individuals do not want to acknowledge God as the Creator. To do soplaces us in a position of self-perceived inferiority.This impinges on our self-esteem. We do not wantto have what we perceive as a secondary status. Wedon't want to be told what to do. We don't want ourself-directed pride and achievements to be dented inany way or the credit for them to be attributedelsewhere. The concept of the sovereignty of Godoffends us because it means we are not in control.Indeed, it is a death blow to human autonomy. As Christians, we recognise and attest to the attributes of God, which include his foreknowledge,sovereignty, and power. We know that God hascreated everything and that he has made humankindin his image. 5 We did not simply appear as the result of a purely random, gradual process, some billions ofyears long, in which primaeval slime (wherever thatcame from!) gradually metamorphosed via ape-likecreatures into the human form as we now know it. Humans were created as intelligent beings, and medicine gives us a plethora of examples of ouringenuity. Indeed, it is astonishing what advancesare now being made. Just over half a century ago,Christian Barnard could not have contemplatedrobotic machines performing surgery any more than the pioneering surgeon John Hunter of theeighteenth century could have envisaged hearttransplant operations. Articial intelligence (AI) is demonstrated by machines rather than humans. It is part of everydaylife in search engines, speech recognition such as in the Alexa devices used by many, and computer games. In medicine, AI can pick up details in scans that the human eye can miss, and it is already being used for this purpose.Nevertheless, the potential dangersare well recognised, including themooted possibility of super-intelligent AI improving beyond the ability of humans to control it.This led Stephen Hawking to suggestin a BBC interview that such adevelopment could 'spell the end ofthe human race '. 6 William Cheshire's piece in this edition explores thetheological and ethical implications of AI in medicine in more detail. As already noted, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can provide genomic information that caninfluence the evaluation and treatment of inheriteddisorders. Supercially this seems helpful and indeeddesirable; in practice, the pre-natal identication ofan inherited disorder could also lead to an abortion.This raises ethical questions for Christians involvedin this area of investigation. Melody Redman andFrancis Sansbury's article in this edition addressesthese and related issues in more depth. In day-to-day clinical practice, most Christian healthcare workers are not f aced with pressing ethical problems that trouble their consciences. Weare dealing with sick people and do our best in oftendifficult circumstances to alleviate their suffering andeffect improvement. Jesus healed the sick, and suchis our aim as well. Nevertheless, as in all aspects oflife, although we are under authority, it is primarilythe authority of Christ to which we owe obedience,and that authority must take precedence. 7 The modern world generally regards the human race as the product of a continuous sequence ofrandom events with no direction. Homo sapiens are thus perceived as merely another animal, albeit onewith superior skills and intelligence. Christians havea very different way of looking at these matters. Weacknowledge God as Creator and the One to whomwe are responsible and must answer. Humanity ismade in the image of God and must answer to him.While acknowledging man's ingenuity (itself a giftfrom God), we must not permit wonder at this todetract from a proper sense of awe and reverencetoward God himself, the Creator of all things. This truth must be at the forefront of our minds and dictate our ethics and clinical practice. To do so is to bear witness to God and the gospel in ourinteractions with our colleagues. \u00a2 influenced by Darwinian evolutionary thinking.

Consider the impact of anaesthesia, antibiotics, the hypodermicsyringe, the stethoscope, X-ray imaging,MRI, articial ventilators, pagers,pacemakers, organ transplants, genesequencing - the list goes on. The rst useof each of these inventions revolutionised the diagnosis and treatment of the sick. Technologyturns the pages of the book of medical progress. Prophets of the technosphere predict that the next wave of extraordinary progress lies with articial intelligence, or 'AI' . This refers to the simulation ofhuman intelligence by machines programmed tomimic human thought patterns such as learning,adapting to new data, problem-solving, executingcomplex tasks, and even social interaction - withoutbeing assisted by humans. Enthusiasm for itstransformative potential has led to predictions thatAI will usher in a fourth technological revolutioncomparable to the neolithic transition to agriculture,the industrial revolution utilising mechanisedproduction, and the digital revolution based oncomputer processing of digital information. medical AI What AI might mean for medicine is a subject ofexciting speculation. Inspired by accelerating change,the CEO of Google has predicted that, within the nextve years, 'we will shift to a world that is AI-rst '. 1 The challenge for physicians will be to calibrate medical AI in such a way as to place the interests of patientsrst. With that in mind, a responsible approach tomaking decisions about medical AI must not belimited to technique but should thoughtfully explorethe ethics of human interaction with technology. AI T FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR William P Cheshire is a neurologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL AI William P Cheshire looks at the emerging use of articial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in medicine, the great opportunities it presents to improve treatment and care,and the pitfalls and dangers we should be awar e of as Christian health professionals.9 SPRING 2023 ways to think about technology The bioethicist Michael Sleasman offers a helpful, ethical framework for thinking through decisionsabout the use of technology. 2 He proposes four categories, which he labels as sentimentalism,messianism, pragmatism, and responsibilism. Howone navigates these categories and balances theirconcerns draws from prior assumptions about what it means to be human and a thinking, morallyresponsible being. technological sentimentalism In one corner are those who instinctively question or resist technological innovation. They may feelthreatened by technological trends that erodekindness in communication or seem to treat peopleas things to be manipulated. Finding it increasinglydifficult to unplug from electronic connectivity, theyfeel that technology deprives them of a more naturalway of inhabiting the world. They see technology asthe source of a host of social problems, and thusnovel technologies such as AI as a Pandora's box ofpotential new problems. Recognising that AI has thepotential to magnify biases in data, they worry that AI could worsen unjust disparities and socialinequalities, placing the poor and vulnerable at agreater disadvantage. Sentimentalists value beingsatised with what one has and lament the loss ofwhat is nostalgically imagined as a simpler, lesstechnological age. Sentimental rejection of medicalAI, however, would deny us its benets. technological messianism At another corner are those who regard technology asintrinsically good and desirable. The potential usefulbenets of AI stagger the imagination, especially as medical progress relies increasingly on digitaltechnologies. The enormous amount of data in everyperson's genome and the accumulating scienticcontent in medical journals exceed the capacity of the human brain to recall, interpret, or synthesise all there is to know about health and disease. AI promises to augment our ability to assess this 'megadata' and bridge the information gap. Analready familiar application of AI is natural languageprocessing to generate clinical notes efficiently fromspeech. In medical research, machine-learningalgorithms are mining vast clinical data sets to detectpreviously unrecognised disease patterns. Articialneural networks radiographic, histologic, and morphologicimages with stunning diagnostic accuracy. Suchadvances may lead to earlier detection of diseasewhen it is more easily treatable. We can trace optimism in technological progress to the European Enlightenment, which sought toimprove the human condition by applying rationalknowledge and invention to full material needs.Optimism in technology can overlook unintended bad consequences, and it flies off the rails if taken to the extreme by those who would place ultimatehope in machinery as the saviour of society. The uncritical adoption of technology sometimes appeals to the technological imperative, which is the philosophical claim that technology in all itsachievable forms is inevitable. The technologicalimperative bows to this supposed inevitability and reduces to the belief that if it can be done, it should be done. Such fatalism is seriously mistaken becauseit abandons ethics by denying the role of humandecision and responsibility. technological pragmatism The prevailing attitude toward technology today is pragmatism, which regards usefulness as theultimate measure of truth and meaning. From apragmatic perspective, AI is a transactional tool for solving human problems by plugging predictedbenets and risks into a mathematical equation,digesting more and more data to calculate potentialconsequences far into the future. Would such hyper-pragmatism ultimately deliver human flourishing? Thinking about thinking technology brings this question to the forefront. Projects to construct amachine intelligence superior to human intelligencepresuppose that thought is reducible to matter and its physical causes and random collisions. Ifintelligence were nothing more than neurones ringand neurochemicals churning in a particular pattern,then, in principle, intelligence equivalent to orsurpassing the human mind could be replicated in electronic circuits. Some philosophers go so far as to suggest that if machines can mimic humanintelligence, then more powerful machines willeventually exceed it and potentially replace it. TheOxford bioethicist Julian Savulescu speculates that,'Humans may become extinct...We might have reason to save or create such vastly superior lives, rather thancontinue the human line'. 3 One rightly shudders to consider the implications of such a view for medicine. Whereas pragmatism seems objective, its blind spot is the assumption that empirically veriablefacts are the only valid knowledge. If that were true,then ethical problems could be resolved by acquiringa sufficient amount of measurable factual data andsubjecting that data to intense machine analysis. Inreality, facts are necessary but insufficient for ethicalanalysis. As the volume of clinical data increases, thevariables that can interact increase, and the numberof potential outcomes enlarges exponentially. Havingmore facts is not enough. Ethical decisions depend onconsidering what is meant by 'useful,' which requiresassigning to facts not just numerical value but moralvalue. Lacking or ignoring knowledge of moral rightand wrong, pragmatism and computer programs thatemulate it descend into moral relativism. 4 The Robot Will See You Nowedited healthcare totechnology can guideus, the author responsible use of AI must affirm andpreserve the humanaspect of medicine. The author challengesus to use this newtechnology to serveChrist and glorify God in improving the care of patients. key pointsAI SCAN FOR MORE 10 SPRING 2023 CS Lewis understood this when he warned that recognising facts while denying the realm of value undermines the authority of the ethical principlesneeded to justify limits on human manipulation. 5 Unconstrained pragmatism makes it possible tojustify committing any evil, provided a greater benet is predicted for society at large. Powerful computational technology, even if supplied with unimaginable quantities of data andouttted with the superfast computer processingspeed of AI, operates within the realm of fact.Technology, while useful, is not, on its own, the nalanswer to human problems. Virtue is also needed, an aspect of human intelligence that surpasses therealm of factual knowledge where AI operates, not by degree but in kind. technological responsibilism Technological responsibilism realistically acceptsboth the promise and peril of technology whileengaging with it critically and with an awareness of what it means to be human. This perspectiverecognises both fact and value and distinguishesbetween the real and the articial. Technology itself is morally ambiguous and laden with the values of its designers and implementers. AI is a tool, not an agent; a machine made of matter and not a living being. Although AI might be programmed to imitate human emotion and, insome ways, to deliver care, it cannot truly care aboutthe patient. An AI might be programmed to renderresponsible decisions that conform with humanlydecided values, but it cannot be programmed to beresponsible. Applying the attribute of trust to AI,according to physicians Matthew DeCamp and JonTilburt, 'is a category error, mistakenly assuming thatAI belongs to a category of things that can be trusted '. 6 AI cannot be said to have the human attributes of voluntary responsibility, moral agency, motives, orcharacter. Some uses of AI blur the line of moral responsibility. A signature feature of deep learning AIis what is known as its 'black box' problem, in whichhidden layers within articial neural networks areinaccessible to human users, who see only input andoutput and cannot know how the AI is analysing data.One might accept an AI diagnosis of cancer based ona proven track record f or accurate analysis of images. But if an unsupervised AI supplied with clinical datawere to advise an elderly patient to forego life-prolonging treatment without giving reasons, onewould be justied in querying whether the machine'sdecision was ethically valid. Technological responsibilism entails a more comprehensive perspective on human nature than is available within the paradigm of pragmatism.Christian healthcare professionals affirm thathumans are much more than the sum of their cells.Every patient is a precious unity of body and spiritwho is loved by God. 7 All people are endowed with unique dignity as image-bearers of the Creator. 8 Responsible use of technology respects this innatedignity in others, a dignity affirmed by Jesus Christ,who, though being in the form of God, took onhumanity. 9 Unlike AI, which is incapable of compassion, Jesus loves us 10 and came that we might have life abundantly. 11 Moral responsibility for medical AI lies with those who design and implement its programming. This iswhy it matters what moral vision is embedded in thetechnology. For medicine to retain its moral integrity,AI must remain our tool and not become our master.We must ensure we retain the prerogative to overridean AI-generated healthcare decision we believe to bemorally wrong and harmful to patients. In harnessingthe power of AI, we must be careful not to become soenchanted by its technical charm that we lose sight of the special dignity of our patients, who are bearersof God's image. Responsible use of AI extends to an awareness of how its use may influence implicit attitudes towardothers. Once we habitually converse with AI, a meremachine imitating human emotion, we must guardagainst thinking of other persons as objects. The philosopher Jay Richards observes, ' The greatest delusion of our age is the paradoxical penchant to deny our own agency while attributing agency to the machines we create'. 12 conclusion The potential medical benets of AI are promising. If used wisely, AI promises to be a powerful tool toassist Christian healthcare professionals in theircalling to heal the sick and to love and serve those in need. 13 However, caution also is needed to full the Hippocratic imperative to ' rst do no harm '. 14 The eventual entry of superintelligent AI into medicine will challenge healthcare professionals in new ways to choose whom we will serve. Whenwe reach the limit of what we as nite humans canaccomplish, will we place our ultimate trust insupercomputers or in Christ? Will we look to andempower technology, potentially allowing it tomaster us, or will we strive to align our use oftechnology with God's good purposes? Christiansunderstand that God's thoughts are innitely higherthan anything possible by machine intelligence. 15 Christians believe that Christ, not technology, is thetrue saviour, and his teachings are our rst principlesfor providing medical care. Christians know thatChrist, not machine intelligence, is the way, thetruth, and the life, 16 our only reliable source of wisdom, our rescue from disease and death, and our everlasting hope. \u00a2AI references (accessed 17/02/23) 1.

Moore's law observes that the number of transistors in anintegrated circuit doubles every twoyears, 1 and we are familiar with factoids such as the phones we carry in ourpockets containing more computing power than the Apollo spacecraft that carried men to the moon. 2 There are now suggestions that the rate of improvement in chips is slowing as developmentstarts to run up against the physical limits of silicontechnology. Impressive as today's computers are,there is no doubt that they are in many ways punycompared with the power and efficiency of animalbrains. While a smartphone has hundreds ofthousands of times the memory and processingpower of the Apollo computers, they still lag waybehind the brains of mammals. While silicon computers transformed society, theyare still outmatched by the brains of most animals.For example, a cat's brain contains 1,000 timesmore data storage than an average iPad and canuse this information a million times faster. The human brain, with its trillion neuralconnections, is capable of making 15 quintillionoperations per second. TECHNOLOGY T ETHICAL E THICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY BIOLOGICAL NEURONAL NETWORKS Matthew Hosier explores a cutting-edge technology that raises many questions about humanity. Matthew Hosier leads Gateway Church, Poole, and regularly contributes to Think Theology and the CMF Medical Study Group. Human beings are not smartphones whose hardware can be upgraded while the SIM card of the soul is maintained 12 SPRING 2023 This can only be matched today by massive supercomputers using vast amounts of energy. Thehuman brain only uses about 20 watts of energy, orabout the same as it takes to power a lightbulb. Itwould take 34 coal-powered plants generating 500megawatts per hour to store the same amount ofdata contained in one human brain in modern datastorage centres. 3 This vast disparity in storage, processing speed, and energy efficiency between animal brains andsilicon-based computing means that researchers are beginning to explore the possibility of creatingbiological computing. This possibility was brought into focus when Melbourne-based Cortical Labs incorporated braincells in a computer chip. In a paper describing theirresearch, 4 the team show how they made these rst steps in creating a 'synthetic biological intelligence'(SBI). Their 'DishBrain' computer used neurones from both rodent and human sources to create a computing network that learnt to play a version of the classic arcade game Pong. A biological neuronal network (BNN) like DishBrain offers great potential for more powerfulcomputing as the 'wetware' of neurones integrateswith computing hardware using the commonlanguage of electricity. DishBrain demonstrated that a BNN is capable of self-organising - that neuraldevelopment can occur as the computer responds to stimuli and learns to better complete the task it has been set. This fascinating piece of research represents more than mere scientic curiosity: BNNs really could offer the potential for much faster and more powerful computers, breaking free of theconstraints imposed by silicon circuits. As well asmassively improved processing power, these neuralcomputers could use far less energy than existingmachines. They would be smaller, more flexible, andcheaper to run than silicon-based computers. But alongside these fascinating possibilities lie substantial ethical questions. The very name chosen by the Melbourne team is troubling: DishBrain highlights the disembodied nature of what has been created - human neurones,yes, but human neurones operating in a Petri dishculture rather than within a human body. The researchers report signicant diff erences in performance between different cell sources, withhuman neurones possessing superior information-processing capacity to rodent neurones. If this is thecase, we would expect human neurones to bepreferred in future and used in more sophisticated BNNs. How might we feel about super-powerfulcomputers running on wetware comprising self-organising human neurones? And what ethicalconsiderations should researchers and legislators be mindful of as such computers are developed? The human neurones in DishBrain were developed from a stem line from ' an XY donor isolated from neonatal foreskin'. 5 As stem lines go, this is ethically a relatively untroubling one. But if BNN's aredeveloped from stem lines such as this, we shouldstill ask ethical and practical questions. For example, what of donor consent? If tissue samples are used in the creation of neuralcomputers, do the donors need to know this andgive consent? What rights might donors then have?Presumably, BNNs could be of signicant economicvalue, so might donors expect some nancialcompensation? What about intellectual rights as synthetic biological intelligence develops? Or copyright if such computers are able to self-replicate? DishBrain is described by its creators as a rst step in synthetic biological intelligence. This raises thequestion of whether BNNs could develop a form ofconsciousness. Might they be able to feel pain? If so,would they have some kind of rights analogous toexisting human or animal rights? What would be the legal status of such entities? These ethical questions might feel less sharp if human stem lines were being used to develop, say, cardiac or skin cells that were then somehowincorporated in a computer. That it is neurones beingused certainly 'feels' more problematic, even if at afundamental, ethical level, the questions are similar.The reason neurones will be used is because of theirability to self-organise. It is this neural plasticity thatwill enable more powerful BNNs to be developed.But does this mean we really could end up with a brain in a dish? An issue here is the common dualistic tendency to separate consciousness from bodies rather than tospeak of humans having embodied consciousness -the 'embodied soul' we see in the biblical account ofthe creation of human beings. In the popular Animal brains are faster, more energyefficient, andmore self-organisingthan silicon processors,driving becomeconscious or rightsas humans and animalsdo, or is this a categoryerror? The author asks if themore important ethicalquestions are around andcommercialisation ofhuman tissues and of humanity tomere neuronalconnections. key points SCAN FOR MORETECHNOLOGY 13 SPRING 2023 imagination, human consciousness resides in human brains, and machines that incorporate humanneurones might therefore be assumed to have thecapacity to develop human-like consciousness.Certainly, AIs are increasingly able to pass the'Turing test' 6 and give the appearance of consciousness, even if this is only appearance andnot reality. 7 It is likely that BNNs would push ever further in this direction. If computers increasingly incorporate human neuronal networks, and the information they hold is passed from one computer to its replacement, the idea that humans are essentially brainscontained in disposable 'meat shells' will bereinforced. This notion, in turn, willhave a bearing on other applicationsof technology in health and on somegender-related issues that society isgrappling with. This is one reason whythe use of neurones, as comparedwith other types of cells, feelssignicant. So we need to be clear: a biblically framed understanding of humanitywould reject the notion that DishBrain represents the rst step in creatinghuman intelligence abstracted fromthe human body. Biblically speaking,human beings can only be understoodas embodied souls created in theimage of God. So God created mankind in his ownimage, in the image of God hecreated them; male and female hecreated them. (Genesis 1:27) This creation was bodily (material flesh and blood), binary (male and female), and self-sustaining (oriented towards reproduction). Human beings are not smartphones whosehardware can be upgraded whil e the SIM card of the soul is maintained. There is a body-and-soul integrityto men and women which cannot be abstracted onefrom the other. That we might use the analogy ofcomputing hardware and software to understandhuman intelligence (just as previous generationsused the analogies of the technologies of their day, such as steam power, or clockwork) isunderstandable. But we are made in the image of God, not the image of a computer. The fantasies of sci- seem to be increasingly being realised, and it is not impossible to imaginethat, in time, we will be able to create androids with'brains' built around a BNN and bodies that are ableto interact with the world in a way analogous to how humans do - like Bishop in the movie Aliens. 8 Such creations would be impressive and ethicallytroubling, but they would not be human. They wouldstill be hardware and wetware, not embodied souls created in the image of God. Far more likely than such a scenario, however, is that BNNs start to be incorporated into moreprosaic computing technology to improve battery life, processing power and memory. Even if we are clear that such computers are not human, we willstill need to decide whether their use is appropriate- where on the 'lawful but not benecial' 9 spectrum would such machines sit? So long as the stem-cell lines from which neurones are produced are ethically sourced andissues around consent and ownership properly addressed, we might nd noparticular problem in the use ofBNNs. In this case, we might viewneurones as simply a type of circuitry.However, it is likely that many wouldfeel disturbed by such computers ortroubled in conscience by their use.An analogy might be found invaccines developed using fetal tissue lines. That there is a directconnection, albeit distant andattenuated, with a real person could cause understandable disquiet. Another theological line of thought to consider is the general biblicalprejudice against one humanpossessing ownership of anotherhuman or even parts of their body.This is seen in a variety of biblicalsources, from the rigid prohibitionagainst murder in Genesis 9:6 and Exodus 20:13, 10 to a rejection of prostitution, 11 to the condemnation of slave traders. 12 Within our cultural framework, this Christian legacy has led not only to the abolition of slavery but to the fact that inEnglish common law, no one actually legally owns a dead body. 13 (There was a subtle but signicant change in this in May 2020 with the introduction ofthe 'opt out' register for organ donation.) 14 If BNNs were to develop to the extent that the phones in ourpockets contained human tissue; tissue which weown, that would repr esent a signicant moral and legal shift. For these reasons, and others space does not allow us to consider, we should be extremelycautious about the development of BNNs. As withdevelopments in embryo research, we should wishfor governments to be a step ahead of researchers in setting ethical guardrails around the developmentof such technologies. Sadly, that might be wishfulthinking. \u00a2references (accessed 17/02/23) 1. , 18 Nov. 2022, bit.ly/3lEEZOV 2. Kendall G. Would your mobile phone be powerful enough to get you to themoon?

Because WGS can revealmuch more information,it is both more clinicallyuseful and likely to revealunexpected issues andproblems. Unpacking the humangenome does not revealwho we truly are, and theauthors remind us thatour identity and the value of human beingstranscends genetics; it isonly to be found in ourrelationship with Christ. key pointsMelody Redman and Francis Sansbury unpack a complex and rapidly expanding area of medicine. 14 SPRING 2023 he NHS introduced Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in early 2021 for a range of indications. 1 Further background reading on WGS and itsseveral positive impacts is availablein our blog on this topic. 2 Here, we focus on the potential challengesarising from WGS (though they may also apply to other forms of genetic testing) andthen explore how we can apply a Christianworldview in this eld. what is Whole Genome Sequencing? Our genome is our body's set of genetic information,including over 20,000 genes. Whole GenomeSequencing (WGS) aims to sequence all of someone's DNA, although an NHS laboratory would only analyse a small part of this. Often, a trio is used for WGS. Thismeans testing the patient and bothbiological parents, which is helpful forinterpreting the results. the National Genomic Research Library and BigData Patients who undergo WGS in England are asked for permission fortheir genomic data to be added to theNational Genomic Research Library(NGRL). 3 The NGRL stores WGS data and can also link this to the patient'swider primary and secondary careNHS records. If a patient chooses to fully withdraw from the NGRL, their data will be removed from futureresearch, but cannot be removed from research thatis underway or has already taken place. challenges: incidental ndings WGS may reveal incidental or unexpected ndings, such as adult-onset neurological disorders or cancerpredisposition genes in children. Although NHSlaboratories will not look for these, sometimes theycannot avoid seeing them. variant classication and uncertainty Genetic changes may be classied as a 'variant of uncertain signicance' (VOUS/VUS), if there is insufficient evidence to know if the variant is a benign human variation or pathogenic. Furtherinformation (such as family segregation studies orresearch) may enable re-classication, but patientsmay be left with uncertainty. Families can nd thisuncertainty difficult. VUSs may be more common in different ethnic groups who have been under-represented in genetic testing.revealing biological parentage Because a trio would often be used (comparing thepatient's sample to mum and dad), non-paternity or non-maternity can be identied. This unexpectedinformation can cause complex ethical dilemmasand may not be disclosed if it is not relevant to thepatient's care. reproductive options Couples may face challenging decisions aboutreproduction if they know their genetic status. Thereis some evidence that having genetic testing mayhelp those who know their status, whether or notthey opt for prenatal diagnosis. 4 Pre-implantation genetic testing involves the discarding of affectedembryos. 5 Testing in pregnancy is often offered, particularly when a person plans to have an abortionif the baby is affected. 6 sharing information with close relatives Obtaining a genetic result or an incidental nding may haveimplications for other familymembers. Should one's geneticinformation remain private to them,or should that information be sharedwhere there are potential healthimpacts for others? This is a hugelycomplex area for individuals and forsociety. As clinical geneticists, whilstwe seek to maintain the patient'scondentiality, we must also consider the potential risk and consequences to other familymembers if an individual refuses to share thatinformation. A 2020 High Court Case (ABC v StGeorge's University Hospital NHS FT) highlightedcomplexities around this balancing act. 7 consent For WGS, 'fully-informed' consent may not bepossible. 8 Rather than using a 'consent form', NHS doctors in England use a 'Record of Discussion' 9 where we communicate types of situations such as complex, uncertain or unexpected results. When the patient undergoing WGS is a child, usually someone with parental responsibility would completethe Record of Discussion to approve the test goingahead. Typically, parents can only consent to testingwhen the genetic variant would be of relevance duringchildhood. However, the test may reveal carrier statusfor recessive conditions or other incidental ndingsthat are not relevant in childhood. How and whenshould these ndings be communicated? data security and access It is crucial that genomic data is kept securely. Thereare also questions around access to this data - forT England are asked for permission for their genomic data to be added to the National Genomic Research Library (NGRL). and can also link this to the patient's wider primary and secondary care NHS records. NGRL, their data will be removed from future research, but cannot be removed from research that is underway or has already taken place. challenges: incidental ndings WGS may reveal incidental or unexpected ndings, such as adult-onset neurological disorders or cancer predisposition genes in children. Although NHS laboratories will not look for these, sometimes they cannot avoid seeing them. like Jesus, we must expresscompassionand walk withpeople whoface theseexperiences 15 SPRING 2023 GENETICS 16 SPRING 2023 example, should Genomics England be permitted to receive fees for using patients' data when for-protcompanies conduct research? inequities and inequalities The dystopian near-future in the lm Gattaca 10 shows a society where individuals are categorisedand discriminated against based on their geneticcomposition. Polygenic screening of embryos is already available in the USA, 11 although the European Society of Human Genetics has called this an 'unproven, unethical practice ' . 12 There are already issues around equity within the devolved nations of the UK; the NHS Long Term PlanWGS aims relate to England only. There are alsoissues of equity worldwide. applying the Christian worldview God created human beings in his image, 13 and God knows us even before we are formed in the womb. 14 However, Scripture also tells of thefall 15 and that humanity is marred by sin. 16 The genomes of humans and other organisms have becomecorrupted, leading to death, disease,and decay. However, through Jesus,we have an eternal hope because hewill return and, on that day, ' There will be no more death or mourning orcrying or pain, for the old order ofthings has passed away ' . (Revelation 21:4) Whilst we are responsible forcaring for our bodies, we mustbalance this with not becomingpreoccupied with searching for futurerisks of disease or genetic perfectionor believing that our identity lies in our genome. Genetic conditions vary widely in the nature and severity of their effects. Many geneticconditions can cause great pain and suffering - bothto the patient and to their loved ones. Families canexperience feelings of guilt, fear for the future, andconcern about other children or family members.Like Jesus, we must express compassion 17 and walk with people who face these experiences. As with many technologies, genetic testing, including WGS, can be used for great good. Forexample, WGS can help reach a relevant diagnosisfor the patient. However, it can also be used forpurposes which many of us would regard aspotentially harmful, such as testing a fetus for thepresence of a condition to decide whether to end apregnancy. We are all one in Christ Jesus, regardless of status or disability. 18 If we believe that life matters from the moment of conception, 19,20 then life should still matter, even if affected by a geneticcondition. However, these decisions are highlyemotive and complicated for families. God calls us to defend the rights of the vulnerable. 21 Jesus perfectly exemplied both how to be sensitive andcompassionate and how not to compromise on sin. 22 The challenge for Christians is to do the same whilst protecting these most vulnerable of people. We are also called to seek justice. 23 If an individual's ability to access insuranceor healthcare were affected by theirgenetic blueprint, or if only the mostgenetically 'superior' embryos werechosen, this would introduce furtherinequalities into society. We musttake care to safeguard againstinequity and inequality. Understanding more about the genome may give us helpful insightsinto aspects of human health anddisease, both on an individual and asocietal level. 'Big data' can benetthe nation's health - such as byidentifying modiable risk factors forillness. But big data can also be usedfor commercial gain or other harmfulpurposes. There is so much that wedo not yet understand about the genome. The Tower of Babel reminds us that whenwe seek to make a name for ourselves and buildsomething monumental, we must carefully considerif this actually aligns with God's will. 24 conclusion The wider rollout of WGS in the NHS poses manypotential opportunities and challenges. 25 Our genome is unique, but it is not where our identitylies. Humans are bearers of God's image. Forbelievers in Jesus, our primary identity is as a child of God. We should seek to prevent any inequalitiesarising from new technologies. Where possible, we should contribute to policy-making andconsultations. We should also walk alongside andshow compassion to those experiencing the effectsof a genetic condition or facing challenging decisionsin this area. \u00a2when we seek Test NHS England. 3 Aug 2018 [updated 2 Feb 2022].england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories 2.

She is married to a Church of England minister and has two young boys embryos are returned. Many genetic conditions are tested for during pregnancy, varying from early tolate gestation. Following testing, parents often facedifficult decisions. Initially, I found providing information about ending pregnancies - some of them very late term - difficult. I have come to realise,however, that my job is to provideinformation and support. Ultimately,it is the parents who are responsiblefor their decisions. At the same time, I always provide the important optionthat it is okay to carry on with thepregnancy. As medicine progresses and we are able to offer so much more ingenetics - even compared to veyears ago - it can feel as though thetesting odyssey never ends. We canand do provide our patients with a lot more understanding and answers.But with that comes expectationsthat are hard to meet. Patients wantanswers; they want to know why a certain situationhas happened to them. Even when genetics canprovide answers, the effects can ripple downfamilies for generations - especially with the morecomplex genomic conditions - which can makeoffering support difficult. The role of a GC is tomanage expectations and provide realism, includingmaking it clear that any genomic nding will impactnot only that one nuclear family but also their muchwider family network. As a Christian, I sometimes wonder whether it is better not to open the Pandora's box that is genetictesting, particularly as our rate of incidental ndingsis becoming more signicant as technologyimproves. In the end, our faulty genes are only anexpression of the sin that has dislocated everythinggood in God's creation. And even when we can ndthe cause of a genetic condition, it does notnecessarily solve the problem. We need a bettersaviour than genetic testing for that! The Biblemakes it clear that we don't always have theanswers. We need to know a contentment that onlycomes from Jesus. 1 The constant striving for answers indicates that some patients are trying to take somecontrol in an often uncontrollable situation.Sometimes, I nd it more helpful to ask, 'how can I help you live with uncertainty and a lack ofknowledge?' rather than, 'let me see what furthertesting we can offer' . The area of practice I nd most challenging to my faith is the question all of us who work in healthcareknow: why do some people have so much pain andsadness in their lives whilst others never experiencesuch grief? This could be the family who have beenaffected by early onset Huntington's disease in everygeneration (where the uncertainty of inheriting thecondition only compounds the grief and guilt formany families). It might be those who experiencethe loss of multiple children or who have severalchildren with severe disabilities. Then there is thefamily marred by a young cancer diagnosis. It canfeel desperate at times, and I often nd myself burdened by sadness. As a Christian, I have faith in the Lord Jesus. I know my nal destination, and this provides me with a sure and certainhope. But many of my patientsendure these difficult situationswithout this faith and yet cope withsuch grace and strength. I oftenwonder if I would respond similarlyeven though I have a relationshipwith the living God who loves me. The areas of my practice most at odds with my Christian faith haveprobably not fully arrived yet. Asmedicine progresses - particularlygenetics - and the values of our society become less rooted in the Judaeo-Christianworldview, I wonder at what point I will have toreassess my practice. Advanced genetic testing forchildren (pre or post-birth), the implications of whichcould lead to parents being able to 'design' theirbaby, transgender issues, and private testing optionsare all ethical concerns that could provide challengesin the future. I am unsure what these challenges willmean for the role of a GC, but as Christians, we arecalled to obey the Word of the Lord, which is neverchanging, and apply it to a medical and ethicallandscape that is ever-changing. \u00a2Even when genetics canprovideanswers, the effects can ripple down families for generations reference 1.

Day in, day out, I wasdealing with extreme deliberate self-harm (DSH),highly distressed people detained for their ownprotection, and aggressive folk under the influenceof multiple substances. To cap it all off, I also had toattend scenes of unexpected death, some moregruesome than others. Many of these people had(obviously or less obviously) died by suicide. These days, I'm a prison GP . More than half of my consultations are overtly psychiatric, and most ofthe rest touch on mental distress. Psychosomaticand functional disorders abound. And usingconsultation model lingo, I take many physical entrytickets for consultations about emotional problems. 1 The frequent attempt to conceal mental painincreases the burden: it is easier to say 'My tooth is aching' than to say 'My heart is broken' . 2 And in my humanitarian work with detainees in poorer countries where mental illness is completely taboo, I nd it the proverbial 'elephant in the cell' .Everyone ignores it even though it's taking up so much room! It's 25 years and counting since I got my licence to wield astethoscope. Mental distress hascropped up almost every day. It is to be expected in doctor-patientconsultations. But worryingly, it'sincreasingly common within peerinteractions. Many colleagues haveburned out and left the NHS. Someare on slow burn and need a break.

SCAN FOR MOREdedicated hospitals, such as St Thomas's in London during the twelfth century. 3 Indeed, the very word 'hospital' derives from the 'hospitality' that wasoffered to the poor and sick in these Christianinstitutions. 4 Much of this caring activity could be described as 'nursing' . And yet the modern profession of nursingemerged much more recently, in the nineteenthcentury. Prior to this, nursing was simply personalcare for the sick, sometimes done with skill andcompassion, sometimes not. Often it was done byfamily and friends or by paid carers of varying skill. In early Victorian England, stereotypes of poorlytrained nurses were well known, such as theinfamous Sarah Gamp in Charles Dickens' novelMartin Chuzzlewit, who was ' dissolute, sloppy and generally drunk'. 5 early nursing reforms Medical knowledge was advancing rapidly in thenineteenth century, and hospitals were becomingmore important. In London, in addition to the greatmediaeval hospitals of St Bartholomew's and StThomas's, a number of newer hospitals had beenfounded in the early eighteenth century - theWestminster, the London, Guy's, and St George'swere all founded within a couple of decades. As hospitals grew and doctors had more therapeutic options, they needed more highly skilledassistants to carry out treatments and observationsmethodically. The role of the nurse became moredeveloped, and the need for a professional class of nurses became obvious. Initially, little training was given or thought necessary. Nurses were usually lower-class women,eg domestic servants. Sisters and Matrons wereoften recruited separately, from higher-classwomen, with little idea of the lower-class nursesbeing promoted to these more senior roles. What training there was often came directly from the doctors, who were obviously interested inensuring that the nurses working with them couldfollow their directions between ward rounds. Many of the poor and sick were cared for in workhouses, where the situation was particularlybad. There, nursing was often done simply by thoseinmates who were relatively able-bodied but whousually had little or no training. Very fewworkhouses had paid nurses. 6 As the nursing profession developed, one of the most famous names is, of course, FlorenceNightingale. She was motivated by Christiancompassion in her work, but she was by no meansthe only one, and there are a number of examples ofChristians who greatly influenced the movement'searly direction. In the rest of this article, we shall seeseveral such examples.Elizabeth Fry Elizabeth Fry was borninto a wealthy Quakerfamily in Norfolk in1780. She wasmotivated by herChristian faith to make a difference in society, and in 1813 sherst visited Newgateprison in London. She was horried by the conditions she found, especiallyfor female prisoners, and she spent many yearseffecting prison and penal reforms. 7 She also campaigned tirelessly for reform in other areas, such as welfare, homelessness and the abolition of slavery. However, later in life, at age 60, she nally found time to do something she had been meaning to dofor years. Whilst chiefly engaged in prison and penalreform for most of her life, she had long wished todo something for the standard of nursing care. In 1827 she had written: During the last ten years much attention has beensuccessfully bestowed by women on the femaleinmates of our prisons...But a similar care isevidently required for our hospitals, our lunaticasylums, and our workhouses. ' 8 Three years earlier, in 1824, she had hosted a young German pastor, Theodor Fliedner, who came to seeher prison reform work. He went home inspired toset up a similar prison ministry and, later on, nursingwork (see below). In 1840, Elizabeth Fry could nally do something herself about nursing training in England. Along withher sister-in-law, Elizabeth Gurney, they set up theInstitution for Nursing Sisters, linked with Guy's andthe London Hospitals. 9 An Annual Report stated its purpose as: to provide experienced, conscientious and ChristianNurses for the sick, and also to raise the standard of this useful and important occupation, so as toengage the attention and enlist the services of manywho may be desirous of devoting their time to theglory of God, and to the mitigation of humansuffering. 10 The same report interestingly notes the kind attentions of Dr Hodgkin (the fellow Quaker andfriend of medical mission that we met in ourprevious article), 11 who cared for the nursing sisters when they themselves were ill; it also lists one 'MissF Nightingale' as one of the Institute's Fliedner set up the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses' Institute Elizabeth Fry & Elizabeth Gurney set up the Institution for Nursing Sisters Dr Robert Todd founds St John's House Florence Nightingale enrols to train at the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses' Institute Florence Nightingale goes to Scutari Hospital to establish nursing care for the British Army Rev William Pennefather and Catherine Pennefather found the Association of Female Workers The Nightingale Training School for Nurses opens in LondonHISTORY Mildmay Deaconesses respond to the Bethnal Green cholera epidemic The Mildmay Mission Hospital opens it's doors 23 2023 18571836 1848 and England, meeting Moravians in Holland andlearning how they had revived the ancient Christianministry of deaconess. 12 Going on to London, he met Elizabeth Fry in 1824 and was inspired by herwork amongst prisoners. He returned and set aboutreforming prisons and supporting both current and former prisoners in his local area. He went on to develop other projects, such as education. Then in 1836, he and his wife Friederikeset up the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses' Institute,training young Christian women to care for the sickpoor of the area. Deaconesses had been a vital partof the Church's social outreach in the early centuriesof Christianity, but this role had gradually died outuntil revived by the Moravians and then further byPastor Fliedner. His Institute gained fame far andwide, setting up daughter institutions in many cities,including the German Hospital in London, 13 which opened in 1845 to care for poor German immigrantsin London. Florence Nightingale visited the German Hospital twice and the Kaiserswerth centre twice beforenally enrolling for training at the Deaconesses'Institute in 1851. Florence Nightingale Florence was born into a wealthy familyin 1820. Aged 16, she experienced a call from God thatprompted her todevote her life to theservice of others,which in her case alsoinvolved rejecting marriage. Although her own faith was not exactlyorthodox evangelical, it was clearly a hugemotivator for her work. 14 As mentioned above, Florence was greatly influenced by her contact with the KaiserswerthDeaconesses' Institute, and nancially supportedElizabeth Fry's Institute for Nursing Sisters. But ofcourse, she is best known for work amongstwounded soldiers at Scutari Hospital in Istanbulduring the Crimean War. In 1854, Florence took ateam of 38 volunteer nurses (including some fromFry's Institute) and 15 Catholic nuns to Scutari.Through their hard work and diligent attention tobasic issues such as hygiene, sanitation andnutrition, Florence and her team were able to reducethe death rate signicantly. During her time there, her influence was also felt by Dr George Saunders, a Christian military surgeon who would be one of the founders of both the Medical Prayer Union (1874) and the MedicalMissionary Association (1878). In his autobiography,Reminiscences, he tells of being invalided back fromCrimea to Scutari with a fever in 1855: When I came to Scutari, I found that the hospitalthere had now every appearance of comfort, andwas unsurpassed by any other, civil or military. Forthis improved state of things all the praise was dueto the noble and indefatigable efforts of MissNightingale, who fortunately had carte blanche todo whatever she thought necessary for the comfortand well-being of the sick and wounded. 15 On returning to London after the war, she used her new-found fame and influence, and the fundsthis had attracted, to open the Nightingale TrainingSchool for Nurses at St Thomas's Hospital in 1860(then based at London Bridge next to Guy's Hospital,before its move to Lambeth). She was alsoresponsible for hospital redesign to improveinfection control - the 'Nightingale Ward' layoutscommon in many hospitals from the period,including St Thomas's. 16 Call the Midwife The kindly exploits ofthe ctional nuns of St Raymond Nonnatusin Poplar, East London,are well known tomany of us throughthe TV series Call the Midwife. However, thetrue story behind thisis no less inspiring. Dr Robert Todd was an energetic and talented London physician who was influential in thelaunching of King's College Hospital in 1840. 17 He gave his name to Todd's Paralysis (paralysisfollowing a seizure). Furthermore, as a keenChristian, he introduced reforms for the medicalstudents at King's to provide better academic, social and pastoral support, becoming the rst Dean of the medical school at King's. Seeing the need to improve standards of nursing in the London hospitals, Dr Todd worked with hisfriend, Charles Blomeld, the Bishop of London, to establish St John's House in 1848. This was anAnglican nursing order based on similar principles to CMF was founded in 1949,and 2024 will be its 75thAnniversary. However, itsroots go back much further,and there is plenty to learnfrom the people andorganisations that camebefore it.

TheSuperintendent of St John's House, Mary Jones, was a close friend of Nightingale's, and Florenceformulated her new school in many ways as asecular version of St John's House. 19 The Sisters of St John's have gone through turbulent times over the years, including their timein Poplar, immortalised in Jennifer Worth's memoirCall the Midwife. 20 The small community lives on today in the West Midlands, though without itsoriginal nursing function. 21 Mildmay Mission Hospital The Rev WilliamPennefather wasappointed Vicar ofChrist in evangelism,overseas mission, action, such asworking with orphans and developing interdenominational Bibleconferences that were the forerunners of the KeswickConventions. 22 His wife Catherine was no less a force to be reckoned with, and at their second conference in1857, the Association of Female Workers was formed,with Catherine as President. They began to build upDeaconess ministry in and beyond their parish. A fewyears later, they moved to St Jude's, Mildmay Park, in North London, where the growing network ofministries continued. The Deaconess ministry was yet again inspired by what had begun in Kaiserswerth and it developedover several years, gaining the approval of FlorenceNightingale, who wrote to Rev Pennefather: I hail with the greatest satisfaction every attempt to train in practical activity all female missionaries,whether for home or foreign service, whether rich orpoor. I am sure that whatever you do will be blessedin this thing. 23 Then in 1866, things took a historic turn when a cholera epidemic ripped through the slums of EastLondon. Mildmay Deaconesses were sent to BethnalGreen, where they set to work caring for the poor andsick. 24 Growing rapidly, the Deaconesses added a nursing home and a cottage hospital to their ministry. At this point, the Mildmay work connects with the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society (EMMS), whichplayed such a vital role in the birth of medical missionand which featured strongly in our previous article. 25 In 1869, Dr Burns Thomson of the EMMS gave astirring speech on medical missions at the annualMildmay Park Conference. 26 This greatly impressed the Pennefathers, who subsequently visited Edinburgh and were inspired to launch the Bethnal Green Medical Mission in 1874 to further develop thework of Mildmay. Its rst superintendent, Dr Dixon,was a graduate of the EMMS training school. 27 The medical work grew rapidly, and in 1877, the Mildmay Mission Hospital opened its doors. Within a few years, in 1883, it was recognised as a nursetraining institution. 28 Down the years, many Christian nurses - including my own mother - havebeen trained at Mildmay and sent out around the UK and the world. Dr Burns Thomson also retired to Mildmay on leaving Edinburgh and spent his nalyears providing pastoral support to the Deaconessesand the aged Mrs Pennefather. 29 Through many changes and adaptations, the Mildmay Mission Hospital is still going strong today- it survived the dawning of the NHS in 1948 whenmany smaller hospitals were forced to close. Later, it focussed on specialist HIV care and is nowreinventing itself yet again for the challenges of thetwenty-rst century with a new step-down servicefor homeless patients. 30 what can we learn from the early nursing profession? Looking back at the amazing Christian role models who played an important part in the development of nursing in the UK, several lessons stand out: As in previous articles, there were numerouslinks and connections between some of the earlypioneers. We should never underestimate thepower of putting people with similar good ideastogether - creative inspiration and the HolySpirit often take over! Sometimes 'old' ideas can be revived andadapted to new situations in amazing ways. The renewal of the Deaconess movement is an excellent example. These early pioneers often saw their Christianfaith as foundational to raising standards andmaintaining the unity of those they inspired -excellent evidence that life-changing faith can(and should) make us better professionals. Difficult and challenging times can inspire us to doincredible things and show creativity and leadershipwe never knew we had. Both Florence Nightingale'sexperience in Crimea and Elizabeth Fry's in Newgateprison inspired them. Modern nursing faces manychallenges - what might the Lord enable hisdisciples to do in the midst of them? Mission, evangelism, and wider social reformwent hand in hand with most of these earlymovements. Christian nurses and otherhealthcarers can have incredible effects beyondtheir purely professional achievements. \u00a2references (accessed 21/02/23) 1. Matthew 10:8 2. Luke 10:25-373. Pickering M.

If all that sounds shockingly old- fashioned and traditional or a bit tooprogressive, then you ar e probably right. He draws on ancient traditions from theearly church, the middle ages, and theReformation (and even the Counter-Reformation) to flesh out a contemporaryprayer discipline steeped in the experiencesof the saints down the ages. That maysound a bit too hide-bound by humantradition. But Staton is also never less thanthoroughly biblical as he explores thesedimensions of prayer.Praying Like Monks, Living Like Fools: An Invitation to the Wonder and Mystery Physician'sStory \u00a37.50 \u00a37.50 \u00a31.50 Light Touch: A guide to healthcare in frailtyDr Ian Donald Onwards & Upwar ds, 9781788159296 Reviewed by David Smithard , Triple Helix Editor Miles to go before I sleep Letters on hope, death and learning to liveClaire Gilbert Hodder and Stoughton 2021 \u00a310.99 288pp, Wilkinson, a GP in EastLancashire CMF.ORG.UK/BOOKSTOREThe book ends with the political upheavals of 2008: the disbanding of the monarchy, and governmental restrictions on foreigners.With locals being trained and hospitalsimproved, the long-term objective was forNepal to care for its own. Accordingly, andfollowing the massive earthquake whichdevastated central Nepal, the campsconcluded in 2015.

A lovely quote froma patient summed up the team's ethos: ' No others are doing what you people are doing.You operate on us, give us food and clothing.What kind of people are you?'

Medicine in the Mountainscomes hot on the heels ofthe author's second book, A Week in August, which celebrates 70 years of Kingston GrammarSchool's Christian Union summer camps. I was converted, aged 14, at one of thesecamps, and recall being inspired by old-boyDavid Hawker, a Christian anaesthetist inNepal. My student elective was sorted! Hawker et al's new book places my elective memories in a wider context. Unlike his previous biography of the rstmissionary surgeon in Nepal ( Kanchi doctor ), Medicine in the Mountains is a collegiate effort. Nurse Ellen Findlay beganwork in Pokhara in 1970, whilst Mike Smith,an ENT surgeon, arrived in 1980. In 1992,their survey conrmed that few patientsbeyond major bus routes attended theirhospital. Who cared for the rest? Fifteenmillion Nepalis lived in remote, inaccessibletowns and villages hidden away in themountains, neglected and often withserious pathology. Mobile medical campswere required. The book takes us to the rst 'ear camp' in 1993, with porters carrying equipment on their backs and suspended from theirforeheads, including an operatingmicroscope. Excellent, unsparingly detailed CHRISTIAN MEDICAL BOOKSTHE BEST PLACE FORPsychiatry, the Bible, and the Church Crime, Psychiatry & the Bible Laurence J Naismith Geriatric Medicine at Lewisham and Greenwich NHSTrust, a Visiting Professor at theUniversity of Greenwich, and is the Triple Helix Editor Laurence Naismith is a retired forensic psychiatrist with degreesin theology and a teaching ministryin Cyprus. His book, Psychiatry, the Bible and the Church is very readable andaimed at the lay reader, particularly churchleaders. The author identies examples ofpossible mental disorders within the Old andNew Testaments and explores the issuesfrom a medical (psychiatric) and theologicalpoint of view. Sometimes, the links are a littletenuous, but he provides an opportunity toexplore the broader issues around the topic.In one example, 'Rachel and White Lies', Dr Naismith acknowledges that lying is not a psychiatric disorder but goes on to explorethe issues around factitious medicalconditions. I enjoyed the book, and it is certainly one I will share with my pastor. Crime, Psychiatry & the Bibleexplores crimes documentedwithin the Scriptures (includingmurder, manslaughter, rape, treason, perjury, and theft). The book's rstpart summarises Hebrew, Roman, andmodern UK law, drawing some interestingparallels. Naismith provides a different andinteresting approach to examining thebiblical text. While the book is well writtenand the arguments clear, there were timeswhen I thought there were better examplesof the said crimes than the ones chosen. Personally, I found the text a little repetitive, but others may nd his approachuseful. Professionals from many spheres, notjust medical, will nd the book interestingand valuable. The text is clear, and those with no specic training will be able to getenjoyment from it.

He unpacks the famous quote,erroneously linked to Bonhoeffer, 'Silence inthe face of evil is itself evil. Not to speak is tospeak. Not to act is to act .' The book's theme is that large parts of the American church(and, by implication, Western churches ingeneral) have been and continue to be silentin the face of evil and advancing statism. In a chapter called 'The spiral of silence', Metaxas explains the idea, derived fromBonhoeffer, that if you do not speak, you arenot being neutral but are contributing tothe success of the thing you refuse to nameand condemn. Conversely, those who speakout make it easier for others to speak out. Drawing lessons from the silence of 12,000 German pastors in the face of risingNazi evil in the 1930s, Metaxas askswhether history is repeating itself inAmerica. There is an incisive commentaryon the parable of the talents and chapterson faith, evangelism, and politics. The book is short, readable, and uncomfortably relevant. A stone-cold classic of modernChristian writing. Greig isdevastatingly honest andrealistic, but full of faith and hope as he grapples with some of thehardest questions any Christian can face.Why does God not answer some prayers?Why was God silent when I needed him themost? Why do some people have incrediblestories of answered prayer, but I havenothing but silence and disappointment? If you have ever asked those questions (and few of us haven't at some point), this book is for you. Compassionate, wise,deeply scriptural, and highly practical - it will help anyone struggling with theburden of unanswered prayer. \u00a2 REVIEWS Professor John C Lennox writes in the foreword, ' This book arises out of the conviction of the authorthat if Christian faith is worth considering, it needs to be deep enough tocope with our most rigorous human scrutinyand our most heart-rending questions' . This little volume covers many subjects in its 130pages. It starts with the question 'Why?' .Why does suffering occur? Is it a punishmentfor our past wrongs, the wrongs of ourparents, or just the way of life? At the beginning Orr-Ewing states, 'Books on suffering written by academic typesrarely connect with people who are actuallysuffering', yet when I was reading this book, I felt it was missing something. I keptthinking this book did not cover the subjectas well as CS Lewis did 80 years earlier. So, I dug out my copy of The Problem of Pain and found the arguments deeper and thequestions better argued. However, Lewis'English is more difficult to read, and manytoday might struggle with it. Nevertheless, Orr-Ewing's is a good book and worth a read. However, I would alsorecommend going back and reading Lewisto complement it if you want a deeperexposition of the topic.

Onahi Idikwu Rachel Mitchell Olivia Abrams Susanna Enongene Lizzy Birdie OngVOLUNTEERS SCAN FOR MORE32 SPRING 2023 OBITUARIES in remembrance of Sir Eldryd Parry (b 1930, q Cambridge, d 2022) Sir Eldryd Hugh Owen Parry, KCMG OBE, a CMF member, died aged 91 on 13 November 2022. I wanted to write a brief appreciation of hisextraordinary life of service in universities in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Ghana and the establishment ofthe Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET). Many might ask what moulded this remarkable man.Eldryd himself acknowledged several key influences. Firstly, his parents, who were GPs in Cardiff, often worked with very deprived families before the start of the NHS. His mother set up anearly palliative care service, occasionally accompanied by Eldryd, and she raised fundsfor the Christian Medical College at Vellore, South India. Eldryd recalls the impact of cold baths and food rationing at school during World War Two on developing hisappreciation of 'austerity'! At university - Cambridge and Cardiff - Eldryd especiallyappreciated the vibrant academic atmosphere in the Welsh National School ofMedicine, where he saw many patients with inf ections. Perhaps that was where Eldryd caught TB? He was very ill and needed a thoracotomy as well as TB drugs. Secondly, his friends. Many of his contemporaries at Cambridge became medical missionaries, and his best man went to work in Nepal. Eldryd worked at several prestigious hospitals with eminent consultants who recognised his very bright intellect; they spent time nurturing Eldryd's clinical andinvestigative skills. These enabled Eldryd to make massive contributions to themanagement of cardiac disease in Africa. Thirdly, existing academic links with universities overseas enabled extremely talented consultants in the UK to be seconded to centres of excellence in A frica. Eldryd was therefore not surprised to be asked at interview in London, 'Would you be prepared to be seconded to Nigeria?' . Fourthly, his family. Eldryd married Helen, an extremely bright and gifted linguist and teacher who made massive contributions to many African schools and collegesand subsequently at the London Institute of C ontemporary Christianity (LICC) in the UK. She agreed they could go to Ibadan, Nigeria - leaving just six days after theirwedding! She made a welcoming home for their four children and countless visitors. Fifthly, his colleagues - in Africa and the UK. Eldryd had the unique ability to recognise talent and readiness to contribute to clinical care, teaching and research at the many African university departments he headed up. He particularly valueddeveloping deep relationships with senior and junior African colleagues, encouragingrobust but respectful dialogue and mutual learning. The affection of his colleagues,particularly his African colleagues, is expressed in the online condolences that havepoured in since his death. Finally, but far from least, his faith. Eldryd was always explicit about his personal Christian faith and how it motivated his attitudes, relationships, and practice. Heloved the expressive worship of several A frican churches that he and Helen attended. Eldryd gave inspiring talks to groups of students - organised by CMF and otherorganisations. He emphasised the value of Scripture, citing the writings of Luke (in hiseponymous Gospel and the Book of Acts) as being crucial in challenging social normswhen providing care for the ill, especially for the disadvantaged. The genuinepresence of Jesus in Eldryd's life was striking, and many who worked for or withEldryd knew that they had become different people. \u00a2 Andrew Tomkins is Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Global Health, UCL, London Professor Duncan Vere (b 1929, q The London Hospital Medical College 1952, d London 2022) Duncan trained at TheLondon Hospital MedicalCollege (LHMC) andgraduated, aftergetting a string ofprizes, with Honours in 1952. He spent his whole working life at TheLondon, apart from a brief period from 1954 to 1956,doing research at The Royal Air Force Institute ofAviation Medicine. Duncan then had variousacademic posts at LHMC, becoming a consultantphysician in 1965. He was Professor of Therapeutics at LHMC from 1972 until he became Emeritus in 1994.

Hefollowed his father into medicine and later into general practice in the town where he grew up. The second world war broke out when he was less than three months old, and one of his earliestchildhood memories was of tanks rumbling through the streets of Cirencester, which was on the route for driving armaments from the Midlands to the south coast. However, this Brethrenfamily were more likely to be pacists and missionaries than soldiers. After medical training at Barts Hospital in London, he worked at Addenbrookes in Cambridge, where he met Adrienne Nye, also a second-generation doctor . In 1965 they married and travelled together to Uganda to do medical work with the supportof the Church Mission Society. After starting a family and returning to the UK, Michael attended All Nations Christian College. But despite the continued pull of Africa, a growing family andinvolvement in general practice took priority. In 1974, the family moved to Cirencester. In those days, Cirencester acted as an associate district general hospital with acute medical, surgical, children's andmaternity wards. Michael trained hospital Senior House Officers (for which he wasawarded FRCP in 2002). He was on- call almost ever y night, alongside his work as a GP . This was a golden era for patients but not for doctors and their families. Michael's gentle, sociable nature suited general practice. He dislik ed conflict and had a desire for unity. For a while later in life, he was chairman of CirencesterChurches Together and was an elder in Cirencester Baptist Church. He also joinedStreet Pastors, patrolling the town at night to show kindness to strangers who were often the worse for wear. After retirement, he walked, sang , sailed and travelled, putting his encyclopaedic knowledge of people and places to good use. Michael had anextensive collection of maps and delighted friends with his local and globalknowledge. He continued his involvement in CMF, maintaining his concernfor those at the coal face of the ethical dilemmas facing Christians inhealthcare. But it is as a local GP and trainer of GPs that he will be most widely remembered. 'He (was) unfailingly prof essional', said a colleague. 'A highly respected doctor and an amazing person who quietly carried his faith into all areas of life.' 'He would come out to care for us in the middle of thenight, always in a suit and tie', said one former patient. 'We owe him a debt of gratitude we could never repay.' Hundreds gathered for his memorial service in Cirencester in December 2022 after he was 'gathered to his people' aged 83, just 400m from where he was born. Michael will be missed by many, including his wife Adrienne, children Jonathan, Peter, and Kirsten, and his ve grandchildren.

He was sent to board at Monkton Coombe School at the tender age of 12, which was not initially a happyexperience, but then went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he thrivedand met his future wife, Ruth Marie Harvey. His Christian faith blossomedwhilst working at a cheese factory in the months before starting at Cambridgeand grew and strengthened across his life. He went on to Westminster Medical School in London to continue clinical medical studies. He met some opposition when he decided to train in psychiatry, from those who felt Christianity and psychiatry wereincompatible. However, Andrew felt strongly called to psychiatr y and had great compassion for his patients. For much of his life, he studied and wrote about faith and psychiatric symptomatology, fascinated by theevidence for the protective influence of religious faith on health, and keen to clarify and correctmisconceptions. These concepts are expounded in his most recent books, Is Faith Delusion? and Mad or God?Jesus: the healthiest mind of all , written with his friend and colleague Pablo Martinez. He became Professor of Psychiatry at Leeds in 1979. He was based clinically at St James's University Hospital, where he continued working until he retired in 2000. He wrote a number of textbooks, including Lecture Notes on Behavioural Sciences , and Symptoms in the Mind: An Introduction to Descriptive Psychopathology , which was rst published in 1995 and reached its sixth edition in 2018. Overall he has authored or co-authored 29 books. He completed his MD on the long-term outcomes of patients with neurosis, notable for the thoroughness of his follow-up. He was also awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1995 by the thenArchbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, ' in recognition of his services to psychiatry, in particular in promoting the need to evaluate the religious and spiritual experience of patients.' He was very involved in the Royal College of Psychiatrists for much of his career, becoming Presiden t of the College from 1990 to 1993, having previously served as Dean. He had four children and twelve grandchildren, six of whom followed him into medicine and one into psychiatry. He was a very hands-on father and a proud and delighted grandfather, passionate about rugbyunion, international cricket, gardening and walking the hills, particularly in Yorkshire and Dartmoor. He also loved classical music, enjoying being part of the Alveley singers and the church choir and lling the housewith Bach organ music on CD. He travelled widely to teach and examine psychiatr y at undergraduate and postgraduate levels in Pakistan, Singapore, Zambia and South Africa. In his retirement, he was involved with PRIME in Nepal, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina. He was an active member of CMF for over 40 years and, together with Ruth, was keen to show hospitality to CMF members new to Leeds. Theirgenerous hospitality continued at the home they retired to in Alveley , Shropshire, where Ruth became a non-stipendiary priest and Andrew was Chair of the Deanery Synod, hosting regular men's breakfasts in the barn, with interesting Christian speakers for local friends and acquaintances. They also taught and led seminars at CMF conferences. At 60, he needed a replacement aortic valve due to severe stenosis but returned to being t and active, particularly in medicolegal work, which had always interested him. Shortly after his eightieth birthday , he developed bacterial endocarditis, which was not diagnosed until a large abscess had formed, requiringsignicant surgery from which he never fully recovered. He remained kind, charming, loving and godly till he was 'called to Glory' on 14 December 2022. He is survived by Ruth, two sons, two daughters, six grandsons and six granddaughters, who will always be grateful for his love, encouragement and Christian example. \u00a2 Mary Bunn is a GP and palliative care specialist currently based in Sierra Leone with a small team working to establish a palliative care service. Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed overfrom death to life. (John 5:24) Brian had just been told he had secondary cancer in hisliver, causing him to become jaundiced. He and his wiferealised that the outlook was not good. I was his surgeon,and after talking about possible treatment options, I asked Brian, 'Do you have a faith that helps you at a time like this, or aren't you sure about such things?' . He turned to his wife and asked, 'Do we, dear?' . As there didn't appear to be much interest in spiritual things, I simply said, 'For me, knowing that there is a God who loves us andcares for us is the only thing that makes sense of problems like this',and changed the subject. The following week, however, I met Brian as he sat in the waiting room for a blood test. He said, 'You know what you said last week - it is strange, but my next-door neighbour, who is a Christian, asked us if we would like to go to church. What do you think?' 'I think that is lovely, but honestly, Brian, I wonder if sitting through some hymns, prayers, and a sermon is what you most need at the moment. I would guess what you most need to know is \"How can I get right with God?\"' There was a two-second pause before Brian looked up and asked, 'How do I get right with God?' We arranged to meet up the followingmorning at his home, and there we went over the basics of theChristian faith. One thing really bothered him - how could Godaccept him when he had spent most of his life without any interest in God whatsoever? We looked at several key verses again, noting how their emphasis is 'to all' or to 'whoever' . There is no age limit or discussion aboutpast mistakes! We looked at: Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God. (John 1:12)The offer to be adopted as children of God is open to everyone who turns to Christ for forgiveness. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, thatwhoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16) This willingness of God to accept anybody who genuinely turns to God keeps being repeated: Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does notbelieve stands condemned already because he has not believed inGod's one and only Son. (John 3:18)As the verse at the start of this page reminds us, our natural status is that we stand outside of God's kingdom. But that whoever turns toChrist is accepted by God. Jesus keeps repeating this vital message. We then turned to the parable Jesus told that most answers the question, can a person really be accepted by God if they turn to himso late in life? In Matthew 20:1-16, Jesus tells the parable of theworkers in the vineyard. Jesus is specically telling us that hiskingdom will contain some who have spent all their lives working forhim, whereas some will be accepted at the last hour. Yet all receivethe same full day's pay. We also looked at the story of the repentantthief on the cross. A man couldn't leave it much later than he did toacknowledge his personal faith that Jesus is the Saviour of the world, Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. (Luke 23:42) Jesus gave him the most reassuring answer anyone could want to hear in such a desperate situation, I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise. (Luke 23:43)Brian said that he wanted to spend some time thinking all this through but that he would like to come to our church the followingSunday. The sermon that Sunday just happened to be on the sameparable from Matthew 20! After the service, I went to talk with Brianand his wife, Barbara, as they sat in the pew. His opening words werethrilling, 'I've some good news to share with you - my wife has becomea Christian too!' Brian survived, remarkably, for another six months,and both he and Barbara came to really love their Saviour and becamefully involved in the life of God's people for the rest of their lives. \u00a2FINAL THOUGHT CAN I BE SURE - I'VE LEFT IT 35 SPRING 2023 CAN I BE SURE - I'VE LEFT IT SO LATE?
