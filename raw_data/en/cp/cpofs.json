If a serious health condition exists, one should see a qualified medical doctor rather than rely on information given here. Asian Journal of Applied Science and Technology 2020 Hippocrates wisely stated back in 400 BC, \"Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food\". Modern research has validated this doctrine. The science of nutrition is dedicated to learning about foods that the human body requires at different stages of life in order to meet the nutritional needs for proper growth, as well as to maintain health and prevent disease. A baby is born with a very high requirement for energy and nutrient intake per unit of body weight to provide for rapid growth. The rate of growth is the highest during the first year and declines slowly after the age of two, with a corresponding decrease in nutrient and energy requirements. During puberty, however, nutritional requirements increase sharply until this period of fast growth is completed. Adulthood begins at about the age of fourteen or fifteen for girls, and eighteen or nineteen for boys. An adult individual needs to balance energy intake with his or her level of physical activity to avoid storing excess body fat. Dietary practices and food choices are related to wellness and affect health, fitness, weight management, and the prevention of chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. Nutrition describes the processes by which all of the food a person eats are taken in and the nutrients that the body needs are absorbed. Good nutrition like Pugos Nutrition can help prevent disease and promote health. A KEY TO GREAT HEALTH: ORGANIC ELECTROLYTES. THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND MUCOID PLAQUE.
