What are antidepressants? Antidepressants are medicines used to treat [mental health conditions](/mental-health-disorders) including: Medicine is just one strategy used to treat depression and anxiety conditions. Other treatments may also be needed, such as psychological treatments (talking therapy) or lifestyle changes. How do antidepressants work? Antidepressants affect several chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) that influence mood and anxiety, including: Because of how they work, you may need to take antidepressants for a while before you see your symptoms improve. If you have depression, you may begin to feel better 2 to 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant medication, but it can take up to 6 to 8 weeks to feel the full effect. If you have an anxiety disorder, it may take 4 to 6 weeks before you start feeling better. It may take up to 12 weeks to feel the full effect. In some people, antidepressants are not effective, no matter how long they take them for. What types of antidepressants might I be prescribed? There are many different types of antidepressants. They are grouped according to how they work in the body. Within each group, there are several different medicines that work in a similar way. - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant class in Australia. While they are not necessarily more effective than others, they are usually well-tolerated by most people, which means that most people find that side effects are not too troublesome. Examples of this class of antidepressants include citalopram, (SNRIs) have fewer side effects than SSRIs and may be used for more severe depression. They include duloxetine, venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine. - Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NARIs) work on noradrenaline and are less likely to cause drowsiness than other classes. This class includes reboxetine. - Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less commonly prescribed today, as they are associated with more harmful side effects than newer medicines. They include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, clomipramine, dothiepin, doxepin, imipramine of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs) are more commonly used to treat anxiety than depression. They include moclobemide. - Noradrenalin-serotonin specific antidepressants (NaSSAs) are a relatively new class with fewer sexual side effects but can cause weight gain. This class includes mirtazapine. - MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) are rarely prescribed today due to their risk of side effects. They include phenelzine and tranylcypromine. - 'Atypical' antidepressants that don't easily fit into the classes above, and include agomelatine and vortioxetine. Agomelatine stimulate melatonin receptors to affect mood. Vortioxetine works on serotonin receptors, but in a different way to SSRIs and SNRIs.

Like all medicines, antidepressants may have side effects. For most people, the side effects are not bad enough that they need to stop taking the medicine.

Side effects differ between antidepressants. Some antidepressant side effects may include: [headaches](/headaches)and [dizziness](/dizziness) [nausea](/nausea) - weight gain - anxiety or [restlessness](/feeling-restless) [difficulty sleeping](/insomnia), or excessive sleepiness - sexual problems, such as a low sex drive Some of these side effects improve as your body gets used to the medicine.

Suicide risk when starting antidepressants Some people, especially [children and young people](/depression-in-children), can experience an increase in suicidal thoughts when they start taking antidepressants.

You can reduce your chance of developing serotonin syndrome by taking your medicines exactly as prescribed by your doctor and avoiding [recreational drugs](/drugs-and-alcohol). How do I know which antidepressant is right for me? Your doctor will take into account a range of factors when deciding which antidepressant to prescribe, including: - your age - your sex - your main symptoms - potential [side effects](/medicine-and-side-effects) - potential interactions with any other medicines you are taking - if you are [pregnant](/medicines-during-pregnancy)or [breastfeeding](/medicines-and-breastfeeding) - your preferences You may find that one type of antidepressant is more effective than others at relieving your symptoms. It can take some time to identify which antidepressant is right for you, so it's important to keep in touch with your doctor, especially when you first start taking an antidepressant. If the medicine is causing side effects, or isn't working, your doctor can advise whether another type of antidepressant might be more suitable. How do I take antidepressants Most antidepressants are taken daily. Your doctor or pharmacist may recommend that you take your medicine at a certain time of day to minimise the chance of side effects. For example, you might prefer to take a medicine that can make you drowsy at night before bed. How long you will need to take antidepressants will depend on your circumstances and how you respond to treatment. Some people take antidepressants for 6 to 12 months before stopping, without their symptoms recurring. Other people will need to take antidepressants for longer, sometimes for life. Stopping antidepressants Stopping antidepressants suddenly is likely to cause withdrawal symptoms including: - nausea or vomiting - dizziness - confusion - anxiety or agitation - sweating The specific withdrawal effects vary depending on the class of medicine you have been taking. If you want or need to stop your antidepressant medicine, make sure to ask your doctor how to taper (gradually reduce) your medicine safely. Gradually reducing the dose of medicine you take will lower the chance of you experiencing withdrawal symptoms. If your doctor recommends that you switch to a different antidepressant, ask them for specific instructions about when to taper and stop your current medicine, and when to start the new one.
