Abstract Background: There is a need to establish the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for the prevention of allergic disease. Methods : Two reviewers independently screened nine international biomedical databases. Studies were quantitatively synthesiz ed using random- effects meta-analyses. Results : 32 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Overall, meta-analysis found no conclusive evidence that AIT reduced the risk of developing a first allergic disease over the short-term (RR=0.30 ; 95%CI 0.04 to 2.09) and no randomized controlled evidence was found in relation to its longer-term effects for this outcome. There was however a reduction in the short-term risk of those with allergic rhinitis developing Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

We found inconclusive evidence that this benefit was maintained over the longer-term: RR=0. 62; 95%CI 0.31 to 1.23. There was evidence that the risk of new sensitization was reduced over the short- term, but this was not confirmed in the sensitivity analysis: RR=0.72; 95%CI 0.24 to 2.18. There was no clear evidence of any longer-term reduction in the risk of sensitization: RR=0.47; 95%CI 0.08 to 2.77. AIT appeared to have an acceptable side-effect prof ile. Conclusions: AIT did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing a first allergic disease. There was however evidence of a reduced short-term risk of developing asthma in those with allergic rhinitis, but it is unclear whether this benefit was maintained over the longer-term. We are unable to comment on the cost-effectiveness of AIT. Keywords: allergen immunotherapy, allergic diseases, allergy, atopy prevention, sensitization. BACKGROUND Over recent decades, a llergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been investigated and used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR)/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and venom allergy . AR and asthma often co-exist and up to 50% of patients with AR have bronchial hyperreactivity(BHR)(1). Children with AR have over three times greater risk of developing asthma later on in life when compared to those without AR(2), especially those with BHR(3). Studies assessing the long-term effectiveness of AIT -especially in those with AR- suggest that AIT might reduce the risk of developi ng asthma(4;5). AIT may also result in a reduced risk for development of new allergic sensitization(s) suggesting a possible mechanism through which this protection is conferred(6;7; 8). As a consequence, interest has broadened from a sole focus on the therapeutic effects of AIT treatment to one that also includes investigation of the potential preventive effects of AIT. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Several populations might benefit from the preventive effects of AIT. First ly, in healthy individuals, with or without IgE-sensitization, AIT might prevent the development of allergic diseases. Second ly, in individuals with allergic manifestations at any stage, AIT may prevent the development of other allergic conditions such as the development of asthma in those with AR. Finally, AIT may prevent the development of addiitonal sensitization in patients who are already sensitized, as well as the spreading of allergic sensitization at the molecular level. T he European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is in the process of developing Guidelines for AIT. This systematic review is one of five inter-linked evidence syntheses conducted in order to provide a state- of-the-art synopsis of the current evidence base in relation to evaluating AIT for the treatment of AR, food allergy, venom allergy, allergic asthma and its role in allergy prevention. The focus of this review is on assessing the preventive capacity of AIT. The information derived from this systematic review will help to inform key clinical recommendations and the identification of future research needs . The potential effect of early introduction of different food allergens into the diet of infants will not be addressed in this review, since it will be covered by the planned update of the prevention part of the EAACI Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines. AIMS We sought to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of AIT for the prevention of allergic disease and allergic sensitization. METHODS Details of the methodology used for this review, including search terms and filters; databases searched ; inclusion and exclusion criteria; data extraction and quality appraisal ha ve been previously reported(9). We therefore confine ourselves here to a synopsis of the methods employed. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Inclusion criteria Patient characteristics We were interested in studies on subjects of any age with or without allergic sensitization(s) and subjects with or without allergic disease. Interventions and comparators We were interested in AIT administered through any route (e.g. subcutaneous (SCIT), sublingual (SLIT)) compared with no intervention, placebo or any active comparator using different allergens (e.g. pollens, house dust mites (HDM)), including modified allergens. Outcomes Primary outcomes The primary outcomes of interest were the development of first allergic disease or of a new allergic disease, in those with a previous allergic condition, assessed over the short-term (i.e. <2 years of completion of AIT) and longer-term (i.e. 2 years post-completion of AIT) using well defined diagnostic criteria . Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes were: the development of: new allergic sensitization(s) (or allergic immunresponse(s)); spreading of allergic sensitization(s) from one allergen to other non-related allergen(s); spreading of allergic sensitization(s) at molecular level, from one allergenic molecule to other molecules; development of new oral allergy syndrome (OAS); health economic analys es from the Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. perspective of the health system/payer; and safety as assessed by local and systemic reactions in accordance with the World Allergy Organization's (WAO) grading system of side-effects(10;11). Study design We were interested in systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, health economic analyses , and large case series with a minimum of 300 patients. Search strategy Our search strategy was conceptualized to incorporate the four elements shown in Figure 1 (Appendix 1). Additional unpublished work and research in progress w as identified through discussion with experts in the field (Appendix 2). No language restrictions were employed. Qu ality assessment Quality assessment was conducted using established tools as detailed in the protocol(9). Assessments were independently carried out on each study by two reviewers . Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, if agreement could not be reached, by arbitration by the third reviewe r. Data analysis and synthesis Data were independently extracted onto a customized data extraction sheet in Distiller SR by two reviewers, and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, if agreement could not be reached, by arbitration by a third reviewer.

Where possible and appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken using random-effects meta-analyses using Stata (version 14). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses, and assessment for publication bias Sensitivity analyses were undertaken by comparing the summary estimates obtained by excluding studies judged to be at high risk of bias with those judged to be at low or moderate risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to compare: Children versus adults Route of administration Allergens used for AIT. We were unable to assess publication bias through the creation of funnel plots due to the small number of studies, but were able to use Eggar's test (12). Registration and reporting of this systematic review This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO with registration number : CRD42016035380 . It is reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Appendix 3). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. RESULTS Overview of studies We identified a total of 10,704 potentially eligible studies after removal of duplicates. Of these, 32 studies reported in 34 publications and one entry into an online trial repository fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Figure 2)(3;6- 8;13-43). In terms of study design, 17 RCTs and 15 controlled-before-after (CBA) studies were identified. The key characteristics and main findings of the RCTs can be found in Table 1 and for the CBAs in Table 2. Nineteen studies included children; eight studies enrolled adults only; and five studies included both child and adult subjects. The numbers of subjects included in these studies varied from 28-691 for the majority (N=30) of studies . However, two CBAs reported on substantially larger populations: 8,396 subjects(7), and 118,754 subjects(16), respectively. T he allergens in the AIT studied were HDM, peach, pollen from grass, birch, single allergens as multiple allergens. Peach was the only food allergen included in the identified AIT studies. The routes of administration were SCIT, oral and SLIT in the form of tablets and drop s. The overall quality of the identified RCTs varied with five RCTs judged to be at low risk of bias(8;14;19;31;42) six at medium risk(13;18;23;24;35;40) and six at high risk of bias(3;17;22;25;28;37) . All CBAs were judged to be at high risk of bias (Tables 3 and 4) . Our main findings are presented according to primary and secondary outcomes of the review. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Primary outcomes: development of new allergic disease We identified 12 studies reported in a total of 14 publications and an entry into an online trial repository on the effectiveness of AIT for the prevention of development of new allergic disease in previously healthy subjects or in subjects already suffering from one or more allergic disease(3;8;13;15- 25). All except the study by Schmitt(16) were RCTs. The Preventive Allergy Treatment (PAT) study reported two updates from the same trial (i.e. three reports in total)(3;20;21). Three RCTs investigated the preventive effects of AIT in relation to development of the first allergic disease in healthy asymptomatic individuals. They focused on the effect of SLIT on cedar pollinosis(25), eczema, wheeze and food allergy(8), and asthma(13), respectively. The majority of studies (N=8) focused on the preventive effect of AIT in relation to the development of asthma in patients with established AR(3;14;15;17- 24). SCIT was used in four of these RCTs (3;17-21) whilst SLIT through drops or tablets were used in four RCTs(14;15;22- 24). In the CBA study using routine healthcare data, patients were stratified according to mode of administration (i.e. SCIT, SLIT drops, SLIT tablets, and combinations of SCIT and SLIT)(16). Short- term preventive effects of AIT The short-term preventive effect of AIT was investigated in t wo RCTs judged to be at low risk of bias(8;19), three RCTs at medium risk of bias(18;23;24), two RCTs at high risk of bias(22;25), and one CBA at high risk of bias(16). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. In terms of mode of administration, SCIT was used in two RCTs(18;19), oral (drops or capsules) (8;23) and SLIT (tablets and drops) in the remaining three RCTs(8;23;24). In the CBA, SCIT, SLIT drops and SLIT tablets were administered(16). RCTs on short-term preventive effects Prevention of the onset of first allergic disease The potential effects of oral AIT for the primary prevention of atopic eczema, wheeze, food allergy and sensitizations were investigated in a recent RCT at low risk of bias by Zolkipli.(8) Infants at high risk of atopy based on family history of allergic diseases were randomized to receive either oral HDM AIT (drops) or placebo twice daily for a year. Upon completion of the trial, no significant difference was seen between the active or placebo groups i n the risk of developing eczema (P=0.20), wheeze (P=0.40) or food allergy (P =0.26) in these children(8). A second RCT by Yamanaka, at high risk of bias, looked at primary prevention in asymptomatic adults sensitised to Japanese cedar pollen. They were randomized to SLIT or placebo and in the second year none of the active group had developed pollinosis compared to seven in the placebo group (P=0.0098)(25). Meta-analysis of data from these two trials showed no overall reduction in the risk of developing a first allergic disease: RR=0.30 (95%CI 0.04 to 2.09) (Figure 3). Sensitivity analysis excluding Yamanaka did not alter this conclusion. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Prevention of onset of asthma in those with established AR An RCT at low risk of bias by Grembiale, investigating the preventive effects of SCIT administered for a two-year period to subjects with AR, found no significant differences in asthma prevalence at the end of the trial among the AIT group compared to controls (P=0.49)(19). The RCT at medium risk of bias by Crimi investigated the effect of SCIT for three years on the development of asthma and BHR among 30 non-asthmatic adults with seasonal AR who were mono- sensitized to Parietaria judaica(18). No significant differences in preventive effect were identified across intervention and control group. At the end of the trial, 47% of patients in the placebo group (7/15) had developed asth ma compared to 14% (2/14) in the SCIT group (P=0.056)(18). The RCT by Moller, at medium risk of bias , randomized 30 children with AR to birch pollen to AIT capsules or placebo(23). They found no cases of asthma at the end of the 10-month treatment period in the AIT group and five cases out of 16 in the control group (P -value not given). The large RCT by Novembre, at medium risk of bias, randomized 113 children, aged 5-14 with hay fever to grass pollen to SLIT drops co-seasonally for three years or conventional pharmacotherapy(24). At the end of the three year trial, the relative risk of developing asthma was 3.8 (95%CI 1.5 to 10.0; P=0.041) in control subjects compared to the SLIT group(24). In the RCT by Marogna, at high risk of bias, 216 children with AR and intermittent asthma were randomized to SLIT or conventional pharmacotherapy for a period of three years. They found a lower occurrence of asthma in the SLIT group (30/66, 45.4%) compared with the control group (OR= 0.04; 95%CI 0.01 to 0.17) (22). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Random effects meta-analysis of these five RCTs plus the short-term effects of the first publication from the PAT trial (20) demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of developing asthma: RR=0.40 (95%CI 0.29 to 0.54) (Figure 4). There was no evidence of publication bias (P= 0.27). This result remained significant after excluding the trial by Marogna and Moller ( 2002) , which were both judged to be at high risk of bias: RR=0.38 (95%CI 0 .20 to 0.72). Subgroup analyses showed that AIT was beneficial in those : aged <18 (RR=0. 40; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.61 ), but not in those aged 18 years (RR=0.28 ; 95%CI 0. 07 to 1.15) receiving SLIT (RR=0. 33; 95%CI to 0.50) and 0. 32 to 0.77) receiving pollen AIT (RR=0.48; 95%CI 0. 33 to 0.71), but not those receiving HDM AIT (RR=0.20; 95%CI 0.01 to 3.94 ). CBAs on short-term preventive effects Prevention of the onset of first allergic disease We found no relevant studies. Prevention of onset of asthma in those with established AR Only one CBA investigated the preventive effects of AIT(16). The study by Schmitt looked at 118,754 patients with AR, but with no comorbid asthma, between 2007-12. Patients were stratified according to exposure to AIT in 2006 and followed to assess incident asthma. The authors reported a preventive effect of AIT on the progression from AR to asthma in patients exposed to AIT through any mode of administration (RR=0.60; 95%CI 0.42 to 0.84; P=0.003) compared to unexposed patients. When subdivided according to route of administration, there was a significant preventive effect of SCIT (RR= 0.57; 95%CI 0.38 to 0.84; P=0.005) whereas effects of SLIT drops and combinations of SCIT and SLIT did not reach statistical significance(16). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Long-term preventive effects of AIT There were four RCT s, one judged to be at low risk(15), one to be medium risk(13) and two assessed to be of high risk of bias(3;17) investigating the long er-term preventive effects of AIT. RCTs on long-term preventive effects Prevention of onset of first allergic disease We found no relevant studies. Prevention of onset of asthma in those with established atopic dermatitis or AR An RCT at medium risk of bias explored the effect of 12 months of daily SLIT on prevention of asthma and new sensitizations in children with atopic dermatitis and sensitization to one or more food allergens(13). As no differences in antibody levels between the SLIT and the placebo group could be identified six months into the trial, recruitment was terminated and the trial reduced to pilot study status. After 48 months of follow-up, there were no differences in asthma prevalence between the two groups(13). A large yet unpublished trial at low risk of bias explored the effect of SLIT tablets on the prevention of asthma in 812 children with grass pollen allergic rhinoconjuctivitis . Based on data available in EudraCT, the trial, undertaken in mono-sensitized children carried out over a five year period with three years of treatment and two years of follow-up study, failed to demonstrate the preventive effect of AIT on the development of asthma (OR=0.9; (95%CI 0.57 to 1.43) (14;15). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. A third RCT by Jacobsen, at high risk of bias, explored the preventive effects of SCIT in relation to onset of asthma over a 10-year follow- up period(3;20;21). This trial enrolled 205 children with seasonal AR at baseline who were randomized to a three-year course of SCIT or no intervention. At 10-years follow-up, the adjusted treatment effect show ed a significantly higher OR of not having asthma of 4.6 (95%CI 1.5 to 13.7) among subjects treated with SCIT compared to controls. The RCT by Song, at high risk of bias, looked at patients with AR, allergic to HDM, two years after discontinuation of three years of SCIT compared to standard pharmacotherapy. They found that no (0/51) patients in the SCIT group developed asthma compared to 9/51 in the control group (P-value not given)(17). Meta-analysis showed no overall evidence of reduction in the long term risk of developing asthma: RR=0. 62; (95%CI 0. 31 to 1.23) (Figure 5). Secondary outcomes We were planning to assess a range of six different secondary outcomes according to the protocol(9). However, we did not find studies related to spreading of allergic sensitization(s) at the molecular level, nor did we identify studies exploring development of n ew OAS after the end of the intervention or health economic analyses of AIT used for prevention. In the sections below, findings related to development of new allergic sensitization(s) and safety will be described. Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Development of new allergic sensitization We found 23 studies investigating the effect of AIT on the development of new allergic sensitizations (6-8;17;22;26- 43) including one trial reported in two publications(29;30). Nine studies were RCTs (8;17;22;28;31;35;36;40;42) and three of these(8;31;42) were assessed to be at low risk of bias. The remaining studies were all CBAs assessed to be at a high risk of bias. Of these, 12 (six RCTs and six CBAs) provided data on short-term effects and 11 (three RCTs and eight CBAs) provided data on long- term effects. Short-term preventive effects RCTs There were six RCTs investigating this outcome. Three low risk of bias RCTs investigated the short-term effects of AIT on the risk of developing new sensitizations (8;31;42). The remaining three RCTs were moderate(40) or high risk of bias(22;36). The Zolkipli HDM oral AIT trial among infants at high risk of developing allergic disease found a significant reduction in sensitization to any common allergen in the active group compared to the placebo group (P=0.03) at the end of the trial, but no difference in HDM sensitization between the AIT (5.7%) and control groups (7.8%): risk difference: 2.2%; 95%CI -7.5 to 11.8 ; P=0.61(8). Garcia studied adult patients allergic to peach, and found no relevant new sensitizations in the placebo group (n=17) and three new sensitizations to single allergens among the 37 patients in the SLIT group after six months of treatment; the AIT was therefore judged to be ineffective(31). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. The RCT by Sz\u00e9pfalusi looked at the preventive effect of SLIT with grass pollen or HDM extract in mono-sensitized children aged 2-5 years; they found no difference in the rate of new sensitizations to HDM between groups after 12 and 24 months of SLIT(42). Three additional RCTs investigating the short-term effects of AIT, of medium to high risk of bias , found significantly lower incidence of new sensitizations among children and adults with AR. The first, Marogna, found that in the group treated with SLIT for three years , 4/130 developed new sensitizations compared to the controls in whom 23/66 developed new sensitisations (OR=0.06; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.17). They further concluded that the SLIT group was less likely to be polysensitized compared to the SLIT group at year 3: OR=0.33 (95%CI 0.17 to 0.61)(22). A second RCT conducted by Marogna found a significantly lower incidence of new sensitizations among the SLIT group compared to controls(36). At the end of the three-year treatment period, 16/271 (5.9%) in the SLIT group had developed new sensitizations compared to 64/170 (38%) among controls (P<0.001). The third RCT by Pifferi looked at children with asthma monosensitized to HDM treated with SCIT for three years compared to controls(40). At the end of treatment, they found no new sensitizations in the SCIT group (0/15) compared to 5/14 in the control group (P=0.01). Meta-analysis showed an overall reduction in the risk of allergic sensitization: RR=0. 33 (95%CI 0.12 to 0.93) (Figure 6). The Eggar test showed no evidence of publication bias (P=0.60). Sensitivity analyses excluding the two studies by Marogna, at high risk of bias, however failed to confirm this risk reduction : RR=0. 72; 95% CI 0. 24 to 2.18. Subgroup analyses lacked precision, but suggested that AIT was: likely to be beneficial in those aged <18 (RR=0. 32; 95% CI 0. 08 to 1.28), but not in those aged 18 years (RR= 3.32; 95%CI 0. 18 to 60.85) Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. more likely to be beneficial in those receiving 3 years therapy (RR=0. 13; 95%CI 0.08 to 0.21) than in those years therapy (RR=0. 74; 95%CI 0.13 to 4.21) more likely to be beneficial in those receiving SCIT (RR=0. 09; 95%CI 0.01 to 1. 41) than SLIT (RR=0.38; 95%CI 0.13 to 1. 13) likely to be beneficial in those receiving HDM (RR=0.33; 95%CI 0.09 to 1.20), but not in those receiving peach (RR=3.32; 95%CI 0. 18 to 60.85). CBAs The inconsistent evidence found in RCTs was also reflected in the included CBAs with four studies finding a lower occurrence of new sensitizations among AIT exposed subjects compared to unexposed subjects(6;34;38;41), one study reporting higher occurrence in the AIT group compared to controls(26), and three studies reporting no differences between groups (Table 2)(33;38;43). Long term preventive effects of AIT on the development of new allergic sensitization R CTs Three RCTs investigated the preventive long term (i.e. post-intervention) effects of AIT on onset of new sensitizations(17;28;35). The Limb RCT, at medium risk of bias, explored the effect of SCIT for 24 months with a mixture of up to seven aero-allergens among children with moderate- to-severe asthma recruited between 5-12 years of age and followed into adulthood(35). The mean foll ow-up time of the 82 subjects was 10.8 years. There was a similar development of new sensitivities among both the SCIT and placebo groups (P=0.13), and the types of new sensitivities were also found to be similar across groups(35). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. The high risk of bias RCT conducted by Dominicus followed adult patients with allergic rhinoconjuncitivitis three years after cessation of SCIT for grass pollen and found that the number of subjects who did not develop new sensitizations were higher in the group exposed to SCIT (20/26; 77%) compared to the placebo group (3/13; 23% ; P-value not given) (28). In an RCT at high risk of bias, Song followed patients with AR two years after cessation of SCIT for HDMs compared to patients receiving pharmacotherapy only(17). In the SCIT group, the occurrence of new sensitizations was 2/43 (4.7%) compared to 17/41 (41.5%) among controls (P<0.01). Meta-analyses of these studies showed no evidence of a reduction in the long-term risk of allergic sensitization: RR=0. 47 (95%CI 0. 08 to 2. 77) (Figure 7). The Eggar test showed no evidence of publication bias (P=0. 23) CBAs Among the seven CBAs investigating long-term preventive effects of AIT, one SLIT study by Di Rienzo found no significant differences in onset of new sensitizations among intervention and control groups during the 10 years of follow- up(27). F ive studies, four SCIT and one SLIT, found reduced onset of new sensitizations among subjects exposed to AIT(7;29;34;37;39). In contrast to these findings, a SCIT CBA by Gulen found a significantly higher occurrence of new sensitization among children with asthma who were monosensitized to HDM exposed to AIT compared to controls(32). Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Cost-effectiveness We found no studies investigating the cost-effectiveness of AIT for the prevention of allergy. Safety We identified a total of seven studies , six SLIT (five of these RCTs and one CBA) , and one SCIT RCT, that reported on adverse events(8;15;22;36;37;40;42). In the SLIT studies, an RCT at low risk of bias investigating effects of SLIT administered as drops to infants reported no differences in numbers or type of adverse reactions between intervention and control groups (8), and a further RCT with low risk of bias among children between 2-5 years of age also reported no relevant side effects in 21,170 single applications(42). The incidence of generalized itching was reported in three SLIT studies assessed to be at high risk of bias: one RCT finding that 4/271 (1.5%) of the children exposed to SLIT experienced one episode of generalized itching that resolved without therapy(36), another RCT reported one incidence of systemic itching after SLIT among 144 children in the SLIT group(22), and a CBA reported that 5/57 adult patients exposed to SLIT had transient oral itching(37). In an RCT, assessed to be at medium risk of bias , the safety of SCIT was assessed among children aged 6-14 years(40). It reported no major local or systemic effects of AIT during three years of treatment among the 15 patients randomized to SCIT(40). DISCUSSION Statement of principal findings We found no consistent evidence from the limited body of RCT evid ence that AIT can prevent t he first onset of allergic disease over the short-term and no RCTs investigating the long-term preventive effects of AIT. We did however find clear evidence of a substantial reduced risk of developing asthma in those Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

There was some evidence to indicate that the risk of allergic sensitization can be reduced over the short-term, but this was not confirmed in the pre-specified sensitivity analysis. There was no evidence of a long-term reduction in the risk of allergic sensitization. These risks were however in many cases imprecisely estimated and so need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, the safety profile of AIT appeared acceptable, but we found no data on cost-effectiveness considerations and so are unable to comment on this outcome. Strengths and limitations The strengths of this study include the comprehensive literature search that was undertaken and adherence to a pre-published protocol with clearly defined objectives and a detailed pre-specified analysis plan. The main limitations relate to the possibility of not uncovering the total body of evidence on this subject and the challenges of interpreting a heterogeneous body of relatively small-scale trial evidence. Implications for policy, practice and research This review has highlighted the inconsistent evidence-base and the lack of robust evidence, in particular for long-term preventive effects of AIT and in terms of detailed subgroup analysis, which impedes our ability to tease out clear implications for healthcare policy and clinical practice. In terms of research, there is a need for high quality well powered RCTs with long-term follow-up and well defined diagnostic criteria to answer the above research questions. Furthermore, there is a need for studies with more robust a ssessment of adherence to AIT to ascertain the dose received and take into consideration the effect of non-adherence to treatment on preventive effectiveness. Future studies should also include possible effect modification caused by measures taken to alter behaviours and/or environmental triggers of allergy (e.g. exposure to passive smoking in childhood, presence of pets) as this may modify the effect of AIT on onset of allergy.

Based on the current evidence, we are unable to conclude that AIT prevents the development of first allergic disease . There appears to be short-term benefit in preventing asthma in those with AR, particularly if AIT is started in childhood with this benefit being seen for SCIT and SLIT. It is however unclear if this benefit is maintained over several years post-discontinuation of AIT or indeed whether AIT is a cost-effective intervention.
