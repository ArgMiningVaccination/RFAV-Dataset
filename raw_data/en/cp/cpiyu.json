Like any injury, it takes time to heal. Feelings of grief and sorrow can be experienced from such experiences as a change in school, death of a loved one, or divorce. Some mothers experience a period of sadness following childbirth symbolic as a loss of their former lifestyle. Following any difficult experience, it is normal to go through a period of pain and suffering. No matter the age of the infant or child, any person can experience a period of grief and sorrow following a loss. Even an infant will sense the loss of a person who was a consistent presence. Though, children respond differently to a loss compared to an adult. A child's awareness is more concrete and short range compared to an adult. In adolescence the abstract concept of the meaning of life and death becomes more developed. The younger the child, the more the loss will be expressed through feelings and body language. While an older child will communicate through words. Some symptoms of grief and sorrow include sadness, crying, sighing, loss of attention and focus, poor appetite, difficulty sleeping, and withdrawal. In addition, to offering a grieving child love and support, remedies can be used to help in dealing with difficult experiences in acute situations, and not suppress them. A constitutional remedy can alleviate symptoms in chronic cases. [Ignatia amara](http://drfeder.com/index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is the main remedy for loss, sorrow and grief. It is indicated when there is the sensation of a lump in the throat, sighing, and uncontrollable weeping. I also use this remedy for women with hysterical feelings and sadness in the post partum period. [Natrum muriaticum](http://drfeder.com/index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is useful for the child who suffers quietly, and keeps her feelings to herself. She tends to be overly responsible and avoids company. She may have difficulty crying and may experience long periods of sadness following a loss through death or breakup of a relationship. There can be a craving for salty foods, lemon and ice cold drinks. [Phosphoric acidum](http://drfeder.com/index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3), also for grief, is indicated when the child appears more exhausted, weak and indifferent rather than sad. There is an improvement following a short nap, and also desire for refreshing fruit juices and carbonated drinks. There can also be a sadness with homesickness and nostalgia. Bach Flower Essences (can be used in conjunction with homeopathic remedies) Star of Bethlehem helps to relieve sadness associated with loss and grief. [Rescue Remedy](http://drfeder.com/index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=30) is a combination of five flower essences, including Star of Bethlehem. Rescue Remedy can be used for sadness and grief associated with emergency situations and panic such as a grave accident, earthquakes or even starting a new school. "}
