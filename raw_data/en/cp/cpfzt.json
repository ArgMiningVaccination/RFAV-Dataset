There are many ideas about how to stay healthy including drinking more water, getting more sleep and exercise. One place people are turning to for help is through vitamins and supplements. However, should everyone begin a vitamin regimen? And, where should we start with taking vitamins? In this Q&A, Hannah Kittrell, MS, RD, CDN, Clinical Research Associate and Director of the Mount Sinai Physiolab, provides some advice on which vitamins people should begin taking and discusses if supplements can really boost your immune system. We hear a lot about taking vitamins, herbs, elderberry syrup, and other supplements to boost your immune system during the pandemic. Is it possible to 'boost' your immune system? It depends on how you define \"boost\", but there are certain nutrients that are vital for optimizing immune function. The immune system is a complex, interconnected system that requires all of its parts to work in harmony to function at its best. It is easy to \"boost\" a single entity, but something as complex as the immune system, not so easy. There are specific nutrients that contribute to a healthy immune system, such as zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and E, and the essential fatty acid omega-6 (linoleic acid). Deficiencies of these micronutrients may impact the immune system in a negative way. To note, adequate amounts of these micronutrients can be easily obtained through eating a well-balanced diet composed of whole foods, with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. Supplementation may be indicated in the case of deficiency, but you should always check with your doctor or a clinical dietitian prior to starting a supplementation regimen. Where should you start in your vitamin regimen? A multivitamin? Vitamin C? A general multivitamin is fine to start, however, adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals can be obtained through eating a well-balance diet. However, people who are likely deficient may also warrant supplementation. We recommend taking a look at your last blood test, which would show any recent deficiencies. Additionally, a comprehensive dietary evaluation conducted by a dietitian would determine dietary habits that can be improved upon. What vitamins and minerals should we be certain to take in adequate amounts? It is difficult to generalize vitamin/mineral needs for a large group of people, as supplementation recommendations are based on deficiencies or likely deficiencies for reasons such as access to food, malabsorption, or medical conditions, and can vary greatly from one person to the next. However, there are certain micronutrients that are of importance for certain groups: Children\u2014Iron, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium Women\u2014Iodine, vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, iron, folate Adults\u2014 Iron, iodine, vitamin B12/B6, vitamin D, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin A, magnesium Seniors\u2014Vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, iron Based on a [nutrition report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/index.html), the top five most common nutrient deficiencies among people who live in the United States include vitamin B6, iron, vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin B12. These deficiencies are mainly due to poor nutrition. And, again, if you follow a healthy food plan and eat adequate amounts of fruits and vegetables, in a variety of colors, then you should not have to worry about any micronutrient deficiencies. How can we best support our immune system during quarantine? The best way to support your immune function is by living a healthy lifestyle. Be sure to get enough sleep. That is seven hours for adults, nine hours for teenagers, and 10 hours for children 12 and under. Drink plenty of water\u2014two cups shortly after waking and six to eight more throughout day\u2014and stay active. Also, everyone should try to eat a well-balanced diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as high quality sources of protein and fat like nuts, seed, legumes and beans, eggs and fish. "}
