A distinct field of medicine that addresses the fundamental cause of disease with individualized, natural treatments. Naturopathic medicine focuses on educating patients on the principles of healthy living and preventative medicine and integrates the healing powers of body, mind and spirit. Naturopathic doctors (ND's) are like your family doctor, but serve as a bridge between conventional and traditional therapeutic realms. ND's use the most ancient healing practices coupled with the latest research and most current diagnostic tools. Having a wide array of disciplines means that ND's can integrate different philosophies and tools to allow for flexibility and creativity when approaching the intricate and complex details of your health.

This is the bread and butter of naturopathic consultations and is woven into all treatment plans. Diet and lifestyle counselling is where we work on the pillars of health, including diet, sleep, exercise, and mental wellness. Any health issue you may have can benefit from improving one (or all) of these pillars. Traditional Chinese Medicine/Asian Medicine Chinese medicine is a wholistic system that addresses energy imbalances through acupuncture, dietary interventions, and lifestyle practices; this approach can be very beneficial in addressing a wide range of health issues ranging from digestive complaints and ankle sprains to anxiety and depression and larger spiritual concerns. Using the Chinese medicine system, we can move back into harmony with ourselves, our emotions and our lives. Botanical Medicine Plant medicine is one of the [oldest forms of healing](http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/herbs/brief-history/) used by our ancestors. Working with plants can support our emotional, as well as our physical health; from coughs and colds to hypertension to hormonal imbalances to sleep and everything in between, plants contain natural compounds that aid our biochemistry to come back into balance. We are intrinsically interwoven with our environment and plant medicine fosters connection and communion with our natural world and our ancestors. Physical medicine Physical medicine focuses on issues that arise in our muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Here we can identify the root cause of your physical symptoms and the best approach to your healing. Physical medicine includes massage, hydrotherapy and spinal manipulations, all of which promote alignment, stimulate circulation and boost immune function. Issues that can be addressed here are acute and chronic injuries, overuse injuries, inflammatory conditions of ligaments, tendons, muscles, and joints, and so much more. Homeopathy Homeopathy uses remedies made from minute doses of plant, animal and mineral substances to stimulate and heal the body. Each remedy is prescribed after a fulsome intake of your symptom picture and overall constitution and can help with physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual concerns. Homeopathy is a very gentle approach and does not interact with other medicinal substances. Labs & Diagnostics Extensive laboratory testing is available to inform our assessment and manage your treatment progress. Tests include, but are not limited to: basic blood panels, saliva and urine tests, sex and stress hormone panels, food sensitivity testing, heavy metal testing and comprehensive stool analysis. These are used as needed, or are available at your request. This service is often not covered by extended benefits packages and is often paid out-of-pocket. Physical Exams Naturopathic Doctors are trained to perform screening and diagnostic physical exams. These exams include pelvic health (gyne/PAP/testicular exams) and prostate health screening exams, as well as focused physical exams to rule in, or out, health conditions.
