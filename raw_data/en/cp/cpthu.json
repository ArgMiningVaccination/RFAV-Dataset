In this blog post, we will touch on the basics of spirituality and meditation to help anyone who is interested in it. Maybe you have already looked into spiritualism and meditation and perhaps you have already practiced these techniques If so, here are a few things you might want to consider. The first thing is first what does spiritualism even mean... Table of Contents Defining spiritualism - What does it mean to be spiritual? - Spirituality is the tendency towards or state of being spiritual. Spirituality can be considered an essential part of life, something that everyone experiences in some form or another, although not always consciously. - Spirituality is defined as having an intimate relationship with God or a higher power. Meditation is a practice where a person practices deep concentration by focusing their thoughts on a particular object or process. - Spirituality is a term that covers different things for different people. For some, it means a search for truth; for others, it might mean a relationship with God or an appreciation of nature. - Spirituality can be described as a way of life that recognizes a connection between people and things outside themselves, including God, nature, and all living creatures; involves the development of an attitude of reverence for creation. - Spiritual can also mean having a direct connection with God, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, Krishna, et al. Spirituality is about having an inner connection with something greater than yourself. - Spirituality is the search for meaning, purpose, immortality, and understanding of life's mysteries. Spiritual people seek an altered state of consciousness, often through meditation, prayer, contemplation, chanting, chanting, yoga, or other practices that they find helpful in attaining this altered state. - Spirituality is an important component of the human experience. It includes beliefs about the existence of spirit, spiritual beings, and the afterlife. - Spirituality refers to the search for meaning in life and the pursuit of spiritual growth and development. What spirituality is not: - Spirituality is not synonymous with religion. One can be spiritual without conforming or following any set religious beliefs. Although being religious obviously has an element of being spiritual - spirituality goes far beyond the boundaries of most religions and holds concepts of not seeing one form of religion or even concept as the 'truth'. - It is also important to note that although meditating can lead us to connect with 'the divine', 'source', or a 'higher power' it doesn't mean one can only meditate if you are spiritual. Meditation is for anyone and everyone and has many benefits beyond building a spiritual practice. What is known as connecting with 'source'? Source energy, connecting to source, spiritual source, or connecting with the divine are all terms often used within spiritualism. This is referred to when we channel energies, concepts, or spiritual realms that are beyond our physical or mental existence and living truths through deep reflection, introspection, contemplation, and meditation. To connect with your spiritual source means to connect with yourself to know who you truly are. When you learn who you really are, you discover what makes you feel alive and why you want to live. This knowledge helps you to better understand others and the world around you. When we connect with our spiritual Source, we feel connected to a greater community and become one with everything around us. Connecting with your spiritual source also helps us develop who we are and what we perceive as 'our truth'. We all have aspects of our personality that make up our unique identity. These traits include physical characteristics, interests, hobbies, likes and dislikes, values, beliefs, goals, aspirations, and dreams. The concept of connecting to 'source' is all about developing a relationship with our higher self, which usually results in some kind of positive impact. Achieving personal growth requires us to be connected with the divine force of the universe, and we should try to understand who we are and how to live life wisely. Human beings need to know they are not alone, as we share a common humanity with other living creatures. Connecting with a spiritual source is when we open our heart to a higher power (which can be in the form of spiritual energy or even our higher self) and allow this higher power to take control, instead of us trying to control things or be in charge. Some people find it difficult to connect with spiritual sources, and the best way to do that is to focus on loving yourself, caring for others, and focusing on how you want to change the world - this is where meditation might lead us too. Spiritual Meditation, enlightenment, and spiritual awakening meaning Before continuing let us quickly talk about spiritual awakening and what it is. - Spiritual Awakening is when our inner light begins to shine. When we see things differently, new possibilities open up in our lives and the world around us. We begin to understand what an amazing miracle life really is. - Spiritual Awakening is an experience that some people have when they become aware of their true nature, which is free from ego, and see themselves in the context of oneness. - Spiritual Awakening is the realization in humans that they are not isolated individuals but parts of an interconnected whole - part of a greater cosmic order - part of nature and therefore part of God's plan for human existence. Spiritual Awakening occurs when we experience enlightenment. This term can also be referred to as the enlightenment of Buddha as this was the point which Buddhist meditators strive to get to. This means that we become free from our self-consciousness and can recognize the true nature of reality. When we awaken to who we are, we realize that all things are interconnected, and our actions affect ourselves and others. Spiritual awakening Some people have reported experiencing what is known as \"awakening.\" In Nisha's opinion, an awakening experience is \"an [activation of higher consciousness or an increase in our awareness as souls.\" Nisha says]these events can be triggered by life changing experiences or the conscious choice to make a lifestyle change to \"become more aligned with the soul's energy.\" While there is some research dedicated to the study of spiritual awakening, there is no scientific proof that it exists. Based on his own experience, Nisha shares an extensive list of what he believes are the benefits of spiritual meditation: a more balanced sense of being less reactivity a sense of inner bliss that isn't dependent on outer circumstances a strong and authentic sense of who you are on a soul level a reduction in unhealthy stress an increase in creativity a strong sense of belonging increased self-esteem, self-trust, and self-acceptance the clarity in your life purpose \"Your practice will bring you realizations and then the awareness that you can choose how you experience each moment of your life,\" says Nisha. In Alico's opinion, it strengthens the mind-body connection. \"Meditation encourages you to do everything with intention. When consistently meditating, you will be able to better listen to what your body needs,\" she says. \"When you choose to listen to your body, you're naturally living a more [mindful]life.\" Importantly, Nisha emphasizes that spiritual meditation isn't a quick fix. \"The benefits it brings come from dedication to daily practice and the willingness to grow,\" he says. [healthline.com] This idea of reaching enlightenment and being spiritually awake was for long the ultimate goal within the history of Buddhist meditation. However, this was thousands of years ago and this is no longer the case. Absolutist views of enlightenment have been criticized for failing to acknowledge that people can be enlightened in different ways while recognizing that an absolute concept of enlightenment could not account for this diversity. This was very prevalent in the movement of enlightened absolutism within the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, we will say it again as there is a huge misconception around meditation and spiritualism. YOU CAN MEDITATE WITHOUT BEING SPIRITUAL. 10 ways to reach the enlightenment spiritual source - Observation of mental patterns and physical habits - Feeling connected with self, others or heightened sense of awareness - Detaching from definitions, labels or self-identity - Channeling inner peace and magnifying positive emotions - Building intuition and inner wisdom - Feeling synchronized to the natural outside world - Heightened feelings of empathy, compassion, mindfulness, kindness, and humanity towards self and others - Dissolving any fears - specifically the fear of death - Increased feelings of self-worth, self-confidence, and your authentic self - Health and happiness that flow with abundance spirituality meditation - how to meditate for spiritual awakening Spiritual meditation is an experience that takes you to the depths of who you are. You, as your real self, were stripped of all the perceptions you had about yourself until that point in your life. In the process, you experience joy and peace. A feeling of love and light warms up your being. Spiritual meditation makes you realize the eternal truth and let go of all that had happened and will happen. The present is where you want to be and find solace. The need to practice spiritual meditation comes from an innate longing to see and think beyond the chaotic world surrounding you. [(stylecraze.com)] So with all of that being said and now that we have a deeper understanding of meditation and spirituality what would the \"spiritual awakening how to\", be... 6 simple steps - Spiritual awakening guided meditation - Find a comfortable seat or position on the floor and be intentional with your setting. Find a quiet spot devoid of noise and distractions or alternatively go outside and be immersed in a peaceful natural setting. - Close your eyes and direct your awareness to your breath - Now become aware of your thoughts, feelings, and emotions through self-observation. The idea here is to be a passive spectator. We are not trying to change our thoughts or control them but rather just notice them pass through our minds without justifying or attaching meaning to them. Acknowledge the thoughts but try and stay away from the constant buzz of chatter that might be going o in your mind. Notice how you respond to these thoughts and if it urges a reaction. Practice letting go of these thoughts - they can pass out of the mind just as quickly as they came into the mind. - Experience the process rather than focusing on the 'end goal' or destination - this is how we practice being in the present moment. Not worrying about the future or dwelling on the past but just focusing on what is happening right here and now. - Use your breath or even repeat a mantra to yourself. Repeating a singular phrase known as a mantra (can be a spiritual one or not) or connecting our awareness back to our breath helps us get away from the mental chatter and connects us to a deeper sense of source. - Reflect, reflect and reflect some more. Become aware of your surroundings, of your internal dialogue of your internal emotional landscape, of the sensations that might arise in your body, of the deep sense of calm that is washing over you. Now open your eyes and let these effects of introspection sink in. Take a moment of stillness and carry this feeling of awareness and calm into the rest of your day. In short, spirituality is a very big concept and it goes far beyond what we traditionally believe it to be. It is also deeply rooted within meditation (as originally this is how meditation came to be) but that is not the only reason or aim of meditation. Although spiritual awakening, enlightenment, and connecting to the divine source are accessed through meditation, an important takeaway is that meditation exists far beyond the spiritual side of things and there are so many other benefits it holds too.
