If you can feel safe in that space then deep healing is possible. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a traditional form of medicine. It was developed by German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann over 200 years ago. In homeopathy we treat the whole person rather than the disease. The aim is to stimulate your body's innate healing capacity to relieve the underlying cause of disease. Your unique symptoms are explored. Your mental and emotional stresses are often pivotal in making a homeopathic prescription. The range of conditions that can be supported with homeopathy is vast: from simple first aid to deep pathology. Homeopathy Consultation In a homeopathic consultation, you tell your story to help me understand how you are feeling blocked. This is part of a detailed case taking which guides the selection of a homeopathic medicine that reflects your unique situation and symptoms. I have an interest in supporting people who are working to resolve the effects of trauma. Mindfulness & Meditation I combine self-compassion practices with trauma sensitive mindfulness and an understanding of somatic healing, to teach you how to relate to challenges. You can experienc deep healing when you learn how to turn towards uncomfortable thoughts and feelings with kindness, openness and curiosity. It is important to learn how to do this in a way that ensures emotional safety, minimising any sense of overwhelm. You can work with me individually, or take part in a self-compassion course. I also offer basic mindfulness and meditation sessions in corporate settings. (Mindfulness training is not a substitute "}
