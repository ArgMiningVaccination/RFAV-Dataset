territory, and tribal grantees that enable low -income parents to work or pursue educat ion and training so that they can better support their families while at the same time promoting the learning and development of their children. The CCDF program also provides funding to enhance the quality of child care for all children. The CCDF Plan is how states and territories apply for CCDF funding (658E (a)) and is the primary mechanism that the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) uses to determine state and territory compliance with the requirements of the law and rule (98.16). ACF acknow ledges that in the FY 2022 - 2024 Plan, states and territories may still be operating under approved waivers related to the COVID -19 pandemic and where appropriate plan responses should reflect the approved waivers. The CCDF Plan allows states and territor ies to describe their implementation of the CCDF program and it is organized into the following sections: 1. Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems and Funding Sources 2. Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Education 3. Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families 4. Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low-Income Children 5. Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings 6. Recruit and Retain a Qualified and Effec tive Child Care Workforce 4 | P a g e 7. Support Continuous Quality Improvement 8. Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability These organizational categories reflect key goals of an integrated system of child care for low- income working families. Although the Plan is divided into sections for reporting and accountability purposes, ACF encourages Lead Agencies to approach the Plan in a cross - cutting, integrated manner. The intention is that grantees and the federal government will be able to use this information to track and assess progress, determine the need for technical assistance (TA), and determine compliance with specific requirements. Citations ACF recognizes that Lead Agencies use different mechanisms to establish policies, such as state statute, regulatio ns, administrative rules, or policy manuals or policy issuances. When asked to provide a citation in the CCDF Plan, Lead Agencies should list the citation(s) for the policy that clearly identifies and establishes the requirement and that allows the Lead Agency to enforce the requirement. Lead Agencies may list multiple sources as needed to cover all types of providers receiving CCDF (e.g., policies for licensed providers may be established in licensing regulations, and policies for license -exempt providers may be in subsidy rules). These citations are intended to provide documentation to support the requested information but not replace requested responses or descriptions. Complete answers must include citations, responses, and descriptions. CCDF Plan Subm ission States and territories will submit their Plans electronically through the ACF -118 electronic submission site. The ACF -118 site will include all language and questions included in the final CCDF Plan Preprint template approved by the Office of Manage ment and Budget. Please note that the format of the questions on the ACF -118 site could be modified from the Word version of the document to ensure compliance with Section 508 policies regarding accessibility to electronic and information technology for in dividuals with disabilities. (See http://www.section508.gov/ for more information.) In responding to questions, states and territories are asked to provide brief, specific summaries and/or bullet points only wi th specific language that responds to the question. Do not use tables or copy and paste charts, add attachments, or paste manuals into the Plan. All information and materials developed to support CCDF implementation and information reported in the CCDF Plan are subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing oversight and monitoring efforts . 1 Define Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems and Funding Sources This section identifies the leadership for the CCDF program in each Lead Agency and the entiti es and individuals who will participate in the implementation of the program. It also identifies the stakeholders that were consulted to develop the Plan and who the Lead Agency collaborates with to implement services. Respondents are asked to identify how match and maintenance -of- effort (MOE) funds are used. Lead Agencies explain their coordination with child care resource and referral (CCR&R) systems and describe their 5 | P a g e efforts on their disaster preparedness and response plans to support continuity of operations in response to emergencies. 1.1 CCDF Leadership The Governor of a state or territory must designate an agency (which may be an appropriate collaborative agency) or establish a joint interagency office to represent the state or territory as the Lead Ag ency. The Lead Agency agrees to administer the program in accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations and the provisions of this Plan, including the assurances and certifications appended hereto (658D; 658E(c)(1) and 98.16 (a)). Note: An amendm ent to the CCDF State Plan is required if the Lead Agency changes or if the Lead Agency official changes . 1.1.1 Which Lead Agency is designated to administer the CCDF program?

List and describe any other state or territory agencies or partners that implement or perform CCDF services and identify their responsibilities. 1.2.3 Describe the processes the Lead Agency uses to oversee and monitor CCDF administration and implementation responsibilities performed by other agencies as reported above in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (98.16(b)). In the description include: Written agreements. Note: The contents of the written agreement may vary based on the role the agency is asked to assume or type of project but must include at a minimum the elements below (98.11(a)(3)). o Tasks to be performed o Schedule for completing tasks o Budget which itemizes categorical expenditures in accordance with CCDF requirements o Monitoring and auditing procedures o Indicators or measures to assess performance of those agencies Any other processes to oversee and monitor other agencies. NOTE: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the DC Department of Human Services (DHS), which is 9 | P a g e the District's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) agency, that outlines the roles and responsibilities of DHS in determining child care eligibility. The MOU includes specific tasks to be co mpleted by DHS and OSSE, with clear timelines and budget line items. Additionally, the MOU requires that OSSE conduct onsite reviews to determine compliance with establish ed policies and conduct follow -up visits to validate compliance and provides for sche duled and unscheduled monitoring visits. OSSE conducts quarterly audits/eligibility reviews of DHS. These reviews consists of OSSE eligibility monitors requesting a selected sample of records for each caseworker. A transmittal form is prepared for the case records and the intake and a ssignment forms are printed. The eligibility monitor visits the child care services office and reviews each record using the Eligibility Review Assessment Form , to document each eligibility factor. These forms are given to the supervisor to complete/update any factors that were noted for correction. During the second review, the Eligibility Review Assessment Form and the Cover Sheet are given to the supervisor and if needed, an additional five to 10 days is given for the resolut ion of any outstanding deficiencies. Additionally, OSSE's Division of Early Learning Operations and Grants Management unit conducts annual reviews of Level II providers , which are Community Based Organizations (CBOs) . OSSE conducts annual audits/eligibilit y reviews of Level II providers (CBO) records. The percentage of eligibility records to be reviewed is determined by the site's total number of families enrolled in subsidy. The criteria are: 1 to 30 family case records - all records will be reviewed 31 to 100 family case records - 50 percent (randomly selected) will be reviewed More than 100 family case records - 30 percent (randomly selected) will be reviewed A randomly selected list is prepared for the case records and the intake and assignment fo rms are printed. The eligibility monitor visits the CBO and reviews each record using the eligibility review checklist, to document each eligibility factor. These forms are given to the eligibility worker to complete/update any factors that were noted for correction. During the second review, the Eligibility Review Assessment Form and the Cover Sheet are given to the eligibility worker and if needed, an additional five to 10 days is given for the resolution of any outstanding deficiencies. OSSE funds CCR&R services through the Building and Sustaining Quality grant, which supports and aligns several activities to improve the supply and quality of child care that are carried out by a lead grantee and its subgrantees. OSSE holds bi -weekly grantee meetings to r eceive updates, discuss grant program implementation and monitor progress towards deliverables. Any issues with program activities are discussed and a plan of action is developed to resolve the concern. The CCR&R tracks each contact made with families, pr oviders and others made over the phone, by email, on their website and in person in an online QuickBase application . OSSE staff review and analyze this data on a monthly basis. The CCR&R also tracks and submits data to OSSE and regarding child care referral requests received from families , child care matching with families , language access, lending library activities , community sites visits , professional development training , technical assistance support to providers and overall family and community engagement. All reports are checked for discrepancies and the CCR&R is advised of any corrections needed. An OSSE grantee dashboard is used to track and compare the analytics monthly to inform strategies to address opportunities for improvement. 1.2.4 Note: Upon request, and to the extent practicable and appropriate, Lead Agencies must ensure any code or software for child care information systems or information technology 10 | P a g e for which a Lead Agency or other agency expends CCDF funds to develop must be made available to other public agencies. This includes public agencies in other states, for their use in administering child care or related programs (98.15(a)(11)). Assure by describing how the Lead Agency makes child care information systems (e.g., subsidy, registry, and QRIS systems) available to public agencies in other states. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) does not expend CCDF funds to develop any code or software for child care information systems or information technology. 1.2.5 Lead Agencie s must have in effect policies to govern the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information about children and families receiving CCDF assistance and child care providers receiving CCDF funds (98.15(b)(13)). Certify by describin g the Lead Agency's policies related to the use and disclosure of confidential and personally identifiable information. Note: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) requires all employees, contractors and other personnel to maintain t he security and privacy of any and all data, documents and information acquired by and accessed through OSSE. Staff are required to sign a n on-disclosure agreement asserting compliance with these policies. The non -disclosure agreement affirms that staff co mplies with confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information pursuant to District of Columbia laws and regulations, as well as federal laws and regulations and that this information is not disclosed to any unauthorized party, organizatio n, or entity. Also, OSSE's licensing regulations require child development facilities to conform to applicable state and federal laws and protect a child's confidential information, keeping all records in a secure location and not disclosing information co ncerning an individual child or the parents/guardians. Further, each child care provider that participates in the District's subsidized child care program is required to sign a \"Provider Agreement\" which specifically requires that the provider is responsib le for ensuring all children's records are maintained in a safe and secure manner. Per the Provider Agreement, OSSE will hold the Provider accountable for any and all missing records by recouping the payment for the child for the time period the Provider c ould not produce the record to substantiate eligibility. 1.3 Consultation in the Development of the CCDF Plan The Lead Agency is responsible for developing the CCDF Plan, which serves as the application for a 3 -year implementation period. As part of the Plan development process, Lead Agencies must consult with the following: (1) Appropriate representatives of units of general purpose local government \u2014 (658D(b)(2); 98.10(c); 98.12(b); 98.14(b)). General purpose local governments are defined by the U.S. Census at https://www.census.gov/newsroom/cspan/govts/20120301_cspan_govts_d ef_ 3.pdf . (2) The State Advisory Council (SAC) on Early Childhood Education and Care (pursuant to 642B(b)(I)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act) (658E(c)(2)(R); 98.15(b)(1)) or similar coordinating body pursuant to 98.14(a)(1)(vii). (3) Indian tribe(s) or tribal organization(s) within the state. This consultation should be done in a timely manner and at the option of the Indian tribe(s) or tribal organization(s) (658D(b)(1)(E)). Consultation involves meeting with or otherwise obtaining input from an appropriate agency in the development of the state or territory CCDF Plan. Describe the partners engaged 11 | P a g e to provide services under the CCDF program as described in question 1.4.1. 1.3.1 Describe the Lead Agency's consultation efforts in the development of the CCDF Plan. Note: Lead Agencies must describe in a. - c. consultation efforts with required partners listed in Rule and Statute. ACF recognizes that there is great value in consulting with other entities and has provided element d. for Lead Agencies to identify consultation effort s with other agencies or organizations. a. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with appropriate representatives of general purpose local governments. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) met with and obtained input from the Deputy May or for Education (DME) during the development of the Plan. Additionally, as described below, OSSE met with and obtained input from the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) which includes representatives from the Executive Office of the Mayor ( EOM ) and the Council of the District of Columbia. During these consultative meetings, OSSE focused on strategies to improve the quality of and access to high -quality child care and ensure equitab le access to high -quality care . Additionally, t hese consultations and collaborations yielded critical stakeholder feedback aimed at empowering families and increasing knowledge of high -quality child care and strategies to strengthen the District's early care and education infrastructure . b. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning - who also serves as the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) A dministrator - facilitated two consultation sessions with the District of Columbia State Early Child Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC). The first session was held in January 2020 and included: Background on the Child Care and Development Block Gr ant Reauthorization Act of 2014 and the state plan requirements An overview of the purpose of each preprint section/topic Presentation and vote on the District's proposal to conduct alternative methodology as part of the State Plan General updates on the D istrict's state plan development process During the January 2020 meeting, the SECDCC voted to move forward with requesting ACF approval to use the alternative cost methodology for the FY 2022 -2024 CCDF Plan. OSSE held a second consultation session with t he SECDCC in March 2020. During this session, the Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning recapped the background and purpose of CCDF and the three -year state plan. The session included a more in -depth review of each of the eight sections of the CCDF preprint highlighting the initiatives the District is currently implementing under each section. Following the main presentation, SECDCC members participated in two breakout groups to facilitate more direct engagement on the CCDF State Plan. The CCDF Adminis trator and the Co - Administrator facilitated each of the breakout groups and solicited input on improving the District's support for the early childhood workforce; enhancing partnerships across government agencies to increase high -quality child care; ensuring CCDF eligible 12 | P a g e families/parents equal access to high -quality child care and what if any policies that were changed during the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency should be extended through the state plan period. In May 2021 , OSSE discussed key themes from public comment on the draft plan with he SECDCC and solicited additional input from SECDCC members . As part of the consultation process SECDCC members recommended reviewing family/parent outreach and engagement practices in preparation for the resumption of eligibility redeterminations following the conclusion of the public health emergency and additional support for the early childhood education workforce. c. Describe, if applicable, how the Lead Agency consulted with Indian tribes(s) or tribal organizations(s) within the state. Note: The CCDF regulations recognize the need for states to conduct formal, structured consultation with Tribal governments, including Tribal leadership. Many states and tribes have consultation policies and procedur es in place. N/A. d. Describe any other entities, agencies, or organizations consulted on the development of the CCDF Plan. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) consulted with a number of public and private stakeholders to gather input on the CCDF State Plan. The list of the se group s (and brief descriptions) include : District's Child Care Recovery Workgroup , a core group of early childhood education stakeholders convened in the Spring 2020 to assist OSSE in developing guidance, templat es and other tools to support childcare reopening efforts due to the coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency , and which OSSE continues to engage for advice and input on key issues facing the District's early learning community ; Program managers from community -based organizations (CBOs) participating in the Pre- K Enhancement and Expansion Program ( a part of the District's publicly funded pre -k program for 3 - and 4 -year -old children ); The Early Childhood Stakeholders Group , a the broad group of license d child care providers - including both CCDF and non -CCDF providers - that OSSE convenes through regular calls to facilitate the flow of information on changes and guidance during the coronavirus COVID -19 public health emergency; The District of Columbia Head Start Association (DCHSA) ; DC Early Learning Collaborative (DC ELC); and DC Action for Children (DC Action) . DCHSA represents all Early Head Start and Head Start programs within the District of Columbia. T he DC ELC is an alliance of more than 100 educ ation professionals, organizations, and coalitions working together to advocate for improved early childhood education policy, investment, and services . DC Action is an advocacy organization that works to promote public policies that support kids at every step from early childhood to early adulthood. 13 | P a g e 1.3.2 Describe the statewide or territory -wide public hearing process held to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the provision of child care services under this Plan (658D(b)(1)(C); 98.16(f)). Remi nder: Lead Agencies are required to hold at least one public hearing in the state or territory, with sufficient statewide or territory -wide distribution of notice prior to such a hearing to enable the public to comment on the provision of child care servic es under the CCDF Plan. At a minimum, this description must include: a. Date of the public hearing. May 25, 2021. Reminder: Must be no earlier than January 1, 2021, which is 9 months prior to the October 1, 2021, effective date of the Plan.

Within this structure, the Office of the State Superintendent for Education ( OSSE ) serves as the state education agency (SEA) and has the oversight and responsibilities of the state CCDF lead agency. OSSE works in close partners hip with other units of District Government that have both state and local functions. As the CCDF lead agency, OSSE works closely with the Mayor and the DC Council with the goal of ensuring that policies, financing and coordination are in place to expand accessibility and continuity of care and provide full- day, full- year comprehensive services for young children, especially those most vulnerable. OSSE is part of the \"education cluster\" of agencies that report to and coordinate with the Deputy Mayor for E ducation (DME). OSSE Leadership (including the CCDF Administrator) meet regulatory with the DME to provide updates on initiatives and activities and solicit input on key topics. OSSE also works through the DME to facilitate coordination with other agencies and offices within the education cluster and the Executive Office of the Mayor. In addition, the Lead Agency reports quarterly to the City Administrator on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including indicators of child care supply, quality, and equitab le access. The D.C. Council is the legislative body for the District of Columbia and carries out performance and budget oversight of District agencies, including OSSE. OSSE staff engage with the Council and its staff around issues related to early care and education both formally (e.g. through budge and performance oversight hearings) and informally on an ad hoc basis. Representatives of the D.C. Council also participate in the District's early childhood coordinating bodies (e.g. the State Early Childhood C oordinating Council and Interagency Coordinating Council) to ensure representation of legislative perspectives in those bodies and ensure the D.C. Council is informed of these bodies' work. As the lead agency , OSSE serves as the convener of these bodies , which also facilitates coordination between the lead agency and the D.C. Council. This partnership between the Executive, Council, and lead agency has resulted in legislative and budget actions that advance the District's early childhood system and outcom es for children and families, including our Universal Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Program for 3 - and 4 -year - 17 | P a g e old children; the Quality Improvement Network, DC's Early Head Start Child Care Partnership grant; the Mayor's Access to Quality Child Care (A2 Q) Expansion Grant that provides local funding to increase the supply of infant and toddler care , investments in the early care and education workforce and a partnership with the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) to distribute locally funded assistance to child care providers during the public health emergency. ii.

Teams from both unit s meet regularly to audit compliance with the program requirements, prepare joint communications and conduct joint outreach and education to meet the above states goal . Since the passage of the Healthy Tots Act, OSSE has refined an effective and systemati c approach for working with child development facilities that are required to participate in CACFP. When a child development facility has been identified as meeting the Healthy Tots Act requirements to participate in CACFP, OSSE contacts the facility to en courage them to participate in CACFP. OSSE also makes the facility aware of the option to apply for a participation waiver. OSSE follows up by scheduling an in -person technical assistance visit with the facility to provide face -to-face assistance with Healthy Tots Act and CACFP compliance. Facilities that decide to apply for CACFP receive training and reoccurring technical assistance from OSSE throughout the entire application process. Each facility receives a minimum of two technical assistance visits during the full application process.

In addition to OSSE's direct role in managing and supporting the QIN, the Head Start State Collaboration Office located within OSSE DEL supports coordination and collaboration between the District's four EHS-CCP grantee s and OSSE DEL, other OSSE divisions, and local education agencies . Because the District offers universal p re-k, many children transition directly from EHS and EHS -CCP programs to pre -k within and HSSCO partners with EHS programs and LEAs to support these transitions. All the EHS and EHS -CCP grantees located in the District are licensed child care facilit ies and participate in the District's child care subsidy program . OSSE DEL and the HSSCO partner with EHS and EHS -CCP programs to address questions or concerns related to licensing and subsidy policies and practices and seek input to inform these policies and practices to support alignment of EHS and CCDF policies to the extent possible. ii. State/territory institutions for higher education, including community colleges . Describe : The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is an active member of the Higher Edu cation Early Childhood Collaborative. Membership of this group has changed over time, but typically includes representatives from the University of the District of Columbia, Trinity Washington University and American University. This group typically meets quarte rly and is charged with ensuring supports for higher educ ation degree attainment. OSSE also funds, coordinates and collaborates with the T.E.A.C.H. program, which works with various local and national universities to suppor t the workforce in attaining an associate's or bachelor's degree in early childhood. OSSE's Division of Early Learning works closely with OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education to coordinate engagement and partnerships with higher education institutions in the District and outreach to early childhood educators about postsecondary education offerings and funding opportunities , such as the Adult College Completion Fair. iii. Other federal, state, local, and/or private agencies providing early childhood and school -age/youth -serving developmental services. Describe : The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) works closely with the Office of Out of School Time Grants and Youth Outcomes located within the Office of the Deputy Mayo r of Education , the 21st Century after school program administered by OSSE K-12 Systems and Supports Division and local educational agencies (e.g. traditional public schools and public charter schools) to support access to and coordination of funding for school -aged programs. iv. State/territory agency responsible for implementing the Maternal and Child Home Visitation programs grant. Describe: 26 | P a g e The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Division of Early Learning (DEL) works closely wit h the District of Columbia Department of Health, which administers the District's evidence -based Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) program. OSSE DEL participates in the District of Columbia Home Visiting Council (HV Counc il), which works to strengthen the understanding, implementation, and sustainability of home visiting as a strategy to support positive child and family outcomes in the District of Columbia. The HV Council developed and approved a new 2021- 23 strategic plan, including six key goals. These goals focus on, among other things, promoting well -trained and supported home visitors to increase the capacity of the workforce to deliver home visiting services, with appropriate adaptations to address the impact of COV ID-19; deepening the HV Council and home visitors' pursuit of racial justice; and developing a District - wide coordinated intake system for home visiting. Additionally, Georgetown University recently completed a MIECHV Needs Assessment on behalf of the HV Council, with key recommendations that the HV Council is pursuing. The HV Council meets bi -monthly. OSSE is also a member of the HV Council's c - intake (centralized/coordinated intake) subcommittee, which works to develop a referral and intake system for ho me visiting in order to improve access to appropriate home visiting services for families who might benefit from them. The c -intake subcommittee also meets bi -monthly . v. Agency responsible for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Progra m. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) works closely with the DC Department of Health Care Finance (DC DHCF) on outreach, engagement and professional development regarding Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and T reatment (EPSDT) services. OSSE and DC DHCF have a shared commitment to pro vide early, comprehensive, regular and as needed medical, behavioral, and dental screenings for all eligible children. Through ongoing meetings and collaborations, OSSE and DC D HCF align policies so that all CCDF eligible children receive developmental screenings (within an appropriate timeframe) and child development centers use these screenings to assess a child's health status, identify risks or concerns, and intervene when necess ary. The DC DHCF Associate Director for Children's Health Services and OSSE's Assistant Superintendent for Health and Wellness co -chair the Health and Well- being committee of the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council, which brings together representatives from managed care organizations, OSSE DEL , other District government agencies, early intervention, IDEA Part B, health care providers and early childhood programs to coordinate around outreach, community engagement and coordination to ensu re children access EPSDT benefits. vi. State/territory agency responsible for child welfare. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) OSSE works closely with the District of Columbia Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) o n a number of early childhood initiatives including trainings on child abuse awareness and prevention 27 | P a g e trainings for child development staff. OSSE also partners with CFSA to conduct child protection register checks for current and prospective child developm ent staff. Senior leadership members participate on the interagency steering committee for OSSE's Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership, the Quality Improvement Network (QIN). Through the QIN, OSSE and CFSA coordinate referrals for subsidized child care for children under the care and supervision of CFSA and facilitate processes for linking these children to early intervention services . For children removed from their homes between the ages 0 -4 years, CFSA can provide temporary emergency in -home child ca re services. During this time, CFSA partners with resource parents to review child care needs and provide support in locating a facility to meet the family's needs. Financial support to resource parents is provided by securing an OSSE child care voucher or using CFSA's child subsidy program to help defray child care cost. Additionally, CFSA nurses support developmental screenings for all children involved with CFSA from birth to age five. During the child protective services investigation, social workers and nurses refer infants and children to OSSE via the Health Services Administration. OSSE will contact the caregiver and schedule the screening. When children are separated from their families following an investigation, a developmental screening is con ducted by a Nurse Practitioner in the Healthy Horizons Assessment Center within thirty days. In addition, developmental screenings are performed by community nurses that support in -home families . vii. Provider groups or associations. Describe: OSSE regularly collaborates with District organizations representing child care providers, including the DC Head Start Association (DCHSA), DC Association for the Education of Young Children, DC Family Child Care Association, Directors Exchange, Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association and Washington Association of Child Care Centers. DCHSA and OSSE staff meet multiple times a month and co -host multiple events on an ongoing basis. DCHSA is the voice of diverse Head Start programs (birth to five) that serves as a vehicle to educate and empower families, early learning professionals, business leaders, philanthropies, and elected officials to advocate for high -quality, continuous, and comprehensive early childhood development supports and services to ensure that all children are ready to succeed in school and in life. OSSE meets at least twice a year with members of other provider association groups listed above, and convenes representatives of these associations on an as -needed basis throughout the year to solicit input and feedback on policy and practice questions . viii. Parent groups or organizations. Describe: In accordance with the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ), as the grant administrator 28 | P a g e for the state's EHS- CCP grant, ensures that all parents enrolled in the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), the District's state EHS -CCP program, automatically become members of their center's parent committee, the forum in whi ch parent information is exchange d and learning opportunities are supported. Parents interested in becoming more involved are encouraged to participate on the QIN policy council, with whom the State S uperintendent works in a shared decision - making model. T hrough the policy council, parents develop their leadership skills. The policy council consists of parent representatives from each of the participating QIN centers and five members of the community. The chair, vice -chair and secretary positions that make up the executive members of the policy council are elected annually. OSSE DEL supports and attends the parent -led Interagency Coordinating Council (ICC). The ICC's purpose is to advise and assist the Mayor and OSSE in its role as the lead agency in the d evelopment and implementation of a District -wide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system to provide early intervention services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities. The ICC meets quarterly. OSSE D EL coordinates with and sits on the Thrive by Five Coordinating Council, which includes parent representatives from every ward in the District as well as agency representatives. To demonstrate the District's commitment to maternal health and early child de velopment and education, Mayor Bowser launched Thrive by Five DC , the District's first comprehensive childhood health and early learning initiative. Thrive by Five's mission is to create the best possible start for DC children by connecting families and ca regivers with a community of resources, education, and support that all children need to thrive by five. The Coordinating Council meets quarterly. Parents of children served in the District's mixed delivery system (MDS) for early childhood care and educat ion are also represented on the SECDCC. ix. Other. Describe: 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds, CCDF Matching, and Maintenance -of- Effort Funds Optional Use of Combined Funds: States and territories have the option to combine CCDF funds with any require d program in 1.4.1. These programs include those operating at the federal, state, and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with di sabilities, children experiencing homelessness, and children in foster care (658E(c)(2)(O)(ii)). Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhan ce services for infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and school -age children and families to allow 29 | P a g e for the delivery of comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, state/territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a state/territory may allow a county/local government to use coordinated funding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding so urces to pay for full- day, full- year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start Program Performance Standards or state/territory Prekindergarten requirements in addition to state/territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and CCDF is strongly encouraged by sections 640(g)(1)(D) and (E); 640(h); 641(d)(2)(H)(v); and 642(e)(3) of the Head Start Act in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services. To implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment, or materials, grantees may layer several funding streams so that seamless services are provided (Policy and Program Guidance for the Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships: https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/acf_im_ohs_15_03.pdf ). 1.5.1 Does the Lead Agency choose to combine funding for CCDF services for any programs identified in 1.4.1 (98.14(a)(3))? No (If no, skip to question 1.5.2) Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum: a. How you define \"combine\" The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) defines combining funds as layering funds together from multiple funding streams to expand and/or enhance services for infants, toddlers, pr eschoolers and school -age children and families to allow for the delivery of comprehensive quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, OSSE layers CCDF funding with local pre -K enhancement dollars to ensure that eligible childr en enrolled in pre -k programs receive a full day of care. The pre -K enhancement supplements, not supplants, the CCDF funds. The lead agency also uses CCDF funds to support child care subsidy reimbursements for Quality Improvement Network (QIN) Expansion providers. The Bainum Family Foundation provides funding to the QIN hub that supplements other funding sources for provision of professional development and other supports. b. Which funds you will com bine? CCDF funds and locally appropriated District funds and philanthropic funds c. What is your purpose and expected outcomes for combining funds, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full- day, full- year programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care, or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations ? Note: Responses should align with the goals , processes and results describe in 1.4.1. Pre -K enhancem ent funds cover 6.5 hours of the day and CCDF funds are layered to ensure a full day of care. Using CCDF subsidy funds to pay for child care services at QIN Expansion sites links comprehensive services to children in the subsidized child care program. The comprehensive services promote overall health and social and emotional well- being, through screenings, oral and health exams and mental health 30 | P a g e supports. Philanthropic funds supplement local and federal funds to enhance professional development and other s upports provided to QIN sites, staff, and families. e. How you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the state/territory level, local level, program level? The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) combines multiple sets of funding by layering CCDF and locally appropriated pre - K enhancement funds to ensure a full day of care. CCDF funds are paid directly to QIN expansion providers to support daily child care activities . f. How are the funds tracked and method of oversigh t Funds are tracked using the District's accounting system of record for CC DF and TANF funds, as well as the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Enterprise Grant Management System for funds allocated such as the pre -K enhancement funds . 1.5.2 Which of the following funds does the Lead Agency intend to use to meet the CCDF matching and MOE requirements described in 98.55(e) and 98.55(h)? Check all that apply. Note: Lead Agencies that use Prekindergarten funds to meet matching requirements mus t check Prekindergarten funds and public and/or private funds. Use of PreK for Maintenance of Effort: The CCDF Final Rule clarifies that public PreK funds may also serve as maintenance -of-effort funds as long as the state/territory can describe how it will coordinate PreK and child care services to expand the availability of child care while using public Prekindergarten funds as no more than 20 percent of the state's or territory's maintenance of effort or 30 percent of its matching funds in a single fiscal year (FY) (98.55(h)). If expenditures for PreK services are used to meet the maintenance -of-effort requirement, the state/territory must certify that it has not reduced its level of effort in full-day/full- year child care services (98.55(h)(1); 98.15(a)(6 )). Use of Private Funds for Match or Maintenance of Effort: Donated funds do not need to be under the administrative control of the Lead Agency to qualify as an expenditure for federal match. However, Lead Agencies do need to identify and designate in t he state/territory Plan the donated funds given to public or private entities to implement the CCDF child care program (98.55(f)). a. N/A \u2014The territory is not required to meet CCDF matching and MOE requirements. b. Public funds are used to meet the CCDF matching fund requirement. Public funds may include any general revenue funds, county or other local public funds, state- /territory -specific funds (tobacco tax, lottery), or any other public funds. i. If checked, identify the source of funds: The FY21 locally appropriated child care subsidy budget is sufficient to meet (and in fact substantially exceeds) CCDF matching and MOE requirements . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) does not anticipate any reductions to the locally app ropriated budget in future years. c. Private donated funds are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. Only private funds received by the designated entities or by the Lead Agency may be counted for match purposes (98.53(f)). i. If checked, are tho se funds: 31 | P a g e A. Donated directly to the state? B. Donated to a separate entity(ies) designated to receive private donated funds? ii. If checked, identify the name, address, contact, and type of entities designated to receive private donated funds: d. State expe nditures for PreK programs are used to meet the CCDF matching funds requirement. If checked, provide the estimated percentage of the matching fund requirement that will be met with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 30 percent): i. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the matching fund requirement, describe how the state will coordinate its Prekindergarten and child care services: ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: e. St ate expenditures for Prekindergarten programs are used to meet the CCDF maintenance -of-effort requirements. If checked, i. Assure by describing how the Lead Agency did not reduce its level of effort in full-day/full- year child care services, pursuant to 98.55 (h)(1) and 98.15(a)(6). ii. Describe the Lead Agency efforts to ensure that Prekindergarten programs meet the needs of working parents: iii. Estimated percentage of the MOE Fund requirement that will be met with Prekindergarten expenditures (not to exceed 20 perc ent): . iv. If the percentage is more than 10 percent of the MOE requirement, describe how the state will coordinate its Prekindergarten and child care services to expand the availability of child care: f. The same funds are used to meet at least some of the CCDF MOE and TANF MOE requirements. i. If known, what percent of funds used to meet CCDF MOE also is used to meet TANF MOE requirements? 1.6 Public -Private Partnerships Lead Agencies are required to d escribe how they encourage public -private partnerships among other public agencies, tribal organizations, private entities, faith -based organizations, businesses or organizations that promote business involvement, and/or community -based organizations to le verage existing service delivery (i.e., cooperative agreement among providers to pool resources to pay for shared fixed costs and operation) (658E(c)(2)(P)). ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of the CCDBG Act. Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate how they encourage public -private partnerships to leverage existing child care and early education service - delivery systems and to increase the supply and quality of child care services for children younger than age 13, for example, by implementing voluntary shared service alliance models (98.14(a)(4)). 1.6.1 Identify and describe any public -private partnerships encouraged by the Lead Agency to 32 | P a g e leverage public and private resources to further the g oals of the CCDBG Act. Include in the response any public -private partnerships that have emerged from the response to the COVID -19 pandemic (98.16(d)(2)) and if applicable, how those partnerships will be continued post - pandemic. The District of Columbia has a unique government structure and operates as a state, county, and a city, with the authority of each of these distinct types of government. OSSE, as DC's state education agency, Lead Agency for CCDF and as a part of the DC government, has many partn erships with other DC government agencies (as described in 1.4) and with private organizations to support early care and education providers to promote health and safety of children and staff, provide high -quality early learning and meet families' child care needs by sustaining and growing the early care and education sector. Specific public -private partnership activities include: Supporting Early Care and Education Providers and Quality Improvement Efforts OSSE funds two grantees, CentroNia and Southeast Children's Fund, to provide scholarships and supports through their Child Development Associate (CDA) programs, which are offered in English, Spanish, and Amharic. The grantees also provide scholarship funding to cover the CDA application fee for those wh o obtain the required instructional hours outside of the grantees' programs, including via Quorum. OSSE received funding from the Trust for Learning, a philanthropic foundation, to support the Supporting Equitable Educator Development grant aimed at provid ing training for trainers and a curriculum to integrate anti- bias, anti- racist training into educator training curricula and materials. OSSE partners with the Bainum Family Foundation to improve outcomes for our state's most vulnerable children and their families. Our partnership focuses on improving the quality of child development facilities, authentically engaging families, enhancing the availability and use of data to inform policy and planning and increasing the supply of high -quality infant and toddl er care in wards 7 and 8, the areas of the city with the largest number of low -income children. OSSE and Bainum have been in partnership since 2015. In addition to the above activities, through this partnership OSSE launched a shared services web -based pla tform that is free to all licensed child development providers, conducted a child care supply and demand study, expanded and evaluated the Quality Improvement Network, provided in -depth and targeted technical assistance and training for providers and OSSE' s grantee partners. The OSSE and Bainum partnership also supports early childhood data analysis in OSSE's Division of Assessment and Research (DAR). Through the Early Head Start -Child Care Partnership grant, OSSE established the Quality Improvement Netwo rk (QIN), a public private partnership that leverages two neighborhood - based hubs (United Planning Organization and Easter Seals) t o provide quality services and support to a network of child development centers and homes. This model uses Early Head Start Program Performance Standards to increase the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care offered by private and non -profit child care facilities and homes in the District. To achieve the goal of enhancing young children's school readiness, the QIN site s provide comprehensive services to promote the overall health, development and well -being of infants and toddlers and their families. The hub partners also partner with corporate and philanthropic funders to secure additional resources to support the QIN centers. 33 | P a g e Partnerships in Respon se to the COVID -19 Pandemic The District of Columbia is partnering two community development financial institutions (CDFIs), the Washington Area Community Investment Fund (Wacif) and Low -Income Investment Fund (LIIF), as s ub-grantees to manage emergency relief grants to child care providers, using funds made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ; Coronavirus Response and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Recovery Pl an (see question 4.1.8e) . These partnerships build on successful past partnerships between the District and both CDFIs to support child care access and sustainability in the District, and will enable child care providers to access technical assistance, business training, and other resources and supports available through Wacif and LIIF . Through this and prior work, these CDFIs have built strong relationships with the Lead Agency, other grantees providing business supports to child care providers, one anothe r and the broader child care community that will enable the Lead Agency to continue to pa rtner with Wacif an LIIF to support child car e providers folowing .e the public health emergency (i.e. by disseminating information to child care providers on business supports offered by Wacif's Enterprising Women of Color Center operated in partnership with the Minority Business Development Agency , and sharing information with LIIF to support LI IF's asset -building, emergency recovery and bus iness capacity building acti vities with District child care providers funded through other philanthropic sources). 1.7 Coordination with Child Care Resource and Referral Systems Lead Agencies may use CCDF funds to establish or support a system or network of local or regional child care resource and referral (CCR&R) organizations that is coordinated, to the extent determined by the state/territory, by a statewide public or private non- profit, community -based or regionally based, lead child care resource and referral organization (such as a statewide CCR&R network) (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii); 98.52). If Lead Agencies use CCDF funds for local CCR&R organizations, the local or regional CCR&R organizations supported by those funds must, at the direction of the Lead Agency: Provide parents in the s tate with consumer education information concerning the full range of child care options (including faith -based and community -based child care providers), analyzed by provider, including child care provided during non-traditional hours and through emergenc y child care centers, in their area. To the extent practicable, work directly with families who receive assistance to offer the families support and assistance to make an informed decision about which child care providers they will use to ensure that the families are enrolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting that suits their needs and one that is of high quality (as determined by the Lead Agency). Collect data and provide information on the coordination of services and supports, including services under Part B, Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 34 | P a g e Collect data and provide information on the supply of and demand for child care services in areas of the state and submit the information to the state. Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith - based and community -based child care providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the state and, as appropriate, coordinate their activ ities with the activities of the state Lead Agency and local agencies that administer funds made available through CCDF (98.52(b)). Nothing in the statute or rule prohibits states from using CCR&R agencies to conduct or provide additional services beyond t hose required by statute or rule. Note: Use 1.7.1 to address if a state/territory funds a CCR&R organization, describe what services are provided and how it is structured. Use subsection 7.5 to address the services provided by the local or regional child c are resource and referral agencies and the indicators of progress met by CCR&R organizations if they are funded by quality set -aside funds. 1.7.1 Does the Lead Agency fund local or regional CCR&R organizations? No. The state/territory does not fund a CCR&R organization(s) and has no plans to establish one. Yes. The state/territory funds a CCR&R organization(s) with all the responsibilities outlined above. If yes, describe the following: How are CCR&R services organized? Include how many agencies, if there is a statewide network, and if the system is coordinated: DC Child Care Connections , the child care resource and referral agency for the District, serves the entire geographic area of the state. The community -based organization operating DC Child Care Connecti ons works as part of a consortium with the grantee selected through a competitive grant process in which a panel of experts reviewed applications and selected the application that best fit the needs and context of DC. DC Child Care Connections has two walk -in service centers in easily accessible locations in the District and operates a hotline that parents can call for support in accessing child care, including during the public health emergency . Through their accessibility to the public, DC Child Care Conn ections works to connect local and national with organizations, DC public agencies, other grantees and the community with the services they need. Through their network, DC Child Care Connections offers one -on-one technical assistance to both providers and families. Additionally, DC Child Care Connections has strong working relationships with other District agencies , participates in various meetings and provides feedback on policies and practices based on their knowledge and experience of DC and the needs of the community. DC Child Care Connections caters to families, providers and the public and partners with the Department of Human Services, DC Health, Department of Employment Services, District Ward Advisory Neighborhood Commissions and OSSE's Homeless Ed ucation State Coordinator. This information is provided to families, providers and the general public through community events, parent workshops, collaboration with other family support services and during in -person visits to the DC Child Care Connections service centers. The information is tailored to the audience based on their need s. As the CCR&R, DC Child Care Connections 35 | P a g e participates in the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council and the Child Care Recovery Working Group. 1.8 Disaster Prep aredness and Response Plan In past disasters, and in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, the provision of emergency child care services and rebuilding and restoring of child care infrastructure has emerged as an essential service. Lead Agencies are required to establish a Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan (658E(c)(2)(U)). They must demonstrate how they will address the needs of children \u2014 including the need for safe child care before, during, and after a state of emergency declared by the Governor, or a major disaster or emergency (as defined by Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5122) \u2014 through a Statewide Disaster Plan. The effective date for the establishment of this Statewide Disaster Plan was Octobe r 1, 2018. 1.8.1 Did you make any updates to the Statewide Disaster Plan since the FY 2019- 2021 CCDF Plan was submitted? Please consider any updates that were made as a result of the Lead Agency's experiences in responding to the COVID -19 pandemic. (Note: It is a Lead Agency decision on how often a plan should be updated and which entities, if any, should be collaborated with in the updating process.) No Yes. If yes, describe the elements of the plan that were updated: 1.8.2 To demonstrate continued compliance w ith the required elements in the Statewide Disaster Plan, certify by checking the required elements included in the current State Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan. a. The plan was developed in collaboration with the following required entities : i. State human services agency ii. State emergency management agency iii. State licensing agency iv.

State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care or similar coordinating body b. The plan includes guidelines for the continuation of child care subsidies. c. The plan includes guidelines for the continuation of child care services . d. The plan includes procedures for the coord ination of post -disaster recovery of child care services. e. The plan contains requirements for all CCDF providers (both licensed and license - exempt) to have in place: i. Procedures for evacuation ii. Procedures for relocation 36 | P a g e iii. Procedures for shelter -in-place iv. Procedures for communication and reunification with families v. Procedures for continuity of operations vi. Procedures for accommodations of infants and toddlers vii. Procedures for accommodations of children with disabilities viii. Proced ures for accommodations of children with chronic medical conditions f. The plan contains procedures for staff and volunteer emergency preparedness training. g. The plan contains procedures for staff and volunteer practice drills. 1.8.3 If available , provide the direct URL/website link to the website where the statewide child care disaster plan is posted : https://osse.dc.gov/sites/defaul t/files/dc/sites/osse/service_content/attachments/FY18%20 OSSE%20DEL%20CCDRP.pdf 2 Promote Family Engagement Through Outreach and Consumer Education Lead Agencies are required to support the role of parents as child care consumers who need information to mak e informed choices regarding the services that best suit their needs. A key purpose of the CCDBG Act is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings\" (658A(b)). Lead Agencies have the opp ortunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care consumer education websites . The target audience for the consumer education information includes three groups: parent s receiving CCDF assistance, the general public, and when appropriate, child care providers. OCC expects that Lead Agencies are using targeted strategies for each group to ensure tailored consumer education information. In this section, Lead Agencies will address how information is made available to families, the general public and child care providers to assist them in accessing high -quality child care and how information is shared on other financial assistance programs or supports for which a family might be eligible. In addition, Lead Agencies will certify that information on developmental screenings is provided and will describe how research and best practices concerning children's development, including their social -emotional development, is shared. This section also covers the parental complaint process and the consumer education website that has been developed by the Lead Agency. Finally, this section addresses the consumer statement that is provided to parents supported with CCDF funds. Note: When ask ed for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals, or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 2.1 Outreach to Families with Limited English Proficiency and Persons with Disabili ties The Lead Agency is required to describe how it provides outreach and services to eligible families with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities and to facilitate the 37 | P a g e participation of child care providers with limited English proficie ncy and child care providers with disabilities in the CCDF program (98.16(dd)). Lead Agencies are required to develop policies and procedures to clearly communicate program information, such as requirements, consumer education information, and eligibility information, to families and child care providers of all backgrounds (81 FR 67456). 2.1.1 Check the strategies the Lead Agency or partners utilize to provide outreach and services to eligible families for whom English is not their first language. Check all that apply. a. Application in other languages (application document, brochures, provider notices) b. Informational materials in non -English languages c. Website in non -English languages d. Lead Agency accepts applications at local community -based locations e. Bilingual caseworkers or translators available f. Bilingual outreach workers g. Partnerships with community -based organizations h. Collaboration with Head Start, Early Head Start, and Migrant Head Start i. Home visiting programs j. Other.

Describe: Staff able to support hearing impaired population. Staff certified in American Sign Language (AS L). 38 | P a g e 2.2 Parental Complaint Process The Lead Agency must certify that the state/territory maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints and makes information regarding such complaints available to the public on request (658E(c)(2)(C); 98.15(b)(3)). Lead Agencies must also provide a detailed description of the hotline or similar reporting process for parents to submit complaints about child care providers; the process for substantiating complaints; the manner in which the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints; and ways that the Lead Agency makes information on such parental complaints available to the public on request (98.16 (s); 98.32(d)). 2.2.1 Describe the Lead Agency's hotline or similar reporting process through which par ents can submit complaints about child care providers, including a link if it is a Web -based process : The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) maintains a complaint hotline (202) 727-2993 for parents to report issues with providers. Comp laints can also be emailed to OSSE.ChildcareComplaints@dc.gov or faxed to the Licensing and Compliance Unit (LCU) at (202) 727 -7295 . Information about how to submit a complaint is available on the O SSE website at: https://osse.dc.gov/service/early -learning -complaints -and-unusual -incident - regarding all providers, including CCDF providers and non -CCDF providers, describe the Lead Agency's process and timeline for screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints. Describe whether the process includes monitoring, and highlight any differences in processes for CCDF and n on-CCDF providers and licensed and license - exempt providers : Upon receiving a complaint regarding licensed providers, including CCDF and non CCDF providers, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) reviews the complaint to determine the l evel of severity of the complaint. A Level I complaint is defined as a health or safety violation which requires the assistance of law enforcement, Child Protective Services (CPS) or an immediate OSSE response. A Level II complaint is defined as a health o r safety violation which may pose a serious health risk to children. A Level III complaint is defined as a violation which does not pose a serious or immediate health risk to children. OSSE responds to Level I complaints within 24 hours, Level II Complaint s within two business days and Level III Complaints within three business days of the receipt of the complaint. Depending on the severity of the complaint, OSSE will initiate an investigation to monitor the facility and determine if the complaint is subs tantiated. A substantiated complaint is defined as a situation or incident that has been identified and verified as unsatisfactory or unacceptable based on the current child development facility regulations and/or provider agreements. If OSSE substantiates a complaint, OSSE will issue statement of deficiencies (SOD) or an enforcement action with a corrective action plan. The corrective action plans always include a monitoring component to ensure providers are taking action to comply with licensing regulatio ns. The District uses the same process regarding screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints for CCDF and non -CCDF providers . Upon receiving a complaint regarding an in -home and relative care provider (the District's CCDF license -exempt provi ders), OSSE will review the incident to determine the severity of the complaint. If the complaint rises to the level of child endangerment, the complaint will be 39 | P a g e reported to the Child and Family Services Agency for further investigation. If the complaint does not pose a risk to the health and safety of the child, but a substantiated concern is identified, OSSE will issue a deficiency to the provider and follow up within 30 days to ensure the issue is remediated . Information about substantiated complaints for license -exempt providers is not made available to the public , as these providers are relatives or provide care in the child's own home . 2.2.3 Certify by describing how the Lead Agency maintains a record of substantiated parental complaints. Highlight any di fferences in processes for CCDF and non -CCDF providers and licensed and license -exempt providers: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) maintains a record of all complaints, including parental complaints (both substantiated and unsub stantiated) about licensed child development facilities , including facilities receiving CCD F funding and non -CCDF funded facilities . The District uses the same process regarding screening, substantiating, and responding to complaints for CCDF and non -CCDF providers . These complaints are stored in the licensing database system. Substantiated complaints are filed by date and made available to the public via the Freedom of Information Act request procedure and they are available on the My Child Care DC website. Substantiated complaints records are maintained for a period of three years. OSSE implements a similar process for license -exempt providers : All incoming complaints, including parental com plaints (both substantiated and unsubstan tiated) and recorded, ssigned to the s provider 's electronic file and review by the Education Service Monitor (and supervisor as needed) for specific action/follow -up.. 2.2.4 Certify by describing how the Lead Agency makes information about substantiated pa rental complaints available to the public; this information can include the consumer education website discussed in section 2.3: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) maintains a record of all complaints, including parental complaints (both substantiated and un substantiated) about providers. These complaints are stored in the licensing database system. Substantiated complaints are filed by date and made available to the public via the Freedom of Information Act request procedure and they are available on the My Child Care DC website. OSSE does not automatically share /publish information about substantiated parental complaints for license -exempt providers , as these providers are relatives or provide care in the child's own home . 2.2.5 Provide the citation to the Lead Agency's policy and process related to parental complaints : Per the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Child Care Facility Regulations Section 5A -119 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Title 5, Chapter 5A (5 5A D CMR \u00a7 111.9 OSSE maintain s and make s available to the public by electronic means, a list of all of the Facilities licensed that includes license number, facility name, license type, location, license issue and expiration dates, point of contact, contact in formation , and licensed capacity .

The website must include information to assist families in understanding the Lead Agency's policies and procedures, including licensing child care providers. The website information must also include monitoring and inspection reports for each provider, and the quality of each provider (if such information is available for the provider) (658E(c)(2)(D); 98.33(a)). The website should also provide access to a yearly statewide report on the aggregate number of deaths, serious injuries, and the number of cases of substantiat ed child abuse that have occurred in child care settings. To help families access additional information on finding child care, the website must include contact information for local child care and resource referral organizations. It must also include info rmation on how parents can contact the Lead Agency and other organizations to better understand the information on the website. To certify, respond to questions 2.3.1 through 2.3.10 by describing how the Lead Agency meets these requirements and provide the direct URL/website link to the consumer education website in 2.3.11.

(Note: While there is no Federal CCDF definition for easily accessible, Lead Agencies may consider easily accessible websites to be searchable, simple to navigate, written in plain language, a nd easy to understand.): My Child Care DC is a consumer- friendly website that helps families find and compare child care options ( http://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/ ). My Child Care DC allo ws families to search center -based and home -based licensed child development providers by distance from a particular address or zip code . Consumers can filter options by operating hours, type of facility, age range of children served and quality improvemen t ratings. The website also specifies which child development providers accept child care subsidies and participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The website includes a detailed, easy -to-read provider profile that provides inspection re ports, capacity, licensing information, accreditation and substantiated complaints. My Child Care DC is easily accessible from the OSSE, DC Child Care Connections and the Thrive by Five websites and is accessible from mobile devices . To ensure that the My Child Care DC website is consumer- friendly and easily accessible, OSSE engaged focus groups of parents to test the design and navigation of the site prior to launching. Furthermore, OSSE conducted a full self- assessment of the My Child Care DC website, b ased on the State and Territory Child Care Consumer Education Websites: Self -Assessment Checklist from the Administration for Child and Families (ACF). OSSE continues to monitor the usability of the website and identify needed enhancements to ensure it rem ains consumer friendly and easily accessible . 41 | P a g e 2.3.2 Describe how the website ensures the widest possible access to services for families that speak languages other than English (98.33(a)): Effective Sept. 30, 2018, My Child Care DC became available in all languages outlined in Chapter 12 (Language Access Act) of Title 4 (Human Rights and Relations) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR). Additionally, families that speak languages other than English can access the website by calling (202) 8 29-2500 to receive free interpreter assistance.

Link to the list of those exempted from licensing: https://osse.dc.gov/service/licensing- and-compliance The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) exempts certain types of providers from licensing requirements . The categories of exempted providers were established through the Titl e 5 Section 101 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, which outlines the applicability of the licensing regulations. The regulations apply to a \"child development facility ,\" which is defined as \"one that provides care and other services for ch ildren on a regular basis by identifying additional entities that do not meet the definition, including an informal or occasional parent -supervised play group.\" Exempted providers do not provide the level of service or activities that are governed through the licensing regulations (such as informal or occasional parent -supervised play groups) and are therefore exempted from the licensing requirements. Additionally, certain exempted providers must comply with other District of Columbia laws and regulations. b. Provide the direct URL/website link to the processes for conducting monitoring and inspections of child care providers, as described in subsection 5.4: https://osse.dc.gov/node/1192316 c.

Describe: 2.3.7 Lead Agencies must post monitoring and inspection reports on the consumer education 45 | P a g e website for each licensed provider and for each non -relative provider eligible to provide CCDF services. These reports must in clude the results of required annual monitoring visits, and visits due to major substantiated complaints about a provider's failure to comply with health and safety requirements and child care policies. A full report covers everything in the monitoring visit, including areas of compliance and non -compliance. If the state does not produce any reports that include areas of compliance, the website must include information about all areas covered by a monitoring visit (e.g., by posting a blank checklist used by monitors). The reports must be in plain language or provide a plain language summary, as defined by the state or territory, and be timely to ensure that the results of the reports are available and easily understood by parents when they are deciding on a child care provider. Lead Agencies must post at least 3 years of reports. Certify by responding to the questions below : a. Does the Lead Agency post? (check one): X i. Full monitoring reports that include areas of compliance and non-complianc e. ii. Monitoring reports that include areas of non -compliance only, with information about all areas covered by a monitoring visit posted separately on the website (e.g., a blank checklist used by monitors). Note: This option is only allowable if the state/territory does not produce monitoring reports that include both areas of compliance and non -compliance. If checked, provide a direct URL/website link to the website where a blank checklist is posted. Click or tap here to enter text. b. Check to certify that the monitoring and inspection reports and, if necessary, their plain language summaries include: X Date of inspection X Health and safety violations, including those violations that resulted in fatalities or serious injuries occurring at the provider. Describe how these health and safety violations are prominently displayed: The health and safety violations and substantiated complaints are included in the provider profile along with the monitoring and inspection reports. These are all available through our consumer -friendly website, My Child Care DC. X Corrective action plans taken by the state and/or child care provider. Describe: The corrective actions taken by the child development facility are available and listed on the inspection and monitor ing reports located at the bottom of each downloadable provider profile (from the My Child Care DC website). The information listed includes the deficiency type, deficiency date, deficiency code, status, corrective actions taken and date abated. X A min imum of three years of results, where available. c. How and where are reports posted in a timely manner? Specifically, provide the Lead Agency's definition of \"timely\" and describe how it ensures that reports and/or summaries are posted within its timeframe. Note: While Lead Agencies may define \"timely,\" we 46 | P a g e recommend Lead Agencies update results as soon as possible and no later than 90 days after an inspection or corrective action is taken. Provide the direct URL/website link to where the reports are posted. This is a sample: https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/MychildCare/FacilityProfile?FacilityId=219 3 i. Describe how the Lead Agency defines timely posting of monitoring reports. Reports are posted upon final completion of the monitoring and inspection, including the resolution of all appeals. The timeframe is approximately 30 days from the inspection completion date. d. Monitoring and inspection reports or t he summaries must be in plain language to meet the CCDF regulatory requirements (98.33 (a)(4)). i. Provide the Lead Agency's definition of plain language. OSSE's definition of plain language is language that is focused on the end user with words, references, and phrases that are commonly used. Documents are written in active voice, include short, easy to understand sentences, and are presented in a simple, straightforward and consistent manner. ii. Describe how the monitoring and inspection reports or the summa ries are in plain language. The monitoring and inspection reports include a plain language summary and are available on the My Child Care DC website. The monitoring and inspection process is described on the OSSE website: https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/Monitoring%20an d%20Inspection%20Process.pdf . In posting monitoring an d inspection results on the My Child Care DC website , OSSE considered literacy levels, languages, alternative communication abilities and mobile phone usability. Parents and the public may use the My Child Care DC website to contact the OSSE Communication Team at OSSE.Communication@dc.gov to inquire about reports. e. Describe the process for correcting inaccuracies in reports (98.33 (a)(4)). The licensing program manager or director reviews each inspection report for accuracy, completeness, comprehensiveness and consistency. All inaccuracies identified are immediately flagged and corrected. The provider is notified of any inaccuracies identified and a corrected statement of deficiency ( SOD ) is issued to the provider. The provider is given a detailed explanation of the inaccuracy and acknowledges receipt and agreement with the corrected SOD. The licensing database is corrected to reflect the changes on the corrected SOD. For license exempt relative and in -home care providers, the Education Services program manager reviews each inspection report for accuracy, completeness, comprehensiveness and consistency. All inaccuracies identified are immediately flagged and corrected. The provider is 47 | P a g e notified of any inacc uracies identified and a corrected SOD is issued to the provider. The provider is given a detailed explanation of the inaccuracy and acknowledges receipt and agreement with the corrected SOD. The provider database is corrected to reflect the changes on the corrected SOD. f. Describe the process for providers to appeal the findings in reports. Description of the process should include the time requirements and timeframes for: filing the appeal conducting the investigation removal of any violations from the web site determined on appeal to be unfounded. Providers have the right to dispute the monitoring and inspection report in writing to the director of licensing and request a review of the inspection report. The request must be made within five days of the in spection completion date. If the provider disagrees with the non - compliance citation, they can refuse to sign the SOD and state their disagreement with the report or portions of the report on the provider acknowledgement form. They can also attach document ation to support their objection to and/or disagreement with the report. The program manager reviews the appeal and the documentation presented and forwards the appeal and all relevant inspection documents to the director of licensing for review. The direc tor of licensing reviews the appeal and inspection documents, interviews the provider, licensing specialist and program manager as needed, consults with the Office of the State Superintendent of Education's Office of the General Counsel and makes a determi nation to allow or disallow the appeal. The decision is communicated in writing to the provider with 15 days of the appeal filing. If the provider is not satisfied with the determination of the director of licensing, they can further request a final review within five days of the appeal decision to the Assistant Superintendent for Early Learning, whose decision is considered final. If the provider's appeal is upheld, the applicable non -compliant citation(s) are removed from the licensing record by the lice nsing specialist, approved by the licensing program manager in the system and the system automatically removes the deficiency from the inspection report on the website. g. Describe the process for maintaining monitoring and inspection reports on the websit e. Specifically, provide the minimum number of years reports are posted and the policy for removing reports (98.33(a)(4)(iv)). The licensing monitor reviews and submits the monitoring reports to the licensing supervisor for approval. The licensing supervi sor reviews and submits the reports to the director of licensing for approval. The director of licensing reviews and approves the report for website posting. The monitoring reports are posted for a minimum of three years and will be removed after that time line. 2.3.8 Aggregate data on serious injuries, deaths, and substantiated cases of child abuse that have occurred in child care settings each year must be posted by Lead Agencies on the consumer education website (98.33(a)(5)). The serious incident aggregate dat a should include information about any child in the care of a provider eligible to receive CCDF, not just children receiving subsidies. This aggregate information on serious injuries and deaths must be separated by category of care (e.g. centers, family ch ild care homes, and in -home care) and licensing status (i.e. licensed or license -exempt) for all eligible CCDF providers in the state. The information on instances of substantiated child abuse does not have to be organized by category of care 48 | P a g e or licensing status. Information should also include the total number of children regulated to be cared for by provider type and licensing status (81 FR, p. 67477), so that families can view the serious injuries , deaths, and substantiated cases of abuse data in context . The aggregate report should not include individual provider -specific information or names. a. Certify by providing: i. The designated entity to which child care providers must submit reports of any serious injuries or deaths of children occurring in child care (98.16 (ff)) and describe how the Lead Agency obtains the aggregate data from the entity. A Licensee shall immediately notify OSSE of any unusual incident that may adversely affect the health, safety, or welfare of any enrolled child or children by subm itting a completed OSSE Unusual Incident Report form to OSSE's Child Care Complaint email address OSSE.childcarecomplaints@dc.gov . A Licensee shall also provide a copy of the completed Unusual Incide nt Report form provided to OSSE to the parent(s) or guardian(s) of each child affected by the unusual incident. Unusual incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following: a) Death of a person occurring at the Facility; b) Injury to, or illness of, any child that occurs during the hours the child is enrolled in care and that requires hospitalization or emergency medical treatment; c) Damage to the Facility or to any Facility vehicle or equipment that interferes with the capability of the Facility to protect the health, safety and welfare of the children and adults at the Facility; d) Outbreak of or a single occurrence of a communicable disease at the Facility that is required to be reported to the District of Columbia Department of Health in accordance wit h Title 22 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations ; e) Unauthorized departure of an enrolled child or any circumstances under which a child is deemed unaccounted for or missing; f) Any traffic accident involving a vehicle rented, owned, maintained, or the use of which was contracted for by the Facility and in which children are being transported at the time of the accident; g) Any adverse or negative action the Facility takes against an employee, volunteer, or household member related to any substantiated crime against a child; or h) Any other incident at the Facility that involves a response by emergency service personnel, such as police, fire, ambulance, or poison control. 81 128.4 In the case of a traffic accident or an incident involving perceived or actu al criminal activity, the Licensee shall also file a report with the appropriate law enforcement authorities. License -exempt providers shall immediately notify OSSE, via email to the assigned Education Services Monitor (ESM), of any unusual incident that may adversely affect 49 | P a g e the health, safety or welfare of any child in the home by submitting a completed OSSE Unusual Incident Report. A copy of the completed incident report will be provided to the parent(s) or guardian(s) of each child affected by the unu sual incident. If the incident indicates that the health, welfare or safety of the child is at risk, the District's Child and Family S ervice Agency (CFSA) is contacted to initiate an investigation. If the incident indicates that there are environmental concerns present, an in -person visit is conducted by the assigned ESM to assess health and safety risk. If risk can be remediated without jeopardizing the safety of the child, a deficiency will be issued by the assigned ESM as part of a detailed report th at outlines the concern and timeline for correction. If the issue described in the complaint poses an imminent risk to the health and safety of the child, services will be suspended until further notice. Services will resume once the identified concern h as been completely remediated. ii. The definition of \"substantiated child abuse\" used by the Lead Agency for this requirement. The definition of \"serious injury\" used by the Lead Agency for this requirement. The term \"physical injury\" means bodily harm great er than transient pain or minor temporary marks. The term \"mental injury\" means harm to a child's psychological or Intellectual functioning, which may be exhibited by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal or outwardly aggressive behavior, or a combination of those behaviors and which may be demonstrated by a change in behavior, emotional response or cognition. The term \"abused\" when used with reference to a child means, \"infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child.\" OSSE partners with the Distr ict of Columbia's Child and Family Services Administration (CFSA). CFSA is the lead agency on substantiating alleged c hild abuse and neglect. CFSA collects multiple types of evidence before making their determinations. The term \"serious injury\" is any injury that requires medical attention. b. Certify by checking below that the required elements are included in the Aggregate Data Report on serious incident data that have occurred in child care settings each year. X i. the total number of serious injuries of children in care by provider category/licensing status X ii. the total number of deaths of children in care by provider category/licensing status X. iii. the total number of substantiated instances of child abuse in child care settings X. iv. the tota l number of children in care by provider category/licensing status c.

The description should include: what information is provided how the information is provided how the information is tailored to a variety of audiences, including: parents providers 55 | P a g e the general public any partners in providing this information Description: Information for families and providers on health, development, early care and education can be found on the Thrive by Five DC website ( https://thrivebyfive.dc .gov/ ) , a one -stop resource center to help District families and child care providers navigate the city's wide range of early health and learning resources. Thrive by Five is a city -wide initiative acknowledging that learning begins at birth, every day c ounts and investments in early childhood education are essentia l. DC Child Care Connections also shares research , information and links to local and national resources on child development with parents, providers and the general public through their websi te and in -person trainings. Additionally, Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) develops print and electronic information that is shared with parents and the general public at community events and online. as well as health and wellness gu idelines for providers and supports for families through the Healthy Tots Act (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/Healthy%20 To ts%20Wellness%20Guidelines.pdf ). OSSE shares information w ith child care providers on research and best practices concerning children's development and successful parent and family engagement through ongoing in - person and online professional development through the Professional Development Information System (PDI S - https://dcpdis.org/) and Quorum (https://www.quorumlearning.com/) (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/Professional%2 0 Development%20Course%20Offerings.pdf ); monthly communities of practice (COPs) and webinars for the child development providers participating in Capital Quality (https://osse.dc.gov/node/1242691 ); and Quality Improvement Network (QIN) meetings for providers and parents participating in the QIN . The trainings are tailored to meet the specific needs of the audience. For example, some CoPs are offered on weekends to accommodate the schedule of the home providers. Some trainings (e.g., Classroom Assessment Scoring System trainings) are offered at different levels (basic, intermediate and advanced ) to meet the various levels of understanding of the audience. The professional development opportunities are offered by different partners including OSSE grantees and other District agencies. OSSE also hosts an annual early childhood education conference for profession als which includes focused workshops on social and emotional development, family engagement, physical health and development and early childhood development. The Quality Improvement Network (QIN) also provides family engagement specialists who work with p roviders, parents and families to identify supports needed and connect families to services. OSSE uses the Early Development Instrument (EDI) to collect and share information about children's development and school readiness outcomes at a neighborhood and city -wide level. EDI is an internationally recognized, holistic tool that assesses children's readiness in five domains: physical health and well -being, language and cognitive development, social competence, emotional maturity and communication skills and general knowledge. The EDI 56 | P a g e includes analysis on the Neighborhood Risk Index (NRI), composite measurement of ten indicators of neighborhood level risk which can be associated with higher levels of developmental vulnerability in children. Combined, the EDI and the NRI, enable OSSE and community, education, and DC. government partners to analyze patterns of risk across neighborhoods and identify areas where children, families, and communities may need additional resources and supports. OSSE partners with community -based organizations (CBOs), local education agencies and the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities to administer and conduct data analysis for the EDI initiative. Each DC public school, public charter school and CBO that participates in the EDI data collection receives a \"school report\" presenting results on levels of vulnerability on children. This tailored information supports school and CBO leaders in: (1) understanding the physical and social- emotional health of the site's pre -Kindergarten student population; (2) examining current services and supports that are available for students; and (3) identifying gaps in supports and services. Schools and CBOs share this information in a variet y of forms. OSSE uses a variety of forms to disseminate EDI information: The State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) reviews the EDI through a powerpoint presentation and the EDI maps. The maps presents EDI across various geographic areas (including wards and neighborhood clusters) Leaders in other DC government agencies review EDI data from the District's data collection and reports/updates on EDI implementation in other jurisdictions and countries. OSSE creates one page overviews of the EDI to share with parent leaders and work with these leaders to develop EDI packets that are then shared in the parent's local child development facility, community group or other entities. 2.4.4 Describe how information on the Lead Agency's policies regarding the social- emotional and behavioral issues and mental health of young children, including positive behavioral intervention and support models based on research and best practices for those from birth to school age, are shared with families, prov iders, and the general public. At a minimum, include what information is provided, how the information is provided, and how information is tailored to a variety of audiences, and include any partners in providing this information. Description : Information on the Lead Agency's policies and expectations regarding social -emotional and behavioral issues and early childhood mental health of children is shared with families, providers and the general public in various ways. The DCMR 5 -A, Chapter 1 licensing regulations indicate that child development staff must complete annual professional development that: (1) incorporates the knowledge and application of the District's early 57 | P a g e learning and developmental guidelines; (2) p romotes the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of children; and (3) i mproves the knowledge and skills of directors, teachers and caregivers in working with children and their families. Additionally, OSSE provides child development facilities and early educators with training on social- emotional development, evidence- based behavior supports, and mental health through both in -person and online modalities, including trainings such as : Building a Solid Foundation: Strategies for Promoting Social -Emotional Development in Young Childr en; Promoting Healthy Social - Emotional Development through Nurturing and Responsive Relationships ; How to Administer the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Third Edition (ASQ -3); and How to Administer the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social Emotional (ASQ: SE). DC Child Care Connections partners with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) and links families, providers and the general public to programs and services related to social- emotional and behavioral health. Through the DBH , families may also acces s mental health information and consultation services. The DBH provides child and family services, assessments of children for identification of services, family - centered mental health services, early intervention programs and emergency services. The Depar tment of Behavior al Health's Healthy Futures program provides onsite training and technical assistance to early childhood educators and families to support individual children's needs using an evidence -based early childhood mental health consultation model . Additionally, OSSE partners with organizations and advocacy groups, such as the Bainum Family Foundation, DC Association for the Education of Young Children and others to widely distribute information about children's social- emotional development and men tal health resources to early educators, child development facilities, and families by participat ing in fairs, open houses and information sessions for families. 2.4.5 Describe the Lead Agency's policies to prevent the suspension and expulsion of children from birth to age 5 in child care and other early childhood programs receiving CCDF funds (98.16(ee)), including how those policies are shared with families, providers, and the general public. On May 6, 2015, the District of Columbia approved the Pre -K Stude nt Discipline Amendment Act of 2015, published in http://lims.dccouncil.us/Download/33194/B21 -0001 -SignedAct.pdf for families, providers and the general public. The legislation prohibits the suspension or expulsion of a student of pre -Kindergarten age from any publicly funded pre -Kindergarten program, including those operated by local education agencies and community -based organizations, unless a school administrator determine s that the student has willfully caused or attempted to cause bodily injury or threatened serious bodily injury to another person, excluding self -defense. Suspensions must not exceed longer than three days for any individual incident. The legislation esta blishes annual reporting requirements for each local education agency on suspensions and expulsions data for all grades . In addition , the Office of State Superintendent of Education (OSSE)'s Child Development Facility Regulation s require that a licensee shall use positive methods of child guidance that meet the individual needs of each child and encourage self -control, self- direction, self- esteem and cooperation (5A DCMR \u00a7 141), and requires providers to maintain and provide to OSSE, upon request, for eac h enrolled children, a record of any suspensions or expulsions (5A DCMR \u00a7 130.7). OSSE collects discipline data through a Discipline Data Collection Template and uses this information to publish an annual report to the DC Council on all disciplinary incid ents and actions that occurred in the prior school year. The annual report is widely distributed to OSSE's child development centers, homes, local education agencies and other stakeholders, and training 58 | P a g e and professional development is developed to support child development centers to comply with the requirements for preventing suspensions and expulsions. OSSE also published a Pre -K Discipline Practices Guide that describes the District requirements on and supports for the prevention of suspension and expuls ions. Child development facilities can use the guide when working with families on issues related to preventing suspensions and expulsions. Additionally, DC Child Care Connections the District's child care resource and referral agency , includes the discip line guide as a resource for centers and families . The District also published a family resource document (available through the District's consumer education website) with information related to preventing suspensions and ex pulsions and promoting positive behavior management. Providers participating in the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) and the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion program receive the support of mental health consultants through a partnership with the Department of Behavioral Health's Healt hy Futures program. All providers participating in Capital Quality, DC's redesigned Quality Rating and Improvement System, also receive the support of a quality facilitator who works one -on-one with center directors and child development home caregivers to provide support and connect them to needed resources. In Fall 2020, OSSE applied to and was awarded a grant, Supporting Equitable Educator Development (SEED) through the Trust for Learning, to ensure the District's early educator workforce has access to meaningful training and resources that aid in developing culturally responsive learning environments for young children and their families. Using a train -the-trainer approach, this project aims to ensure early educators in DC have the requisite skills, kn owledge and appreciation of diversity to create culturally responsive ideal learning environments for all children and families in DC Additionally, 2.5 Procedures for Providing Information on Developmental Screenings Lead Agencies are required to provide inf ormation on developmental screenings t o parents, the general public and, when applicable, child care providers. Information should include: Existing resources and services that the state can use in conducting developmental screenings and providing referrals to services for children who receive child care assistance. Lead Agencies must also include a description of how a family or child care provider can use these resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for children who receive subsidies an d who might be at risk of cognitive or other developmental delays, which can include social, emotional, physical, or linguistic delays (658E(c)(2)(E)(ii)). This information about the resources can include the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and T reatment program under the Medicaid program carried out under title XIX of the Social Security Act and developmental screening services available under IDEA Part B, Section 619 and Part C, in conducting those developmental screenings and in providing referrals to services for children who receive subsidies. Lead Agencies are required to provide this information to eligible families during CCDF intake and to child care providers through training and education (98.33(c)). Information on developmental screenin gs, as other consumer education information, should be accessible for individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with disabilities . 59 | P a g e 2.5.1 Certify by describing: a. How the Lead Agency collects and disseminates information on existing resources and services available for conducting developmental screenings to CCDF parents, the general public, and where applicable, child care providers(98.15(b)(3)). Strong Start, the District of Columbia's Early Intervention Program (DC EIP) , is administered through OSSE and serves as the single point of entry for infants and toddlers whose families or others have concerns about their development. Strong Start provides services through program staff and approved contractors. Strong Start collaborates with child devel opment facilities on an ongoing basis to provide training for child development facility staff on how to conduct, implement and utilize the Ages and Stages Questionnaire - 3 (ASQ -3) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire - Social Emotional (ASQ: SE -2) develop mental screenings with the children they care for. After each child development center training, center directors, teachers and home providers are asked if they would like to schedule an official screening event for their facility in the future where Child Find staff will assist in conducting developmental screenings. Child Find staff also participate in the ongoing expansion the ASQ Online Developmental Screening Database , supporting 16 pilot child development facilities within the Quality Improvement Netw ork to use ASQ . Strong Start has made developmental screening information and trainings available at both CCR&R locations, as well as in the Professional Development Information System (PDIS) for child development facilities. Strong Start provides bi- mon thly developmental screening/ early intervention referral training on the PDIS platform accessible by all licensed child development facilities in the district. In addition, Strong Start offers a developmental screening parent workshop that has been used wi th parent networking groups, family success centers, DC Public Library staff development groups, and other community -based organizations. At all outreach events, Strong Start provides a sign -in sheet that is used to follow up and reach out to families who are interested in developmental screening information. Strong Start has an informal developmental screening request process established with the District's Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA), where the Child Find staff receive direct requests for scr eenings from the Child Protective Services unit within CFSA. Children ages 2 years and eight months to 5 years and 10 months who are not enrolled in a DCPS or public charter school receive screening and evaluations through Early Stages, operated by the Di strict of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). Information on how to submit a referral for a 3 - to 5-year- old child not currently enrolled in school is available at http://www.earlystagesdc.org/ . Once a referral is received, an Ages and Stages Questionnaire (A SQ-3) will be completed and, if necessary, the family will be scheduled for an appointment to bring the child in for an evaluation and eligibility determination. If the child is found eligible for services, an Individualized Education P rogram (IEP) is deve loped and the child receives an appropriate placement in a DC Public School (DCPS). For child ren enroll ed in DCPS or public charter schools, a referral is made to the special education coordinator, who arranges for the child to receive an evaluation and el igibility determination. b. The procedures for providing information on and referring families and child care providers to the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program under the Medicaid program \u2014carried out under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) \u2014and developmental screening services available under Part B, Section 619 and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1419, 1431 et seq.). The DC Department of Health Care Finance (DC DHCF) is the state agency responsible for 60 | P a g e the administration of the Medicaid program. The Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services benefit constitutes the child health component of the Medicaid program. The benefit includes all ne cessary health care services covered under federal Medicaid law to identify and then correct or ameliorate any defects or chronic conditions found in beneficiaries under the age of 21. Families are provided information regarding developmental screenings at various intake sites across the District and on the district websites. Strong Start, DC's Early Intervention Program (DC EIP) (children under 2 years, 10.5 months) follows the following procedures: Step 1: Referral - Parent or other referral source suspec ts child may have developmental delay or disability; The Strong Start program contacts parent, provides information and assigns a service coordinator (SC); the SC provides information about Strong Start, informs the family of their rights and refers family to an evaluation site; and parental consent is obtained to share the referral with an approved evaluation site and managed care organization (MCO), if applicable. Step 2: Determine eligibility - Determine eligibility using the Battelle Developmental Inven tory, Second Edition (BDI -2); Eligibility: 25 percent delay in at least one developmental area or a diagnosed condition; and conduct optional family assessment plan and gather information for Individualized Family Services Plan (IFSP). Step 3: Planning Me eting - If the child is eligible, family identifies desired outcomes, IFSP team specifies early intervention services and develops written plan; \u00b7 If child is ineligible: Family receives a thorough explanation of the evaluation results and reasons for ineligibility and provide family with strategies and access to other therapy through their insurer or other community resources. Step 4: Implement Services - the IFSP will identify the services that best support families to be able to help their child particip ate in everyday routines. Services might include assistive technology devices and services, audiology, vision services, family training, counseling, home visits and parent support groups, medical services only for diagnostic or evaluation purpose, nursing services, health services, occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychological services, service coordination, social work services, specialized instruction, speech -language pathology, transportation and related costs. Children ages 2 years and eight mon ths to 5 years and 10 months receive screening and evaluations through Early Stages, operated by the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS). Information on how to submit a referral for a 3- to 5-year- old child not currently enrolled in school is available at http://www.earlystagesdc.org/ . Once a referral is received, an Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ -3) will be completed and, if necessary, the family will be scheduled for an appointment to bring the chi ld in for an evaluation and eligibility determination. If the child is found eligible for services, an Individualized Education P rogram (IEP) is developed and the child receives an appropriate placement in a DC Public School (DCPS). For child ren enrolled in a DCPS or public charter school, a referral is made to the special education coordinator, who arranges for the child to receive an evaluation and eligibility determination. Children with developmental delays prior to age three who are determined eligible for preschool special education and who have a current IFSP may choose the Extended IFSP option and continue to receive Part C services until the first day of school following the child's fourth birthday. In addition to the information provided at the spe cific sites above, a brochure describing Part C and Part B services is available on OSSE's website: https://osse.dc.gov /sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/Comprehen sive%20Child%20Find%20Brochure.pdf . c. How the Lead Agency gives information on developmental screenings to parents 61 | P a g e receiving a subsidy as part of the intake process. Include the informati on provided, ways it is provided, and any partners in this work. Families are provided information on developmental screenings at various sites across the District during the intake process. The Department of Human Services eligibility staff and Level II providers provide the consumer education statement that includes information on Strong Start, the District of Columbia's Early Intervention Program (DC EIP). The statement also includes information on promoting positive behavior to foster children's social and emotional growth. d. How CCDF families or child care providers receiving CCDF can use the available resources and services to obtain developmental screenings for CCDF children at risk for cognitive or other developmental delays. Anyone, including pare nts, guardians, family members, friends, physicians and child care staff can call the DC EIP Child Find Hotline at (202) 727 -3665 for information about eligibility and how to make a referral. Once a referral is made, the family is contacted by a service co ordinator who arranges for an evaluation and assessment of the child and family to determine eligibility for early intervention services. Additionally, families receive resources and services for children at risk for cognitive or other development delays through the District of Columbia Public School Early Stages program. Early Stages also provides the following related services free of charge (1) training in how to conduct developmental screening and how to establish a developmental screening program for any child development center interested in making screening a routine part of their program and (2) parent workshops presented in partnership with child development centers to raise parent awareness of the importance of early intervention and other child development topics. e. How child care providers receive this information through training and professional development. Strong Start, DC's Early Intervention Program , is an OSSE approved training entity that provides professional learning units for early childhood educators in DC on a variety of topics related to early intervention (EI), developmental screenings and EI referrals. In addition, Strong Start has developed and offered a variety of trainings/workshops to increase public awareness of specific t opics related to developmental screenings, the early intervention referral process and other inclusion -based early intervention topics. Monthly and Bi -Monthly trainings are offered and documented in collaboration with DC Child Care Connections ( DC CCC), th e District's child care resource and referral agency , in order to increase child development facilities' and community -based organizations' professional development, build public awareness and enhance communication between providers and families about deve lopmental concerns . Strong Start Child Find staff continue to assist in providing ongoing expansion training to child development facilities participating in the ASQ Online Developmental Screening Database initiative.

Describe: The lead agency monitors a random selection of 25 percent of all eligibility records from the Department of Human Services, Child Care Services Division. The lead agency also monitors Level II child care providers who conduct eligibility determination on behalf of the lead agency for their sites. A percentage of eligibility records to be reviewed is determined by the total number of families whose children are enrolled in subsidy for the site. The criteria are: 1 to 30 family case records - all records will be reviewed; 31 to 100 family case records - 50 percent (randomly selected) will be reviewed; and More than 100 family case records - 30 percent (randomly selected) will be reviewed. d. None 3.1.10 Informing parents who receive TANF benefit s about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirement. Lead Agencies are required to inform parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the work requirement for any single custodial parent who has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care for a child younger than age 6 (98.16(v); 98.33(f)). Lead Agencies must coordinate with TANF programs to ensure that TANF families with young children will be informed of their right not to be sanctioned if they meet the criteria set forth by the state/territory TANF agency in accordance with Section 407(e)(2) of the Social Security Act. In fulfilling this requirement, the following criteria or definitions are applied by t he TANF agency to determine whether the parent has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care. Note: The TANF agency, not the CCDF Lead Agency, is responsible for establishing the following criteria or definitions. These criteria or definitions are offered in this Plan as a matter of public record. a. Identify the TANF agency that established these criteria or definitions: DC Department of Human Services (DHS) b. Provide the following definitions established by the TANF agency: i. \"Appropriate child care\": Child care must meet parents' needs in terms of hours and location. The child care center or family child care provider must be licensed. An in - home or relative provider is exempt from licensing; however, s/he must meet the minimum requirements incorporat ed in the child care provider's agreement. The basic needs of the children must be met. These needs include: safety, developmental, social, cultural, and health. ii. \"Reasonable distance\": Reasonable distance is defined as travel time it takes for a resident o f the District of Columbia to drop off his/her child at a child care facility and arrive on time at work. This travel time should not exceed one and one- half hours from home to work. For District of Columbia residents who work outside the city in Maryland or Virginia, the travel time is defined as the time it takes to drop off the 79 | P a g e children at the child care facility and arrive on time to work. This travel time should not exceed two hours from home to work. iii. \"Unsuitability of informal child care\": Unsuitable Informal Child Care is care that is not licensed or is licensed - exempt under the Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services or does not meet the programmatic criteria as included in the executed Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Ser vices with the Office of State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). Informal Child Care is defined as care provided by a relative or in -home providers who are selected by the parents. Such providers must have an official provider agreement with the parent a nd a provider agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services with OSSE, along with current health certificates for themselves and the children in their care. iv. \"Affordable child care arrangements\": Affordable child care arrangements are terms of agreement betw een the parents and the provider that meet the needs of the parents and the children by using the c hild care subsidy with the providers in the District of Columbia. Parents can obtain care for their children using the available subsidy, as long as they are participating with the District of Columbia's extensive provider subsidy system, which includes all categories of care (infants, preschoolers, school- age) in all wards. c.

In addition to income and the size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co -payments. Lead Agencies, however, may NOT use cost of care or amount of subsidy payment in determining co - payme nts (98.45(k)(2)). Questions 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 address co -payments during the initial/entry -eligibility period. To help families transition off child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co-pay amounts for families determined to be eligible under a graduated phase -out.

Cod e \u00a7 4 -401 et seq. The copay requirements and exemptions are set forth in Section 400.1 of OSSE's Eligibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual and 5 -A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 204.2 and 204.3 b. Families who are receiving or needing to receive protec tive services on a case - by- case basis, as determined by the Lead Agency fo r purposes of CCDF eligibility. Describe the policy and provide the policy citation. In addition to the other requirements set forth in 5 -A DCMR\u00a7 201, in order to be eligible for s ubsidized child care in DC, a child shall, at the time of eligibility determination or redetermination meet the requirements for one of the following categories of need: (1) Resides with parent(s) who are working or attending a job training or education pr ogram; (2) Resides with parent(s) who is seeking employment or engaging in job search; or (3) Receives, or need to receive, protective services or is considered a vulnerable child, as defined herein. Protective Services is specifically defined as pare nt(s) or guardian(s) of children who are under the active supervision of CFSA Child Protective Services division or under the active supervision of the Family Division of the DC Superior Court due to abuse or neglect. The child may be living in the natural parent's home or with a third party. Children eligible for subsidized child care pursuant to this subsection are waived of the following eligibility requirements: (1) Participate in a qualifying activity (e.g. training or employment); (2) Income threshold requirements in Section 200.7. The eligibility staff shall not calculate income to determine eligibility or co -payment. Section 200.6 Eligibility Requirement (3) Children under Protective Services . The District of Columbia Mayor's Order 2009 -3, dated Jan. 15, 2009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE as the lead agency for CCDF and delegated the authority of the Mayor to administer the District law that governs subsidized child care, D.C.

Families meeting other criteria established by the Lead Agency. Describe the policy. 3.2.5 Policies and processes for graduated p hase -out of assistance at redetermination. Lead Agencies that establish initial family income eligibility below 85 percent of state median income (SMI) are required to provide a graduated phase -out of assistance for 83 | P a g e families whose income has increased abo ve the state's initial income threshold at the time of redetermination but remains below the federal threshold of 85 percent of the state median income (98.21 (b)(1)). Providing a graduated phase -out promotes continuity by allowing for wage growth, allows for a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program as income increases, and supports long- term self -sufficiency for families. Lead Agencies that provide a graduated phase -out must implement a two -tiered eligibility threshold, with the second ti er of eligibility (used at the time of eligibility redetermination) to be set at: (i) 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size. (ii) An amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lead Agency's initial eligibility threshold that: (A) Takes into account the typical household budget of a low -income family. (B) Provides justification that the second eligibility threshold is: (1) Sufficient to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low-income workers and that promote and support family economic stability . (2) Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption. At redetermination, a child shall be considered eligible if his or her parents are working or attending a j ob training or educational program even if their income exceeds the Lead Agency's income limit to initially qualify for assistance as long as their income does not exceed the second tier of eligibility (98.21(a); 98.21(b)(1)). Note that once deemed eligibl e, the family shall be considered eligible for a full minimum 12 -month eligibility period, even if their income exceeds the second tier of eligibility during the eligibility period, as long as it does not exceed 85 percent of SMI. A family eligible for ser vices via the graduated phase -out of assistance is considered eligible under the same conditions as other eligible families with the exception of the co -payment restrictions, which do not apply to a graduated phase -out. To help families transition from child care assistance, Lead Agencies may gradually adjust co -pay amounts for families whose children are determined eligible under a graduated phase -out and may require additional reporting on changes in family income. However, Lead Agencies must still ensure that any additional reporting requirements do not constitute an undue burden on families. a. Check and describe the option that best identifies the Lead Agency's policies and procedures regarding the graduated phase -out of assistance. N/A. The Lead Agency se ts its initial eligibility threshold at 85 percent of SMI and therefore, is not required to provide a graduated phase -out period. (If checked, skip to subsection 3.3) The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at 85 percent of SMI. A. Describe the po licies and procedures. New applicants are eligible for subsidized child care if such applicant(s) can document an annual gross family income up to 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) or 85 percent of the current SMI, whichever is lower. -Durin g redetermination, families who are classified as being over the income threshold at the end of the 12 -month eligibility period are to be considered 84 | P a g e eligible up to 85 percent of the current SMI. -During the 12 month eligibility period, families designated as eligible for subsidized child care and receiving such services whose income exceeds 85 percent of the current SMI shall continue to receive subsidized care for no more than three months. At the end of the three month period of continued assistance, if the gross annual family income is below 85 percent of the most current SMI, assistance cannot be terminated and the child shall continue receiving assistance until the next scheduled redetermination. B. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure . The District of Columbia Mayor's Order 2009 -3, dated Jan. 15, 2009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE as the lead agency for CCDF and delegated the aut hority of the Mayor to administer the District law that governs subsidized child care, D.C. Code\u00a7 4 -401 et seq. The graduated phase out requirements are set forth in Section 500.4 of OSSE's Eligibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual and 5 - A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 201.7 and 201.9. The Lead Agency sets the second tier of eligibility at an amount lower than 85 percent of SMI for a family of the same size but above the Lea d Agency's initial eligibility threshold. A. Provide the income level for the second tier of eligibility for a family of three: B. Describe how the second eligibility threshold: 1. Takes into account the typical household budget of a low -income family: 2. Is sufficie nt to accommodate increases in family income over time that are typical for low-income workers and that promote and support family economic stability: . 3. Reasonably allows a family to continue accessing child care services without unnecessary disruption: 4. Provide the citation for this policy or procedure related to the second eligibility threshold: b. To help families transition from assistance, does the Lead Agency gradually adjust co-payments for families eligible under the graduated phase -out period? No Yes i. If yes , describe how the Lead Agency gradually adjusts co -payments for families under a graduated phase out. If graduated phase out occurs at redetermination, then the family co -pay amount will increase based on income and family size. However, co -pays do not increase within a 12 - month eligibility period. ii. If yes, does the Lead Agency require additional reporting requirements during the graduated phase -out period? (Note: Additional reporting requirements are also discussed in section 3.4.3 of the Plan.) No 85 | P a g e Yes. Describe: 3.3 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families Lead Agencies are required to give priority for child care assistance to children with special needs, which can include vulnerable populations, in families with very low incomes, and to children experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B); 98.46(a)). The prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limited to eligibility determination. Other ways to give priority may include the establishment of a waiting list or the ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served. Note: CCDF defines \"child experiencing homelessness\" as a child who is homeless, as defined in Section 725 of Subtitle VII -B of the McKinney -Vento Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a) (98.2). Describe how Agency defin es: a. \"Children with special needs\": Children with disabilities have special needs that are defined as conditions or characteristics of a child under the age of 19 that reflect a need for particular care, services or treatment, most commonly physical and/or mental disabilities and/or delays and is evidenced by Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) or Individualized Education Program (IEP). b. \"Families with very low incomes\": A family with a very low income is defined as is defined as having income at or below 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) . 3.3.2 Identify how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child care services for the following children and families: Note: If waiving co -payments is checked, Lead Agencies will need to provide further information in question 3.2.4. Paying higher rates for accessing higher quality care is addressed in 4.3.3 and using grants or contracts to reserve spots is addressed in 4.1.6 . a. Complete the table below to indicate how the identified populations are prioritiz ed or targeted. Population Prioritized Prioritize for enrollment in child care services Serve without placing on waiting list Waive co - payments (on a case -by-case basis). As described in 3.2.4.

If applicable, identify and describe any other ways the identified populations in the table above are prioritized or targeted. The lead agency does not currently have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list, the lead agency will give priority to these special populations: (1) Children of families with very low family income; (2) Children with special needs, including vulnerable children; and (3) Children experiencing homelessness . 3.3.3 List and define any other priority groups established by the Lead Agency. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) does not prioritize or target child care services for any other priority groups. 3.3.4 Describe how the Lead Agency prioritizes services for the additional priority groups identifie d in 3.3.3. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) does not prioritize or target child care services for any other priority groups. 3.3.5 Lead Agencies are required to expend CCDF funds to (1) permit the enrollment (after an initial eligibility determination) of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained, (2) provide training and technical assistance to child care providers and the appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving children and families experiencing homelessness (addressed in section 6), and (3) conduct specific outreach to families experiencing homelessness(658E(c)(3); 98.51). a. Describe the procedures to permit the enrollment of children experiencing homelessness while required documentation is obtained. Upon initial eligibility determination, children eligible for subsidized child care categorically due to experiencing homelessness shall be permitted to enroll in the subsidized child care placement prior to completion of all required documentation and are provided a 60 calendar day grace period in which to provide full documentation of eligibility. The Child Care Referral Form serves as acceptable documentation until the records can be provided and the child shall re ceive , and the provider shall be paid for, subsidized child care during the grace period. If, after full documentation is provided, the child experiencing homelessness is found to be ineligible, subsidized child care services shall be terminated. b. Check, where applicable, the procedures used to conduct outreach for children experiencing Homelessness (as defined by CCDF Rule) and their families. i. Lead Agency accepts applications at local community -based locations ii. Partnerships with community -based organizations iii.

Other: Applicant parents of children experiencing homelessness are waive d of the requirement to participate in a qualifying activity and income threshold requirements. Eligibility staff does not calculate income to determine eligibility or co - payment. Note: The Lead Agency shall pay any amount owed to a child care provider for services provided as a result of the initial eligibility determination, and any CCDF payment made prior to the final eligibility determination shall not be considered an error or improper payment (98.51(a)(1)(ii)). 3.3.6 Lead Agencies must establish a grace period that allows children experiencing homelessness and children in foster care to receive CCDF assistance while providing their families with a reasonable time to take any necessary actions to comply with immunization and other health and safety requireme nts (as described in section 5). The length of such a grace period shall be established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency (658E(c)(2)(I)(i)(I); 98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)). Note: Any payment for such a child during the grace perio d shall not be considered an error or improper payment (98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)(2)). a. Describe procedures to provide a grace period to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements, including how the length of the grace period was established in consultation with the state, territorial, or tribal health agency for: i.

Describe how the Lead Agency coordinates with licensing agencies and other relevant state, territorial, tribal, and local agencies to provide referrals and support to help families with children receiving services during a grace period comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements (98.41(a)(1)(i)(C)(4)). The Department of Human Services (DHS) provides the family a follow up request that lets them know they have 60 days to get a complete Health Certificate. The form also 88 | P a g e includes contact information for the person at DHS who can assist them with getting the form completed. DHS also includes information on the admission form letting the provider know that this family has a 60 -day grace period to comply with the H ealth Certificate requirements. c. Does the Lead Agency establish grace periods for other children who are not experiencing homelessness or in foster care? No Yes. Describe: 3.4 Continuity for Working Families 3.4.1 Minimum 12 -month eligibility. The Lead Agency is required to establish a minimum 12 -month eligibility and redetermination period: regardless of changes in income. Lead Agencies may not terminate CCDF assistance during the minimum 12 -month period if a family has an increase in income that exceeds the sta te's income eligibility threshold but not the federal threshold of 85 percent of state median income (SMI) . regardless of temporary changes in participation in work, training, or educational activities (658E(c)(2)(N)(i) and (ii)). The Lead Agency may not t erminate assistance prior to the end of the minimum 12 -month period if a family experiences a temporary job loss or a temporary change in participation in a training or educational activity. Any temporary change cannot have a time limit (e.g. 60 days, 90 d ays, etc.). A temporary change in eligible activity includes, at a minimum: 1. any time -limited absence from work for an employed parent due to such reasons as the need to care for a family member or an illness 2. any interruption in work for a seasonal worker who is not working 3. any student holiday or break for a parent participating in a training or educational program 4. any reduction in work, training, or education hours, as long as the parent is still working or attending a training or educational program 5. any other cessation of work or attendance at a training or educational program that does not exceed 3 months or a longer period of time established by the Lead Agency 6. a child turning 13 years old during the minimum 12 -month eligibility period (except as describ ed in 3.1.1) 7. any changes in residency within the state, territory, or tribal service area a. Describe the Lead Agency's policies and procedures related to providing a minimum 12- month eligibility period at initial eligibility determination and redeterminatio n and provide a citation for these policies or procedures. Once a child is determined as eligible for receiving child care subsidy assistance, the family or individual will be considered to meet all eligibility requirements for such assistance and will r eceive assistance for not less than 12 months before re -determining eligibility. A child shall 89 | P a g e remain eligible for the District of Columbia's child care subsidy program throughout the 12-month eligibility period regardless of: b. A change in gross annual fam ily income, if the gross annual family income does not exceed85 percent of the SMI for a family of the same size; c. A temporary change in the child's parent(s)' or guardian(s)' ongoing status (for example child care may be continued during a parent(s)' or guardian(s)' period of parental leave, for not less than 12 months from the last date the applicant was determined as eligible for receiving child care subsidy assistance); d. A change in the child's age, including turning 13 during the eligibility period; or e. Any change in residency within the District of Columbia. Section 500.1 in The Office of the State Superintendent of Education's (OSSE) Eligibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual provides examples of the impact of temporary and non -temporary changes on a child's eligibility and also reviews other potential eligibility scenarios. Furthermore, eligibility staff monitor any change in parent(s) or guardian(s) status throughout the period of eligibility to ensure the co -payment is correct at all times. Co -payments may not be increased during a 12 -month eligibility period as long as the income does not exceed 85 percent of the state median income, temporary changes in work, training or education activities. f.

Continuing assistance for \"job search\" and a Lead Agency's option to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12 -month eligibility period. Lead Agencies have the opt ion, but are not required, to discontinue assistance during the minimum 12 -month eligibility period due to a parent's non-temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program, otherwise known as a parent's eligible activity. If the Lead Agency chooses the option to discontinue assistance due to a parent's non-temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity, it must continue assistance at least at the same level for a period of not fewer than 3 months after each such lo ss or cessation. This time period allows the parent to engage in a job search and to resume work or resume attendance in a job training or educational program. At the end of the minimum 3 -month period of continued assistance, if the parent has engaged in a qualifying work, training, or educational program activity with an income below 85 percent of state median income (SMI), assistance cannot be terminated, and the child must continue receiving assistance until the next scheduled redetermination or, at the Lead Agency option, for an additional minimum 12 -month eligibility period. a. Does the Lead Agency consider seeking employment (engaging in a job search) an eligible activity at initial eligibility determination (at application) and at the minimum 12 -month eligibility redetermination? (Note: If yes, Lead Agencies must provide a minimum of three months of job search.) No Yes. If yes, describe the policy or procedure (including any differences in eligibility at initial eligibility determination vs. redeterminati on of eligibility): In addition to the other requirements set forth in 5 -A DCMR\u00a7 201, in order to be eligible for subsidized child care in DC, a child shall, at the time of eligibility determination or redetermination , meet the requirements for one of the following categories of need: (1) Resides with parent(s) who are working or attending a job training or education program; (2) Resides with parent(s) who is seeking employment or engaging in job search; or (3) Receives, or need to receive, protective serv ices or is considered a vulnerable child, as defined herein. Parents who are seeking employment or engaging in job search are categorized into three groups for verification purposes: 1. TANF Recipients: This group of applicants includes TANF recipients par ticipating in a qualifying activity for a minimum of 20 hours per week. The timeframe that child care is requested and the parent(s) or guardian(s) activity schedule must match. Only DHS CCSD Eligibility staff may place TANF recipients' children in child c are. 2. TANF Payee: This group of applicants includes guardian(s) or custodian(s) who are providing care to a child who is not their natural child, receiving financial assistance though ESA on behalf of the child and participating in a qualifying activity fo r a minimum of 20 hours per week. This guardian(s) or custodian(s). The timeframe that child care is requested and the guardian(s) or custodian(s)' activity must match. Or 3. Verified Job Search: This group of applicants includes parent(s) and guardian(s) en gaging a valid job search, whether through DOES or another approved agency such as the TANF Employment Program, Food Stamp Employment Program (FSET), TANF Employment 94 | P a g e Provider (TEP), Office of Work Opportunity (OWO), or an Economic Services Administration (ESA) approved job search or work experience program. This group of parents also includes teen or young adult parents, who are either: (1) enrolled and attend a middle school, high school, or an equivalent secondary program (e.g. GED program), or college; or (2) enrolled in a verified job search, job training or work readiness program. Children of teen or young adult parents shall remain eligible during the summer if already provided during the school year regardless of school or work status. In addition, families eligible for subsidized child care pursuant to this subsection shall be provided a - 3- month grace period from the date of graduation before income requirements and any co - payment are applied. Acceptable documentation for verification of seeking employment or engaging in job search includes: Confirmation of job search or job training from DOES, TANF Employment Program, Food Stamp Employment Training (FSET), TANF Employment Provider (TEP), Office of Work Opportunity (OWO), or an ESA -approved job se arch or work experience program. b. Does the Lead Agency discontinue assistance during the minimum 12-month eligibility period due to a parent's non -temporary loss or cessation of eligible activity and offer a minimum 3 - month period to allow parents to e ngage in a job search and to resume participation in an eligible activity? No, the state/territory does not discontinue assistance during the 12 -month eligibility period due to a parent's non -temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job train ing or educational program. Yes, the Lead Agency discontinues assistance during the 12 -month eligibility period due to a parent's non- temporary loss of work or cessation of eligible activity and provides a minimum 3-month period of job search. If yes: i. Prov ide a summary describing the Lead Agency's policies and procedures for discontinuing assistance due to a parent's non -temporary change: A child's eligibility for DC's child care subsidy program shall be re -determined during the 12 -month eligibility period in the following situations: (1) Any change in residency outside of the District of Columbia; (2) Non -temporary change; or (3) A change in income, if the family's income exceeds 85 percent of the State median income for a family of the same size. Applican ts shall report any of the changes leading to an unscheduled redetermination to their eligibility staff within ten (10) calendar days of the change. A non -temporary change is defined as any cessation of work or attendance at a training or education program that exceeds 90 calendar days. Once the parent reports the non -temporary change they will have 90 days to find a qualifying activity, if qualifying activity is not obtained the parent will receive a 90 day termination notice. For example, if a parent lost their job 90 days ago and is no longer working, this is considered a non -temporary change and the child is no longer eligible.

The District of Columbia Mayor's Order 2009- 3, dated Jan. 15, 2009 nunc pro tunc to Aug. 16, 2009, designates OSSE as the lead agency for CCDF and delegated the authority of the Mayor to administer the District law that governs subsidized child care, D.C. Code \u00a7 4 -401 et seq. The reporting requirements are set forth in Section 500.1(a) (1 -5) of OSSE's Eligibility Determinations for Subsidized Child Care Policy Manual and 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 201.6. 3.4.4 Prevent th e disruption of employment, education, or job training activities. Lead Agencies are required to have procedures and policies in place to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving assistance under the TANF program) are not required to unduly disrup t their employment, education, or job training activities to comply with the Lead Agency's or designated local entity's requirements for the redetermination of eligibility for assistance (658E(c)(2)(N)(ii); 98.21(d)). Examples include developing strategies to inform families and their providers of an upcoming redetermination and the information that will be required of the family, pre - populating subsidy renewal forms, having parents confirm that the information is accurate, and/or asking only for the inform ation necessary to make an eligibility redetermination. In addition, states and territories can offer a variety of family -friendly methods for submitting documentation for eligibility redetermination that considers the range of needs for families in access ing support (e.g., use of languages other than English, access to transportation, accommodation of parents working non -traditional hours). a. Identify, where applicable, the Lead Agency's procedures and policies to ensure that 99 | P a g e parents (especially parents rece iving TANF program funds) do not have their employment, education, or job training unduly disrupted to comply with the state/territory's or designated local entity's requirements for the redetermination of eligibility. Check all that apply. i. Advance noti ce to parents of pending redetermination ii. Advance notice to providers of pending redetermination iii. Pre -populated subsidy renewal form iv. Online documentation submission v. Cross -program redeterminations vi. Extended office hours (evenings and/or wee kends) vii. Consultation available via phone viii. Other : Applicants are not required to disrupt work, training, or education activity in order to complete the eligibility redetermination process. In addition applicants receiving TANF benefits may use the District's TANF documents to support redetermination. The eligibility staff will determine what documents are required to verify the family and child's eligibility using as their basis the reason for eligibility. The eligibility staff shall ensure a letter is sent to the parent(s) or guardian(s) that requests written documentation to update the case file, which may include, but is not limited to, documentation required when determined initial eligibility. During the public health emergency the Lead agency has allowed families with children under age 13 and who have their 12 -month eligibility expire during the public health emergency to remain eligible for subsidized child care throughout the public health emergency, until the District government enters Ph ase Four of the COVID -19 reopening. Families will receive a notice in the mail with a request to come in and recertify after the public health emergency is lifted. Services for children who turn 13 will terminate at the next redetermination date following their 13th birthday (whether or not the District government has entered Phase Four). 4 Ensure Equal Access to Child Care for Low- Income Children A core purpose of CCDF is to promote parental choice and to empower working parents to make their own decisio ns regarding the child care services that best suit their family's needs. Parents have the option to choose from center -based care, family child care, or care provided in the child's own home. In supporting parental choice, the Lead Agencies must ensure th at families receiving CCDF funding have the opportunity to choose from the full range of eligible child care settings and must provide families with equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non -CCDF families. Lead Agencies must employ strat egies to increase the supply and to improve the quality of child care services, especially in underserved areas. In addition to generally building the supply of child care for all families, this effort also supports equal access for CCDF eligible children to the priced child care market. This section addresses strategies that the Lead Agency uses to promote parental choice, ensure equal access, and increase the supply of child care. Note: In responding to questions 100 | P a g e in this section, the Office of Child Care (OCC) recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories and types of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF -defined categories and types of care. For these questions, provid e responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 4.1 Maximi ze Parental Choice and Implement Supply Building Mechanisms The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive(s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either receiving a child care certificate or, if available, enrolli ng their child with a provider that has a grant or contract for providing child care services (658E(c)(2)(A); 98.30(a)). Even if a parent chooses to enroll their child with a provider who has a grant or contract, the parent will select the provider, to the extent practicable. If a parent chooses to use a certificate, the Lead Agency shall provide information to the parent on the range of provider options, including care by sectarian providers and relatives. Lead Agencies must require providers chosen by fam ilies to meet health and safety standards and has the option to require higher standards of quality. Lead Agencies are reminded that any policies and procedures should not restrict parental access to any type of care or provider (e.g. center care, home care, in -home care, for -profit provider, non-profit provider, or faith -based provider, etc.) (98.15 (a)(5)). 4.1.1 Describe the child care certificate, including when it is issued to parents (before or after the parent has selected a provider) and what infor mation is included on the certificate (98.16 (q)). Eligibility is determined two ways in the District. Families may go to the Department of Human Services (DHS) for eligibility determination or they may go to a child development center designated as a Level II provider. A Level II provider is authorized to conduct initial eligibility determinations and re - determinations for families seeking child care subsidy in its center on behalf of the lead agency. No certificates or admission forms are needed for this process. If a family chooses to go the DHS, the child care admission form is issued after they have selected a provider. When it has been determined that a family meets all eligibility criteria and placement has been made, the eligibility staff issues an admission form to the parent(s) or guardian(s) with instructions to have it completed by the selected provider. The provider then returns the admission form to DHS, Child Care Services Division (CCSD) to confirm the child has been accepted and payment for c hild care services will be authorized. The provider must enter the date the child started at the facility and sign and date the form. The provider returns the admission form via email to DHS CCSD within 24 hours after the child is enrolled at the facility. The admission form includes the following information: type of care (traditional or non - traditional), child's name, parent/guardian, beginning date, child care provider, assigned co -pay information, eligibility worker's contact information, and parent's signature . 4.1.2 Identify how the parent is informed that the child care certificate allows the option to choose from a variety of child care categories, such as private, not-for-profit, faith -based providers; centers; FCC homes; or in -home providers (658E(c)(2)(A)(i); 658P(2); 658Q). Check all that apply. a. Certificate provides information about the choice of providers b. Certificate provides information about the quality of providers c. Certificate is not linked to a specific provider, so parents can c hoose 101 | P a g e any provider d. Consumer education materials are provided on choosing child care e. Referrals provided to child care resource and referral agencies f. Co-located resource and referral staff in eligibility offices g. Verbal communication at the time of the application h. Community outreach, workshops, or other in-person activities i. Other. Describe: My Child Care DC is a consumer- friendly website that helps families find and compare child care options (https://childcareconnections.osse.dc.gov/ ). My Child Care DC allows families to search center- based and home -based child development providers by distance from a particular address or zip code. Consumers can filter options by operating hou rs, type of facility, age range of students served and quality rating. Parents receive a flier with information about the My Child Care DC website with the voucher. Providers are also required to maintain this flier near the sign in/sign out area. 4.1.3 A core principle of CCDF is that families receiving CCDF -funded child care should have equal access to child care that is comparable to that of non -CCDF families (658E(c)(4)(A) and 98.45(a)). a. Describe how parents have access to the full range of providers el igible to receive CCDF: District families have the opportunity to choose from a full range of licensed providers including for -profit, non -profit , and faith -based center -based and home -based providers that accept the child care subsidy vouchers. Families a re able to search for licensed childcare, browse and compare child care options by location and zip code, and learn about available early childhood resources on the My Child Care DC website. b. Describe state data on the extent to which eligible child care pr oviders participate in the CCDF system: Over half of the District's licensed child development facilities (centers and homes) participate in the subsidized child care program in all 8 wards of the District. The District also supports relative and in -home care options for families that are unable to find a child care provider who meets their needs. c. Identify any barriers to provider participation, including barriers related to payment rates and practices, based on provider feedback and reports to the Lead Agency: The District has decreased barriers to participation by increasing subsidy reimbursement rates in FY19 based on the average cost of providing child care. Barriers to participation in the District's subsidized child care program in the past were low reimbursement rates and late or delayed payments. However, these are no longer barriers to participation as the District significantly increased the reimbursement rates as a result of the increases to federal and local funding in fiscal year 2019. Furtherm ore, The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has eliminated late or delayed payments and has paid out reimbursements on time consistently. Since October 2018, OSSE also pays a $75 initial registration fee for each subsidy eligible child . OSSE acknowledges there may be other obstacles that may force some providers to limit the number of children receiving subsidies in their care. Some providers indicated that payment practices (e.g. reimbursement payment and payments based on attendance r ather than enrollment) were obstacles that prevented participation in the subsidy program. In response to this feedback and experience during the public health emergency, OSSE has modified its prior attendance -based payment policies and now pays based prov iders based on enrollment for all children who are absent fewer than 10 days per month (or 15 days if the absence is 102 | P a g e excused). When children are absent more than 10 days per month (or 15 days if the absence is excused), OSSE pays providers for the number o f days the child actually attended in addition to up to 10 unexcused or 15 excused absences per month. These payment practices are intended to support the fixed costs of care and reduce barriers to participation in the child care subsidy program. OSSE meet s regularly with membership associations representing providers, including membership associations representing CCDF and non -CCDF providers, to solicit input on its policies and practices that may create barriers to participation in subsidy and/or ways to increase the attractiveness of the subsidy program to a wide range of providers. 4.1.4 Certify by describing the Lead Agency's procedures for ensuring that parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider who receives CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(B); 98.16(t)). A licensed facility shall provide parents with unlimited access to their children at all times, pursuant to 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 127.2. Facilities are required to establish and implement written policies that are to be provided to parents. The written policies must include that parents have unlimited access to their children and access to all facility areas used by their child. Additionally, parents are informed of this policy during the parent application and o rientation process. Providers are reminded of this policy during the subsidy provider orientation and in the subsidy provider agreement. 4.1.5 The Lead Agency must allow for in-home care (i.e., care provided in the child's own home) but may limit its use ( 98.16(i)(2)). Will the Lead Agency limit the use of in -home care in any way? No Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the use of in -home care? Check all that apply. a. Restricted based on the minimum number of children in the care of t he provider to meet the Fair Labor Standards Act (minimum wage) requirements. Describe: b.

List the data sources used to identify shortages, and describe the method of tracking progress to support equal access and parental choice (98.16(x). a. In child care centers. In November 2018, the Bainum Family Foundation, a private foundation, published Early Learning Supply and Demand, an analysis of estimated supply of and potential demand for early learning slots by child age (e.g. infant/toddler and pre -k), program quality, and neighborhood in the District of Columbia. The analysis was conducted by the Reinvestment Fund with financial support of the Bainum Family Foundation and includes an accompan ying interactive map allowing users to further analyze the data for specific ages, quality levels, populations, and communities. This analysis included both center -based and home -based licensed child development facilities as well as public and private sch ools serving pre-kindergarten -aged students . The analysis found a shortage of high -quality infant and toddler slots throughout the District and identified the specific geographic areas with the greatest gap between estimated supply and demand . The study is available at : https://bainumfdn.org/wp -content/uploads/2018/10/Bainum_EL -Supply -Demand - Report_FNL_Nov of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) also funded a third party research institute, the Urban Institute, to conduct a study of the supply of and demand for nontraditional- hour child care in the Di strict . This study (available at: https://www.urban.org/research/publication/nontraditional- hour -child -care - district -columbia ) found that over 20 pe rcent of children under age 12 in the District have parents who work or commute nontraditional hours, and identify the greatest potential unmet need for nontraditional -hour care in wards 7 and 8 . OSSE has used data and findings from both studies to inform strategies to increase the supply of child care in the District, including the Access to Quality Child Care Expansion grant, which use slocal funds to make facilities grants to support expansion of child development facilities to create additional infant an d toddler s lots. OSSE is keenly aware that the data collected and analyzed through both these studies is now several years old, and that the public health emergency has affected, and continues to affect, both the supply of and demand for child care in the District in multiple ways, the long -term impacts of which are still unfolding. Given this, OSSE recognizes a need for additional data collection and analysis to identify potential shortages as the District emerges from the public health emergency. The Lea d Agency tracks progress to support equal access and parental choice through several data poin ts: the number and percent age of providers participating in the child care subsidy program, the number of slots available in subsidy providers by age group and ge ographic location (ward), the percent of subsidy utilization by age group (infant/toddler) and ward, and the number of subsidy participating providers at each quality designation in Capital Quality , with the goal of increasing the number of subsidy provide rs and slots as well as the number of subsidy providers achieving \"quality\" and \"high -quality\" designations . These data point are collected through the data systems of record for child care licensing and included , along with directional trends, in Key Per formance Indicators (KPIs) that the Lead Agency reports to the City Administrator on a quarterly basis and/or pe rformance Oversight questions on which the Lead Agency reports to the City Council annually . The Lead Agency also tracks changes in supply of c hild care facilities (due to temporary and permanent closures as well as new openings) on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews data collected by D.C. Chhild Care Connections (DC CCC) , the District's Child Care Resource and Referral agency, on vacancies in child development facilities and parental requests for referrals to child care , to provide 105 | P a g e additional information on progress and areas where parents are encountering challenges accessing care. The Lead Agency is working with DC CCC to enhance collectio n and analysis of data on child care demand and supply. OSSE is currently updating our internal data systems that support child care licensing, subsidy, and quality initiatives and anticipate that this system will further enhance our ability to track progress to support equal access and parent choice . b. In child care homes . The 2018 Early Learning Supply and Demand Report interactive map and the study of nontraditional hour care included information on demand and supply in homes, as well as center - and (where applicable) school- based facilities. The indicators and mechanisms that the Lead Agency uses to track progress to support equal access and parental choice are inclusive of data from both child care centers and child care homes. c. Other. 4.1.8 Lead Agencies are required to develop and implement strategies to increase the supply of and improve the quality of child care services (98.16 (x)). These strategies should address children in underserved areas; infants and toddlers; children with disabilities, as defined by the Lead A gency; and children who receive care during non-traditional hours. Identify what method(s) is (are) used to increase supply and/or to improve quality for the following populations and indicate in the description if a strategy is focused more on building su pply or on improving quality. a.

DBH is working with OSSE to expand access to HF services to additional facilities in wards 7 and 8 during the FY 2022-24 CCDF State Plan Period. b. xi. Other . Describe: The Early Head Start Child Care Partnership grant increases the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care in underserved areas in the District by providing a model for scaling up quality improvement efforts for infants and toddlers across the District. OSSE leveraged the Early Head Start -Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) grant to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN). The QIN increases access to compr ehensive child development and family support services with a particular focus in underserved areas. As part of the QIN, The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) awarded a locally - funded grant to a community -based organization to serve as a hub and provide technical assistance and training and coordinate comprehensive services for a network of child development homes that primarily serve infants and toddlers. The hub agency supports fourteen child development home providers. The hub is s upporting the network in achieving Early Head Start quality in their programs. The hub provides continuous job embedded professional development and coaching to the staff, comprehensive services, health services, support in nutrition and wellness, as well as support to engage families in the programs. The locally funded Access to Quality Child Care Expansion Grant makes grants for child development facility construction or renovation to create new infant and toddler slots in the District.

Within each tier, OSSE differentiates rates for infants and toddlers, pre -school, and school - aged care to reflect the difference in costs to deliver care by age. The infant and toddler tiered reimbursement rates are higher than the rates for other age groups due to the higher cost of care for infants and toddle rs. Child care centers participating in OSSE's Quality Improvement Network (QIN), which seeks to increase the supply of high -quality infant and toddler seats, also receive additional funding and quality services. vii.

Describe : The Lead Agency will use Child Care Stabilization Grant Funds received through the American Recovery Plan to make grants to child care providers to preserve the supply o f child care and help provid ers cover operating costs to remain in operation during the public health emergency and recovery. The Lead Agency will work through intermediaries \u2014the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), Washington Area Community Investment Fund (Wacif), Hurley & Associates , and United Planning Organization \u2014to distribute 90 percent of Child Care Stabilization Funds received by the Lead Agency as subgrants to child care providers. CCDF and non -CCDF providers licensed as of the date of passage of the American Recovery Plan are potentially eligible for a grant, provided the provider provide s the certifications required by the American Recovery Plan and further certifies that the provider needs financial assistance to remain in operation and will use grant funds to remain in oper ation for the duration of the grant period. In-home and relative providers are not eligible for subgrants from this program. Provider funding amounts will be determined using a formula based on the provider's esti mated monthly cost of operations, as estimated using the D.C. Cost Estimation Model and the provider's licensed enrollment capacity , 112 | P a g e with adjustments for additional factors that may increase or decrease the provider's financial need . The remaining 10% of funds will be used to cover intermediaries' costs to administer subgrant programs and provide business supports and capacity building for subgrantees. The Lead Agency has chosen to work with these intermediaries because they are familiar with the District's child care providers, have a track record of successfully administering subgrants and supporting child care providers, and have the capacity to make high -quality business supports and capacity building available to child care providers. Each intermediary will be responsible for subgrants to a des ignated subset of eligible child care providers, based on providers' need s and participation or non -participation in various programs (e.g. child care subsidy, Quality Improvement Network, Shared Service Business Alliance) , but may provide business support s and capacity building for other child care providers as well. The Lead Agency will work with the intermediaries to coordinate subgrant administration and business capacity building activities to avoid duplication, maximize efficiency, and increase the av ailability and intensity of high -quality business supports and capacity building tailored to the needs of child care businesses in the District. In addition, the Lead Agency will use a port ion of the 10% of funds not distributed through subgrants to suppor t additional Lead Agency staff needed to oversee the grant program and coordinate intermediaries' subgranting and business capacity building activit ies with one another and other related initiatives (supported by the Lead Agency and other public and privat e entities); to conduct outreach and communications wit h child care providers about the program; and to collect and analyze data on child care demand, supply, and facilities needs to inform the Lead Agency's ongoing efforts to support equal access and pare ntal choice and improve the supply and quality of child care .

How does the Lead Agency define areas with significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment? The Lead Agency defines areas with significant concentrations of poverty and unemplo yment as areas within a high poverty census tract. A high poverty census tract is defined by the tiers \"10 -24.99 percent families in poverty\" and \"greater than families in poverty\", as verified by ECMapDC.org . b.Descr ibe how the Lead Agency prioritizes increasing access to high -quality child care and development services for children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have access to high - quality program s. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE )'s 2019 -2023 strategic plan included a goal of increasing by 1,000 the number of quality slots available for infant and toddler care across the District. In 2018 , the District created the Access to Quality Child Care Expansion grant with a goal to increase the supply of quality infant and toddler supply by 1,000 by September 2020 with at least 50 percent of sub -granted amounts to improve supply for infants and toddlers eligible for subsidy. Through September 2020, Access to Quality had supported the creation of 1,244 new infant and toddler slots. In selecting child development facilities for the initial round of subgrants, the grantee administering the Access to Quality fund prioritized applicants serving or proposing to serve children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and do not currently have sufficient numbers of such programs. The Access to Quality Child Care Expansion Program remains a pillar of the Lead Agency's strategy to further increase supply of high -quality child care for infants and toddlers in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and/or shortages of high -quality programs during the recovery from the pu blic health emergency , contingent on continued local funding. Through the Lead Agency's public private partnership with the Bainum Foundation, the Quality Improvement Network ( QIN) expanded in March 2018 to three additional centers serving 94 children in Wards 7 and 8, our wards with the highest concentration of poverty and unemployment. In 2019, OSSE received federal funds to support these facilities. The Bainum Family Foundation still provides professional development supports to the QIN directly to th e hubs. In 2017 the Bainum Foundation established a $4.5 million Early Learning Quality Fund to support the development of 750 high quality infant and toddler slots in W ards 7 and 8. The Lead Agency continues to pursue federal and philanthropic funding op portunities to expand the work of the QIN. 4.2 Assess Market Rates and Analyze the Cost of Child Care Key principles of the CCDF are to: (1) provide equal access to child care for children receiving child care assistance; and (2) ensure parental choice by offering a full range of child care services. Payment rates that are too low to support equal access undermine these principles. To establish subsidy payment rates that ensure equal access, Lead Agencies collect and analyze data through a number of tools. Lead Agencies have the option to conduct a statistically valid and reliable (1) market rate survey (MRS) reflecting 114 | P a g e variations in the price to parents of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child or (2) an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, such as a cost estimation model (658E(c)(4)(B)). A cost estimation model estimates the cost of care by incorporating both data and assumptions to judge what expected costs would be incurred by child care providers and parents unde r different scenarios. Another approach would be a cost study that collects cost data at the facility or program level to measure the costs (or inputs used) to deliver child care services (CCDF -ACF- PI-2018- 01). Regardless of whether Lead Agencies conduct a market rate survey or an alternative methodology, they are required to analyze the cost of providing child services, known as the narrow cost analysis, that meet basic health, safety, quality and staffing requirements (base level care) (98.45(b)(3), (f )(1)(ii)(A), and (f)(2)(ii)), and higher -quality care at each level of quality, as defined by the Lead Agency (98.45(b)(4), (f)(1)(ii)(B), and (f)(2)(iii)). The analysis must identify the gaps between the cost of care and subsidy levels adopted by the state and then be considered as part of the rate setting process. Note: Any Lead Agency considering using an alternative methodology, instead of a market rate survey, is required to submit a description of its proposed approach to its ACF Regional Child Care P rogram Office for pre -approval in advance of the Plan submittal (see https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ/resource/ccdf -acf-pi-2016 -08) . Advance approval is not required if the Lead Agency plans to implement both a market rate survey and an alternative methodology. In its request for ACF pre -approval, a Lead Agency must: Provide an overview of the Lead Agency's proposed approach (e.g., cost estimation model, cost study/survey, etc.), includ ing a description of data sources. Describe what information the Lead Agency will obtain from an alternative methodology that could not be obtained from the required narrow cost analysis. Describe how the Lead Agency will consult with the State Early Child hood Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, organizations representing child care caregivers, teachers and directors, and other appropriate entities prior to conducting the identified alternative methodology. Describe how the alternative methodology will use methods that are statistically valid and reliable and will yield accurate results. For example, if using a survey, describe how the Lead Agency will ensure a representative sample and promote an adequate response rate. If using a cost estimation model, describe how the Lead Agency will validate the assumptions in the model. If the proposed alternative methodology includes an analysis of costs (e.g., cost estimation model or cost study/survey), describe how the alternative methodology will account for key factors that impact the cost of providing care, such as: staff salaries and benefits, training and professional development, curricula and supplies, group si ze and ratios, enrollment levels, licensing requirements, quality level, facility size, and other factors. Describe how the alternative methodology will provide complete information that captures the universe of providers in the child care market. Describe how the alternative methodology will reflect variations by provider type, age of children, geographic location, and quality. Describe how the alternative methodology will use current data. 115 | P a g e What metrics the Lead Agency will use to set rates based on the al ternative methodology. Describe the estimated reporting burden and cost to conduct the approach. A Market Rate Survey (MRS) or an ACF pre -approved alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than 2 years before the date of submissio n of the Plan (658E(c)(4)(B)(i) (98.45 (c)). Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, Lead Agencies may request a waiver for up to one additional year (until July 1, 2022) to complete the required MRS or an ACF pre - approved alternative methodology. Lead Agencies may also request the required Narrow Cost Analysis be waived for one year (until July 1, 2022). These waiver requests must include a justification linked to the COVID -19 pandemic. 4.2.1 Completion of the MRS or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology. Did the sta te/territory conduct a statistically valid and reliable MRS or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology? Yes. If yes, please identify the methodology(ies) used below to assess child care prices and/or costs. a. MRS. When was your data gathered (provide a d ate range, for instance, September - December, 2019)? b. ACF pre-approved alternative methodology . Identify the date of the ACF approval and describe the methodology: On April 15, 2021, the ACF approved the District's request to use an alternative methodol ogy to establish subsidy payment rates. As provided in the Office of the State Superintendent of Education's (OSSE's ) request, OSSE updated the D.C. Cost Estimation Model that was developed in 2018 in consultation with nationally recognized early childhood finance experts. The model is a flexible financial model that incorporates a variety of assumptions and data inputs to calculate the estimated cost of delivering services at each level of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), Capital Quality, in center and home -based settings under a variety of operating scenarios (e.g. different facility sizes, ages of children served, sources of revenue and program participation). The goals of the alternative methodology are to: 1) identify key cos t drivers that cut across all QRIS designations and age groups ; 2) carefully explore differential costs between programs based on size, ages of children served, and other factors ; 3) assess the fiscal impact of various policies (e.g. licensing requirements , minimum wage increases) and participation in different programs and funding streams (e.g. Quality Improvement Network, the Pre- K Enhancement and Expansion Program( PKEEP ), the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) ) on provider costs and revenues; 4) u nderstand the impact of new health and safety protocols and group sizes on provider costs and revenues during the public health emergency and 5) use this information to test a range of alternative rate -setting and policy recommendations with a clear unders tanding of the fiscal impact of these decisions. OSSE updated the model that was used in 2018 because that model was extensively vetted by both local stakeholders and national experts and the District was able to use the results from the 201 8 cost estimatio n model to inform rate 116 | P a g e setting and make targeted and meaningful investments in supporting providers' financial sustainability. No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. a. Please identify the Lead Agency's planned methodology(ies) to assess child care p rices and/or costs. i. MRS. If checked, describe the status of the Lead Agency's implementation of the MRS. ii. ACF pre-approved alternative methodology. If checked, describe the status of the Lead Agency's implementation of the ACF pre -approved alternativ e methodology, including if applicable, the date of the ACF approval and a description of the methodology: The Administration for Ch ildren and Families approved the District's Alternative Methodology approach on April 15, 2021. In 2018 the District develop ed the D.C. Child Care Cost Estimation Model, an interactive model of the actual cost of delivering child care services. The D. C. Child Care C ost Estimation Model adapts the Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC), a dynamic, web -based tool that calcul ates the cost of quality child care based on site -level provider data. The D.C. Cost Estimation Model uses Excel spreadsheets to create flexible financial models, based on the PCQC, that are aligned to the District's unique reimbursement rate variations, quality ratings and other funding factors and can be used to project costs to deliver care under a variety of scenarios within District of Columbia policy and funding conditions. The resulting modeling tool takes into account the different levels of quality of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) in the universe of child care providers in the District, including child development centers and homes serving children of varying ages and needs. b. If a waiver is requested, Lead Agencies will need to respond to questions 4.2.2 -4.5.2 based on data collected for the FY 2019 -2021 CCDF Plan. Identify the date of the Lead Agencies' most recent and complete Market Rate Survey or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology that will provide data to inform responses to questions 4.2.2 -4.5.2. Click or tap here to enter text. 4.2.2 Prior to developing and conducting the MRS, or conducting the ACF pre -approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency is required to consult with (1) the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities, and (2) organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.45 (e)). Local child care pro gram administrators may also be good informants to Lead Agencies on narrow cost analyses. Describe how the Lead Agency consulted with the: a. State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body: On Jan . 28, 2021, the Office of the 117 | P a g e State Superintendent of Edu cation (OSSE) consulted with the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council ( SECDCC) and received approval to request the Administration for Children and Families ( ACF) approval to use an alternative methodology based on the District's Child Care Cost Estimation Model for the FY2022 -24 CCDF State Plan. In March 2021, OSSE consulted with SECDCC members and sought input to inform the assumption s in the model, and in July 2021 OSSE will present the findings of the completed mode l analysis to the SE CDCC for further review and feedback. b. Local child care program administrators: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education conducted focus groups with local child care program administrators , through the Director's Exchange, the D.C. Family Child Care Association, the Multicultural Spanish Speaking Provider Association, an d the Washington Association of Child Care C enters . Each of these organizations ' membership is primaril y comp osed of local child care program administrators. OSSE also reviewed the cost model inputs and assumptions with the D.C. Child Care Recovery Working Group, a working group of child development facility leaders representing the diversity of settings within the District's child care ecosystem that OSSE convened in Summer 2020 to advise OSSE in planning for and supporting child care facilities in reopening and recovery following COVID -related closures, and whom OSSE continues to engage as an informal advisory on key policy, programmatic, and other questions facing the agency an d child development facilities. OSSE reviewed the model's inputs and assumptions with these groups to ensure the model is representative of the District's child care programs and facilities. c. Local child care resource and referral agencies: The Child Care Resource and Referral Agency for the state is a member of the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC ) and the District's Child Care Recovery Working Group and has provided a review and input into the alternative methodology. d. Organ izations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) conducted focus groups with representatives of organizations representing caregivers, teachers, and directors, including the District of Columbia Association for the Education of Young Children, Director's Exchange, D.C. Head Start Association, D.C. Family Child Care Association, Multilingual Spanish Speaking Providers Association , and D.C. Action, as well as conducting follow -up conversati ons with individual program leaders and directors to solicit additional information and feedback on key assumptions or data points. OSSE also reviewed the cost model inputs and assumptions with the D.C. Child Care Recovery Working Group, a working group o f child development facility leaders representing the diversity of settings within the District's child care ecosystem that OSSE convened in Summer 2020 to advise OSSE in planning for and supporting child care facilities in reopening and recovery following COVID -related closures, and whom OSSE continues to engage as an informal advisory on key policy, programmatic, and other questions facing the agency and child development facilities. e. Other. Describe: 4.2.3 ACF has established a set of benchmarks, largely based on research, to identify the components of a valid and reliable market rate survey (81 FR, p. 67509). To be considered valid and reliable a Market Rate Survey or alternative methodology meets the following: o represents the child care market 118 | P a g e o provides comp lete and current data o uses rigorous data collection procedures o reflects geographic variations o analyzes data in a manner that captures other relevant differences An MRS can use administrative data, such as child care resource and referral data, if it is representative of the market. a. Describe how each of the benchmarks are met in either the MRS or ACF pre - approved alternative methodology. i. Represent the child care market: The District's alternative methodology is designed to be inclusive of the universe of p roviders in the District's child care market and to reflect variations by provider type, age of children, and quality. T he Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) Division of Early Learning ( DEL) used the D.C. Cost Estimation Model tool to separately model the costs for the three types of licensed providers that exist in the District --child development centers, child development homes, and child development expanded homes \u2014taking into account the unique operating conditions and variation in c ost drivers of these different providers. For each provider type we also modeled a variety of scenarios that reflect variation in provider size (number of children served); ages of children served (birth to five, infants and toddlers only, preschool only, school -aged, and birth -to-five and school- aged); quality level (based on the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ) ratings) and participation in different programs and revenue streams. The dynamic nature of the model enables us to program assumptions about cost and revenue drivers that can then be adapted to vary based on these factors, as well as to include fixed costs and calculate variations in fixed, marginal, and total costs per child under different scenarios. ii. Provide complete and c urrent data: The District's 2021 Cost Estimation Model uses complete and current data from a variety of sources. Revenue data include the District's current and proposed subsidy reimbursement rates, reimbursement rates for the CACFP program, and Uniform Pe r Student Funding Formula. Cost data include data from the District of Columbia's current minimum wage, most recent salary information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics, District of Columbia Public Schools Salary Schedule, and data on facilities costs from the Low- Income Investment Fund (LIIF) . Assumptions and data on non -personnel costs, such as supplies, equipment, rent , or mortgage payments and food were updated using the consumer price index and refined through consultation with the District's child care providers , other District government agencies , and national and local experts, such as BUILD, Opportunities Exchange, and LIIF. iii. Use rigorous data collection procedures: The Office of the State Superintendent o f Education ( OSSE ) used data from public sources that use rigorous data collection and quality control measures (such as BLS data) and consulted with child care providers and national experts to validate and refine all data and assumptions incorporated int o the model. This consultation process included multiple focus groups with groups of child care providers representing the universe of child care in the District, as well as follow - up to collect more detailed information on specific data points raised in t hese conversations. iv. Reflect geographic variations: N/A - the District of Columbia has only one geographic 119 | P a g e area v. Analyze data in a manner that captures other relevant differences: The District of Columbia Cost Estimation Model is a flexible financial model that allows inputs and assumptions to be adjusted to test a wide variety assumptions and scenarios. Through testing different assumptions, we are able to analyze the fiscal impact of a wide variety of policies, programs (e.g. participation in the Pre- K Enh ancement and Expansion Program ( PKEEP ) or the Quality Improvement Network ( QIN)), provider business models, and operating conditions, including the impact of potential differences in providers' operating circumstances, enrollment, and costs as a result of the public health emergency. b. Given the impact of COVID -19 on the child care market, do you think that the data you gathered (as indicated in 4.2.1) on the prices or costs of child care adequately reflect the child care market as you submit this plan? No Yes. If yes, why do you think the data represents the child care market? The District of Columbia Cost Estimation Model is a flexible financial model that allows inputs and assumptions to be adjusted to test a wide variety assumptions and scenarios, i ncluding the impact of potential differences in providers' operating circumstances, enrollment, and costs as a result of the public health emergency. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) is in ongoing dialogue with child development facility leaders, including leaders of center- and home -based facilities, about how the public health emergency is impacting their programs' enrollment, costs, finances, staffing, and family and staff well- being, among other topics. 4.2.4 Describe how the marke t rate survey or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology reflects variations in the price or cost of child care services by: a. Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets). Describe: N/A - the District of Columbia has only one geographic area b. Type of provider. Describe: The District's alternative methodology used the D.C. Child Care Cost Estimation Model to separately models the costs for the three types of licensed providers that exist in the District: child development centers, child development homes, and child development expanded homes. c. Age of child. Describe: Within the models for each provider type, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) used the Child Care Cost Estimation Model to develop a variety of scenarios that reflect variation in ages of children served (e.g. birth to five, infants and toddlers only, preschool only, school -aged, and birth -to-five and school -aged) and reflect differences in group -sizes, adult:child ratios, and other regulatory requirements related to ch ild age. d. Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology, such as quality level. In addition to variations by provider type and children's ages, the District's alternative methodology used the D.C. Child Care Cost Estimation Model to model multiple scenarios that varied by by provider quality (as measured through Capital Quality, the District's tiered Quality Rating Improvement System ( QRIS )), size, and participation in different programs and revenue streams (including the Pre- K Enhancement and Expansion Program ( PKEEP ), the 120 | P a g e Quality Improvement Network (QIN), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program ( CACFP). 4.2.5 Has the Narrow Cost Analysis been completed for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan? No, a waiver is being requested in Appendix A. If no, describe the status of the Lead Agency's upcoming narrow cost analysis. Yes, the narrow cost analysis information is included in the report as described in 4.2.6. If yes, describe how the State/Territ ory analyzed the cost of child care through a narrow cost analysis for the FY 2022 - 2024 CCDF Plan, including: a. The methodology the Lead Agency used to conduct, obtain, and analyze data on the estimated cost of care (narrow cost analysis), including any re levant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child (98.45 (f)(ii)). As described in response to question 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, the Lead Agency used the D.C. Cost Estimation model as an approved alternative methodoloy. The D.C. Cost Estimation Model addresses the narrow cost analysis requirements to conduct, obtain, and analyze data on the estimated cost of care (including relevant variation by category of provider or age of child) taking into account the costs of providers' implement ation of health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements, and the cost of higher -quality care; and the D.C. Cost Estimation Model goes beyond these requirements to allow modeling of different scenarios and factors that affect providers' costs, revenues, and overall financial viability. The Lead Agency used information generated from the D.C. Cost Estimation Model to conduct the analysis of costs and of gaps between subsidy rates and costs to provide care required for the narrow cost analysis. b. How the methodology addresses the cost of child care providers' implementation of health, safety, quality and staffing requirements (i.e. applicable licensing and regulatory requirements, health and safety standards, training and professional development standards , and appropriate child to staff ratio, groups size limits, and caregiver qualification requirements (98.45 (f)(ii)(A)). The DC Cost Estimation Model is a flexible financial model that enabled the lead agency to estimate the cost of implementing federal and District health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements. The model's input tab determines the facility size by inputting the number of classrooms, and then calculates based on the corresponding group size limits for each age group. The number of ch ild care program administrative personnel are determined by facility size, and classroom teaching personnel are determined by ratio requirements for each age group. Teaching personnel qualification requirements are accounted for with the salary inputs for lead teachers, assistant teachers, and teacher aides/floaters. The analysis calculates the cost for classroom coverage throughout the day, as well as coverage for paid leave (including sick leave) and professional development release 121 | P a g e time. Data generated b y applying the D.C. Cost Estimation Model to various scenarios was used to conduct the narrow cost analysis. c. How the methodology addresses the cost of higher -quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or othe r system of quality indicators, at each level of quality (98.45 (f)(ii)(B)). The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) used the D.C. Cost Estimation Model to calculate the cost of care at each of the District's Capital Quality designation s: developing, progressing, quality, and high -quality. Each scenario accounts for the differences in personnel costs, administrative staff full- time equivalents and other relevant inputs needed to deliver care at each level of quality. Data generated by a pplying the D.C. Cost Estimation Model to various scenarios was used to conduct the narrow cost analysis. d. The gap between costs incurred by child care providers and the Lead Agency's payment rates based on findings from the narrow cost analysis. The Lead Agency used the cost estimates generated by the D.C. Child Care Cost Estimation Model to conduct the narrow cost analysis and calculate the cost of care per child annually, monthly, weekly, and daily. The Lead Agency reimburses child care facilities per child on a daily basis, so average daily cost per child is used to compare to the Lead Agency's current payment rates and identify and quantify gaps between current subsidy reimbursement rates for infants -toddlers and the estimated cost to deliver care, as presented below. Daily estimated average cost of care is calculated by dividing the annual estimated average cost of care by 260. Quality Designation Annual estimated average cost of care Daily estimated average cost of care Current daily reimbursement rate Gap between estimated cost of care and reimbursement rate Developing $20,132 market rate survey or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology, the Lead Agency must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or ACF pre - approved alternative methodology. The detailed report must also include the Narrow Cost Analysis, as described in 4.2.5, which estimates the cost of care (including any relevant variation by geographic location, category of provider, or age of child) necessary to support (1) child care providers' implementation of the health, safety, quality, and staffin g 122 | P a g e requirements, and (2) higher quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a quality rating and improvement system or other system of quality indicators, at each level of quality. For states without a QRIS or for a state with a QRIS system that is c urrently limited to only certain providers, those states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, school- age quality standards, or state defined quality measures.) The Lead Agency must make the report with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the report, including posting the results on the Lead Agency website. The Lead Agency must describe in the detailed report how the Lead Agency took into consideration the views and comments of the public or stakeholders. Describe how the Lead Agency made the results of the market rate survey or ACF pre- approved alternative methodology report widely available to the public (98.45(f)(1)) by respo nding to the questions below. a. Date the report containing results was made widely available \u2014no later than 30 days after the completion of the report. The Lead Agency will publish a report presenting the results of the alternative methodology and narrow co st analysis no later than 30 days after the submission of this plan. b. Describe how the Lead Agency made the detailed report containing results widely available and provide the link where the report is posted. The Lead Agency will make the detailed repor t widely available within the District's child care community by presenting report findings to stakeholder groups including the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (S ECDCC ), OSSE's Child Care Recovery Working Group, and the associations and provider groups consulted to inform the alternative methodology; through the Division of Early Learning newsletter; making the report available on the OSSE website here https://osse.dc.gov/publication/modeling- cost-child -care -district -columbia- 2021 ; and via social media. c. Describe how the Lead Agency considered stakeholder views and comments in the detailed report. The detailed report reflects the resul ts of adjustments to the D.C. Cost Estimation Model that the Lead Agency made in response to stakeholder input. For example, the Lead Agency adjusted staffing assumptions for expanded child car e homes and center administrative roles based on stakeholder fe edback, as well as data inputs for staff compensation and benefits. The detailed report also includes information about additional scenarios that the Lead Agency modeled in response to stakeholder input, including a scenario estimating the cost to deliver care with teacher salaries comparable to those of teachers in the District of Columbia Public Schools. T he Lead Agency will present a summary of the report findings to the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council prior to publication and incl ude feedback and input in the detailed report. 4.3 Establish Adequate Payment Rates 123 | P a g e The Lead Agency must set CCDF subsidy payment rates, in accordance with the results of the current MRS or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology, as identified in 4.2.1, at a level to ensure equal access for eligible families to child care services that are comparable with those provided to families not receiving CCDF assistance. Lead Agencies must also consider the costs of base and higher quality care at each level as part of its rate setting. The Lead Agency must re- evaluate its payment rates at least every 3 years. 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on the most recent MRS as identified in 4.2.1) for the following categories below. Lead Agencies are required to provide a summary of data and facts in their Plan to demonstrate how its payment rates ensure equal access. The preamble to the final rule (81 FR, p. 67512), indicates that a benchmark for adequate payment rates is the 75th percentile of th e most recent MRS. The 75th percentile is the number separating the lowest 75 percent of rates from the highest 25 percent. Setting rates at the 75th percentile, while not a requirement, would ensure that eligible children have access to three out of four child care slots. The 75th percentile benchmark applies to the base rates. Base rates are the lowest, foundational rates before any differentials are added (e.g., for higher quality or other purposes). Further, base rates must be sufficient to ensure th at minimum health and safety and staffing requirements are covered. Percentiles are not required if the Lead Agency conducted an ACF pre -approved alternative methodology, but must be reported if the Lead Agency conducted a MRS. For states that conduct an ACF pre-approved alternative methodology, report the base payment rates based on a full- time weekly rate. The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of the categories on which rates can be based and are not intended to be comp rehensive of all categories that might exist or to reflect the terms used by the Lead Agency for particular ages. If rates are not statewide, please use the most populous geographic region (defined as the area serving highest number of CCDF children) to re port base payment rates below. a. Fill in the table below based on either the statewide rates or the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF). To facilitate compiling state by state payment rates , provide the full time weekly base payment rates in the table below. If weekly payment rates are not published then the Lead Agency will need to calculate its equivalent. The below published rates reflect the rates established in existing regulations (DCMR 5A-203) . Beca use subsidy payment rates are set in regulations, OSSE must promulgate new regulations in order to update the rates , to take effect October 1, 2021 . Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting. (All rates are full- time) Base payment rate Full-time weekly base payment rate If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate? Infant (6 months) Center care $65.3 4 (day) $326.70 N/A 62% 124 | P a g e Toddler (18 months) Center care $65. 34 (day) $326.70 N/A 62% Preschooler (4 years) Center care $48.87 (day) $244.35 N/A 86% School -age child (6 years) Center care (Based on full -day, full-year rates that would be p aid during the summer.) $36.06 (day) $180.31 N/A 95% Infant (6 months) Family Child $50.46 112% Toddler (18 months) $50.46 (day) $252.30 N/A 112% Age of child in what type of licensed child care setting. (All rates are full- time) Base payment rate Full-time weekly base payment rate If the Lead Agency conducted an MRS, what is the percentile of the base payment rate? If the Lead Agency used an alternative methodology what percent of the estimated cost of care is the base rate? Family Child Care Preschooler (4 years) Family Child Care $30.84 (day) $154.20 N/A 69% School -age child (6 years) Family Child Care (Based on full -day, full-year rates that would be paid during the summer.) $28.00 (day) $140.00 N/A 104% c. b. If the L ead Agency does not publish weekly rates then how were these rates calculated (e.g., were daily rates multiplied by 5 or monthly rates divided by 4.3)? Rates were calculated by multiplying by 5 the current daily rates set in DCMR 5 - A203.2. These are the ra tes for a child development facility at the \"developing\" level, which is the lowest rating in the District's tiered Quality Rating and Improvement 125 | P a g e System (QRIS). During the public health emergency, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has implemented a public health emergency rate that increases daily per- child subsidy rates paid to child development facilities participating in the District's child care subsidy program by a fixed percentage calculated under a formula established in DCM R 5-A203.13 -17. This temporary increase in subsidy payment rates, which will remain in effect through the duration of the public health emergency, is not reflected in the rates above. Describe how the Lead Agency defines and calculates part-time and full -time care. Full Time Traditional: between 6 and 11 hours of care Part Time Traditional: less than 6 hours of care. d. Provide the date these current payment rates became effective (i.e., date of last update based on most recent MRS as reported in 4.2.1). Oct. 1, 2018 e. If applicable, identify the most populous area of the state (area serving highest number of children accessing CCDF) used to complete the responses above. N/A - the District of Columbia has only one geographic area f. Provide the citation, or link, if available, to the payment rates Click 5A g. If the payment rates are not set by the Lead Agency for the entire state/territory, describe how many jurisdictions set their own payment rates (98.16(i)(3)). N/A - the Lead Agency sets the rates for the entire sta te 4.3.2 Describe how and on what factors the Lead Agency differentiates payment rates. Check all that apply. a. Geographic area. Describe: b. Type of provider. Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by home or center, or relative and in -home care. Describe: c. Age of child. Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by the age of the child: infant and toddler (6 weeks to 2 years 11 months), pre -school (ages 3 and 4) and school age (age 5 through 12 years 11 months). Describe: d. Quality level. Describe: Child care provider payment rates are differentiated by the quality tier designation assigned in the Capital Quality Quality Rating Improvement System (QRIS) program (e.g. Preliminary, Developing, Progressing, Quality, High - Qualit y). e. Other . Describe: Payment rates are also differentiated by the amount of time a provider cares for a child (part-time, full- time, extended day, or nontraditional ) as well as for children with special needs. 4.3.3 Lead Agencies can choose to estab lish tiered rates, differential rates, or add -ons on top of their base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., a higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers to serve children with special needs and a s a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Lead Agencies may pay providers more than their private pay rates as an incentive or to cover costs for higher quality care (81 FR, p. 67514). 126 | P a g e Has the Lead Agenc y chosen to implement tiered reimbursement or differential rates? No Yes, If yes, identify below any tiered or differential rates, and at a minimum, indicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates, including if the rates were based o n the MRS or an ACF pre -approved alternative methodology. Check and describe all that apply. a. Tiered or differential rates are not implemented. b. Differential rate for non-traditional hours. Describe: c. Differential rate for children with specia l needs, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: d. Differential rate for infants and toddlers. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no separate bonus or add -on. Describe: e. Differential rate for school -age programs. Note: Do not check if the Lead Agency has a different base rate for school -age children with no separate bonus or add- on. Describe: f. Differential rate for higher quality, as defined by the state/territory. Describe: g. Other differential rates or tiered rates. Describe: Child development facilities that participate in the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) receive an enhanced reimbursement rate reflecting QIN participation. 4.3.4 Establishment of adequate payment rates. a. Desc ribe how base payment rates are adequate and enable providers to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements under CCDF, and how they were established based on the most recent MRS or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology and the Narrow Cost Analysis , as reported in 4.2.1 and 4.2.5.. In determining compliance with the Act for the equal access provisions in the FY2019 -2021 CCDF Plan, the OCC reviewed all the states with payment rates below the 75th percentile benchmark. Of those states, the hal f with the lowest payment rates were considered non -compliant and placed on a corrective action plan (CAP). These states all had rates below the 25th percentile for either some or all categories of care. The 25th percentile is not to be viewed as a benchma rk or a long -term solution to gauge equal access. It is also not to be viewed as sufficient for compliance in future plan cycles. OCC expects to continue to take action against states with the lowest rates in future plan cycles in an effort to keep payment rates moving upward toward ensuring equal access. Note: Per the preamble (81 FR p. 67512), in instances where an MRS or ACF pre -approved alternative methodology indicates that prices or costs have increased, Lead Agencies must raise their rates as a result. The current rates were established using information from the FY18 D.C. Cost Estimation Model analysis, which calculated the cost of delivering care in different settings, to children of different ages, and estimated the average cost of care at the v arying levels of quality in both centers and homes. This information informed setting of rates to fully cover the average cost of care for each Capital Quality designation and enable child care providers to meet health, safety, quality, and staffing requirements at all four Capital Quality (QRIS) designations. 127 | P a g e As described in response to question 4.2, the Lead Agency has completed the ACF -approved alternative methodology for the FY2022 -24 plan, is is preparing to promulgate regulations to set new subsid y reimbursement rates that are informed by that methodology , and projects they will be effective Oct. 1, 2021. The Lead Agency is using estimates generated from the most recent, updated, and ACF -approved cost estimation model to set base payment rates that reflect the average per child cost to deliver care and are adequate and enable child care providers to meet health, safety, quality and staffing requirements at all four Capital Quality (QRIS) designations. b. Describe the process used for setting rates, including how the Lead Agency factors in the cost of care, including any increased costs and provider fees because of COVID -19, and how such costs may be modified after the pandemic subsides . Current subsidy reimbursement rates established in DCMR 5 -A(203) were set in 2018, following completion of the alternative methodology conducted to inform rate -setting for the District's 2019 -2021 CCDF state plan. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) used the D.C. Cost Estimation model to calc ulated the cost to deliver care under a variety of scenarios that varied in terms of number and ages of children served, provider quality level, provider type, and provider participation in various programs. To inform the current subsidy reimbursement rate s, OSSE calculated the average cost of care for a representative program at each quality designation, not including participati on in any additional progra ms. OSSE set the infant- toddler rate for each quality designation tier to match the average cost of ca re calculated in this way for each quality designation tier, and adjusted other rates proportionate to the new infant -toddler rates. In December 2020, OSSE promulgated emergency and proposed regulations (DCMR 5 -A203.13- 17) establishing a public health em ergency rate that increases daily per -child subsidy rates by a fixed percentage calculated under a formula established in DCMR 5 -A203.13- 17. OSSE initiated the public health emergency rate following an analysis of the impact of the public health emergency on child care providers' costs to deliver care, as analyzed using the D.C. Cost Estimation Model. This analysis found that group size limitations imposed by health and safety guidance as well as increased costs for cleaning and supplies, significantly incr eased child development facilities' costs to deliver care. The formula created in the public health emergency regulations is designed to increase daily subsidy payment rates in proportion to the reduction in children's attendance in care due to the public health emergency. This temporary increase in subsidy payment rates will remain in effect through the duration of the public health emergency, until at least 30 days and no more than 90 day after the expiration of the public health emergency. OSSE is curr ently preparing to propose changes to DCMR 5 -A(203) in order to update the subsidy rates set in DCMR 5 -A(203.2- 7 and 203.10) to reflect increased costs in response to the findings of the alternative methodology and additional required updates (e.g. updated sliding fee scales and the recognition of Juneteenth as Federal holiday). OSSE does not anticipate changes to the public health emergency rate in these proposed regulatory changes, because under the existing regulations it will terminate naturally following the end of the public health 128 | P a g e emergency, and has proven to be a useful tool to stabilize child care provider revenues should a future public health emergency affect child care provider operations and enrollment. 4.3.5 Describe how the Lead Agency took the cost of higher quality, as determined in 4.2.5, into account, including how payment rates for higher -quality care, as defined by the Lead Agency using a QRIS or other system of quality indicators, relate to the estimated cost of care at each level of quality. Note: For states without a QRIS, the states may use other quality indicators (e.g. provider status related to accreditation, PreK standards, Head Start performance standards, or state -defined quality measures). As described in response to questi on 4.2.4, Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) used the D.C. Cost Estimation Model to calculate the cost of care for a variety of scenarios including scenarios that reflect each of the District's Capital Quality designations (developing, progressing, quality, and high -quality) as well as participation in various quality improvement programs (the Quality Improvement Network, Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Program). Each scenario accounts for the differences in personnel costs, administrat ive staff full- time equivalents and other relevant inputs needed to deliver care at each level of quality. At each Capital Quality designation, the reimbursement rate for full- day traditional infant -toddler care is set to match the estimated average per -child cost of care for a representative child development facility and other rates are adjusted proportionately . 4.3.6 Identify and describe any additional facts that the Lead Agency considered in determining its payment rates ensure equal access. If applicable , provide a description of how any additional health and safety costs, because of the COVID -19 pandemic are included in rate setting. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) establishes subsidy reimbursement rates based on a variety of factors, including the cost of care as estimated using the alternative methodology, previous child care subsidy payment rates, relative demand and supply or shortages for different types of care, considerations of equity across provider types and quality levels and the resources available to the District for child care subsidies. In December 2020, OSSE promulgated regulations (DCMR 5 -A203.13- 17) establishing a public health emergency rate that increases daily per- child subsidy rates by a fixed percentage calculated under a formula established in DCMR 5 -A203.13 -17. OSSE initiated the public health emergency rate following an analysis of the impact of the public health emergency on child care providers' costs to deliver care, as analyzed using the D.C. Cost Estimation Model. This analysis found that group size limitations imposed by health and safety guidance as well as increased costs for cleaning and supplies, significantly increased child development facilities' costs to deliver care. The formula created i n the public health emergency regulations is designed to increase daily subsidy payment rates in proportion to the reduction in children's attendance in care due to the public health emergency. This temporary increase in subsidy payment rates will remain i n effect through the duration of the public health emergency, until at least 30 days and no more than 90 day after the expiration of the public health emergency. Because the public health emergency rate is established in regulations, it will go into effect in the future to stabilize provider payments any time a public health emergency is declared that affects operations, enrollment, and/or attendance in child development facilities. . 129 | P a g e 4.4 Implement Generally Accepted Payment Practices and Ensure Timeliness of Payments Lead Agencies are required to demonstrate that they have established payment practices applicable to all CCDF child care providers that include ensuring the timeliness of payments by either (1) paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services or (2) paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. To the extent practicable, the Lead Agency must also support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by (1) paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance, (2) providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time, (3) providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month, or (4) using an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan (658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(2)). Lead Agencies are required to use CCDF payment practices that reflect generally accepted payment practices of ch ild care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF - funded assistance. Unless a Lead Agency is able to demonstrate that the following policies are not generally accepted in its particular state, territory, or service area or among particular cate gories or types of providers, Lead Agencies must (1) pay providers based on established part -time or full-time rates rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time and (2) pay for reasonable, mandatory registration fees that the prov ider charges to private -paying parents (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). Responses may also identify any additional health and safety fees providers are charging as a result of COVID -19. In addition, there are certain other generally accepted payment practices that are required. Lead Agencies are required to ensure that child care providers receive payment for any services in accordance with a payment agreement or an authorization for services, ensure that child care providers receive prompt notice of changes to a family's eligibility status that could impact payment, and establish timely appeal and resolution processes for any payment inaccuracies and disputes (98.45(l)(4) through (6); 658E(c)(2)(S)(ii); 98.45(l)(4); 98.45(l)(5); 98.45(l)(6)). 4.4.1 Certify by identifying and describing the payment practices below that the Lead Agency has implemented for all CCDF child care providers. a. Ensure the timeliness of payments by either (Lead Agency to implement at least one of the following): i. Paying prospectively prior to the delivery of services. Describe the policy or procedure. ii. Paying within no more than 21 calendar days of the receipt of a complete invoice for services. Describe the policy or procedure. Invoices are due by the fifth business day of the mon th for services rendered the previous month and payments are issued the last week of the month (approximately 10 -15 days between receipt of invoice and issued payment ). b. To the extent practicable, support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by: Note: The Lead Agency is to choose at least one of the following: I. Paying based on a child's enrollment rather than attendance. Describe the policy or procedure. . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) pays the full 130 | P a g e monthly rate, based on enrollment, for children who attend child care in a month and are absent 10 or fewer days (or 15 days if the absence is excused). For children who are absent more than 10 days in a gi ven month (or 15 days if the absences is excused) OSSE pays for up to 10 days of absences (or 15 days if the absence is excused) as well as any days that the child was in attendance. No documentation is required to support the unexcused absences. Excused a bsences must be accompanied by a doctor's note or other valid documentation submitted with the invoice. During the public health emergency, OSSE allows COVID -related absences to be counted as excused. OSSE's Child Care Subsidy Guidance dated February 19, 2 021 describes the documentation required for COVID - related absences. If a child has not attended child care at all in the past 60 days the program was open and serving children, the provider must terminate the child's enrollment and OSSE will discontinue p ayment to the provider. Providers must make at least two attempts to contact the parent/family of a non -attending child before terminating the child from the program. Cessation of payment due to non -attendance will not affect the child's subsidy eligibility: if the child re -enrolls or resumes attending at the same provider or another provider participating in the subsidy program, OSSE will resume pa yment to the provider on behalf of the child. Procedures for terminating enrollment due to non -attendance are outlined in OSSE's Frequently Asked Questions Supporting Subsidized Child Care Attendance and Payment: https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/COVID% 20Attendance%20FAQs%20Updated%20March%202021.pdf . ii. Providing full payment if a child attends at least 85 percent of the authorized time. Describe the policy or procedure .. iii. Providing full payment if a child is absent for 5 or fewer days in a month. Describe the policy or procedure. iv. Use an alternative approach for which the Lead Agency provides a justification in its Plan. If chosen, please describe the policy or procedure and the Lead Agency's justification for this approach. . c. The Lead Agency's payment practices reflect generally accepted payment practices of child care providers who serve children who do not receive CCDF subsidies. These payment practices must include the following two practices unless the Lead Agency provides evidence that such practices are not generally accepted in its state (658E(c)(2)(S); 98.45(l)(3)). i. Paying on a part -time or full- time basis (rather than paying for hours of service or smaller increments of time). Describe the policy or procedure and include a definition of the time increments (e.g., part time, full-time). Children are assigned to full- time or part -time traditional, extended day, or non - traditional services, depending on nee d for care. Hours are as follows: Full Time Traditional: between 6 and 11 hours of care Part Time Traditional: less than 6 hours of care. ii. Paying for reasonable mandatory registration fees that the provider charges to private - paying parents. Describe the policy or procedure. Child development providers are only able to charge parents the co -payment established by the lead agency and any late fees incurred by parents/guardians who do not pick their children up on time. The provider is not allowed to collec t any other fees from the parent/guardian, and collection of fees will result in the termination of the subsidized child care agreement. Since Oct. 1, 2018, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) has paid a $75 initial registration fee for children receiving subsidies to reflect the payment 131 | P a g e policies and practices of non -Child Care an d Development Fund ( CCDF ) providers. d. The Lead Agency ensures that providers are paid in accordance with a written payment agreement or an authorization for s ervices that includes, at a minimum, information regarding provider payment policies, including rates, schedules, any fees charged to providers, including fees related to COVID 19, and the dispute -resolution process. Describe: All child development facilities who participate in the subsidized child care program sign an annual agreement. The agreement details the following: general requirements for the provision of care and financial management requirements; attendance reporting and payment policies; reimbu rsement rates; sliding fee scale for parent co -payments; payment reconciliation and error reporting process for incorrect payments received; Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ) requirements; and dispute -resolution process. e. The Lead Agency provide s prompt notice to providers regarding any changes to the family's eligibility status that could impact payments , and such a notice is sent no later than the day that the Lead Agency becomes aware that such a change will occur. Describe: The Department of Human Services (DHS) conducts subsidized child care eligibility on behalf of the lead agency. DHS notifies the providers of a family's eligibility status, such as when a family's child care services are terminated at the 12 -month re -determination period. f. The Lead Agency has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: The Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services details the policies and procedures for dispute resolution and appeals. If informal disput e resolution attempts are unsuccessful, providers are able to submit a written statement and the Assistant Superintendent of Early Learning will render a decision within 30 days. The provider may appeal the decision within 15 days. The Superintendent has 3 0 days to reconsider and render a new decision . g. Other. Describe: . 4.4.2 Do payment practices vary across regions, counties, and/or geographic areas? No, the practices do not vary across areas. Yes, the practices vary across areas. Describe: . 4.4.3 Descr ibe how Lead Agencies' payment practices described in subsection 4.4 support equal access to a full range of providers. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) pays the full monthly rate, based on enrollment, for children who attend chi ld care in a month and are absent 10 or fewer days (or 15 days if the absence is excused). For children who are absent more than 10 days in a given month (or 15 days if the absences is excused) OSSE pays for up to 10 days of absences (or 15 days if the abs ence is excused) as well as any days that the child was in attendance. This policy is created to cover providers' fixed costs to deliver care and support equal access to a full range of providers, while also creating an incentive for providers to take step s to prevent or respond to chronic absenteeism, which prevents children from accessing care. OSSE has reduced barriers to provider participation by ensuring on -time and consistent payments to child care providers and pays a $75 initial registration fee fo r each subsidy eligible child to reflect the practices of private pay providers . OSSE is exploring alternative payment practices, such as grants or contracts for subsidized slots, as additional options to support equal access to a full range of providers, particularly for children with special needs. 4.5 Establish Affordable Co-Payments 132 | P a g e Family co-payments are addressed in Section 3 related to minimum 12 -month eligibility and the graduated phase -out provision and also in this subsection, because they are an important element for determining equal access. If a Lead Agency allows providers to charge amounts more than the required family co -payments, the Lead Agency must provide a rationale for this practice, including how charging such additional amounts will not negatively impact a family's ability to receive care they might otherwise receive, taking into consideration a family's co- payment and the provider's payment rate. 4.5.1 How will the Lead Agency ensure that the family contribution/co -payment, based on a sliding - fee scale, is affordable and is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF services (98.16 (k))? Check all that apply. a. Limit the maximum co-payment per family. Describe: The co -payment is applied only to the 2 youngest children receiving subsid y and does not exceed 7 percent of a family's income. The co -payment is only applied to family incomes above 100 percent of FPL. b. Limit the combined amount of co -payment for all children to a percentage of family income. List the percentage of the co -payment limit and describe. . c. Minimize the abrupt termination of assistance before a family can afford the full cost of care (\"the cliff effect\") as part of the graduated phase -out of assistance discussed in 3.2.5. Describe: . d. Other . Describe: . 4.5.2 Does the Lead Agency choose the option to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co -payment in instances where the provider's price exceeds the subsidy payment (98.45(b)(5))? No Yes. If yes: i. Provide the rationale for the Lea d Agency's policy to allow providers to charge families additional amounts above the required co-payment, including a demonstration of how the policy promotes affordability and access for families. . ii. Provide data (including data on the size and frequency of such amounts) on the extent to which CCDF providers charge additional amounts to families. iii. Describe the Lead Agency's analysis of the interaction between the additional amounts charged to families with the required family co -payment and the ability of current subsidy payment rates to provide access to care without additional fees. 5 Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings Lead Agencies are required to certify that there are in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services in the state/territory, which supports the health and safety of all children in child care. States and territories may allow licensing exemptions. Lead Agencies must describe how such licensing exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and development of CCDF children in license -exempt care (98.16 (u)). 133 | P a g e Lead Agencies also must certify that there are in effect health and safety standards and training requirements applicable to providers serving CCDF child ren whether they are licensed or license - exempt . These health and safety requirements must be appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served, must include specific topics and training on those topics, and are subject to monitoring and enforcement procedures. The organization of this section begins with a description of the licensing system for all child care providers in a state or territory and then moves to focus specifically on CCDF providers who may be licensed, or those exempt from licensing. The next section addresses child -staff ratios, group size limits, and required qualifications for caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.16(m)) serving CCDF children. The section then covers the health and safety requirements; standards, train ing, and monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure that CCDF child care providers comply with licensing and health and safety requirements (98.16(n)). Finally, Lead Agencies are asked to describe any exemptions for relative providers (98.16(l)). In some cases, CCDF health and safety requirements may be integrated within the licensing system for licensed providers and may be separate for CCDF providers who are license -exempt. In either case, Lead Agencies are expected to identify and describe health an d safety requirements for all providers receiving CCDF. Note: When responding to questions in this section, the OCC recognizes that each state/territory identifies and defines its own categories of care. The OCC does not expect states/territories to change their definitions to fit the CCDF -defined categories of care. For these questions, provide responses that closely match the CCDF categories of care. Criminal background check requirements are included in this section (98.16(o)). It is important to note that these requirements apply to all child care staff members who are licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law and all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services. Note: When asked for citations, responses can include state statute, regulations, administrative rules, policy manuals or policy issuances. See the Introduction on page 4 for more detail. 5.1 Licensing Requirements Each state/territory must certify it has in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services provided within the state/territory (not restricted to providers receiving CCDF funds) and provide a detailed description of these requirements and how the requirements are effectively enforced (658E(c)(2)(F)). If any types of providers are exempt from licensing requirements, the state/territory must describe those exemptions and describe how these exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, or development of children. The descriptions must also include any exemptions based on provider category, type , or setting; length of day; and providers not subject to licensing because the number of children served falls below a Lead Agency -defined threshold and any other exemption to licensing requirements (658E(c)(2)(F); 98.16(u); 98.40(a)(2)(iv)). 5.1.1 To ce rtify, describe the licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the state/territory by identifying the providers in your state/territory that are subject to licensing using the CCDF categories listed below. Check, identify, and describe all that apply, and provide a citation to the licensing rule. a. Center -based child care. 134 | P a g e i. Identify the providers subject to licensing: D.C. Code \u00a7 7 -2036 provides The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), with authority to s et forth and enforce all licensing requirements for child development facilities, which include center -based care. The licensing requirements are set forth in 5 -A District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. A licensed \"child development facility\" is any pe rson or persons, or entity or organization, whether organized formally or informally that provides care, education, and other services, supervision, and guidance for more than 2 infants, toddlers, and children that are not related, on a regular basis. \" Child development facility\" or \"facility\" includes A \"child development center\" or \"center\" means a Child Development Facility lo cated in premises other than a dwelling occupied by the operator of the Facility that serves more than 12 children . . ii. Describe the licensing requirements: The licensing requirements that govern center -based care include basic requirements for all licen sees. These include requirements for supervision, ratio and group size requirements; the health and safety standards for a child development facility's premise, including the supplies, equipment and environmental health; requirements for administration and operation; staff members' suitability for employment in a child development facility, including criminal background checks, traffic record checks, drug and alcohol testing provisions and health and safety training requirements; requirements for program act ivities that promote healthy development and basic health standards that must be in place to protect children, no matter what type of facility they attend. Child development centers must meet the all the requirements for all licensed child development facilities In addition, licensed child development centers must meet the additional requirements specific to child development centers , including staff qualification requirements . iii.

A child development home provides child care for up to a tot al of 6 children. Expanded child development home means a child development home in which child care is provided by 2 or more caregivers for up to 12 children. ii. Describe the licensing requirements: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) has authority to set forth and enforce all licensing requirements for child development facilities, which include care provided in a child development home or expanded home. The licensing requirements that govern care provided in a \"child development h ome\" or \"expanded home\" set forth standards for the basic requirements for all licensees, including requirements for supervision, ratio and group size requirements; the health and safety standards for a child development facility's premise, including the s upplies, equipment and environmental health; requirements for administration and operation; staff members' suitability for employment in a child development facility, including criminal background checks, traffic record checks, drug and alcohol testing pro visions, and health and safety training requirements; requirements for program activities that promote healthy development; and basic health standards that must be in place to protect children, no matter what type of facility they attend. Child Developmen t Homes must meet the all the requirements for all licensed child development facilities. In addition, licensed homes must meet additional requirements specific to child development homes , including staff qualifications requirements . iii. Provide the in the child's own) ( if applicable): i.

N/A 5.2 Standards for Ratios, Group Size and Qualifications for CCDF Providers 137 | P a g e Lead Agencies are required to have child care standards for providers receiving CCDF fun ds, appropriate to the type of child care setting involved, that address appropriate ratios between the number of children and number of providers in terms of the age of the children, group size limits for specific age populations, and the required qualifications for providers (658E(c)(2)(H); 98.41(d); 98.16(m)). For ease of responding, this section is organized by CCDF categories of care, licensing status, and age categories. Respondents should map their Lead Agency categories of care to the CCDF categorie s. Exemptions for relative providers will be addressed in subsection 5.6. 5.2.1 Describe how the state/territory defines the following age classifications. For instance, Infant: 0 -18 months. a. Infant. Describe: Birth to 12 months b. Toddler. Describe: 12 to36 m onths c. Preschool. Describe: 36 to60 months but younger than school -age d. School -Age.

Ratio: When children of different ages are combined in one group, the adult -to-child ratio fo r the youngest child shall apply B. Group size: When children of different ages are combined in one group, the adult -to- child ratio for the youngest child shall apply vi. If any of the responses above are different for exempt child care centers, describe the rat io and group size requirements for license -exempt providers. The District does not exempt any child care centers. b. Licensed CCDF family child care home providers: i. Mixed -Age Groups A. Ratio: 5-A DCMR \u00a7 121.3(c ) outlines the adult to child ratio and maximum number of children allowed in a child development home and expanded home ser ving infants, toddlers, and /or preschoolers and providing out of school time care to school age children. The ratio requirements depend on the number of children in care and the ages of those children. See 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 121.3(c).

Lead Agencies are required to have minimum pre -service or orientation training requirements (to be completed within 3 months), as appropriate to the provider setting and the age of children served. This training must address the required health and safety topics (658E(c)(2)(l)(i) and the content area of child development. Lead Agencies have flexibility in determining the number of training hours to require, and they may consult with Caring for our Children Basics for best practices and the recommended time needed to address these training requirements. Lead Agencies must also have ongoing training requirements for caregivers, teachers, and directors who are caring for children receiving CCDF funds (658E(c)(2)(I)(i); 98.44(b)(1)(iii)). Lead A gencies are to report the total number of ongoing training hours that are required each year, but they do not have to report these hours out by topic (658E(c)(2)(G)(iii). Ongoing training requirements will be addressed in 5.3.13. Both preservice/orientati on and ongoing trainings should be a part of a broader systematic approach and progression of professional development (as described in section 6) within a state/territory. States and territories must have health and safety standards for programs (e.g., ch ild care centers, family child care homes, etc.) serving children receiving CCDF assistance relating to the required health and safety topics as appropriate to the provider setting and age of the children served (98.41(a)). This requirement is applicable t o all child care programs receiving CCDF funds regardless of licensing status (i.e., licensed or license -exempt). The only exception to this requirement is for relative providers, as defined in 98.2. Lead Agencies have the option of exempting relatives fro m some or all CCDF health and safety requirements (98.42(c)). Exemptions for relative providers' standards and training requirements will be addressed in question 5.6.3.

Overall, a licensed provider shall conform, to the extent practic able, to the National Health and Safety Performance Standards to ensure the safety and welfare of children and the cleanliness and sanitary conditions of the Facility, per 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 142.2. 146 | P a g e Section 151 of the licensing regulations sets forth the requireme nts for excluding both children and staff from the facility due to illness. A child who exhibits 1 or more symptoms of an illness must be isolated and parents contacted. After being treated for the symptom(s) by a licensed health care practitioner, the child may be readmitted to the Facility only with written permission, and written instructions for continuing care if needed, from a licensed health care practitioner. Section 152 of the licensing regulations sets forth the requirements for required health e xaminations and immunizations. All facilities must have complete documentation of a comprehensive physical health examination, which shall include evidence of age appropriate health examinations or screenings and up -to-date immunizations, and, for each chi ld three years of age or older, evidence of an oral health examination. Additionally, facilities are required to obtain the Certificate of Immunization Compliance, issued by the District of Columbia Department of Health, which certifies that the facility has reached the District's immunization compliance target of 98 percent for enrolled children and staff. Section 130 provides the recordkeeping requirements for a child enrolled at the facility. These records are necessary to protect the health and safety of children in care as operational control requires that information regarding each child in care be kept and made available on a need -to know basis. Section 131 requires a facility to maintain results of staff member's pre -employment physical examinations , annual physical examinations, and immunizations as they are necessary to ensure children's health and safety. Licensing regulations also seek to prevent and control infectious diseases by setting forth requirements for: handwashing, specifically under w hat circumstances hand washing and hand sanitizing are required for staff, volunteers, and children and specific hand washing and hand sanitizing procedures, see 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 143; diapering, specifically requiring maintaining a diaper changing area within arm's reach of a properly maintained a source of running water and soap that is not in the kitchen or eating area and procedures for soiled diapers, see 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 145; water play, specifically prohibiting the use of bottles, cups and glasses during water ta ble play because the presence of these items encourages children to drink from them and contamination of hands, toys, and equipment in the room in which play tables are located may play a role in the transmission of diseases, see 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 157; the remova l or covering of shoes prior to entering an infant play area to protect infants from hazardous toxins, see 5 -A DCMR \u00a7 124. ii. Describe any variations in the standard(s) by category of care (i.e. Center, FCC, In - home), licensing status (i.e. licensed, licens e-exempt), and the age of the children in care.

Provide the citation(s) for this policy or procedure. 5.4.4 Inspections for license -exempt in -home care (care in the child's own home). Lead Agencies have th e option to develop alternate monitoring requirements for care provided in the child's home that are appropriate to the setting. A child's home may not meet the same standards as other child care facilities and this provision gives Lead Agencies flexibilit y in conducting more streamlined and targeted on -site inspections. For example, Lead Agencies may choose to monitor in -home providers on basic health and safety requirements such as training and background checks. Lead Agencies could choose to focus on hea lth and safety risks that pose imminent danger to children in care. This flexibility cannot be used to bypass the monitoring requirement altogether. States should develop procedures for notifying parents of monitoring protocols and consider whether it woul d be appropriate to obtain parental permission prior to entering the home for inspection (98.42(b)(2)(iv)(B)). a. To certify, describe the policies and practices for the annual monitoring of license - exempt in- home care, including if monitoring is announced or unannounced, occurs more frequently than once per year, and if differential monitoring procedures are used. In-home care providers are subject to an annual monitoring visit by the assigned Education Service Monitor (ESM) which will include an inspecti on of health records for caregiver and child, training records, as well as ensuring that the home meets health and safety requirements. The monitoring visit reviews items pertaining to training, attendance, meals, activities, and health and safety requirem ents. The monitoring ensures that criminal background checks and suitability determinations have been made and health certificates and first aid and CPR certifications are current. b. Provide the citation(s) for this policy or procedure. Pursuant to DC Co de \u00a74 -411, in -home care providers must enter into an agreement to provide subsidized child care services. Through the provider agreement, which establishes a contractual relationship, license exempt in -home providers and relative providers are required to comply with annual unannounced and announced visits by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Division of Early Learning education service monitors to ensure compliance with the provider agreement. c.

There is no specific citation for this policy. 5.4.6 The states and territories shall have policies and practices that require the ratio of licensing inspectors to child care providers and facilities in the state/territory to be maintained at a level sufficient to enable the state/territory to conduct effective inspections of child care providers and facilities on a timely basis in accordance with federal, state, and local laws (658E(c)(2)(K)(i)(III); 98.42(b)(3)). a. To certify, describe the state/territory policies and practices regarding the ratio of licensing inspectors to child care providers (i.e. number of inspectors per number of child care providers) and fac ilities in the state/territory and include how the ratio is sufficient to conduct effective inspections on a timely basis. Currently, the ratio of licensing inspector to child development facility is 1:47. The current ratio does allow for effective and e fficient inspections and monitoring as we have a three -year licensing requirement. All inspections and follow -up visits are completed within the required timeframe. Although this ratio is one of the lowest in the surrounding area, we are adding capacity to further reduce the case load for staff. b. Provide the policy citation and state/territory ratio of licensing inspectors. N/A 5.5 Comprehensive Background Checks The CCDBG Act requires states and territories to have in effect requirements, policies and procedur es to conduct comprehensive background checks for all child care staff members (including prospective staff members) of all child care programs that are 1) licensed, regulated, or registered under state/territory law; or, 2) all other providers eligible to deliver CCDF services (e.g., license -exempt CCDF eligible providers) (98.43(a)(1)(i)). Background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation, including contract employees and self -employed indivi duals; whose activities involve the care or supervision of children; or who has unsupervised access to children (98.43(2)). For family child care homes, this requirement includes the caregiver and any other adults residing in the family child care home who are age 18 or older (98.43(2)(ii)(C)).

Career pathways. Describe: The Office of the State Superi ntendent of Education (OSSE) worked with a regional advisory group that consist ed of representatives from the DC -Maryland -Virginia area to develop a competency -based career pathway for the E arly Childhood Education (ECE) workforce that was published in the fall of 2019. OSSE ensures that all ECE professionals are aware of the general responsibilities, minimum education requirements, and professional develop ment opportunities available for each designated position through multiple public education efforts. O SSE offers a resource webpage for ECE professionals to learn about position responsibilities, education requirements and available programs and resources for furthering one's education and career. Additionally, OSSE has a live ECE Help Desk that the workfo rce can call or email for information, technical assistance and connections to resources. The Professional Development Information System (PDIS), OSSE's Workforce Registry, allows early childhood educators to learn about career opportunities (e.g., trainin gs), build their electronic resume, build their own electronic portfolio of educational credentials and more. PDIS is intended to allow ECE professionals to use their stored documents to request to be assigned to a career level based on their education credentials and professional trainings. Through this system, the workforce can appl y for an OSSE - certified review of their credentials for a professional certificate indicating the positions for 211 | P a g e which they are qualified to be employed; this certificate is called the Credential Verification Certificate and the levels are primarily based on the years of experience and credential(s) obtained. OSSE also offers scholarship grant opportunities for the Child Development Associate credential, associate degree, and bac helor's degree in early childhood education. iii. Advisory structure. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) works with the Program Quality Committee of the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC ) to receive advisement on programming relating to workforce development that includes professional development offerings, outreach efforts and resource development.

OSSE solicits public comment on any policy or regulation changes. Additionally, OSSE is a member of the Early Childhood -Higher Education Collaborative , which aims to develop progra mming opportunities for the ECE workforce in coordination with local postsecondary representatives. OSSE conducts surveys through its workforce programs and its live ECE Help Desk to determine the needs of the local workforce and identify hurdles preventin g early childhood educators and prospective early childhood educators from accessing the existing resources . OSSE regularly collaborates with administrators of the Child Development Associate ( CDA ) programs within the District and convenes the CDA Administ rators Committee as an opportunity for different CDA program s in the Distric t to collaborate on topics such as , CDA candidate needs , program needs and the workforce pipeline. iv. Articulation. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is a member of the Early Childhood -Higher Education Collaborative, as are the local universities that offer early childhood -related degree programs. The colleges have confirmed the articulation of the Child Development Associate (C DA) credential in to up to six college credits . OSSE's grantees offering the CDA program and the District's T .E.A.C.H. program supporting associate and bachelor's degree scholarships funded by OSSE work with college representatives on behalf of Early Childhood Education (EC E) professionals to aid in the articulation of college credits for the CD A and professional development with associated continuing education units (CEUs). Some university partners are willing to accept both CDA and CEU s for college credit , but this differs based on university . OSSE continues to work with the Council for Professional Recognition (issuer of the CDA) to help facilitate the articulation of CEUs and the CDA at local universities. v. Workforce information. Describe: The Office of the State Superin tendent of Education (OSSE) collects workforce data from several sources and tools to gain a robust understanding of the District's Early Childhood Education ( ECE) workforce to aid in programmatic planning. The data collection tools include the Professiona l Development Information System (PDIS), Division of Early Learning Licensing Tool (DELLT), the ECE Help Desk, Quorum (online learning platform) , and feedback from professional development information sessions, and an annual assessment of professional deve lopment offerings . The various workforce data collected include current position, education credentials , completed professional development, and years of experience. OSSE is in the process of modernizing our data systems , which will result in an 212 | P a g e integrated data system that houses child, family, facility, provider and workforce data. OSSE is working with the vendor for this project to identify options to maximize this system to strengthen workforce data. Additionally, OSSE requires its grantees offering Child Development Associate ( CDA ) program s and the District's T.E.A.C.H. program funded by OSSE , to collect data on the ECE professionals participating in the programs such as : city ward of employment, salary and career pathway goal. vi. Financing.

These training opport unities on a variety of topics are provided by approved trainers, based on the Core Knowledge Areas (CKA) mentioned previously , reviewed and approved by OSSE and administered through DC Child Care Connections , as well as sister agencies and partners. There are course options in English and Spanish , with a limited number of trainings in Amharic. . Trainings are offered in person and through virtual learning platforms, such as GoToMeeting and Webex. OSSE also offers a variety of opportunities to earn PLUs and Continuing Education Units (CEUs) through online learning platforms such as Quorum. Quorum is an online learning platform that provides more than 160 hours of courses and the ability to complete the required CDA coursework online. Quorum courses are offere d in English and Spanish. The CDA and CEUs may articulate into college credits at local institutions of higher educations, depending on the institution and program. ii. Engagement of training and professional development providers, including higher educ ation, in aligning training and educational opportunities with the state/territory's framework. Describe : The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has a robust, research -based Trainer Approval Program (TAP) that ensures the child care w orkforce has access to a wide variety of quality training opportunities that improve their knowledge, skills, and competency in early childhood development from infancy through pre -K to kindergarten. TAP certifies both individual and organizational profess ional development trainers that provide ongoing training and professional development opportunities in the 11 Core Knowledge Areas (CKAs ) that detail the specific knowledge and skills needed by early childhood professionals to work effectively with all you ng children and families. A variety of professional development ( PD) opportunities are afforded through OSSE grantees, a contract with Quorum , and partnerships with other government agencies (e.g., DC Health , Department of Behavioral Health, etc. ). Additio nally, the Strong Start program within 213 | P a g e OSSE , DC's early intervention program, is approved to provide training opportunities to the workforce, and does so on a regular basis. Their trainings focus on healthy development, supports for young children and fami lies and screening tools, such as the Ages and Stages Questio nnaire. iii. Other. Describe: 6.1.2 Describe how the state/territory developed its professional development framework in consultation with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Educ ation and Care (if applicable) or similar coordinating body if there is no SAC that addresses the professional development, training, and education of child care providers and staff . OSSE work s with the Program Quality Committee of the State Early Childho od Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC ) to receive advisement on programming relating to workforce development that includes professional development offerings, support to degree programs, resource development and other topics as the committee deems n eeded at any given time. Changes or additions to the Core Knowledge Areas (CKA) are reviewed and approved by the SECDCC. 6.1.3 Describe how the framework improves the quality, diversity, stability, and retention of caregivers, teachers, and directors (98.44(a)(7)). The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) seeks to promote diversity, stability, retention, and progression of the early childhood workforce through numerous professional development (PD) opportunities , scholarship and grant opportunities t hat enable child care professionals to access to programs at little or no cost to them , including those that are funded by OSSE and by other District government entities (e.g. the Early Childhood Tuition Assistance Program administered by the University of the District of Columbia and the Mayor's Scholars and D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant programs administered by OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education) . The ECE Help Desk and OSSE grantees also support the child care workforce t o access grants and scholarships from federal and other sources . OSSE strives to recruit and retain diverse educators by providing PD and continuing education opportunities tailored to the diversity of the District's early childhood workforce and broader p opulation . OSSE works diligently to review, refine, and modify PD offerings based on feedback from the workforce, and uses data from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System for Pre-K and the Environment Rating Scales observations to understand areas for improvement and target PD according. PD opportunities are also offered in English and Spanish, with a limited number of courses provided in Amharic. OSSE also administers a Child Development Associate ( CDA ) Training and Scholarship program via two grantees that offer their program in English, Spanish and Amharic languages based on the needs of the current and prospective workforce . The OSSE -sponsored e -learning platform for the Early Childhood Education ( ECE) workforce , Quorum, offers courses in English and Spanish including all coursework needed to obtain a CDA. In alignment with the DC Language Access Act, OSSE strives to reach individuals across the District by making publications available in the six most common languages spoken. Providing targeted PD, sc holarship opportunities, and learning opportunities in at least three languages, OSSE works 214 | P a g e to support the workforce in achieving quality, diversity, retention, and stability in the District. 6.2 Training and Professional Development Requirements The Lead Agency must describe how its established health and safety requirements for pre - service or orientation training and ongoing professional development requirements \u2014as described in Section 5 for caregivers, teachers, and directors in CCDF programs \u2014align, to the extent practicable, with the state/territory professional development framework. These requirements must be designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children and to improve the kn owledge and skills of the child care workforce. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children receiving CCDF funds across the entire age span, from birth through age 12 (658E(c)(2)(G)). Ongoing training and professional development should be accessible and appropriate to the setting and age of the children served (98.44(b)(2)). 6.2.1 Describe how the state/territory incorporates into training and professional development opportunities: the knowledge and application of it s early learning and developmental guidelines (where applicable); its health and safety standards (as described in section 5); and social- emotional/behavioral and mental health of young children intervention models, which can include positive behavior inte rvention and support models that reduce the likelihood of suspension and expulsion of children (as described in Section 2 of the Pre- Print) (98.44(b)). The District's training and professional development requirements are enumerated in the Child Developmen t Facility Licensing Regulations. Training requirements include pre - service, orientation and annual health and safety training ; courses in the DC Early Learning Standards, the District's early learning and developmental guidelines , and courses in developme ntally appropriate methods of positive behavior intervention and support. As a result of the updated DC Early Learning Standards, a training and professional development rollout plan was developed. Training of trainers has been held for both community -base d organizations and local education agencies on the updated stan dards. Additionally, the required health and safety trainings are provided through both online (Quorum e -learning platform) and in -person opportunities . Health and safety training requirements can be tracked for each individual employee th rough a tracker embedded in the dashboard of the Professional Development Information System (PDIS). OSSE has intentionally increased the availability of training and supports related to social- emotional /behav ioral deve lopment and mental health intervention models in response to the need. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) works through partnerships internally (i.e., Strong Start) , and with other DC agencies (e.g., the Department of Behavioral Health, DC Health , Early Stages ) to provide trainings to providers. Community of practice meetings are held monthly for providers participating in Capital Quality, DC's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). In addition to the previously men tioned courses, OSSE also provides access to an online learning platform , Quorum, to providers 215 | P a g e that allow s them to take courses toward the CDA credential, some of the licensing requirements, as well as course offerings on resiliency, trauma and behavior management. 6.2.2 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development are accessible to providers supported through Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving CCDF funds (as applicable) (98.44(b)(2)(vi)).

Describe how the state/territory will recruit and facilitate the participation of providers in the subsidy system: a. with limited English proficiency. Currently, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) offers more than 1 60 courses available in Spanish through an online learning platform , Quorum . In-person trainings are often available in Spanish or with interpretation services. OSSE engages regularly with the District's M ulti-cultural Spanish -Speaking Providers Association and ensures that course descriptions for all courses offered in Spanish are translated and sent directly to the assoc iation. Additional training has been developed in Amharic and OSSE hopes to expand available opportunities in the Amharic language based on demand. CDA training and scholarship programs are also available in both Amharic and Spanish. OSSE's recruitment and communication strategy also seeks to engage providers with limited English proficiency to participate in Capital Quality. Capital Quality engages the community through the My Child Care DC website, the OSSE website and through DC Child Care Connections, t he District's child care resource and referral ( CCR&R ) agency . Capital Quality employs staff who speak Spanish and Amharic, and all staff have access to the language access line for any individual that may have questions or want to learn more about the initiative. b. who have disabilities. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) provides outreach and services to eligible persons with disabilities. Customer service sites (e.g., the OSSE office building, Child Care Resource and R eferral (CCR&R) or CCR&R service centers) are accessible and comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. The online learning platform also supports individuals with limited mobility. Online trainings and in -person trainings offer information in multiple modalities to ensure that individuals with disabilities can access the content . Multiple modes of communication are available to support individual needs. All providers, including those with disabilities, are encouraged to participate in Capital Qualit y, the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System. Quality facilitators who support Capital Quality receive training, technical assistance and coaching to support providers, families and children with special needs. . 6.2.4 Describe how the state/territory's training and professional development requirements are appropriate, to the extent practicable, for child care providers who care for children receiving child care subsidies, including children of different age groups (such as specialized credenti als for providers who care for infants and/or school -age children); English -language 216 | P a g e learners; children with developmental delays and disabilities; and Native Americans, including Indians as defined in Section 4 of the Indian Self -Determination and Educati on Assistance Act (including Alaska Natives) and Native Hawaiians (98.44(b)(2)(iv)). The District's training and professional development requirements enumerated in the Child Development Facilities Licensing Regulations specify the following topic areas supportive of child care providers who care for children receiving child care subsidies, English learners and children with developmental delays and disabilities : community health and social services resources for children and families; developmentally app ropriate methods of positive behavior intervention and support; developmentally appropriate programming for infants, toddlers, preschool and/or school- age children, as applicable; enhancing self -regulation and self -esteem in children; and inclusion of chil dren with special needs, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Training and professional development is provided by DC Child Care Connections, the Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) program , along with support from sister agencies, as well as local and national experts in early care and education. CCR&R has extensive experience and strong relationships in the communities where children receiving subsidized child care live. CCR&R utilizes this expertise, in coordination with their local and national networks , to cultivate training opportunities that are reflective of the needs of children and families participating in the subsidized child care program and the providers serving them . CCR&R has increased training and professional development offerings on social- emotional development and trauma -informed practice based on feedback from the community and in response to the needs of the children and families served. These training opportunities are available across OSSE's Professional Development Information System (PDIS), Quorum e-Learning platforms, and other online and in -person sessions. OSSE, with the support of the CCR&R , also manages the Trainer Approval Program (TAP) to ensure that early learning trainers are individuals and organizations that possess professional career experiences, expertise, and education in the field that are both relevant and aligned with the mission of the Division of Early Learning and the District's early childhood context. CCR&R develops the training sessions and descriptions along with the training partners and submits them (includes information on the duration of the training, the aligned Core Knowledge Area (CKA), and number of Professional Learning Unites (PLUs) participants will receive) to OSSE for approval prior to the courses being offered.. These courses and course descriptions are reviewed and approve by OSSE on a rolling basis as new trainings are developed. Through this process, OSSE and CCR&R work to ens ure that all trainings offered are reflective of the community served, including children participating in subsidized child care, as well as the needs of the facilities and educators who serve them. In addition, the District's Quality Rating and Improvem ent System, Capital Quality , provides training, technical assistance, one -on-one coaching that is tailored to the needs of child care providers serving children in the District's child care subsidy system . The Communities of Practice and other supports tha t Capital Quality provides for all participating providers are informed by data on participating providers' needs and strengths, including consideration of the needs of children and families served, and 217 | P a g e coaching and technical assistance for each provider are customized based on the provider's Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP), self- assessment, and consideration of the needs of families and children served. 6.2.5 The Lead Agency must provide training and technical assistance (TA) to providers and appropriate Lead Agency (or designated entity) staff on identifying and serving children and families experiencing homelessness (658E(c)(3)(B)(i)). a. Describe the state/territory's training and TA efforts for providers in identifying and serving children and their families experiencing homelessness (relates to question 3.2.2).

X X 6.3.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 6.3 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) uses a variety of indicators to track progress in supporting training and professional development of the Child Care Workforce. Specifically, OSSE tracks the following related to training and professional development (PD): 1) PD registration rates; PD participation rates; 3) utilization of course offerings; 4) highest rates of attendance based on topic, as well as time/day of the week; 5) PD satisfaction rates; and 6) an annual PD survey developed to support providing offerings based on identified needs and interests. OSSE also takes into consideration areas for improvement identified by performance on the observation metrics, the Environment Rating Scales (ERS) and Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). OSSE also develops goals and indicator for the scholarship programs that are funded through OSSE. For the scholarship program, OSSE sets annual enrollment go als for both the Child Development Associate (CDA) program, as well as the associate and bachelor's degree program. When considering the CDA program, OSSE tracks the following: 1) community engagement/recruitment opportunities; 2) enrollment rates; 3) CDA completion rates; 4) cohort information, such as cohort primary language (i.e., Amharic, English, or Spanish); 5) renewal supports provided; 6) supports provided for scholars who completed their coursework on the online learning system. For the associate a nd bachelor's degree program, OSSE tracks the following: 1) community 231 | P a g e engagement/recruitment; 2) applicants; 3) number of enrolled scholars; and 4) number of students who matriculate in a given year. OSSE also surveys the workforce at least once annually to confirm the status of the workforce and track progress towards meeting credential requirements. Survey responses provide indicators of whether early educators : 1) have completed an education program; 2) are enrolled in an education program; or 3) are no t currently enrolled in an education program. This helps OSSE target supports and education needs by ward and by facility. 6.4 Early Learning and Developmental Guidelines 6.4.1 States and territories are required to develop, maintain, or implement early learning and developmental guidelines that are appropriate for children in a forward progression from birth to kindergarten entry (i.e., birth to three, three to five, birth to five), describing what children should know and be able to do and covering the essential domains of early childhood development. These early learning and developmental guidelines are to be used statewide and territory -wide by child care providers and in the development and implementation of training and professional development (658 E(c)(2)(T)). The required essential domains for these guidelines are cognition, including language arts and mathematics; social, emotional, and physical development; and approaches toward learning (98.15(a)(9)). At the option of the state/territory, early learning and developmental guidelines for out-of-school time may be developed. Note: States and territories may use the quality set -aside, discussed in section 7, to improve on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guideline s. a. Describe how the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines address the following requirements: i. Are research -based. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) published the updated District of Columbia Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) in 2019. The updated edition of the DC ELS is a response to the evolution of the standards movement in early care and education throughout the country. The DC ELS include alignment with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics (2010) as well as the Next Generation Science Standards (2013). The standards are also aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework: Ages Birth to Five (2015), thus ensuring that all children receive the same standards -based instruction and appropriate learning experiences regardless of program auspices. ii. Developmentally appropriate. DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS ) are research -based and intentionally broken down by age levels appropriate for the growth and deve lopment continuum. Those age levels include infants, toddlers, 2-year- olds, preschoolers, pre -K exit expectations and kindergarten exit expectations to ensure developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) and standards by subject. iii. Culturally and linguistically appropriate. The DC E arly Learning Standards (DC ELS) is designed to outline developmental 232 | P a g e trajectories for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abilities. The DC ELS is published in seven languages including English, Spanish, Amharic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese and French. Indicators, examples and supportive practices are culturally sensitive and inclusive of children and families diverse backgrounds. iv. Aligned with kindergarten entry. The DC Early Learning Standards ( DC ELS ) include indicators for infants, toddlers, 2 - year- olds and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for children leaving pre -K and kindergarten . The kindergarten exit expectations mirror the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathe matics and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) v. Appropriate for all children from birth to kindergarten entry . The DC Early Learning Standards ( DC ELS ) include indicators for infants, toddlers, 2 - year- olds and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for children leaving pre -K and kindergarten . These standards provide parents and teachers with information about expectations for what children know and are able to do and describe how children progress at various ages and development levels. They fo cus on the whole child and include a broad range of domains because young children's learning and development are interrelated and cross all areas of learning. vi. Implemented in consultation with the educational agency and the State Advisory Council or similar coordinating body. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) consulted and worked with the State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC), local educational agencies (LEAs), community -based organizations (CBOs) and oth er stakeholders to create an implementation plan that laid out activities for the state, partners and LEAs to accomplish and the timeline for doing so . Representatives from each stakeholder group were also included in the revision process and on committees based on their area of expertise. The rollout plan for the updated standards included training for LEAs and CBOs. b. Describe how the required domains are included in the state/territory's early learning and developmental guidelines. Responses for \"other\" are optional. i. Cognition, including language arts and mathematics. Fourteen standards cover these domains , including the following: Demonstrates understanding of spoken language; Uses language to express self; Uses conventional grammar and syntax; Uses con ventional conversational and other social communication skills; Demonstrates understanding of print concepts; Demonstrates comprehension of printed materials read aloud; Hears and discriminates the sounds of English and/or home languages; Writes letters an d words; Understands the purpose of writing and drawing; Matches, groups and classifies objects; Demonstrates knowledge of numbers and counting; Demonstrates knowledge of volume, height, weight and length; Identifies and labels shapes; and Demonstrates un derstanding of positional words. 233 | P a g e ii.

The social and emotional domain includes six standards for children's learning and development: Expresses a variety of feelings and learns to manage them; Recognizes the feelings and rights of others and responds appropriately; Manages own behavior; Develops positive relationships with adults; Engages and plays with peers; and Resolves conflicts with others. iii. Emotional development The social and emotional domain includes six standards for children's learn ing and development: Expresses a variety of feelings and learns to manage them; Recognizes the feelings and rights of others and responds appropriately; Manages own behavior; Develops positive relationships with adults; Engages and plays with peers; and Resolves conflicts with others. iv. Physical development. This domain includes two standards for children's learning and development: Demonstrates strength and coordination of large muscles; and Demonstrates strength and coordination of small muscles. This dom ain also includes health and safety standards t hat cover the following: Demonstrates behaviors that promote health and safety; and Demonstrates competent eating behaviors through the maintenance of positive eating attitudes, optimal food acceptance skills, self- regulation of food intake, mindful food choices and positive body image. v. Approaches toward learning. This domain includes four standards for children's learning and development: Attends and engages with curiosity; Shows persistence; Approaches task s flexibly; and Uses symbols and takes on pretend roles. vi.

Describe how the state/territory' s early learning and developmental guidelines are 234 | P a g e updated and include the date first issued and/or the frequency of updates . The DC Common Core Early Learning Standards (DC CCELS) were originally adopted in 2012. In May 2017, the Office of the State Superi ntendent of Education (OSSE) launched a process to review the DC CCELS with a goal of considering additions in key areas to better align with the Head Start Early Learning Framework, Next Generation Science Standards, arts integration and to address the ne eds of dual or mul ti language learners. OSSE collaborated and worked with several stakeholders, including individuals from local education agencies, national agencies, federal agencies, child care providers and experts working with the WestEd Mid Atlantic Comprehensive Center in reviewing and updating the DC CCELS . A draft of the enhanced standards was shared with different stakeholders within the District before finalizing the document . In October 2019, the updated DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS ) and implementation plan were completed. The Division of Early Learning will continue to follow activities set in the implementation plan and will continually look for ways to keep the standards up to date . d. If applicable, discuss the state process for the adop tion, implementation, and continued improvement of state out -of-school time standards . N/A e.

The primary purpose of the DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) is to ensure that children in the District of Columbia have the kinds of rich and robust early learning experiences that prepare them for success in school and for lifelong learning. The DC ELS include s indicators for infants, toddlers, 2-year -olds and preschoolers, as well as exit expectations for children leaving pre -K and kindergarten. The kindergarten exit expectations mirror the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). To achieve this goal, the Early Learning Standards should be used as: A resource for guiding the selection and implementation of curriculum; A focus for discussion by families, educators, community members and policymakers regarding the c are and education of young children; A guide for selecting assessments appropriate for children from a variety of backgrounds with differing abilities; A guide for planning experiences and instruction that enable children to make progress in meeting the st andards; and A framework for planning professional development opportunities for education staff. 235 | P a g e 6.4.3 If quality funds are used to develop, maintain, or implement early learning and development guidelines, describe the measurable indicators that will be used to evaluate the state/territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services and the data on the extent to which the state/territory has met these measures (98.53(f)(3)). Local funds are used to develop, maintain or implement the DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS). 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to use a portion of their Child Care and Development Fund program expenditures for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and to increase parental options for and access to high -quality child care (98.53). The quality activities should be aligned with a statewide or territory -wide assessment of the state's or territory's need to carry out such services and care. States and territories are required to report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1. In the CCDF Plan , the ACF 118, states and territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the 3 -year period (658G( b); 98.16(j)). 2. In the annual expenditure report, the ACF -696, ACF will collect data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities. This report will be used to determine compliance with the required quality and infant and toddler spending requirem ents (658G(d)(1); 98.53(f)). 3. For each year of the Plan period, states and territories will submit a Quality Progress Report, the ACF 218, that will include a description of activities funded by quality expenditures and the measures used by the state/territ ory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory (658G(d); 98.53(f)). States and territories must fund efforts in at least one of the following 10 activities: Supporting the training and p rofessional development of the child care workforce (Addressed in Section 6) Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and developmental guidelines (Addressed in Section 6) Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rati ng and improvement system or other systems of quality improvement for child care providers and services Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers Establishing or expanding a statewide system of child care resource and referral services Supporting compliance with state/territory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in section 5) 236 | P a g e Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the state/territory , including evaluating how programs positively impact children Supporting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation Supporting the development or adoption of high -quality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development Performing other activities to improve the quality of child care services, as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well- being, or kindergarten entry are possible Througho ut this Plan, states and territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, quality set-aside funds, and will describe the measurable indicators of progress used to evaluate state/territory progress in improving the quality of child care services for each expenditure (98.53(f)). These activities can benefit infants and toddlers through school -age populations , and all categories of care. It is important that while Lead Ag encies have the flexibility to define \"high quality\" and develop strategies and standards to support their definition, Lead Agencies should consider how that definition and those strategies for different provider types reflect and acknowledge their unique differences and how quality varies in different settings, including family child care and small care settings as well as child care centers . This section covers the quality activities needs assessment, quality improvement activities, and indicators of prog ress for each of the activities undertaken in the state or territory . 7.1 Quality Activities Needs Assessment for Child Care Services 7.1.1 Lead Agencies must invest in quality activities based on an assessment of the state/territory's needs to carry out those activities. Lead Agencies have the flexibility to design an assessment of their quality activities that best meet their needs, including how often they do the assessment. Describe your state/territory assessment process, including the frequency of assessment (658G(a)(1); 98.53(a)). The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has recently completed multiple needs assessments for early childhood care and education in the District of Columbia, including the PDG Birth to Five needs asses sment (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/PDG%20B - 5%20Truncate d%20Needs%20Assessment%206.4.20.pdf ) and the Early Head Start and Head Start Needs Assessment for the District of Columbia (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/PDG%20B - 5%20Truncated%20Needs%20Assessment%206.4.20.pdf ), conducted by Child Trends. Both of these needs assessments took comprehensive approach to assessing the current state and needs of early childhood in the District of Columbia, including child and family demographics, early learning and other programs supporting young children and their families; quality, accessibility, reach of and gaps in existing prog ramming; and strengths, weaknesses, and implications for efforts to improve early childhood outcomes and supports for children, families and communities. And both needs assessments provided rich information on existing quality and supply of child care serv ices in the District, as well as strengths, weaknesses, 237 | P a g e challenges and opportunities to increasing access to and quality of care. On an ongoing basis , Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System, provides information about the qu ality of care as assessed using evidence based observational tools, the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (ITERS -3), Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (FCCERS -3) and Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre -K (CLASS Pre -K), which are conducted annually for providers participating in Capital Quality. The first ratings under Capital Quality occurred in fall 2019 and provide information about the current distribution of quality among child development facilities in the District . Collection of ITERS, FCCERS and CLASS Pre -K data was paused from spring 2020 through spring 2021 due to coronavirus (COVID -19) public health emergency but will continue annually once data collection and the rating process are able to resume. In addition to the formal assessments, child care providers participating in Capital Quality complete a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan ( CQIP) that includes a self -assessment aligned with 10 evidence - based quality standards. OSSE and the Capital Quality grantee review CQIP data annually to inform the resources and supports made available to providers through Capital Quality and for all child care providers in the District . 7.1.2 Describe the findings of the assessment and if any overarching goals for quality improvement were identified. If applicable, include a direct URL/website link for any available evaluation or research related to the findings. The PDG Birth to Five needs assessment (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/PDG %20B -5%20Truncated%20Needs%20Assessment%206.4.20.pdf ) and the Early Head Start and H ead Start Needs Assessment for the District of Columbia (https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ osse/page_content/attachments/PDG %20B -5%20Truncated%20Needs%20Assessment%206.4.20.pdf ), identified a number of themes , several of which inform overarching goals for quality improvement in the District of Columbia: First, wards 7 and 8 lack high -quality e arly care and education for infants and toddlers, before - and after- care for school- aged children, and nontraditional -hours' care for children under age 12 . Second, there is a need for more training, coaching and postsecondary opportunities and supports to retain and develop the early childhood workorce Third, there are needs to build capacity of the early childhood workforce and programs to implement trauma informed practices and support mental health of children, families, and the early childhood workforc e Fourth, there is a need for further training and supports on working with children who have special needs and culturally and linguistically diverse families Capital Quality data provides additional insights on specific strengths and weaknesses of qual ity within child development facili ties: In the 2018 -19 program year, OSSE found over 90 percent of all pre -K classrooms in the District met or exceeded the District's established floors in each of three domains of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) ( Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support ) , but the percentage of programs meeting or exceeding the target was much higher for Emotional Support and Classroom Organization compared to Instructional Support , suggesting a need to focus quality 238 | P a g e improvement in this domainData also showed that Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domain scores have remained stable over the past five years while the average Instructional Support score has increased , suggesting that strategies to improve Instructional Support are producing results . For the Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale -Revised ( ITERS -R), OSSE found that 81 percent of classrooms met or exceeded the floor although no classrooms met the target. For the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale-Revised (FCCERS -R) OSSE found that 65 percent of classrooms met or exceeded the floor and 10.5 percent met or exceeded the target. Bec ause observation data from these measures is only available for2017 -18 and 2018- 19, it is not yet possible to track trends over time. These findings help OSSE target training and professional development, particularly towards trainings focused on the DC Common Core Early Learning standards to improve those teacher -child interactions mea sured by the Instructional Support domain and towards trainings focused on infant/toddler teachers and family child care homes. 7.2 Use of Quality Funds 7.2.1 Check the quality improvement activities in which the state/territory is investing.

State general funds 7.3 Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) or Another System of Quality Improvement Lead Agencies may respond in this section based on other systems of quality improvement, even if not called a QRIS, as long as the other quality improvement system contains the elements of a QRIS. QRIS refers to a systematic framework for evaluating, improving, and communicating the level of quality in early childhood programs and contains five key elements: 1. Program standards 2. Supports to programs to improve quali ty 3. Financial incentives and supports 4. Quality assurance and monitoring 5. Outreach and consumer education 7.3.1 Does your state/territory have a quality rating and improvement system or another system of quality improvement? a. No, the state/territory has no plans for QRIS development. If no, skip to 7.4.1. b. No, but the state/territory is in the QRIS development phase. If no, skip to7.4.1. c. Describe Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS operating statewide or territory -wide. Describe how the QRIS is admin istered (e.g., statewide or locally or through CCR&R entities) and any partners, and provide a link, if available. The District's QRIS, Capital Quality, is administered statewide. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) serves as the lead agency and a grantee provides one -on-one technical assistance and coaching to child development homes and centers through early childhood coachin g 241 | P a g e professionals, known as Q uality Facilitators. Capital Quality includes 10 quality indicators that early ch ildhood care and education providers use to complete a web -based self- assessment of their child development homes and centers. These 10 quality indicators include : 1) curriculum and instruction are aligned to DC Early Learning Standards (DC ELS); 2) Formal and informal assessments are aligned to curriculum; 3) Formal and informal assessments are implemented; 4) Data are used to inform instructional and professional practices (C LASS Pre -K and/or ITERS -3 and/or FCCERS -3 are used to inform instructional and pr ofessional practices); 5) Culturally and linguistically responsive practices are implemented; 6) Inclusion practices are implemented; 7) Develo pmental screenings are implemented; 8) Early care and education professionals meaningfully engage in professional development; 9) Family engagement promotes positive and goal -oriented relationships; and 10) Mission statements are reflective of both the program and the families served. OSSE collects and analyzes the Continuous Quality Improvement Plan (CQIP ) (self- assessment data annually to inform the resources and supports providers receive as participants in Capital Quality . OSSE also collects feedback on the CoP meetings and on providers' experience with their quality facilitators. In addition to the self- assessmen t, OSSE collects and analyzes the CLASS Pre -K, ITERS -3 and FCCERS -3 data to evaluate progress and determine areas where supports are needed. The following is a link to the Capital Quality website, which provides additional information: https://osse.dc.gov/page/capital -quality -qris. d. Yes, the state/territory has a QRIS initiative operating as a pilot -test in a few localities or only a few levels but does not have a fully operating initiative on a statewide or territory -wide basis. Provide a link, if available. e. Yes, the state/territory has another system of quality improvement. Describe the other system of quality improvement and provide a link, if available. 7.3.2 Indicate how providers particip ate in the state or territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement. a. Are providers required to participate in the QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply if response differs for different categories of care. i. Parti cipation is voluntary. ii. Participation is partially mandatory. For example, participation is mandatory for providers serving children receiving a subsidy, participation is mandatory for all licensed providers or participation is mandatory for programs serving children birth to age 5 receiving a subsidy. If checked, describe the relationship between QRIS participation and subsidy (e.g., minimum rating required, reimbursed at higher rates for achieving higher ratings, participation at any level). According to Section 102 of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Title 5, Chapter 5 -A1, child development facilities that receive Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF ) funding must participate in the District's Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ), while licensed non -subsidy pro viders may elect to participate. The Capital Quality designation determines the tiered reimbursement rate for subsidy providers. In Capital Quality, subsidy providers are reimbursed based on four designations , 242 | P a g e or tiers (Developing, Progressing, Quality and High -Quality ), with the highest level of quality rece iving the highest tiered reimbursement rate. iii. Participation is required for all providers. b. Which types of settings or distinctive approaches to early childhood education and care participate in the state/territory's QRIS or another system of quality improvement? Check all that apply. i. Licensed child care centers ii. Licensed family child care homes iii. License -exempt providers iv. Early Head Sta rt programs v. Head Start programs vi. State pre-kindergarten or preschool programs vii. Local district -supported pre-kindergarten programs viii Programs serving infants and toddlers ix. Programs serving school -age children x. Faith -based settings xi. Tribally operated programs xiv. Other. Describe: c. Describe how the Lead Agency's QRIS, or other system for improving quality, considers how quality may look different in the different types of provider settings which participate in the QRIS or other system of qu ality improvement. For instance, does the system of quality improvement consider what quality looks like in a family child care home with mixed -age groups vs. child care centers with separate age groups? Or are standards related to quality environments fle xible enough to define quality in home -based environments, as well as child care center environments? The District developed its Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ), Capital Quality, to be reflective of and responsive to the different types of pr ovider settings participat ing in the QRIS. The observation measures used in licensed child care centers, t he Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (ITERS -3) and Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre -K (CLASS Pre -K), are specific to those settings and the observation measure used in licensed family child care homes, the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (FCCERS -3), is specific to those settings. All observation measures used are valid and reliable measures of early care and education program quality and accurately measure quality across different program ty pes such as Early Head Start, state pre-kindergarten ( i.e., the District's Pre-K Enhancement and Expansion Program), faith -based settings and other programs. 7.3.3 Identify how the state or territory supports and assesses the quality of child care providers. The Lead Agency may invest in the development, implementation, or enhancement of a tiered quality rating and improvement system for child care providers and serv ices or another system of quality improvement. Note: If a Lead Agency decides to invest CCDF quality dollars in a QRIS, that agency can use the funding to assist in meeting consumer education requirements (98.33). If the Lead Agency has a QRIS, respond to questions 7.3.3 through 7.3.6. 243 | P a g e Do the state/territory's quality improvement standards align with or have reciprocity with any of the following standards? No Yes. If yes, check the type of alignment, if any, between the state/territory's quality standards a nd other standards. Check all that apply. a. Programs that meet state/territory p re-K standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a reciprocal agreement between pre-K pro grams and the Quality Rating and improvement System). b. Programs that meet federal Head Start Program Performance Standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, there is a recipro cal agreement between Head Start programs and the Quality Rating and Improvement System ). c. Programs that meet national accreditation standards are able to meet all or part of the quality improvement standards (e.g., content of the standards is the same, an alternative pathway exists to meeting the standards). d. Programs that meet all or part of state/territory school -age quality standards. e. Other. Describe: 7.3.4 Do the state/territory's quality standards build on its licensing requirements and other regulatory requirements? No Yes. If yes, check any links between the state/territory's quality standards and licensing requirements. a. Requires that a provider meet basic licensing requirements to qualify for the base level of the QRIS . b. Embeds licensi ng into the QRIS. is \"rated\" license. d. Other. Describe: 7.3.5 Does the state/territory provide financial incentives and other supports designed to expand the full diversity of child care options and help child care providers imp rove the quality of services that are provided through the QRIS or another system of quality improvement. No Yes. If yes, check all that apply. a. If yes, indicate in the table below which categories of care receive this support. Financial incentive or o ther supports Licensed center - based License exempt center - based Licensed family child care home License exempt care in the provider's home In-home (care in the child's own home) 244 | P a g e One-time grants, awards, or bonuses Ongoing or periodic quality stipends Higher subsidy payments Training or technical assistance related to QRIS Coaching/mentoring Scholarships, bonuses, or increased compensation for degrees/certificates Materials and s upplies Priority access for other grants or programs Tax credits for providers Tax credits for parents Payment of fees (e.g. licensing, accreditation) b. Other: 7.3.6 Describe the measurable indicat ors of progress relevant to subsection 7.3 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. Capital Quality , the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System, assesse s quality based on the following evidence -based assessments : Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale, Third Edition (ITERS -3) Family Child Care Environ ment Rating Scale, Third Edition (FCCERS -3) Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Pre -K Depending on the type of setting (i.e., center -based or family -based provider) and the age ranges of the children served (e.g., preschool -age only, birth to 5) in the facility, the results of one or more of these measures (CLASS Pre -K, ITERS -3 and/or FCCERS -3) are used to calculate a facility's Capital Quality rating, which translates into a Capital Quality designation of developing, progressing, quality and high -quality. Aggregate data from the three assessments are used to evaluate progress and determine areas in which supports are needed . OSSE has adopted evidence -based floors and targets for each measure, based on publisher recommendations and analysis 245 | P a g e of national data and research on each tool. For ITERS -3 and FCCERS -3 the floor is 3 and the target is 6 (on a 1 to 7 scale) . CLASS yields three program -level domain scores on a scale of 1 to 7 ; floors are 4.5 for the Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domains and 2 for the Instructional Support domain , and targets are 5 for the Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domains and 4 for the Instructional Support domain. OSSE and the Capital Quality grantee track aggregate data on the average sco re across all participating providers on each measure, as well as the percentage of programs meeting or exceeding the floor or target, with a goal of reducing the percentage of programs below the floor and increasing the number meeting or exceeding the tar get. Additionally, OSSE has established a goal that at least 50 percent of child development programs participating in the subsidy program will achieve designations of quality or high quality. In fall 2019, 41.2 percent of child development facilities participating in the subsidized child care program achived a designation of quality or high quality . 7.4 Improving the Supply and Quality of Child Care Programs and Services for Infants and Toddlers Lead Agencies are required to spend 3 percent of their total C CDF expenditures on activities to improve the supply and quality of their infant and toddler care. This is in addition to the general quality set -aside requirement. Lead Agencies are encouraged to use the required needs assessment to systematically review and improve the overall quality of care that infants and toddlers receive, the systems in place or needed to support and enhance the quality of infant and toddler providers, the capacity of the infant and toddler workforce to meet the unique needs of very young children, and the methods in place to increase the proportion of infants and toddlers in higher quality care, including any partnerships or coordination with Early Head Start and IDEA Part C programs. 7.4.1 Identify and describe the activities that are being implemented by the state/territory to improve the supply (see also section 4) and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers and check which of the activities are available to each provider type. 246 | P a g e Activiti es available to improve the supply and quality of infant and toddler care.

Establis hing or expanding high - quality community - or neighborhood -based family and child development centers. These centers can serve as resources to child care providers to improve the quality of early childhood services for infants and toddlers from low - income families and to improve eligible child care providers' capacity to offer high- quality, age - appropriate care to infants and toddlers from low -income families. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) received one of eight state level Early Head Start -Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) grants to provide high- quality, comprehensive, early childhood development services to at -risk children in wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; the wards demonstrating the most need and which have the highest at-risk populations. These funds were layered with local funds supported by the Early Learning Quality Improvement Network Amendment Act of 2015 to create and support community -based Quality Improvement Networks (QIN) comprised of two neighborhood -based hubs (one of the two are funded by local and federal funds and one of the two is funded by local funds only) that are responsible for providing comprehensive services and quality improvement technical assistance to a network of child development centers and child development homes. These centers and homes agreed to meet Early Head Start Program Performance Standards and use funds to provide services to EHS -eligible and low -income children through converting existing subsidy slots or adding EHS -CCP slots. Funds are used to cover technical assistance and the provision of comprehensive services. At the time of writing, this grant has contributed to the following outcomes: provision of service to 366 children (using federal funds) and an additional 294 (using lo cal and philanthropic funds). The first iteration of the federally funded grant concluded in the fall of 2019 and a new QIN grant was awarded for the period 2019 - 2024. OSSE also received additional federal funding to expand the QIN . 248 | P a g e b. Establishing or expanding the operation of community -based, neighborhood- based, or provider networks comprised of home -based providers, or small centers focused on expanding the supply of infant and toddler care. Describe: As part of the Q uality Improvement Network (QIN), t he Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) awarded a locally funded grant to a community -based organization to serve as a hub and provide technical assistance and training and coordinate comprehensive servi ces for a network of child development homes that primarily serve infants and toddlers. The hub agency supports 18 child development home providers. The hub is supporting the network in achieving Early Head Start quality in their programs. The hub provides continuous job embedded professional development and coaching to the staff, comprehensive services, health services, support in nutrition and wellness, as well as support to engage families in the programs. OSSE also used Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF ), Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental funds, and local fun ds to support shared services business services for child development homes to enhance efficiencies and allow home providers to have more time and resources to focus on quality improvem ent strategies. 249 | P a g e c. Providing training and professional development to enhance child care providers' ability to provide developmentally appropriate services for infants and toddlers. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education 's (OSSE's ) approved professional development offerings, available through the child care resource and referral (CCR&R) program , Quorum, and the Professional Development Information System (PDIS) , include numerous professional development opportunities spe cifically focused on building early educators ' ability to provide developmentally appropriate services for infants and toddlers . The District networks with sister agencies and partner organizations to provide free training and technical assistance, includi ng the following courses specific to infants and toddlers: The DC Early Learning Standards; Infant Safe Sleep Practices; Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (ITERS- 3) and the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (FCCERS -3) training; Stewards of Children; Nutrition for Infants and Toddlers; Ages and Stages Questionnaire; Developmentally Appropriate Practice for Infants and Toddlers; and Trauma and Resilience: Building Strength in Children . Early childhood educato rs can also access scholarships through the OSSE -funded T.E.A.C.H. program or a separate scholarship program operated by the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) to complete UDC's associate degree program with an infant/toddler course concentration . 250 | P a g e 251 | P a g e d. Providing coaching, mentoring, and/or technical assistance on this age group's unique needs from statewide or territory -wide networks of qualified infant /toddler specialists. Describe: The District develops and maintains a number of netw orks of qualified infant -toddler specialists who support child development centers and homes by providing coaching, mentoring and/or technical assistance on infants' and toddlers' unique needs. These networks include the grant -funded Quality Improvement Ne twork (QIN) coaches, grant -funded Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) quality facilitators and Trainer Approval Program (TAP) trainers. The QIN coaches and infant and toddler specialists are trained in the Program for Infant/Toddler Care (PITC) co aching model and provide weekly coaching and support to infant and toddler teachers. QIN coaches also work directly with child development centers and homes onsite to provide coaching and technical assistance toward alignment to Early Head Start Program Performance Standards. QRIS quality facilitators coach center directors and home providers in the development of a continuous quality improvement plan for their facility, providing tailored technical assistance around 10 quality indicators. These services are free -of-cost to child development centers and homes, and both the QIN and QRIS networks facilitate opportunities for peer mentoring through ongoing community of practice sessions for center directors and home providers. 252 | P a g e e. Coordinating wi th early intervention specialists who provide services for infants and toddlers with disabilities under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.). Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE ) is the lead agency for the District's Early Intervention (Part C) Program (DC EIP). The mission of the DC Early Intervention Program is to identify and serve infants and toddlers, birth through 2 years, with developmental delays and disabilities and thei r families. As the single point of entry for infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays and disabilities from birth to the third birthday, DC EIP identifies and evaluates infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays and provides h igh-quality, age - appropriate early intervention services for eligible infants/toddlers and their families. DC EIP coordinates services in a caring manner that supports the culture and meets the needs of families. OSSE incorporates the requirements under IDEA, Part C - Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD); monitoring and compliance; fiscal oversight; training and technical assistance; data collection and reporting; public awareness; procedural safeguards and policy development. In its overall administration, DC EIP maintains both in -house and contracted staff to provide child find; evaluation/assessments; direct early intervention services; and service coordination. DC EIP serves more than 2,000 children and their families per year. 253 | P a g e f. Developing infant and toddler components within the state/territory's QRIS, including classroom inventories and assessments. Describe: The District' s Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ), Capital Quality, is inclusive of settings se rving children birth -5, including infants and toddlers. As of October 202 1, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) uses the Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale -3 and the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale -3 for annual as sessments in classrooms and family child care homes serving infants and toddlers .. Providers receive training and support leading up to and following the annual assessment. g. Developing infant and toddler components within the state/territory's child care licensing regulations. Describe: The licensing regulations have standards that are specific to Infants and toddlers. Some examples include ratio, group size, indoor program space requirements, and general furnishing, food and nutrition, equipment and supplies requirements. 254 | P a g e h. Developing infant and toddler components within the early learning and developmental guidelines. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) published the updated District of Columbia Early Learning Standards (DC ELS) in 2019. DC ELS are research -based and intentionally broken down by age -levels appropriate for the growth and development continuum. Those age levels include infants, toddlers, 2s, preschoolers, pre -K and kindergarten to ensure developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) and standards by subject. DC ELS also include indicators for infants, toddlers, 2s and preschoolers, as well as exit expect ations for children leaving pre - K and kindergarten . These standards provide parents and teachers with information about expectations for what children know and are able to do and describe how children progress at various ages and development levels. They f ocus on the whole child and include a broad range of domains because young children's learning and development are interrelated and cross all areas of learning. 255 | P a g e Activities available to improve the supply and quality of infant and toddler care.

Improving the ability of parents to access transparent and easy -to- understand consumer information about high -quality infant and toddler care that includes information on infant and toddler language, social - emotional, a nd both early literacy and numeracy cognitive development. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) awarded a grant to one primary community - based organization, which oversees both the Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS), Capital Quality, and the child care resource and referral program (CCR&R) to provide consumer education to families for the period 2019 -2023. The CCR&R provides families with a provider listing and current QRIS rating information that meets their identi fied needs. This information is also available on the My Child Care DC website, where families may register for and compare child care options in their selected area and for their selected age group. My Child Care DC serves as a hub for both providers and families to access information related to licensed child development facilities across the district This website also lists the Capital Quality designation for subsidized and other participating program s. Additionally, informational brochures are distribut ed to parents that address the importance of quality and different child care options in the District. CCR&R shares program information with families seeking child care through a variety of mediums including an online database, walk -in consultation, email and phone referrals. 256 | P a g e j. Carrying out other activities determined by the state/territory to improve the quality of infant and toddler care provided within the state/territory and for which there is evidence that the activities will lead to imp roved infant and toddler health and safety, cognitive and physical development, and/or well - being. The Early Head StartChild Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) grant increases the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care in the District of Columbia (DC) by providing a model for scaling up quality improvement efforts for infants and toddlers across the District . OSSE leveraged the EHS -CCP g rant to develop the Quality Improvement Network (QIN). The QIN increases access to comprehensive child development and family support services. The locally funded Access to Quality Child Care Expansion Grant makes grants for child development facility construction or renovation to create new infant and toddler slots in the District. Providers who operate in or plan to expan d to underserved areas are prioritized to receive this funding. The first round of Access to Quality grants increased the number of available infant and toddler slots by 1,244 through September 2020. k. Coordinating with child care health consultants. Describe: NA 257 | P a g e l. Coordinating with mental health consultants. Describe: Infants and toddlers enrolled in the Quality Improvement Network ( QIN) classrooms have access to mental health consultation via an interagency agreement with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) . Each participating provider is assigned a mental health consultant to work with on a weekly basis. OSSE is partnering with DBH to expand access to mental health consultation during the period of the FY2022 -24 CCDF State Plan . m. Establishing systems to collect real time data on available (vacant) slots in ECE settings, by age of child, quality level, and location of program. Describe: . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) coordinates with the child care resource and referral (CCR&R ) program on collecting vacancy information at the same time they are confirming the facility's open/closed status. The information is tracked through a data system showing a breakdown by age, location and quality le vel and shared with OSSE on a weekly basis . OSSE is also using Coronavirus Relief and Response Supplemental Appropriations funds to enhance the capacity of the CCR&R to collect and use data on vacancies and exploring how work currently underway to update OSSE's internal data systems can further enhance these efforts. n. Other . Describe: 7.4.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.4 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child 258 | P a g e care programs and services for infants and toddlers within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. Through Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Impro vement System (QRIS), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) measures the quality of child care programs serving infants and toddlers using the Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (ITERS -3) (for child development centers) and the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition ( FCCERS -3) (for child development homes and expanded homes). ITERS -3 is an observation measure designed to assess programs serving children from birth to 30 months. It measures spatial, programmatic and interpersonal features of the program environment. FCCERS -3 is an observation measure designed to assess family child care programs conducted in a provider's home for children from infancy through school age. Similarly, it measures spatial, programmatic and interpersonal features of the program environment. These two measures contain measurable indicators that can help OSSE to track progress related to improvements in the health and safety of children (e.g., adequate space and furnis hings, appropriate personal care routines) for infant and toddlers in center -based care and family -home provider care. OSSE has adopted evidence -based floors (3 on a 1 to 7 scale) and targets (6 on a 1 to 7 scale) for each both ITERS -3 and FCCERS -3 and tr acks progress on the programs' progress toward the target scores (e.g., 6) for the ITERS -3 and FCC ERS-3 subscales. In 2018- 19 81 percent of infant -toddler classrooms met or exceeded the floor on the ITERS -3 although no classrooms met the target. For the F CCERS -R 65 percent of homes met or exceeded the floor and 10.5 percent met or exceeded the target. Bec ause observation data from these measures is only available for 2017 -18 and 2018- 19, it is not yet possible to track trends over time. These findings hel p OSSE target training and professional development, particularly towards trainings focused on the DC Common Core Early Learning standards to improve those teacher -child interactions measured by the Instructional Support domain and towards trainings focuse d on infant/toddler teachers and family child care homes. To address the shortage of infant -toddler care in the District, OSSE also tracks progress on indicators of infant -toddler supply, including the number of licensed slots available for infants and tod dlers, the number of infant and toddler slots in programs that participate in the child care subsidy system, and the number of slots available in underserved communities in Wards 7 and 8. OSSE also tracks indicators of progress for specific investments in increasing infant and toddler supply, such as the Access to Quality program, which created 1,244 new infant and toddler slots from 2018 -2020. These indicators all contribute to measuring progress toward's OSSE's strategic goal that the percentage of infan ts and toddlers in programs achieving \"quality\" and \"high - quality\" designations in Capital Quality will increase over time and that 1,500 more infants and toddlers will be enrolled in quality or high -quality programs by the end of 2023 (compared to 2019), as set in OSSE's strategic plan (https://osse.dc.gov/strategicplan ). 259 | P a g e 7.5 Child Care Resource and Referral A Lead Agency may expend funds to establish, expand, or maintain a statewide system of child care res ource and referral services (98.53(a)(5)). It can be coordinated, to the extent determined appropriate by the Lead Agency, by a statewide public or private non -profit, community -based, or regionally based lead child care resource and referral organization (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii)). This effort may include activities done by local or regional child care and resource referral agencies, as discussed in section 1.7. 7.5.1 What are the services provided by the local or regional child care and resource and referral agencies? The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) provides a grant to a local community -based organization to operate the state- wide child care resource and referral (CCR&R) program , providing families and providers with responsive services and evidence - based supports that promote improved access to high - quality early care and education in the District of Columbia. The CCR&R includes a hotline, two walk -in service centers with lending libraries, and a website to improve access to and awareness of community resources that improve family engagement and the home -school connection. CCR&R also hosts weekly opportunities for families to engage in learning opportunities aimed at supporting their children, as well as additional topics based on th e needs of the community served. The CCR&R is also responsible for the implementation of the Trainer Approval Program (TAP) and professional development course offerings. 7.5.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.5 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The child care resource and refe rral ( CCR&R ) system tracks each contact made with families, providers and others by phone, by email, on their website and in person. This information is tracked in a Quick Base application and is reviewed and analyzed on a monthly basis. Enrollment, attenda nce and professional development offerings are also tracked to help better coordinate services for families and providers. Measurable indicators include : the numbers of contacts made with families (e.g., for child care referrals) and providers (e.g., for t echnical assistance) ; visits to the website and lending libraries ; books and other resources downloaded and borrowed from the website and lending libraries ; and enrollment and attendance at the professional development trainings. 7.6 Facilitating Compliance w ith State Standards 7.6.1 What activities does your state/territory fund with CCDF quality funds to facilitate child care providers' compliance with state/territory health and safety requirements? These requirements may be related to inspections, monitori ng, training, compliance with health and safety standards , and with state/territory licensing standards as outlined in Section 5. Describe: 260 | P a g e The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) uses CCDF quality funds to train child care providers on the District's health and safety requirements. The trainings increase child care providers ' knowledge of the policies and standards outlined in the Child Development Facility Licensing Regulations. Additionally, CCDF quality funds are used to support trai ning and professional development offered through the Professional Development Information System (PDIS) and Quorum platforms . These platforms facilitate trainings on a host of early childhood education topics, including pre -service, orientation and annual health and safety training. Health and safety training requirements can be tracked for each individual employee through a tracker embedded in the dashboard of the PDIS. 7.6.2 Does the state/territory provide financial assistance to support child care provide rs in complying with minimum health and safety requirements? No YES. If yes, which types of providers can access this financial assistance? a. Licensed Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF ) providers b. Licensed non -Child Care Development Fund (CCDF ) provider s c. License -exempt Child Care Development Fund (CCDF ) providers d. Other. Describe: 7.6.3 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.6 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) tracks progress in improving the quality of child care t hrough the District's Quality Rating and Improvement and System (QRIS), Capital Quality. As a foundational basis for health and safety (the baseline for quality) , child development facilities must comply with the child care requirements and OSSE staff ensu res that these facilities meet these minimum standards of care. M easurable indicators of increased health and safety practices include reductions in reports of serious injuries and health and safety violations during unannounced visits by licensing special ists. 7.7 Evaluating and Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Child Care Programs and Services 7.7.1 Does the state/territory measure the quality and effectiveness of child care pr ograms and services in both child care centers and family child care hom es? No Yes. If yes , describe any tools used to measure child, family, teacher, classroom, or provider improvements, and how the state/territory evaluates how those tools positively impact children. Capital Quality, the District's Quality Rating and Improv ement System (QRIS) yields ratings of program quality that correspond to one of five Capital Quality designations: Developing, Progressing, Quality , High- Quality and preliminary . The Capital Quality designations enable t he Office of the State Superintenden t of Education (OSSE) to monitor and track the progress of child development centers and homes regarding the extent to which programs deliver 261 | P a g e increasingly high -quality programming over time. The QRIS assesses quality based on valid and reliable observation s conducted by a third party vendor using the following evidence -based assessments : Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale, Third Edition (ITERS -3) Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale, Third Edition (FCCERS -3) Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Pre -K Depending on the type of setting (i.e., center -based or family -based provider) and the age ranges of the children served (e.g., preschool -age only, birth to 5) in the facility, the results of one or more of these measures (CLASS Pre -K, ITERS -3 and/or FCCERS -3) are used to calculate a facility's Capital Quality rating, which translates into a Capital Quality designation of developing, progressing, quality and high -quality. These tools provide a common measure of quality that informs c onsumers and helps target investments and planning in early childhood care and education. This common measure of quality means that there is alignment of quality standards across child development homes, centers and publicly funded pre -K that is focused on positive outcomes for children. OSSE has adopted evidence -based floors and targets for each measure, based on publisher recommendations and analysis of national data and research on each tool. ITERS -3 and FCCERS - 3 the floor is 3 and the target is 6 (on a 1 to 7 scale) . CLASS yields three program -level domain scores on a scale of 1 to 7 for CLASS, floors are 4.5 for the Emotional Support and Classroom Organization domains and 2 for the Instructional Support domain , and targets are 5 for the Emotional Suppor t and Classroom Organization domains and 4 for the Instructional Support domain. CLASS Pre -K, ITERS -3, and FCCERS -3 observations were paused for Capital Quality purposes from spring 2020 through spring 2021 due to the public health emergency, although a small number of programs were able to receive CLASS observations on a voluntary basis in spring 2021. OSSE expects to resume observations for all Capital Quality providers on an annual basis once public health conditions and guidance permit. 7.7.2 Describe the m easurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.7 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in child care centers and family child care homes within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The Capital Quality ratings are calculated using observable indicators of quality from the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Pre -K, the Infant and Toddler Enviro nment Rating Scale - Third Edition (ITERS -3) and the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Third Edition (FCCERS -3) for programs serving infants and toddlers. OSSE aims to have at least 50 percent of child development programs with designations of q uality or high -quality during the performance period. Currently, 41.2 percent of child development facilities participating in the subsidized child care program have a designation of quality or high quality. The baseline data from the first Capital Quality ratings in Fall 2019 show: 16 percent designated High -Quality ; 35 percent designated Quality ; 45 percent designated Progressing ; and four percent designated Developing of 172 total licensed, participating facilities (as of Dec. 1, 2020) rated in fall 2019 . An additional 58 licensed, participating facilities are designated Preliminary because they did not have two years of observation data for , or started participation in the QRIS after, the fall 2019 rating process . 7.8 Accreditation Support 262 | P a g e 7.8.1 Does the state/territory support child care providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation by a national accrediting body with demonstrated, valid, and reliable program standards of high quality? a. Yes, the state/territory has supports operating statewide or territory -wide for both child care centers and family child care homes. Describe the support efforts for all types of accreditation that the state/territory provides to child care centers and family child care homes to achieve accreditation. Is accreditati on available for programs serving infants, toddlers, preschoolers and school -age children? b. Yes, the state/territory has supports operating statewide or territory -wide for child care centers only. Describe the support efforts for all types of accreditati on that the state/territory provides to child care centers. Describe: c. Yes, the state/territory has supports operating statewide or territory - wide for family child care homes only. Describe the support efforts for all types of accreditation that the state/territory provides to family child care. Describe: d. Yes, the state/territory has supports operating as a pilot -test or in a few localities but not statewide or territory -wide. i. Focused on child care centers. Describe: ii. Focused on family child care homes. Describe: e. No, but the state/territory is in the in the development phase of supporting accreditation. i. Focused on child care centers. Describe: ii.

Infants and toddlers b. Preschoolers c. and/or School -age children. Efforts to develop high -quality program standards are supported through the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ), Capital Quality. A key element of the QRIS is supporti ng programs in developing a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan 263 | P a g e (CQIP), which includes a set of quality standards that are common to all programs serving children birth to age 5. As part of the CQIP, programs are supported in designing and implementing qua lity improvement strategies, in addition to being provided with targeted support by quality facilitators (i.e. , coaches) who work with the home provider or center director to monitor, track and measure progress. In addition, the District 's Child Care Resou rce and Referral (CCR&R) program and the Quality Improvement Network ( QIN)provide training and technical assistance to support providers in maintaining healthy, safe and enriching environments. Additionally, the District promulgated new licensing regulatio ns in December 2016 that incorporate key components of the Caring for Our Children standards. Included in the licensing regulations are higher education requirements for staff. With the passage of the District's Healthy Tots Act in 2014, child development facilities serving more than 50 percent subsidy -eligible children are required to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The Healthy Tots Act provides an additional enhancement to each meal as an incentive and outlines standards for promoting children's physical health and well -being. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) partners with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) to provide mental health consultants for child development facilities participating in t he QIN and the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Program through the Healthy Futures program. The Healthy Futures program is also working to expand to child development centers located in w ards 7 and 8 participating in the subsidized child care program. 7.9.2 Describe the measurable indicators of progress relevant to subsection 7.9 that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services within the state/territory and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met these measures. The Capital Quality 10 quality indicators are aligned with national accreditation standards (e.g. , National Association for the Education of Young Children, or NAEYC, National Association for Family Child Care, etc.) and are a part of the self- assessment that all participating providers complete. The self -assessment was updated in fall 2020 with the goal of being able to measure change and improvements over time. Capital Quality includes 10 quality indicat ors that are used for providers to complete a web -based self -assessment of their programs. Capital Quality requires programs to address the following program elements: 1. Curriculum and instruction are aligned to DC Early Learning Standards ; 2. Formal and informal assessments are aligned to curriculum ; 3. Formal and informal assessments are implemented ; 4. Data are used to inform instructional and professional practices ; o CLASS Pre -K and/or ITERS -3 and/or FCCERS -3 results are used to inform instructional and profess ional practices. 5. Culturally and linguistically responsive practices are implemented ; 6. Inclusion practices are implemented. 7. Developmental screenings are implemented. 264 | P a g e 8. Early care and education professionals meaningfully engage in professional development. 9. Family engagement promotes positive and goal- oriented relationships. 10. Mission statements are reflective of both the program and the families served. 7.10 Other Quality Improvement Activities 7.10.1 List and describe any other activities that the state/territory provides to improve the quality of child care services for infants and toddlers, preschool -aged, and school - aged children, which may include consumer and provider education activities; and also describe the measurable indicators of progress for each acti vity relevant to this use of funds that the state/territory will use to evaluate its progress in improving provider preparedness, child safety, child well- being, or kindergarten entry, and the data on the extent to which the state or territory has met thes e measures. Describe: The District of Columbia seeks to address racial and social inequities throughout the city by improving the well- being of children from birth and continuing through early childhood. The Office of the State Superintendent of Educati on (OSSE), Division of Early learning (DEL) in 2019 combined three grants previously separated grants supporting Quality Rating and Improvement System ( QRIS ), child care resource and referral (CCR&R) and the Shared Services Business Alliance (SSBA) into on e grant , the Building and Sustaining Quality Early Care and Education Grant , with three program areas to align the strategies and enhance collaboration and coordination among programs. The goal of this grant is to build the capacity of DC's early care and education system to expand and enhance quality services for young children and their families. This grant support s activities that address the identified and documented business and administrative needs of child development facility owners, center director s and child development home caregivers and activities that support positive, goal -oriented communications and relationships with parents/guardians in their role as their child's first and most important teacher. The grant objectives are: improve the quali ty of early learning environments ; strengthen partnerships and communication with parents to enhance knowledge ; increase access to quality resources, referrals and supports for families ; improve program participation and outcomes for children and families ; increase successful linkages for families and providers to needed services and supports ; and i mprove the diversity and equity of outcomes for young children in programs and services. Monthly reports are utiliz ed to track and measure progress based on iden tified grant goals. Monthly reports include data on community/provider engagement, meetings, professional development offerings , completed coaching/technical assistance sessions, etc. Other measurable indicators for the CCR&R and the SSBA include: the numbers of contacts made with families (e.g., for child care referrals) and providers (e.g., for technical assistance); visits to the website and lending libraries; books and other resources downloaded and borrowed from the website and lending libraries; n umber of provider participants, and enrollment and attendance at the professional development trainings. December 2020, OSSE was a warded the Supporting Equitable Educator Development (SEED) grant from the Trust for Learning . The SEED grant will enhance pr ofessional development through the Building and Sustaining Quality Early Care and Education Grant . The goal of the 265 | P a g e SEED grant is to improve the outcomes for all children by addressing racial and social inequities. Through meaningful culturally relevant pro fessional learning experiences, the grant aims to reduce implicit biases and develop anti- bias practices within the early learning workforce using a train the trai ner model . The planned train the trainer approach is designed to ensure the District's earl y educator workforce has access to meaningful training and resources that enable them to develop the requisite skills, knowledge, and appreciation of diversity to create culturally responsive ideal learning environments for all young children and families in DC. The success of this opportunity will be measured based on the successful completion and implementation of the train the trainer model and utilization of related training and proffessional development as tracked in the Professional Development Inform ation System . Furthermore, as the District seeks to have strong policies, funding and programs that support our goals, there is a long -term need and vision for an Early Childhood Integrated Data System (ECIDS). I n March 2021, OSSE secured a vendor, throu gh a competitive process, to build an integrated data system for child care subsidy case management and payment, licensing , workforce and QRIS data , as a step towards this long -term vision . OSSE has begun work with the vendor and will measure progress thr ough achievement of milestones in the vendor's work plan . 8 Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability Program integrity and accountability activities are integral to the effective administration of the CCDF program. Lead Agencies are required to describe in their Plan effective internal controls that ensure integrity and accountability while maintaining the continuity of services (98.16(cc)). These accountability measures should address reducing fraud, waste, and abuse, including program violatio ns and administrative errors. This section includes topics on internal controls to ensure integrity and accountability and processes in place to investigate and recover fraudulent payments and to impose sanctions on clients or providers in response to frau d. Respondents should consider how fiscal controls, program integrity, and accountability apply to: Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) within the Lead Agency's various divisions that administer or carry out the various aspects of CCDF MOUs, grants, or contracts to other state agencies that administer or carry out various aspects of CCDF Grants or contracts to other organizations that administer or carry out various aspects of CCDF, such as professional development and family engagement activities Internal processes for conducting child care provider subsidy 8.1 Internal Controls and Accountability Measures to Help Ensure Program Integrity 8.1.1 Lead Agencies must ensure the integrity of the use of funds through sound fiscal management and must ensure that financial practices are in place (98.68 (a)(1)). Describe the processes in place for the Lead Agency to ensure sound fiscal management practices for all expenditures of CCDF funds. Check all that apply: 266 | P a g e a. Verifying and processing billing records to ensu re timely payments to providers. Describe: Expenditures of Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF ) funds for direct services are expended in a timely manner to providers, adhering to the District's 30 - Day Quick Payment Act. Invoices are submitted by the fifth business day of the month from providers to OSSE via the web -based Online Attendance Tracking System (OATS), and attendance is reviewed and verified by the assigned attendance coordinator for each provider site. Verified attendance is sent to the District 's Chief Financial Officer Accounts Payable department wh ich provides additional verification and approval before the payments are processed. CCDF discretionary funds are either disbursed through a purchase order that was obtained through the District's procurement process, or via the Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS). Both methods are standard agency -wide, and adhere to all generally accepted accounting principles and practices. b. Fiscal oversight of grants and contracts. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) monitors all CCDF su b-recipients. Written grant agreements or contracts are in place for all sub -contractors and/or sub -grantees that include deliverables and a detailed scope of work to ensure compliance wit h all federal and District laws, policies and regulations. OSSE requires all sub -recipients to participate in ongoing trainings and meetings, particularly for first -time sub -recipients. Early post - award meetings cover the specific work to be done as well a s provide a review of all of OSSE's financial and programmatic policies and procedures and relevant local and federal regulations. Ongoing trainings and meetings are used to troubleshoot new issues as well as provide updates and/or reminders of information provided in the early post -award meetings. c. Tracking systems to ensure reasonable and allowable costs. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) has implemented the Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS) for the fiscal m anagement of grants. The system was designed to improve the management and administration of federal and local grants managed by OSSE. EGMS provides users with information on the status of grant applications, awarded amounts, expenditures to date and payme nt status of pending reimbursements. EGMS offers sub -grantees more convenience with a centralized location to manage the following: Identification of and application to OSSE grants, submission of programmatic and/or fiscal amendments to the original applic ation, and submission of electronic reimbursement requests with required supporting documentation. The system has enhanced operational efficiencies, security architecture, central data storage and warehousing, increased transparency, workflow automation an d performance accountability. OSSE's grants management and program staff review monthly reimbursement requests in EGMS to determine that all expenses are aligned with the grantees' scope of work and approved budget. Reimbursement requests are reviewed by two internal OSSE staff members to ensure costs are: being expended against the approved budget, and are allowable, reasonable, and allocable. These requests, alongside programmatic reports and onsite monitoring, provide a thorough review of the grantee's compliance with OSSE's approved programmatic application, work plan, and budget . d. Other. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) conducts annual onsite monitoring visits and program evaluations to sub -recipients. Each progra m maintains records on file for a minimum period of three years. These records must be accessible at all times for review upon request by officials from the 267 | P a g e District of Columbia Government or the f ederal government. On -site visits support efforts to maintain quality and ensure compliance with OSSE grant and contractual agreements, inclusive of OSSE's internal policies and procedures, and relevant DC and federal regulations . 8.1.2 Check and describe the processes that the Lead Agency will use to identify risk in their CCDF program (98.68(a)(2)). Check all that apply: a. Conduct a risk assessment of policies and procedures. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) is currently convening an internal work group to use the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Child Care (OCC ) approved \"Grantee Internal Controls Self- Assessment\" tool as a framework to review how well the District's policies and procedures meet the Child Care Development Fund's (CCDF) regulatory requirements in the areas of program integrity and financial accountability. This evaluation will be complete by Sept. 30, 2021. This tool evaluates how well the grantee's internal controls are working to reduce payment errors, minimize fraud, and ensure fu nds are used for allowable costs. OSSE will use the tool to document findings, identify strengths and weakness in program integrity and financial accountability, and identify and implement action steps to mitigate any findings. See https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/resource/grantee -internal- controls -self- assessment - instrument -0. b. Establish checks and balances to ensure program integrity. Descr ibe: The Child Care Development Fund ( CCDF )-funded grants are cost reimbursable in nature, minimizing risk of improper spending. Costs are first incurred by the sub - grantee according to an approved budget. The sub -grantee then submits requests for reimburs ement, indicating the linkage to the budget and providing supporting documentation to substantiate that costs are allowable, reasonable and allocable. Two internal Office of the State Superintendent of Education ( OSSE ) reviewers conduct a desk review of th e reimbursement requests to confirm adherence to the budget and applicable federal cost principles, as previously outlined before approving them for payment. All rounds of submission and OSSE responses are recorded in the Enterprise Grants Management Syste m (EGMS ). CCDF -funded contracts are managed in the electronic PASS system, which enables OSSE to track obligations, invoices and payments in compliance with District procurement law. c. Use supervisory reviews to ensure accuracy in eligibility determinat ion. Describe: Eligibility determinations are conducted by the DC Department of Human Services (DHS) Child Care Services Division (CCSD) and designated child care providers (referred to as Level II providers). Eligibility determinations are reviewed and approved by the DHS CCSD supervisor for new employees until the employee demonstrates proficiency in the determination process. The lead agency reviews and approves eligibility records for new Level II providers until the Level II provider demonstrates profi ciency in the determination process. The Eligibility Monitoring Unit conducts annual audits to ensure the accuracy of the eligibility determinations. Three percent of DHS records are audited annually by the lead agency and 100 percent of Level II records a re audited annually by the lead agency for providers with fewer than 30 records. Fifty percent of Level II records are audited annually by the lead agency for providers with 31 -100 records, and 30 percent of Level II records are audited annually by the lea d agency for providers with more than 100 records . 268 | P a g e d. Other. Describe: N/A. 8.1.3 States and territories are required to describe effective internal controls that are in place to ensure program integrity and accountability (98.68(a)), including processes to train child care providers and staff of the Lead Agency and other agencies engaged in the administration of CCDF about program requirements and integrity . a.
