Design: NAMS enlisted a panel of clinician experts in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health to review and update the 2010 NAMS position statement and recommendations on the basis of new evidence andclinical judgement. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Results: Osteoporosis, especially prevalent in older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Postmenopausal bone loss, related to estrogen deficiency, is the primary contributor to osteoporosis. Other important risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosisinclude advanced age, genetics, smoking, thinness, and many diseases and drugs that impair bone health. An evaluation of these risk factors to identify candidates for osteoporosis screening and recommending nonpharmaco- logic measures such as good nutrition (especially adequate intake of protein, calcium, and vitamin D), regular physical activity, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are appropriate for all postmenopausalwomen. For women at high risk for osteoporosis, especially perimenopausal women with low bone density and otherrisk factors, estrogen or other therapies are available to prevent bone loss. For women with osteoporosis and/or other risk factors for fracture, including advanced age and previous fractures, the primary goal of therapy is to prevent new fractures. This is accomplished by combining nonpharmacologic measures, drugs to increase bone density and to improve bone strength, and strategies to reduce fall risk. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government- approved options sclerostin. Conclusions: Osteoporosis is a common disorder in postmenopausal women. Management of skeletal health in postmenopausal women involves assessing risk factors for fracture, reducing modifiable risk factors through dietaryand lifestyle changes, and the use of pharmacologic therapy for patients at significant risk of osteoporosis or fracture.For women with osteoporosis, lifelong management is necessary. Treatment decisions occur continuously over the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Decisions must be individualized and should include the patient in the process of shared decision-making.

Here, NAMS provides guidance on the diagnosis, assessment, prevention, and treat- ment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in North America. The recommendations herein are based, where possible, on evidence provided by clinical trials and, where evidence does not exist, current best clinical practice in the opinions and clinical judgment of an editorial panel consisting of clinicians and researchers with expertise in metabolic bone diseases orwomen's health. These statements do not represent guidelinesor codified practice standards as defined by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, the editorial panel has attempted to provide sufficient information for clinicians toapproach postmenopausal women with or at risk for osteopo-rosis with a confident understanding of management options. The recommendations are focused on the perceptions of the needs of healthcare professionals caring for the skeletal healthof postmenopausal women in the primary care setting. Theguidance provided herein is generally consistent with recom-mendations for the assessment and treatment of postmeno-pausal osteoporosis available from several other NorthAmerican societies and organizations. 2-8 This position statement is an update of the 2010 position statement, ''Management of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women. ''9Since then, several new medications with sophis- ticated mechanisms of action have received government approval on the basis of randomized, controlled trial (RCT)data. In addition, new knowledge about the pathophysiologyand epidemiology of postmenopausal osteoporosis has become available, as have new perspectives about the roleof hormone therapy (HT) in the management of skeletal health, longer experience with the efficacy and safety of older osteoporosis drugs, the potential role of drug holidays for bisphosphonates, and new paradigms regarding sequential use of and anabolic and antiremodeling osteoporosis therapies. These advances have created the need to update the position statement. METHODS For this revision, NAMS enlisted a six-person editorial panel composed of clinicians and researchers with expertise in metabolic bone diseases or women's health to review the 2010 position statement, identify key studies and evidence pub- lished subsequently, and reach consensus on recommenda-tions. The editorial panel reviewed clinical studies publishedin English related to osteoporosis management in postmen-opausal women. Priority was given to evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses of such trials, followed by evidence from systematic reviews and controlled observational studies,using criteria described elsewhere. 10Because standards of care and available treatment options differ throughout theworld, the focus is limited to therapies for postmenopausalosteoporosis available in North America. The NAMS Boardof Trustees was responsible for the final review and approvalof this position statement. EVALUATING PATIENTS FOR AND WITH OSTEOPOROSIS Background Osteoporosis \u2014the most common bone disorder affecting humans\u2014is a generalized skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength, predisposing a person to anincreased risk of fracture, most importantly of the spineand hip. 11These and other serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events. However, the bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause. Less serious fractures, such as wrist fractures, occur in young postmenopausal women and are important warning signs of osteoporosis. Persons with osteoporosis and high risk of fracture can be readily identified. Both general and pharmacologic manage- ment strategies are available to slow or prevent bone loss and to reduce fracture risk. Because osteoporosis is such a com-mon disorder, skeletal health assessment should be a part ofthe routine evaluation of all postmenopausal women, and allprofessionals caring for postmenopausal women should becompetent and confident about undertaking that evaluation. Pathophysiology In adults, bone tissue undergoes constant change by a process called bone remodeling . Old bone material (mineral and protein matrix) is resorbed (removed) by osteoclasts and replaced with new healthy bone by osteoblasts. Osteocytes interconnect in the solid matrix of bone via an extensive canalicular network that senses both mechanical loading andfocal bone damage. Osteocytes secrete molecules that regu-late both the location of and the rate of bone remodeling.These include receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa- b (RANK) ligand, a growth-promoting factor whose interaction with its receptor RANK is required for the proliferation, differentiation, and activity of osteoclasts; and sclerostin,an inhibitor of bone formation. Osteocyte activity is, in turn,regulated by mechanical loading and circulating hormonesincluding parathyroid hormone (PTH) and estrogen. Bone strength (and, hence, fracture risk) is dependent on many qualities of bone, of which bone mineral density (BMD)is the most commonly measured. 11Bone density at any given age is a function of both peak bone mass (reached by age 30) and how much bone is subsequently lost. In healthy premen-opausal women, bone mass is quite stable. The amount of oldbone resorbed is replaced with an almost equal amount of newbone. 12During perimenopause, estrogen deficiency results in increased expression of RANK ligand, activating osteoclasts. Bone resorption becomes more rapid, exceeding the ability ofNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 974 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause Societyosteoblasts to form new bone, resulting in an accelerated phase of bone loss during the menopause transition.12,13 The average annual rate of bone loss is about 2%, beginning 1 to 3 years before menopause and lasting for 5 to 10 years,resulting in an average loss of BMD of 10% to 12% in thespine and hip across the menopause transition. 12Rates of loss are somewhat greater in thin versus heavy women. After this interval of relatively rapid bone loss, bone density decreases about 0.5% per year. This imbalance in remodeling continues into advanced age in which an additional deficit in osteoblast function limits bone formation. By age 80 years, women have lost, on average, approximately 30% of their peak bone mass.4 Bone loss after menopause results in a gradual but progres- sive deterioration of the microarchitecture of both trabecular and cortical bone, weakening the skeleton and increasing the risk of fracture. The thick and numerous trabeculae seen in thespine and ends of long bones in premenopausal women becomethinned and perforated and may be completely resorbed, result-ing in empty spaces where bone tissue once existed. The thickouter shell of cortical bone is thinned from the inside andbecomes more porous because of the dominance of boneresorption over formation. This imbalance in bone remodeling can be accentuated by a very sedentary lifestyle, contributing to accelerated bone loss in older inactive women. Many diseasesand medications can amplify these effects by either increasingbone resorption or inhibiting bone formation. Other factors, including bone mineralization, matrix com- position, microstructure, and microdamage, as well as age-related factors such as the accumulation of advanced glyca-tion end products, affect the quality and integrity of bone tissue. These factors cannot be directly measured in clinical practice. These combined changes in bone mass, structure, and quality result in impaired bone strength and the increased fracture risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Bone mineral density The measurement of areal bone density (the amount of bone mineral divided by the area of the bone scanned) by dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is the principal clinical tool used to assess skeletal health. Careful attention to thequality of both the acquisition and interpretation of DXA bonedensity tests is necessary. 14 To standardize bone density values from different skeletal sites, results are reported as T-scores or Z-scores: /C15The T-score compares a woman's bone density to the average value of healthy young women and is expressed in standard deviation (SD) units. A T-score of \u00fe1 repre- sents a value 1 SD above the young normal mean, whereas a value 2.5 SDs below the young normal mean would equate to a T-score of /C02.5. By convention, the White (non-race adjusted), young, normal value serves as the reference for T-scores in women of all races. /C15The Z-score is the number of SDs above or below the average bone density for the average person of the same age, sex, and ethnicity. The normal range for Z-score is /C02.0 to \u00fe2.0. The Z-score has limited value in postmenopausal women.Studies to date provide inadequate data on racial inequities in health care. Individual- and system-level issues that pro-mote inequality need to be addressed in further researchstudies. 15 Diagnosing osteoporosis Diagnostic categorization by bone density is based on recommendations of a World Health Organization Study Group (Table 1).16In North America, the standard criterion for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women isa T-score of /C02.5 or less at the lumbar spine (LS; at least two vertebral levels measured in the posterior-anterior projection but not the lateral projection), femoral neck (FN), or total hip(TH) by DXA testing. If anatomic factors such as arthritis or hip replacement make measurements of the spine and hip invalid, bone density of the distal one-third site of the radius (forearm) may be considered a diagnostic site, but other methods of diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk also should be considered. When a woman's T-scoreincreases with treatment from less than /C02.5 to values above /C02.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis persists. 17 The diagnosis of low BMD, or osteopenia, does not nec- essarily indicate that bone loss has occurred. This term has limited clinical use because it includes young postmenopausal women without other risk factors who are at low risk of fracture as well as older women with other risk factors whoare at very high risk of fracture. T-scores can be generated from other methods of BMD assessment, and some of those measurements have been shown to predict fracture risk. In general, however, T-scores from those other methods should not be used to diagnose osteoporosis. 18 In addition to BMD, the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made in postmenopausal women who present withfractures of their spine or hip or who have other risk factorsresulting in high fracture risk (Table 2). 7 Osteoporosis is categorized as either primary orsecondary . Primary osteoporosis refers to bone loss that occurs after menopause and with aging. Secondary osteoporosis is diag- nosed when medications such as glucocorticoids or diseases contribute to bone loss. Prevalence In the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey, 16.5% of American women aged 50 years or older had osteoporosis, defined as a BMD T-score of /C02.5 or lower at either the FN or LS.19Similar prevalence has been observed in Canada and Mexico.20,21The prevalence of osteoporosis by low FN BMD increases with age, from TABLE 1. Diagnostic categories based on femoral neck T-scores Normal T-score /C21/C01.0 Low and /C02.5 Osteoporosis T-score /C20/C02.5 aThis category is often referred to as osteopenia. Kanis JA, et al.16NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 9756.8% in women aged 50 to 59 years to 34.9% in women aged 80 years and older.22In the United States, the rates of osteo- porosis vary with ethnicity: Black Americans have the highestBMD, whereas Asian Americans have the lowest. 23These differences, however, may be related more to body weightthan to race. 24 More than 2 million fractures related to osteoporosis occur each year in the United States, including more than 700,000 clinical vertebral fractures and 300,000 hip fractures, result- ing in more than 500,000 hospital admissions.25Most of these fractures occur in older postmenopausal women, with two- thirds of the fractures occurring after age 75.26For a White American woman aged 50 years, the risk of suffering anosteoporotic fracture in her remaining lifetime has been estimated at 40%, and for hip, forearm, and symptomaticvertebral fracture is at 17.5%, 16.0%, and 15.6%, respec- tively. 27Lifetime risks for hip fracture are 17% for White Americans, 14% for Hispanic Americans, and 6% for Black Americans.28 Age-adjusted rates of hip fracture in women in the United States and Canada appeared to be decreasing after 1997.However, recent data suggest that those rates have plateauedand may even be increasing again, perhaps related to thedeclining use of osteoporosis medications since 2008. 29,30 The absolute number of patients who have fractures willcontinue to increase because of population growth. 22 Morbidity and mortality Hip fractures, occurring on average at age 82, elicit a particularly devastating toll, resulting in higher cost and disability than all other fracture types combined.31Hip frac- tures cause up to a 25% increase in mortality within 1 year of the incident.32Up to 25% of women require long-term care after a hip fracture, and 50% will have some long-term loss of mobility. The annual incidence of experiencing a second hip fracture is 2% to 10%, with the second fracture occurring, on average, about 2 years after the first.33 Fractures at other sites, including the spine, humerus, and pelvis, also can result in serious morbidity.34Multiple or severe vertebral fractures may cause substantial pain as well as loss of height and exaggerated curvature of the thoracic spine (kyphosis), restricted movement, and impaired lungfunction.35Only about one-third of vertebral fractures that can be diagnosed radiographically come to clinical atten-tion. 35,36Existing vertebral fractures increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fracture by five- to seven-fold.37The relative risk for mortality after vertebral fracture is as high as with hip fracture.38Postfracture pain, loss of mobility, changed body image, and loss of independence can have strong effects on self-esteem and mood.39 Clinical assessment Evaluation of skeletal health, including the assessment of risk factors for low BMD and fracture, should be undertaken in all postmenopausal women. This information can identifywomen for BMD testing and shape recommendations for clinical management. Risk factors and risk assessment It is important to distinguish between risk factors for osteoporosis as defined by BMD and risk factors for fracture.Major risk factors for low BMD in postmenopausal womeninclude menopause status, advanced age, genetics, thinness, and diseases or drugs with adverse skeletal effects. Low BMD, as well as a history of previous fracture, older age, parental history of hip fracture, frailty, and other medical problems are important risk factors for fracture. Tools to assess the risk of low BMD and of osteoporotic fracture are available. Risk factors for low bone density. /C15Advanced age . Bone loss decreases progressively with advancing age, and the prevalence of osteoporosis increases as women grow older. /C15Thinness. Bone density in healthy women is strongly correlated with body weight. 40Being thin \u2014often cited as body weight less than 127 lb (57.7 kg), the lower quartile of weight for US women aged older than 65 years, or body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg/m2\u2014is a risk factor for low BMD. /C15Genetics . Family studies demonstrate that 50% to 85% of the variance in BMD is genetically determined.41Many genes have been weakly associated with low bone mass in humans. /C15Smoking. Women who currently smoke have lower BMD than do nonsmokers.42Smokers are generally thinner and have earlier menopause and lower serum estradiol levelsthan nonsmokers. /C15Diseases and drugs . Many diseases and drugs adversely affect the skeleton (Table 3).4,7These include eating dis- orders, chronic inflammatory illnesses (ie, rheumatoid arthritis), diseases causing malabsorption (ie, celiac dis- ease), and various endocrinopathies (hyperparathyroidism, Cushing syndrome). Drugs can cause bone loss by increas- ing bone resorption (aromatase inhibitors [AIs]), impairing vitamin D metabolism (phenytoin), or reducing bone for- mation (glucocorticoids), as can surgeries such as gastricbypass. Notable factors not predictive of low BMD include daily or lifetime intake of calcium or vitamin D, alcohol or caffeineTABLE 2. Diagnosing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 1.

Tools to predict low bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Several simple tools are available to identify postmeno- pausal women likely to have low BMD. The OsteoporosisSelf-Assessment Tool combines age and body weight in thisformula: Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool T-score \u00bc0.2/C2 (weight in kg minus age in years), truncated to yield integer. 43 Using a definition of less than 2 as high risk, the performance of the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool in identifyingpostmenopausal White women with BMD T-score valuesof/C02.5 or lower at either the LS or FN demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.3% and a corresponding specificity of 39.6%. The Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument demonstratedsensitivity of 93.3% and 94.4% for selecting Canadian women with low BMD and osteoporosis, respectively. 44These tools are most useful for selecting young postmenopausal women for BMD testing. Risk factors for fracture. The most important risk factors for fracture in postmeno- pausal women are history of previous fracture or falls, olderage, and low BMD. Combining these and other independentrisk factors improves the ability to identify patients at high risk of fracture. 45Several fracture risk-assessment tools are available to estimate a person's risk of fracture, including the Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada calculator.46This computer-based algorithm isavailable online (www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX/) and in com- mon DXA software. In addition to age, sex, and BMI, FRAXcombines age, sex, BMI, and independent risk factors onthe basis of meta-analyses of large observational cohorts (Table 4). 47Separate databases are used to estimate fracture risk in White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic women in the United States. Details of the use of the FRAX tool, including its strengths and limitations, have been reviewed elsewhere.48 /C15Prior fracture . Having or having had a fracture since menopause is the most important and powerful risk factor for having another fracture.49The risk of refracture is especially high (up to 19% within 12 mo) in patients with recent fractures.37,50This has led some organizations to describe patients with a recent osteoporotic fracture as being at very high or imminent risk of fracture.7,51This increased risk gradually diminishes but persists for at least10 years, with the average risk over that time being abouttwo-fold higher than expected for their age and BMD. - In the past, terms such as fragility ornontraumatic fractures were used to define fractures related to osteo- porosis and that predicted future fractures. - Recent evidence suggests that all fractures, except those of the face, skull, hands, and feet, are associated with low BMD and future fracture risk, irrespective of association with trauma. 52 /C15Low bone density . The strongest correlation of BMD and fracture risk is with hip bone density.53Hip fracture risk increases by 2.6-fold for each age-adjusted SD (one Z- score unit) decrease in FN BMD. The magnitude of risk associated with low BMD is modulated by age and other risk factors.TABLE 3.

For any BMD value, older women are at higher fracture risk than are younger postmenopausal women.45 /C15Parental history of hip fracture . The strongest compo- nent of a family history to predict fracture risk is a parental history of hip fracture.54 /C15Smoking . Fracture risk in postmenopausal women who smoke is increased about 30%, independent of BMD.55 /C15Excessive alcohol intake . Consuming more than three servings of alcohol daily is associated with a 38% and 68% increase risk of major osteoporotic and hip fracture,respectively.56 Risk factors not incorporated into FRAX include those not available in the databases on which FRAX was based (eg,falls) or were not known when FRAX was developed (diabe-tes): /C15Falls . Most fractures, including many vertebral fractures, occur after a fall from a standing height or less. 57,58As a result, risk factors for falls, including a history of recentfalls; weakness; impaired balance, coordination, vision, or hearing; obesity; and arthritis, are also risk factors for fracture. /C15Diseases and drugs . Poor health is a risk factor for fracture; most diseases are associated with a general increase in fracture risk (Table 3).4,7Diseases and drugs such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and proton pump inhibitorsare associated with increased fracture risk without causing bone loss. Disorders and drugs that affect muscle strength and balance such as frailty, stroke, and antidepressant medications increase risks of falls and fracture. Other known risk factors for fracture include dementia, low physical activity, thoracic kyphosis, rates of bone loss, and both weight and height loss.52,59 Other risk-assessment methods. Bone density can be assessed by techniques other than DXA, including ultrasound and quantitative computed tomography (CT). T-score values obtained with these tech- niques are not substitutes for T-scores of the hip or spineobtained with DXA because they may overestimate or under-estimate BMD and thus fracture risk. 60For those few patients who cannot have DXA measurements at the hip or spine, assessing fracture risk with FRAX without BMD providesmore useful information than does BMD measured by alternate techniques. Biomechanical CT analyzes quantitative CT scans of the LS and hip with an algorithm called finite element analysis that provides validated estimates of bone strength in individ-ual patients. 61Biomechanical CT predicts fracture risk, although its advantage over DXA is small. Access to bio- mechanical CT is limited, and its role in routine clinical practice has not been defined. Trabecular bone score is a special software available for DXA machines that analyzes the heterogeneity of density distribution on routine LS DXA images. Trabecular bonescore measurements correlate with trabecular microarchitec-ture fracture risk independently from bone den- sity. 62Trabecular bone score has recently been incorporated into FRAX.63Using trabecular bone score is most helpful in women whose fracture risk is near the treatment threshold. Assessing fall risk, with special emphasis on a history of a recent fall, is an important part of risk assessment in olderwomen. 57The Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injury initiative developed by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention provides an algorithm for fall-risk screening (www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/STEADI-Algorithm-508.pdf). Limitations to fracture-risk assessment. There are limitations to the use of any of the individual fracture-risk assessment tools and of the FRAX assessmenttool. FRAX underestimates fracture risk in patients with fallsor diabetes and in those with low spine but not FN BMD. 64In addition, current FRAX scoring does not allow input for quantification of risk factors, including dose of glucocorti- coid, amount of alcohol intake, duration and amount ofcigarette smoking, or the number, type, or recency of priorfractures. 47Despite these limitations, FRAX has been vali- dated as an accurate predictor of fracture probability in largepopulations in the United States and Canada. 65,66However, its performance in identifying individual patients who will orwill not fracture is less robust. 67FRAX does not accurately predict BMD, but that is not what it was designed to do.68 Until there are practical and inexpensive methods to measure bone strength accurately, estimating fracture risk with FRAXwill remain one of the most useful tools. Indications for bone density testing Bone density should be measured in postmenopausal women with risk factors for low bone density where knowingthe result will influence clinical management: /C15Those with a history of fracture since menopause /C15Those with known medical causes of bone loss or fracture /C15Those aged 65 years and older /C15Those aged 50 years and older with one or more of these additional risk factors: - Body weight less than 127 lb (57.7 kg) or BMI less than 21 kg/m 2 - History of hip fracture in a parent - Current smokerTABLE 4.

Kanis JA, et al.47NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 978 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause Society- Discontinuing estrogen with additional risk factors for fracture In healthy postmenopausal women without osteoporosis, repeat BMD testing after 3 years does not enhance fracturerisk prediction. 69For postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years with baseline T-scores greater than /C01.5, retesting could be deferred to age 65, the age at which routine BMD screening is recommended for all women.70Earlier retesting should be considered in women within 5 years of menopause whose initial BMD T-score was lower than /C01.5 or in those with other important risk factors such as prior fracture or withmedical problems or medications predisposing to bone loss. Physical examination The goals of evaluating postmenopausal women with oste- oporosis or important risk factors are to identify modifiable risk factors and secondary causes of bone loss, to quantifyfracture risk and the severity of osteoporosis, and to determine appropriate candidates for pharmacologic therapy. This eval- uation requires a detailed history of risk factors for fracturesand falls, other diseases and medications, previous fractures,and family history. A thorough physical examination should include evaluation of kyphosis, muscle strength, and balance. Standing height should be measured annually with an accurate method, such as a wall-mounted ruler or a stadiometer. Heightloss of 1.5 in (3.8 cm) or more increases the likelihood that a vertebral fracture is present. This calls for evaluation by alateral thoracolumbar radiograph or vertebral fracture compression verte-bral fractures. 71,72Weight should be recorded to identifythose women with low BMI and to be aware of weight changes, which may interfere with the interpretation ofchanges in BMD over time. For women with osteoporosis,examination also should include specific skeletal assessmentssuch as bone tenderness (best elicited over the anterior tibia orthoracic vertebrae), indicating osteomalacia or focal bone disease, and joint laxity or blue sclera, features of osteogene- sis imperfecta. Laboratory evaluation For women with osteoporosis considering pharmacologic therapy, laboratory testing is performed to evaluate for sec-ondary causes of bone loss and to identify contraindications tospecific therapies (Table 5). 4,5,7Routine tests include com- plete blood cell count and general chemistry, especially serum detect patients with <100 mg/d) and those with hypercalciuria (>250 mg/d). Special laboratory tests should be considered in the presence of abnormal routine laboratory tests, clinical clues of other diseases, or unusual cases of osteoporosis. Biochemical markers of bone turnover. Bone turnover markers are serum tests that reflect either bone resorption by osteoclasts (fasting serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen) or bone by 73Bone turnover markers cannot diagnose osteoporosis and have varying ability to predict TABLE 5.

Key points /C15Osteoporosis is a common disorder with potentially serious consequences. /C15Assessment of skeletal health should be a part of routine care for all postmenopausal women. /C15The annual examination should include measurements of height and weight; assessment for chronic back pain and kyphosis; and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis, frac- tures, and falls. /C15The most important risk factors for future fracture are a history of previous fracture, older age, and low BMD. - Fracture risk is especially high in the first 2 years after an incident fracture. /C15Bone mineral density testing is indicated for all postmen- opausal women with risk factors for low BMD or fracture. - DXA is the preferred technique for BMD testing. - For untreated postmenopausal women at low fracture risk, repeat DXA testing is not useful until at least 5 years have passed, unless rapid bone loss is antici- pated. /C15Vertebral imaging is appropriate for postmenopausal women aged 70 years and older or with historical height loss. /C15Secondary causes of osteoporosis should be evaluated before osteoporosis treatment has begun. /C15The routine use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in clinical practice is not recommended. NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS The objectives of managing skeletal health in postmeno- pausal women are to prevent or minimize bone loss and toreduce the likelihood of fractures. All postmenopausalwomen, regardless of their BMD, clinical risk factors, or fracture risk, should be encouraged to adopt nonpharmaco- logic measures and lifestyle modifications, such as eating abalanced diet with adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D, being physically active, and avoiding harmful lifestyle habits such as smoking, to support both general and bone health. 4,5,7,75These general approaches, however, will not prevent bone loss in early menopause, will not significantlyincrease BMD in postmenopausal women, and are certainlynot adequate treatment for women with osteoporosis. Forwomen at high risk of fracture, pharmacologic therapy tostrengthen the skeleton is required to reduce fracture risk. With obvious exceptions, such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), most studies evaluating the effects of non- pharmacologic treatments and lifestyle modification are small and of short duration. As a result, recommendations here will be based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinion.Nutrition Calcium and vitamin D Sufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D are necessary for normal skeletal growth during childhood and adolescence.The importance of these nutrients in healthy postmenopausalwomen is less clear. An Institute of Medicine (IOM; now called the National Academy of Medicine) committee con- cluded that scientific evidence supports important roles forcalcium and vitamin D in skeletal health. Their proposed dailyintakes of calcium for postmenopausal women were 1,000 mgto 1,200 mg, with an upper limit of 2,000 mg (Table 6). 76The IOM commented that the recommendation for women aged 51 to 70 years is based on uncertain and inconsistent data. The average dietary calcium intake in postmenopausal women in the United States and Canada is 700 mg to 800 mg, about one-third of which comes from dairy products, meaning that an average dairy-free diet contains up to 500 mg of calcium. Few healthy women need to take more than 50 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM-recommended daily intake. Patients with malabsorption ordisorders of calcium metabolism such as hypoparathyroidism may require higher daily intakes of calcium and vitamin D. A listing of calcium content of foods and supplements is avail- able from the National Institutes of Health Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center (www. bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/bone-health/nutrition/calcium- and-vitamin-d-important-every-age). No serious adverse events (AEs) have been observed with daily calcium intakes of less than 600 mg. Larger daily intakes are associated withgastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and constipation. In the WHI Calcium and Vitamin D study, the average dietary calcium intake was about 1,100 mg daily. In the groupthat took an additional 1,000 mg of a calcium supplement daily,the risk of kidney stones was increased by 17%. 77The possi- bility that a calcium supplement of 1,000 mg daily (with totaldaily intake approximately 2,000 mg) is associated withincreased cardiovascular risk was raised in a clinical trialand a subsequent meta-analysis. 78,79That association was not observed in the WHI.80A subsequent meta-analysis found that a calcium intake level of 2,000 mg to 2,500 mg per day wasnot associated with cardiovascular risk in healthy adults. 81 However, in the absence of proof of benefit, a total dailycalcium intake of more than 1,200 mg is not recommendedfor healthy postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis.

Institute of Medicine.76NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 980 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause SocietySkeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementation in healthy adults are uncertain. The IOM recommends 600 IU for womenaged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those agedolder than 70 years, stating that these intakes were sufficientto achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in mostpostmenopausal women. Meta-analyses of the effects of calcium and/or vitamin D on fracture risk provide inconsistent conclusions, with most reporting no benefit on fracture risk. 82,83In the bone health substudy in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial, the bone density effects of 2,000 IU ofcholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) daily were evaluated over 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y) with baseline serum 25-OHD levels of 27.6 ng/mL.84No effect was observed in the entire study group or in the subgroup with baseline serum 25-OHD levels less than 30 ng/mL. The inability to demonstrate effectiveness may be related tocalcium and vitamin D being threshold nutrients; severedeficiencies may be harmful, but intakes more than thethreshold to avoid deficiency does not provide additionalbenefit. Salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracturerisk have been observed most often in institutionalized orvitamin D-deficient older adults. 85Most studies evaluating the effects of calcium or vitamin D have not restricted the study population to deficient participants. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of the benefitsand harms of daily supplementation with vitamin D 400 IU ormore and calcium 1,000 mg or more daily for the primaryprevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmeno- pausal women. 86They also recommended against the use of vitamin D supplements to prevent falls.87 Women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than women with normal BMD, and there is no convincing evi- dence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplementsimproves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs. 88Adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment-induced hypocalcemia. 5 Protein intake Studies of relationships between protein intake and BMD or fracture risk have been inconsistent. In fall-prone olderadults who were losing weight, higher protein intake wasassociated with reduced fall frequency. 89 Probiotics The gut microbiota can influence several aspects of bone health, including the absorption of calcium and vitamin D and immune response. In animal models, probiotics may prevent bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency, and prelimi-nary studies in humans suggest that probiotics could have arole in preventing bone loss. 90 Other supplements Strontium is a heavier divalent cation than calcium and increases BMD by being deposited in the skeleton. Strontiumranelate , a proprietary strontium salt, reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausalwomen with osteoporosis. 91This drug was never approved in the United States or Canada, and it is no longer available inthe rest of the world because of concerns about increasedcardiovascular risk. Other strontium salts (citrate, chloride) are promoted to support bone health in the United States, but there is no evidence for their effectiveness or safety. Meta-analysis found no meaningful relationship between magnesium intake and skeletal health. 92Routine magnesium supplementation is not recommended in healthy adults with normal diets. Various vitamin K supplements have been promoted to improve bone health. A recent meta-analysis found no evi- dence that vitamin K affects bone density or vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women and that the evidence was insufficient to confirm a reduction in clinical fractures.93 Phytoestrogens, including isoflavones, are plant-derived compounds with weak estrogenic activity. In a systematicreview, some isoflavones (aglycone form) had a moderatelybeneficial effect against estrogen-deficiency bone loss. 94 Isoflavones are not recommended as effective strategies to prevent or treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.95 There is also no compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of boron, zinc, black cohosh, berberine, or dehydroepiandros- terone on BMD or fracture risk in postmenopausal women. Avoiding harmful lifestyle factors Cessation of smoking and limiting alcohol intake are important general health measures. The AEs of smoking on bone health appear to reverse when smoking is stopped.96 Physical activity and exercise Skeletal mass is strongly influenced by mechanical loading. During growth in children, impact-loading exercise programsinduce small gains in BMD, whereas diseases causing immo-bilization are associated with low bone mass. A Cochrane review and several meta-analyses found relatively small, statistically significant effects of exercise on BMD compared with control groups in postmenopausal women. 97-99 The perception that exercise can reverse osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by inducing new bone formation isunfounded. Programs of regular exercise for general healthcan be recommended, especially those that increase musclestrength and improve balance, leading to fewer falls. Womenwith osteoporosis, especially those with vertebral fractures, should avoid activities that involve lifting or pulling with forward spine flexion or rotation and may benefit from anexercise program to stretch and strengthen the extensormuscles of the spine. 100 Fall prevention At least one-third of women aged 65 years and older experience one or more falls each year, and the risk of falling and of fracture increases with advancing age.101Because most fractures occur as a result of a fall, attempts to reduce theNAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 981incidence of falls should be important components of reduc- ing fracture risk in older postmenopausal women.4,7A recent USPSTF report and a Cochrane review found that multicom- ponent exercise programs such as tai chi that target balance,gait, and muscle strength were the most effective ways toprevent falls and perhaps fractures in older adults. 86,101 Tapering the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptic agents,and antidepressants reduced the risk of falling by more than60%. Hip protectors may be considered in patients at high riskfor falling, especially for patients in supervised settings suchas long-term care facilities. 102The Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention's Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries initiative, based on published guidelines, providesuseful tools for fall risk assessment and management (www.cdc.gov/steadi/). Key points /C15Recommending and promoting healthy habits, including attention to nutrition, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity, and avoidance of harmful habits is appropriate for all postmenopausal women. /C15None of these approaches can significantly improve BMD or correct the architectural abnormalities of osteoporosis. /C15The modest skeletal benefits of nonpharmacologic mea- sures should not be construed as sufficient or effectivetherapies for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. /C15The likelihood of falls can be decreased, however, and fracture risk may be reduced in older women. Prevention of falls is especially important in older women or those with decreased mobility. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY TO PREVENT BONE LOSS Several drugs with differing mechanisms of action have demonstrated the ability to prevent bone loss in postmeno-pausal women and to reduce fracture risk in women withpostmenopausal osteoporosis. The mechanisms of action ofall osteoporosis drugs are to modulate (either to inhibit or to activate) bone metabolism. Antiremodeling agents, often called antiresorptive drugs, include bisphosphonates, and denosumab.They inhibit bone resorption, and to a lesser extent, bone formation. These drugs maintain or improve BMD and reducefracture risk, but they do not improve or repair disruption oftrabecular structure. In contrast, osteoanabolic agents, by stimulating new bone formation, improve cortical and/or trabecular bone structure and induce large increases in BMD, reducing fractures more quickly than do antiremodel- ing drugs. Prevention versus treatment Drugs are approved by North American regulatory agencies for either preventing or treating osteoporosis or both. Since2008, North American guidelines have focused on using osteoporosis drugs to reduce fracture risk. The concept of preventing osteoporosis by halting postmenopausal bone lossand its attendant damage to skeletal architecture is not recog- nized in those guidelines. On the basis of studies demonstrating prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women without osteoporosis, variousoral and transdermal estrogen preparations, alone or in com-bination or bazedoxifene (BZA), as well as raloxifene, bisphospho- nate drugs (alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledr-onate) have government approval for prevention ofosteoporosis (Table 7). Bone density responses to these agentsover 2 years in prevention studies are varied. The bone density benefits of therapy persist as long as therapy is continued, but the effects of estrogen-like drugs abate when treatment isdiscontinued. Markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment values within a few months, and BMD falls to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 years of stopping therapy, effects pre-vented by switching to a bisphosphonate. 103,104 Although using drugs to prevent osteoporosis is not included in national osteoporosis guidelines, a strong clinicalargument can be made for doing so, especially in women whocome to menopause with low bone mass. 105,106On average, women lose about one T-score unit (10-12%) of bone mass across a normal menopause transition.12,107,108With this rapid bone loss, significant and irreversible deterioration in trabec- ular microarchitecture occurs. These effects are preventable with estrogen and bisphosphonates.106,109,110However, with the exception of the WHI, strong evidence that preventingbone loss in young postmenopausal women results in fewer fractures in later life is lacking. A modeling exercise sug-gested that infrequent infusions of zoledronate at menopause would substantially reduce fracture risk and the number of women aged older than 65 years who had osteoporosis. 111 Support for the concept of osteoporosis prevention by anti-remodeling agents also is found in the treatment of womenwith AIs for nonmetastatic breast cancer who experience boneloss and increased fracture risk. 112In these patients, bisphosphonates and denosumab prevented bone loss, anddenosumab reduced the incidence of vertebral fractures by 50% within the first year of treatment, including in women with normal BMD values at baseline. 113-115 Hormone therapy Several oral and transdermal systemic estrogen products are government approved in the United States and Canada for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Although no clear differences in the BMD responses among different estrogen preparations or between oral and transdermal admin- istration have been observed, transdermal estrogen appears to have less risk of venous thrombotic events and possiblystroke. Bone mineral density The beneficial effects of systemic standard doses of oral or transdermal HT on BMD, including estrogen plus progesto- gen therapy (EPT) for women with a uterus or estrogen-alone therapy (ET) for women without a uterus, have been shown inNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 982 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause SocietyRCTs in both younger and older postmenopausal women.116- 120In or micronized progesterone [MP]), for signifi-cantly LS BMD by 3.5% to 5.0%, with a 1.7%increase in hip density. 116In the WHI, a 5-year RCT in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years (N \u00bc16,608), standard daily EPT doses (0.625 mg CE plus 2.5 mg MPA) significantly increased LS and TH bone density by 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively, relative to placebo.121Oral 17- bestradiol in daily doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1.0 mg increased LSBMD after 2 years by 0.4%, 2.3%, and 2.7%, respectively. 122 Combining those doses of estradiol with norethindrone ace-tate 0.5 mg daily resulted in larger increases in BMD. In a meta-analysis of 57 RCTs in postmenopausal women, consis- tent BMD increases with ET or EPT were observed at all skeletal sites versus placebo. 123In trials of 2 years' duration, the mean difference in BMD after EPT was 6.8% at the LS and4.1% at the FN. Similarly, daily doses of 0.05 mg and 0.1 mgof estradiol acetate delivered via a vaginal ring significantlyincreased hip (1.7% and 1.8%, respectively) and 3.3%, respectively) compared with base- line. 124Lower-than-standard doses of ET and EPT are asso- ciated with significant, albeit smaller, improvements in BMD, although the number of women experiencing bone loss on lower doses is likely higher.118,120,122,125-127 Fracture risk In the WHI, ET with CE alone and EPT reduced the combined risk of vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and total fractures by 34% compared with placebo in a low-risk fracture population.121,128Hip fracture risk was reduced by 30%(hazard 0.7; 95% (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). Meta-analysis and a systematic review, dominated by WHI results, demonstrated that 5 to7 years of HT significantly reduced risk of spine, hip, andnonvertebral fractures. 129,130Because no study, including the WHI, has evaluated the effects of estrogen on fracture risk in women with osteoporosis, estrogen is not approved as a treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Doses of ET or EPT lower than used in the WHI have not been studied withregard to fracture efficacy. Safety In the WHI, initial reports of systemic EPT showed sta- tistically significant increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and thromboembolic events. 131-133In women with prior hysterectomy, CE alone for 6.8 years resulted in a statisticallysignificant increased risk of stroke and deep venous throm-bosis, whereas breast cancer, coronary heart disease, totalvenous thromboembolism (VTE), and pulmonary embolismwere not statistically increased. 134In the WHI Memory Study, a statistically significant increase in probable dementia was noted in women aged 65 to 79 years who received EPT for a mean of 4.0 years.135After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years, there was a nonsignificant trend for increased probable dementia in women allocated to ET. Subgroup analyses suggest that the timing of initiation of HT influences the benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects observed in women aged 60 years and younger orwithin 10 years of menopause, including less risk of cardio- vascular disease and possibly cognition. 136-138In women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years past the menopauseTABLE 7.

Bone mineral density loss of 3% to 6% occurs during the first year after cessation of systemic ET or EPT, and markers of bone turnover return to pretreatment values within a fewmonths. 103,139Within 2 years, BMD falls to levels seen in women who never took estrogen.140In the WHI, discontinua- tion of HT was associated with a return of fracture risk tolevels seen in women who had received placebo, with no excess fracture risk observed. 141 The primary indication for systemic HT is for relief of vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms in post-menopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within10 years of menopause, with secondary benefit on boneprotection. 142,143However, well-counseled women with per- sistent menopause symptoms and those at high risk of fracturewho cannot tolerate the other therapies may be candidates for HT for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis if benefits outweigh risks. Extended use of HT is an option for well-counseled women who have low bone mass, regardless ofmenopause symptoms, for prevention of further bone lossand/or reduction of fracture risk when alternate therapies arenot appropriate or when the benefits of extended use areexpected to exceed the risks. 142,144,145 Despite positive effects on bone, initiating HT in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause is generally not recommended because of con- cerns about cardiovascular safety.142,146 Although the optimal time to initiate ET or EPT and the optimal duration of therapy have not been established, ET orEPT should largely be used in the early years after meno-pause. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency, prematuremenopause, or early surgical menopause experience long- term AEs on bone, cognition, mood, cardiovascular health, sexual health, and mortality. 147For these women, an estrogen preparation should be considered, unless there are contra-indications, to prevent bone loss as well treat menopausesymptoms, at least until the average age of natural meno-pause. 142Higher doses of HT may be needed to provide protection against bone loss in younger women, particularly those aged younger than 40 years.125 Estrogen-receptor antiresorptive properties in bone. Raloxifene is the only EAA approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausalosteoporosis. In a 2-year RCT of 601 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis (mean age, 55 y), raloxifene 60 mg per dayimproved BMD by 1.6% at the LS and 1.2% at the FN compared with placebo (decreases of 0.8% and 1.2%, respec-tively). 148Bone loss resumes when raloxifene therapy is stopped.149Raloxifene is associated with bone loss when given to premenopausal women.150 Adverse events with raloxifene include increased hot flashes, leg cramps, and an increased risk of VTE.151,152In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, raloxifene signif-icantly reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 76% after 3 years and by 59% after 8 years of therapy. 153,154 Bazedoxifene with conjugated estrogens Bazedoxifene is an EAA that has effects similar to raloxi- fene on bone density and fracture risk in women with osteo- porosis.155It is not approved as monotherapy in the United States or Canada. A daily fixed-dose combination of BZA 20 mg with CE 0.45 mg improved VMS, decreased bone turnover markers,and prevented bone loss over 2 years in young postmeno-pausal women. 156-158In a pooled analysis from phase 3 trials in young postmenopausal women with normal or low BMD,bone density changes versus placebo with BZA plus CE were 2.3% and 1.4% at the LS and TH, respectively. 159Because BZA is a uterus antagonist, and the rates of endometrial hyperplasia were less than 1% and comparable to placebo, progestogens do not need to be taken with this combinationtherapy, based on safety data up to 2 years. 158,160 In RCTs of up to 2 years with the combination of CE and BZA, mammographic breast density and rates of breast tenderness, breast cancer, vaginal bleeding, cardiovascular events, and VTE were similar to placebo.157This combination has been approved in the United States, Canada, and Mexico for the management of moderate to severe VMS and in the United States and Mexico for prevention of postmenopausalosteoporosis. This product contains a warning similar to otherestrogen-containing products. The best candidates for BZA with CE are postmenopausal women with a uterus who need relief from hot flashes and prevention of bone loss. Caution should be exercised in beginning any HT in women aged older than 60 years. Tibolone Tibolone, a synthetic hormone derived from the Mexican yam, has metabolites with estrogenic, androgenic, and pro-gestogenic effects. 161In young postmenopausal women, tibo- lone prevented hot flashes, bone loss, and vaginal atrophy.162 In women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, tibolone 1.25 mg daily significantly reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture but increased stroke risk.163It has not been approved in the United States or Canada but is used in Mexico for osteoporosis prevention. Bisphosphonates These analogs of pyrophosphate bind to bone matrix and are absorbed into osteoclasts at sites of active bone remodel- ing. By interfering with important intracellular processes,NAMS POSITION STATEMENT 984 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause Societybisphosphonates impair osteoclast function. Bone remodeling decreases, and BMD increases.164There are bisphosphonates approved for both the prevention and treatment ofpostmenopausal osteoporosis. In young postmenopausal women, bisphosphonates increase BMD over 24 months by 3.1% to 6.0% in the LS and by 1.8% to in the proximal femur. 165-168Doses of zoledronate and alendronate approved for prevention are 50%smaller than the doses approved for osteoporosis treatment. Bone mineral density decreases slowly on stopping alendro- nate or zoledronate. 103,169 Bisphosphonates can be considered to prevent bone loss in early menopause if estrogen cannot be taken or when ET orraloxifene therapy is discontinued. Key points /C15Intervening to prevent rapid bone loss and deterioration of skeletal structure is a unique opportunity to maintain bone health. /C15Such intervention would be most appropriate in women with low BMD who are experiencing relatively rapidbone loss because of acute estrogen deficiency in the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal periods or on discontinuing ET. /C15For younger, healthy postmenopausal women, particularly those with VMS, who are candidates for prevention of bone loss, estrogen alone (if no uterus) or combined with progestogen or BZA are the most appropriate therapies. - A bisphosphonate could be chosen if estrogen is contra- indicated or on stopping ET. - Raloxifene is a good option for prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women with an elevated risk of breast cancer and infrequent VMS. /C15Bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss can be considered in postmenopausal women with low BMD (T-score </C01) and other risk factors for fracture (eg, family history) who do not meet criteria for osteoporosis treatment.PHARMACOTHERAPY TO TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN The primary objective of treating women with osteoporosis is to reduce the risk of fracture. All drugs approved forosteoporosis treatment have been shown in RCTs to reducefracture risk (Table 8). 151,170-189 These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action and their effectiveness. Details and nuances of theiruse are found in cited reviews. Combining therapies is not generally recommended to treat osteoporosis, although sequential therapies may play a role in preventing loss after certain therapies. Antiremodeling drugs Antiremodeling agents inhibit bone resorption by osteo- clasts, and secondarily, bone formation. Treatment results inthe filling in of remodeling spaces in bone that are present at the beginning of therapy and in opening of fewer new remodeling spaces, resulting in increased BMD and skeletal strength and decreased fracture risk. These drugs do not repairdeficits in trabecular architecture. Denosumab, the mostpotent inhibitor of bone remodeling, does reduce porosityin cortical bone. Protection from fractures occurs within1 year of beginning therapy, persists as long as treatment isgiven, and wanes when treatment is stopped. Hypocalcemia has been reported with some of these agents. Low serum calcium should be corrected before beginning therapy. Raloxifene In a pivotal RCT of postmenopausal women with osteopo- rosis, raloxifene significantly reduced the incidence of verte- bral fractures after 3 years by 30% and 50% in women withand without prevalent vertebral fracture, respectively. 151Hip and nonvertebral fracture risk was not reduced with raloxifene therapy for up to 8 years.152 TABLE 8.

Therapy considerations. Raloxifene is an option for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with a low risk of hip fracture, an elevated risk of breast cancer, and low risk of stroke and VTE. Bisphosphonates In RCTs, daily oral therapy with and annual intravenous dosing with the risk of vertebral fractures by 41% to 70% over 3 years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.191 Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate also reduced the risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures by 28% to 50% and 20% to 38%, respectively, in long-term extension studies. Bone mineral density in the TH and FN plateaus after about 5 years, with no further increases over the next 4 to 5 years.192,193 Registration for government approval of the commonly used weekly and monthly dosing regimens of the oral agents wasbased on studies comparing BMD responses to daily therapy rather than on fracture endpoint studies (Table 8). 151,170-189 Adverse events include diffuse bone and muscle pain of unknown mechanism, worsening upper gastrointestinal symp- toms with oral bisphosphonates, and flu-like symptoms in about one-third of patients with the first infusion of zoledr- onate. Renal failure has occurred with zoledronate in patientswith compromised renal function. Oral bisphosphonates are tobe used with caution, and zoledronate is contraindicated inpatients with markedly impaired renal function. Osteonecro- sis of the jaw (ONJ) occurs infrequently (1 in 10,000-100,000 patient-years) with osteoporosis doses of bisphosphonates. 194 Invasive dental procedures and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for ONJ. Discontinuing therapy before an invasivedental procedure does not reduce the risk of ONJ, 195but improving oral hygiene preoperatively and using topical antimicrobial therapy with dental extraction does appear to reduce risk.196,197 A duration-dependent risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures with atypical radiologic features becomes evident after 2 to 3 years of therapy, with an incidence of about 1 in 1,000 patients after 8 to 10 years of therapy.198The risk of these fractures appears to be greater in Asian women, in younger postmenopausal women with low BMD rather than osteoporosis, and in patients with some genetic skeletal disorders such as hypophosphatasia.199Pain in the thigh or groin is usually present for weeks to months before the atypical fracture occurs. Patients on bisphosphonates for more than 3 years should be cautioned to report new thigh or groinpain so that radiographic evaluation can be undertaken. The risk of atypical fracture may decrease on discontinuation oforal bisphosphonates. 200 Duration of therapy and bisphosphonate drug holiday. The effects of bisphosphonate therapy on bone remodeling and protection from fracture wane slowly (over 1-5 y) when treatment is stopped.192,193,201Because of this unique phar- macology, a temporary withdrawal of therapy ( ''bisphospho- nate holiday '') can be considered after 3 to 5 years of therapy in patients at low or moderate fracture risk and who no longer meet criteria for therapy.5,7,130,202Fracture risk increases again when patients have been off oral bisphosphonate ther-apy for 2 years. 203Osteoporosis treatment should be restarted with a significant decline in BMD, an intervening fracture, or other factors altering clinical risk.5,191,202For patients remain- ing at high risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy(history of previous spine or hip fracture or multiple otherfractures, hip BMD values remaining in the osteoporosisrange, or who have other important risk factors), continuing on the bisphosphonate or switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic agent is recommended. 5,7,202 Therapy considerations. Bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Use with cautionin patients with significantly impaired renal function. Con-sider a bisphosphonate holiday only in women at low ormoderate fracture risk. Denosumab This fully human monoclonal antibody inhibits RANK ligand, the principal stimulator of bone resorption. Treatment with denosumab 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months results in marked inhibition of bone remodeling, with resorption inhibited more than formation. 204In a pivotal RCT, denosumab therapy for 3 years reduced the risk ofvertebral fractures by 68% and hip fractures by 40% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 178Over 10 years, BMD increased by 21.7% and 9.2% in the LS and TH,respectively, and protection from fracture persisted orimproved. In that trial, skin rash and skin infection occurred more frequently with denosumab than placebo but did not increase in frequency with long-term therapy. Denosumab can be used in patients with impaired renal function, but hypocalcemia is more common. Rare cases of atypical femoral fractures and ONJ were observed with long-term therapy. The relationshipbetween duration of denosumab therapy and these possibleAEs is unclear. No other AEs were observed over 10 years oftreatment. 192 Discontinuing denosumab. On stopping denosumab treatment, bone turnover markers quickly rise above baseline levels before returning to pre- treatment levels after 1 to 2 years. Bone mineral densityNAMS POSITION STATEMENT 986 Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 /C2232021 The North American Menopause Societydecreases rapidly, and vertebral fracture protection is lost. Vertebral fractures, often multiple, occurring 3 to 18 monthsafter stopping denosumab treatment have been reported. 205 There is no justification for a ''holiday ''with denosumab therapy. Whenever denosumab is stopped, therapy with a bisphosphonate should be used to prevent bone loss.206,207 Therapy considerations. Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fractures. There is no limit to the duration of denosumab therapy. Administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped beyond7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone lossand vertebral fractures. Calcitonin-salmon Nasal spray calcitonin-salmon is recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis only for women who cannot tolerate other therapies. 5Calcitonin-salmon may reduce pain and shorten time to mobilization after an acute vertebral frac-ture. 208 Osteoanabolic therapies These bone-building drugs stimulate bone formation and restore the structure of trabecular bone by increasing the number and width of trabeculae and improving corticalthickness. 209The bone-forming effects of these agents dimin- ish over several months (antisclerostin therapy) to a few years (PTH-receptor agonists). For these and other reasons, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoa- nabolic agents are discontinued. To maintain the treatmentbenefits, these therapies should always be followed by anantiremodeling drug. Osteoanabolic therapies are more effec-tive than antiremodeling agents at increasing BMD andreducing fractures and should be the initial therapy forosteoporosis in women at very high or imminent risk offracture. 6,7,51 Parathyroid hormone receptor agonists Teriparatide and abaloparatide activate the PTH receptor, stimulating bone formation on trabecular and endocorticalbone surfaces, leading to increased skeletal mass and volume,improved trabecular microarchitecture, increased corticalwidth, and increased bone strength. 210,211Both drugs, admin- istered by daily subcutaneous injection, significantly reduce risks of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture. Hip fracture efficacy was not demonstrated in individual randomized trials (limited by sample size), but a meta-analysis showed hip fracture efficacy with teriparatide.212Orthostatic hypotension with first doses and hypercalcemia are possible AEs. High doses of both drugs induced bone tumors in rats, but this risk has not been observed in clinical studies. Neither drug shouldbe used in patients with hypercalcemia, at risk for osteosar- coma, or with skeletal metastases. Previously, treatment with both agents was limited to 2 years in one's lifetime. Theteriparatide label changed (November 2020) to allow a repeat teriparatide course in appropriate patients. Abaloparatide isnot yet available in Canada. Teriparatide. Teriparatide is a synthetic peptide comprised of the first 34 amino acids of PTH. 210In a phase 3 pivotal trial, teriparatide therapy for 18 to 19 months resulted in increases of LS bonedensity by 9.5% and TH bone density by 2.6%. 179The risks of vertebral and nonvertebral fracture were reduced by 65% and35%, respectively. In women with postmenopausal osteopo-rosis at high fracture risk, teriparatide reduced risks of verte-bral fracture by 56% and clinical fractures by 52% compared with risedronate. 213 Abaloparatide. Abaloparatide is a synthetic analog of PTH-related peptide analog, modified to potentiate its anabolic effect.211In a pivotal fracture trial, women with postmenopausal osteopo-rosis were randomized to blinded abaloparatide 80 mg, pla- cebo, or open label teriparatide for 18 months. 214Bone mineral density increased with abaloparatide by 11.2% in the LS and by 4.2% after 18 months in TH BMD. Over 18 months, risks of vertebral fracture and nonvertebral frac- ture were reduced by 86% 43%, respectively. These fracture-prevention benefits achieved with abaloparatide weremaintained for 2 additional years when women were switched to alendronate. Increases in BMD, especially at the hip, were greater with abaloparatide than with teriparatide, but there were no significant differences in fracture risk between the two therapies. Romosozumab Romosozumab is a humanized antisclerostin monoclonal antibody that stimulates bone formation while inhibiting boneresorption. 215It is administered monthly as two subcutaneous injections totaling 210 mg for 12 months. In women withpostmenopausal osteoporosis, average BMD increases with romosozumab at 1 year were 13.3% in the LS and 6.8% in the TH. With 12 months of romosozumab followed by 24 months of alendronate or denosumab, total increases in LS BMD were 14.9% and 18.1%, respectively, whereas increases in 7.0% with alendronate and 9.4% with denosu-mab. women with postmenopausal osteopo- rosis, romosozumab, compared with placebo, significantly reduced vertebral fracture risk by 73% and clinical fractures (>85% of which were nonvertebral) by 36% after 12 months of therapy.181The 25% reduction in nonvertebral fracture risk was not statistically significant. In a second pivotal trial in women at high risk of fracture, romosozumab was compared with alendronate.182At 12 months, vertebral fracture risk was reduced by 37% with romosozumab compared with alendronate. After that 12 months, all women received alendronate. At the end of the study (average, 33 mo; 21 mo on alendronate),NAMS POSITION STATEMENT Menopause, Vol. 28, No. 9, 2021 987nonvertebral fractures were significantly reduced by 19% and hip fractures by 38% in patients receiving romosozumabduring the first year of the study compared with those whoreceived only alendronate throughout. The reduction in ver-tebral fracture risk observed during the 12 months of romo-sozumab compared with placebo or alendronate was maintained for at least 2 years while women took denosumab or alendronate. Romosozumab can produce mild injection-site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions. Compared with alendronate,romosozumab was associated with a higher risk of majorcardiovascular AEs (heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death), but there was no difference in rates of these eventswith romosozumab versus placebo. The explanation for the disparity in the results of the two studies is unclear. 216 Romosozumab is not recommended for women at high risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly those who have hadrecent heart attacks or strokes. Therapy considerations. Osteoanabolic therapy results in larger, faster gains in BMD and better protection from fractures than do bisphosph- onates. Anabolic therapy should be followed by a potent antiremodeling agent to maintain gains in BMD. Bone min-eral density gains, particularly in the hip, are greater when theanabolic drug is administered before the antiremodeling drugcompared with the opposite sequence. The best candidates arewomen at very high risk of fracture, including those with priorand especially recent fractures, very low BMD (T-score below/C03.0), and those who sustain fractures or lose BMD while taking antiremodeling therapy. DEVELOPING AN OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT PLAN Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive, and currently incur- able disease requiring life-long management. There is nosingle treatment paradigm. Rather, treatment must be indi-vidualized and then monitored and altered depending on the course of the patient. Different medications are chosen depending on the patient's age, BMD, fracture risk, and otherconsiderations. Moreover, different medications may bechosen for the same patient at different stages of life. Optimal management will entail the use of osteoporosis therapies invarious sequences to maximize benefits and minimize risksacross the lifespan of a postmenopausal woman. Goal-directed therapy, or ''treat-to-target, ''is an emerging concept to aid in the selection of initial therapy or when and how to change therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis. 217 The fundamental principle of this concept is that the goal of treatment is to reach an acceptable level of fracture risk orsuitable surrogate. The initial treatment is selected according to the likelihood of that treatment achieving this goal. If the response to the initial treatment does not achieve this goal, achange in treatment is considered. The value of BMD as an appropriate target as a surrogate of fracture risk is supported by recent studies documenting that the level of BMD achieved on osteoporosis treatments corre- lates strongly with a person's current risk of fracture; the higher the TH BMD is on treatment, the lower the fracture risk. 218,219Those studies suggested that optimal treatment benefit is achieved at TH T-score values between /C02.0 and /C01.5. These data are bolstered by robust evidence from meta- regressions of published clinical trials of many medications demonstrating a strong correlation between the magnitude of BMD increase with treatment and reduction of vertebral,nonvertebral, and hip fracture risk. 220,221 These results suggest that, for patients with very low BMD or very high risk of fracture, beginning therapy with anosteoanabolic agent followed by an antiremodeling drug is most likely to achieve osteoporosis treatment goals. 51,222The studies documenting the superiority of osteoanabolic treat- ments over antiremodeling drugs for reducing fracture risk in patients at very high risk of fracture strongly support thisrecommendation. 182,213This approach is even more attractive on recall that the increase in BMD and fracture protectionachieved with 12 to 18 months of osteoanabolic treatmentpersists for at least 2 years after patients are transitioned to a bisphosphonate or denosumab. 223,224 Based on these concepts, the choice of the initial treatment is based on the patient's current BMD and fracture risk (Table 9).6,7,51If the response to the initial treatment does not achieve this target, a change in treatment is considered.

If the treatment target is reached after3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, discontinuation oftreatment for an interval could be considered, with plans torestart therapy if bone loss or fractures occur. If raloxifene or denosumab therapy is stopped, switching to a bisphosphonate would be indicated to prevent the rapid decrease in BMD and loss of fracture protection. Osteoanabolic therapy should always be followed by a bisphosphonate or by denosumab. Monitoring osteoporosis therapy Bone mineral density testing should be repeated 1 to 2 years after beginning osteoporosis therapy (depending on the drugused), with careful attention to quality control of the repeat testing. 4,7For patients on bisphosphonates, repeating BMD testing again at 5 years is used to determine whether a''bisphosphonate holiday ''would be considered. 202 Although changes in bone turnover markers are used by some specialists to assess adherence and effectiveness of therapy, routine use of bone markers is not recommended.Follow-up contact by an office nurse may be the mosteffective means to enhance adherence to therapy. 225 Key points /C15The choice of the initial treatment for osteoporosis is based on the patient's current BMD and fracture risk. /C15Raloxifene is an option for the treatment of postmeno- pausal osteoporosis in women with a low risk of hip fracture, an elevated risk of breast cancer, and low risk of stroke and VTE. /C15Bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. - Use with caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function. - Consider a bisphosphonate holiday only in women at low fracture risk who no longer meet criteria for ther- apy. /C15Restart therapy if bone loss or fractures occur or when patient again meets criteria for treatment. - For patients remaining at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, continue treatment or switch to another drug. /C15Denosumab is appropriate for women with postmeno- pausal osteoporosis, including those at high risk of fracture. - There is no limit to the duration of denosumab therapy. - Administration of denosumab should not be delayed or stopped beyond 7 months without subsequent therapy to prevent bone loss and vertebral fractures. /C15Osteoanabolic therapies are most appropriately used in women at very high risk of fracture, including those with prior and especially recent fractures, very low BMD (T- score below /C03.0), and those who sustain fractures or lose BMD while taking antiremodeling therapy. - Osteoanabolic therapies increase bone mass more rap- idly and reduce fracture risk more effectively thando bisphosphonates. - Anabolic therapy should be followed by an antiremod- eling agent to maintain bone density gains.- Bone mineral density gains, particularly in the hip, are greater when an anabolic drug is administered before an antiremodeling drug, compared with the oppositesequence. /C15Bone mineral density measured while on therapy correlates with current fracture risk. /C15If the response to the initial treatment does not achieve preventing bone loss or reducing the risk of fracture, achange in treatment should be considered. /C15If drug-related AEs occur, appropriate management strate- gies should be instituted.
