[Chiropractic](/chiropractic-care/) is essential for restoring the alignment and function at the foundation. Acupuncture helps with more acute symptoms, such as back pain and headaches. We use acupuncture to restore balance in the body and keep you well. Acupuncture stimulates the natural healing process. At our practice, acupuncture is almost always used in conjunction with chiropractic adjustments. Balancing the Body's Energy Unlike conventional approaches to health care, acupuncture is used to balance the body's energy by specifically placing tiny, hair-thin needles underneath the skin. By inserting these needles under the skin at specific points, we are able to stimulate chemical changes in the body. These chemical changes ultimately decrease the effects of illness. Over the years, acupuncture has become an increasingly popular way to alleviate pain. Acupuncture stimulates the body to generate chemicals called endorphins. Endorphins simulate morphine by attaching to opiate receptor sites that exist throughout the nervous system. Endorphins help impede pathways that transmit pain signals from the body to the brain. In addition to relieving pain, acupuncture fosters relaxation. Acupuncture increases energy and biochemical balance, allowing your body to heal naturally. In addition to reducing pain and inflammation, acupuncture increases both physical and emotional health. Acupuncture has been proven to effectively address an array of acute and chronic conditions. Here are some of the many issues that acupuncture can address: - Digestive problems - Respiratory issues - Neurological disorders - Urinary, menstrual and reproductive issues - Addiction - Sleep problems When it comes to fostering healing, it's important to provide an early and correct diagnosis. Before we decide on your individual care plan, we want to better understand what is going on inside your body. During your first visit, you will have a chiropractic evaluation. After meeting with [Dr. Brittney](/dr-brittney-keller/) to review your past health and present health, she will take a closer look at your physical well-being. Then, she will choose acupuncture points for your specific condition. These points are based on traditional acupuncture methods. Once Dr. Brittney selects the acupuncture points, she will share with you her plan of action and, once you are ready, begin the procedure. While it depends on the individual, most practice members report little to zero discomfort as the needles are inserted. There is also no significant discomfort during the session. Many practice members don't feel the needles at all. [How often is acupuncture necessary?](#toggle-2) As is the case with chiropractic adjustments, the frequency of acupuncture sessions varies depending on the practice member. For more challenging cases, regular sessions may be beneficial. In other cases, however, a handful of sessions may be all that's needed. For complex or chronic conditions, we might recommend one to three acupuncture sessions a week. As progress is made, sessions will become less frequent. [How long does an acupuncture session take?](#toggle-3) The majority of acupuncture sessions take between 10 and 30 minutes. [What should I expect to feel after a session?](#toggle-4) You likely will experience pain relief right away. If relief is not instant, you should start to feel better within a few hours or days after you receive care. [What About Those Needles?](#toggle-5) If you've never had acupuncture before, you may be wondering about the needles that are used. We want to assure you that the needles used are small and ultrathin. They are nothing like a hypodermic needle that's used in a hospital setting. It would take two to three acupuncture needles to fill an average hollow medical needle. Book an Appointment Dr. Brittney underwent rigorous training to become certified in chiropractic acupuncture. She took her course from the esteemed Acupuncture Society of America (ASA) Certification. Experience the benefits of acupuncture in Lincoln.
