Journal of Caring Sciences Introduction: Exposure to noxious stimuli can cause pain in infants. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the lavender oil inhalation on the pain resulting from the pentavalent vaccination. Methods: This clinical trial consisted of two groups: the lavender oil group with 42 infants and the placebo group with 57 infants. The healthy infants without congenital abnormalities in need of pentavalent vaccine also participated in our study. The infants started the lavender oil or placebo aromatherapy one minute before injection. The pain was assessed three times, using the Neonatal Infant pain Scale (NIPS): before vaccination, 15 s, and 5 min after vaccination. Also, the duration of crying was measured in both groups. Results: At baseline, the two groups were similar in relation to the NIPS scores. While, after 5 minutes, the NIPS score was significantly lower in the lavender group. Based on the repeated measures analysis, the NIPS score changed over time totally. However, t... International Journal of Emerging Trends in Health Sciences Preterm newborns are defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Prolonged or frequent pain in the early stages of life can prevent the baby's behaviour, feeding patterns, adaptation to the outside world, as well as changes in brain development and adversely affect growth. Preterm newborns are known to be more sensitive to pain due to immature pain mechanisms. Therefore, preterm newborns need more support during painful procedures. The aim of this review is to provide information about the painful procedures encountered by preterm newborns in neonatal intensive care units and the evidence-based non-pharmacological methods for these painful procedures. This study used English-Turkish language articles and a search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Google Scholar, using a combination of key like 'painful procedures', 'preterm newborn', 'non-pharmacological methods' and terms are frequently used in non-pharmacological methods as well as pharmacological methods in pain relief. Non-pharmacologic methods used in pain management in preterm neonates are massage, kangaroo care, music, oral sucrose, swaddling, facilitated tucking, prone position, mother's touch, voice and smell and breastfeeding method. Facilitated tucking, kangaroo care, swaddling, breast milk and oral sucrose are effective in heel blood collection and venous blood collection in newborns. It has been reported in the literature that the smell of glucose, breast milk, vanilla and lavender reduces pain. It is stated in the literature that breast milk, sucrose and kangaroo care used during the retinopathy of premature retinopathy reduces pain during and after the procedure. The aim of newborn pain management is to help reduce pain and help the baby cope with pain. Therefore, further research on evidence-based non-pharmacological methods is essential, and it is essential for all health professionals to be aware, know and practice non-pharmacological methods. Applied Nursing Research 2010 Protocols 1996 Clinical Therapeutics 2009 2011 BACKGROUND: Pain is a global health problem which exists from birth to the last stages of our life. It has been proven that infants are able to feel the painful stimulus. Infants routinely experience the pain in the hospitals especially during the vaccination procedure. Therefore, finding a non pharmacological pain relieving method is necessary. The aim of this study was to compare the pain relieving effect of oral sucrose, breastfeeding and combination of them during the first vaccination of infants with less than 3 months of age. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 120 infants under 3 months of age who referred to Tabriz Health Centers in 2009 were categorized randomly in four groups; 25%oral sucrose, breastfeeding, combined method and control groups. In the case groups, vaccination was implemented two minutes after the mentioned intervention. Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used to determine the pain score at 0, 5 and 10 minutes after the vaccination. The duration of... Background: Paracetamol may be use as antipyretic agent for the treatment of fever, as well as an analgesic in the treatment of mild to moderate pain on post vaccination in infants. The use of Paracetamol during fever may be or may not be recommended since it may alter natural human body immune response although it may reduce pain. Objectives: This study described the relevancy of Paracetamol use post infants vaccination based on data collection systematic review analyses. This study aims to describe the effectiveness of breastfeeding in reducing pain and Paracetamol in reducing fever and pain post infants vaccination.
