PY - 2022/4 Y1 - 2022/4 N2 - Influenza virus circulates year-round, yet uptake of maternal influenza vaccination decreases outside of influenza season. This prospective study of 62 pregnant women provides insight into the possible underlying reasons for this. Despite knowledge of benefits for maternal and infant outcomes, we observed a lack of understanding of rates of influenza infection outside influenza season, concerns about safety in relation to receiving multiple vaccinations during the same pregnancy, and lack of healthcare provider recommendation to be vaccinated outside influenza season. These findings can help tailor public health education targeting pregnant women and their healthcare providers to improve influenza vaccine uptake.
