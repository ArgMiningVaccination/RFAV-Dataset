Rather than merely seeking the legacies of colonialism in Indigenous texts, this dissertation acknowledges the devastating impact of colonialism on Indigenous peoples but does not give colonialism cente r stage. Instead, the center belongs to Indigenous traditions and the dialogue that takes place between the stories being written today and the ancient stories and histor ies that have been passed down through generations. In exploring these novels and the cultural landscapes thei r authors call home, we see that travel, migrations, and the resul ting intercultural contact s are not incidental, but integral to many Indigenous cultures, and contribute to a growing sense of Indigenous internationalism. Mobility and travel are not in conflict with, but instead coexist with a sense of rootedness and place. Thus, as we l ook at contemporary cro ss-cultural contacts among Indigenous authors, artists, and activis ts, it is vital to understand the long Indigenous histories both of rootedness and mobility. vi TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION: Travel, Mobility, and International Indigenous 1 I d e n t i t i e s CHAPTER ONE: Home is Where the Indians Are: International 34 Indigeneity, Mobility, and Home in the Work of Thomas King CHAPTER TWO: \" We are internationalists!\": Rootedness, 73 Migration, and Indigenous Intern ationalism in Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the \"A Maori Travel, in Witi Ihimaera's The Uncle's Story CONCLUSION 193 WORKS CITED 205 VITA 220 1Introduction: Travel, Mobility, and In ternational Indigenous Identities Indigenous cultures have long traditions of travel and mobility that empower them to survive, adapt to changing physical and poli tical contexts, and create new futures for themselves. This dissertation proposes a criti cal perspective that recognizes travel and migration neither as elements foreign to I ndigenous cultures nor as symptoms of their hybridity or assimilation. Rather, they are cen tral elements of Indigenous tradition, and as such inform contemporary Anglophone Indige nous writing as well as international Indigenous political actions. Understanding the place of travel within Indigenous cultures leads to a deeper understanding of the Indigenous peoples' ri ghts, which include not only the right to land, but also the right of free move ment. Such mobility is not in conflict with but is instead complementary to a powe rful sense of place and rootedness. This project arose out of an interest in the international Indigenous peoples' protests and conferences surrounding the 1992 Co lumbian quincentennial. I spent the fall of 1991 in Mexico and Guatemala on a program abroad, and part of the program entailed meetings with people who were organizing I ndigenous groups. Even groups in relatively remote areas were not only aware of the upcoming 500-year annive rsary (for which many had some kind of commemoration planned), but also saw their own local struggles as connected with those of Indigenous peoples in other parts of the Americas. These experiences raised my awareness of and at tention to the commemorations of 1992. While governments in Europe and the Americas or ganized international celebrations of Columbus's voyage of \"discovery,\" Indigenous peoples organized counter- 2commemorations to contest the celebratory Eu rowestern narrative. Native peoples of the Americas were at the forefront of these count er-commemorations, but they were joined in their efforts by Indigenous pe oples from around the world. For example, an international conference of Aboriginal peoples was conve ned outside the 1992 Eart h Summit in Rio de Janeiro; while most attendees were from the Americas, groups as far-flung as the Ainu in Japan and Saami from Scandinavia sent re presentatives as well (\"Ainu Represented,\" \"Indigenous Village\"). A similar meeting took place in Panama in October of 1992, including Indigenous leaders fr om five continents (\"Indigenous Peoples\"). The first World Indigenous Youth Conference took pl ace in 1992 in Quebec City, Canada, and drew participants from all over the wo rld. Rigoberta Mench\u00fa's 1992 Nobel Peace Prize also served to focus international attention on the struggles of Indi genous peoples, as did the United Nations' declaring 1993 the Intern ational Year of th e World's Indigenous People.1 Groups as diverse as the Saami, the Inuit in Canada, the United States, Greenland and Russia, the Cherokee in the United States, Mayans in Mexico and Guatemala, and the Ainu in Japan were visibly organizing their resistance around a collective identity : that of Indigenous peoples. In The Origins of Indigenism (2003), Ronald Niezen notes that \"one of the distinguishing marks of this [Indigenous rights] movement is the extent to which, unlike ethnonationalism, it is grounded in international networks\" (9). 1 Wanting to keep 1992 focused on positive representations of Columbus, Spain successfu lly petitioned for 1993 to be the International Year of the World's Indigenous People, rather than 1992 as originally proposed (Moorehead). Against the wishes of Indigenous representatives, the UN also decided to use the term \"people\" rather than \"peoples,\" as the term \"peoples\" indicates groups with the right of political sovereignty and was thus opposed by UN member states with Indigenous groups within their boundaries. 3 But where are the roots of this sense of international Indigenous identity? Given the linguistic and cultural differences that exist among Indigenous groups, and the differing experiences of colonialism, how did the idea of Indigenous commonality develop? Was it a product of globalization, a process that, as Antonio Hardt and Michael Negri propose in Empire (2000), was increasing interna tional contact and migration? Hardt and Negri suggest that A specter haunts the world, and it is the specter of migration. All the powers of the old world are allied in a merciless operation against it, but the movement is irresistible. Along with the flight from the so-called Third World there are flows of political re fugees and transfers of intellectual labor power, in addition to the massive movements of the agricultural, manufacturing, and service proletariat. (213) This \"specter of migration\" that haunts th e narrative of globalization has been of ongoing interest to postcolonial writers and theorist s, as much of the migration Hardt and Negri describe has been from formerly colonized nations. Most critics have focused primarily on contacts between postcolonia l nations and their former co lonizers, contacts that are still structured by the hier archies of colonialism. Few scholars have examined international and intercultural contacts outside of these hierarchies, and the problem that results from this oversight is the reestablis hment of imperial culture as the center, and continued relegation of colonized cultures to the margin. My undergraduate work had been heavily centered on postcolonial literature and theory, but as I began paying more attenti on to the concerns of Indigenous peoples, I 4began to wonder why postcolonia l theory, in spite of claiming global scope, did not seem to address Indigenous groups. When white Australians are considered postcolonial, the term \"postcolonial\" becomes inadequate to describe the situation of Aboriginal Australians, who have not onl y lived through British colonization, but continue to be colonized by the \"postcolonial\" Australian ma jority. The term \"postcolonial\" is also simply inaccurate for most Indigenous groups, as they are still colonized. There is no \"post\" in the Indigenous colonial situation. Leaving aside the question of terminol ogy, however, it is still worth asking whether some of the insights developed by postcolonial theorists can be usefully applied within an Indigenous context. A close look at postcoloni al and Indigenous theories suggests that these conflicts may not be as ex treme as they initially appear. Part of the issue is that \"postcolonial th eory\" is a wide field, encompassing such diverse approaches to history and culture as\u2014for example\u2014Marxism, postmodernism, nationalism, and essentialism. In spite of its name, postcolonia l theory is often interpreted as including anti-colonial works written before the end of colonialism, most not ably Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth , published during the Algerian war for independence in 1961; certainly Edward Said's writings on Pale stine speak of an ongoing situation of colonization. Postcolonial theory also prom inently includes works that elide or erase histories of contemporary colonization and I ndigenous resistance: seminal works such as Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin's The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in Post-Col onial Literatures (1989), in which settler co lonies such as Australia and New Zealand are defined as postcolonial , leave little space for the struggle of 5colonized peoples in these areas. Although Indigenous peoples in these states are mentioned, they are neither the focus of the te xt nor does their presence seem to have any effect on the \"postcolonial\" iden tity of the settler colony. Indigenist critiques of postcolonial theory have focused on the fact that many postcolonial texts marginalize or ignore the ongoing struggles of Indigenous peoples, as well as on the problematic term \"postcolonial\" itself. The problem with the term lies not merely with the ongoing colonization of Indige nous peoples, but also with the implicit association of the term with a progressive conception of history. Thomas King, in his 1990 article \"Godzilla vs. Post-Col onial,\" points out that the term \"postcolonial\" rests on certain assumptions: While post-colonialism purports to be a method by which we can begin to look at those literatures which are formed out of the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor...the te rm itself assumes that the starting point for that discussion is the advent of Europeans in North America. At the same time, the term organizes th e literature progressively suggesting that there is both progres s and improvement. (11-12) Similar critiques, especially of the linear a nd progressive nature of the term, are familiar from within the field of postcolonial criticism as well. In Imperial Leather: Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Colonial Contest (1995), Anne McClintock makes an important distinction between postcolonial theory and the word \"postcolonial\" itself. My misgivings are not about the th eoretical substance of postcolonial theory, much of which I greatly admi re. Rather, I question the orientation 6of the emerging discipline and its concomitant theories and curricula changes around a singular, monolithic term, used ahistorically and haunted by the nineteenth-century image of linear progress. (13) In \"Godzilla vs. Post-Colonial,\" King also admits that he is \"not a theorist,\" and thus \"can not talk about the theory itself, how it work s\" (10); instead, his primary concern is the term itself. While King's lack of backgr ound with postcolonial theory may not be emblematic of the approach of Indigenous cr itics, it does suggest that the very term \"postcolonial\" may be a barrier. The term a ppears to announce that currently colonized Indigenous peoples are not with in its purview, and the erasur e inherent in the term is more powerful than the efforts at inclusion made by some prominent theorists within the field, such as Gayatri Spivak in A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Toward a History of the Vanishing Present , or McClintock in her abovementioned text. An additional problem in using a postcoloni alist approach to Indigenous literature is the fact that postcolonial theory ap proaches Indigenous literatures with a predetermined framework of analysis, rather than one that emerges from the literature itself, often resulting a constant compare-and-contrast analysis rather than an analysis in and of itself. Anishinaabe author Kimberly M. Blaeser addresses this problem in her essay \"Native Literature: Seeking a Critic al Center\" (1993), critiquing none other than Vine Deloria, Jr., for defining the paramete rs of Native literatu re by way of Western categories. Even if Deloria does define Native literature in opposition to the West, [Such oppositions] actually proceed from and reinforce an understanding of the dominant position of the Eu ro-American literary aesthetic, 7constructing their own identity as they do by its relationship to the master template... The emerging critical langua ge expressing [a] central aesthetic characteristic of Native literature need not or should not have to base its existence or integrity on an oppositional relati onship. (57-58) Blaeser takes Deloria to task for allowing Euro-American categories to take a central position even as he tries to define American Indian literature. Instead, she suggests, a definition of the parameters and aesthetic a pproaches of American Indian literature may best be found by studying American Indian literature itself, rather than by applying literary categories that have emerged from the study of European literature to the works of American Indian authors. Indigenous theorists should not make colonial discourse the central element of their approach. The trope of cultural hybridity, which reflects a focus on the colonizer-colonized relationship, has long been a mainstay in di scussions of Indigenous peoples. For example, in the seminal 1953 study Indigenous Peoples: Living and Working Conditions of Aboriginal Populations in Independent Countries ,2 published by the Inte rnational Labour Office, the authors describe the difficulty in coming up with a workable definition of \"Indigenous peoples\": Today the result of this common life [between conqueror and conquered] is often a kaleidoscopic process of biological and cultural hybridism. The physical and ethnic criterion still has a certain value for practical 2 This study led to the ILO's 1957 Convention concerning the Protection and Integration of Indigenous and Other Tribal and Semi-Tribal Populations in Independe nt Countries. This convention was controversial in large part because it saw assimilation into the dominant community as its primary goa l, and because of this was revised substantially in 1989; in spite of the 1957 convention's problems, however, it was among the first documents to recognize the continued existence and rights of Indigenous communities. 8classification, but only in dealing wi th groups which, like the forest dwellers of the Amazon region, have, b ecause of geographi cal isolation or social structure, or both, continue d to exist in relative purity. (4) An invocation of cultural hybridity can imply th e existence of cultura l purity and suggest that so-called hybrid cu ltures have lost some essential integrity. This version of hybridity echoes the trope of the Vanishing Indian by suggesting that there are no longer any pure, authentic Indigenous cultures, for they are in compatible with modern ity; their decline and disappearance were (or are) inevitable. While the idea of hybridity in and of itself does not necessarily suggest the disappearance of Indigenous cultures, it does suggest that those cultures still present today are not quite authentic. In his book The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art (1988), James Clifford describes this widespread view as one that sees \"the world as populated by endangered authenticities\" (5). More recent postcolonial ite rations of hybridity appear to resist the notion of \"endangered authenticities.\" Homi Bhabha, for example, in The Location of Culture, sets hybridity in opposition to \"the purists of di fference\" (111) as a means of disavowing fixed identities. Hybridity may be a strate gy of resistance to a ssimilation, as Bhabha explains: When the natives [of India] demand an Indianized Gospel, they are using the powers of hybridity to resist ba ptism and to put the project of conversion in an impossible position. Any adaptation of the Bible was forbidden by the evidences of Christianity. (118) 9Bhabha also posits hybridity as existing both in the coloni zed and the colonizing culture at their points of contact, the liminal sp aces. Discussing another missionary effort at colonizing the population of India which make s use of language already \"preoccupied\" by Hindu traditions, words which have a different valence in the Indian cultural context than in the British one, Bhabha writes, The process of translatio n is the opening of anot her contentious political and cultural site at the he art of colonial represen tation. Here the word of divine authority is deeply flawed by the assertion of the indigenous sign, and in the very practice of dominati on the language of the master become hybrid\u2014neither one thing nor the other. (33)3 The focus of Bhabha's notion of hybridity, which echoes throughout postcolonial theory, is the contact zone between colonizer and colonized. While this is a useful area to examine, such a focus elides the multitude of other influences on Indigenous cultures, including traditions that pr edate colonization, and contac t with other Indigenous or colonized peoples. Centering on the colonizer-colonized rela tionship is a problem not only in the field of postcolonial criticism. In his study Red on Red: Native American Literary Separatism (1999), Creek writer Craig S. Womack suggests that in Native American Studies, too, there is a tendenc y to concentrate on the influe nce that colonization has had on Native Americans: 3 Bhabha's use of the term \"indigenous\" seems to be synonymous with \"colonized\"; for example, all Indians in India are indigenous. This elides the substantial differences between colonized groups who have gone through a process of decolonization and those who have not. This is particularly notable as India, the area of Bhabha's primary focus, itself recognizes Indigenous \"Scheduled Tribes\" whose status as tribal differs from that of the majority of the population. 10European contact is a given; toward the purpose of contributing something toward Native Studies, however, I am more interested in what can be innovated and initiated by Native peoples in analyzing their own cultures rather than deconstructing Nativ e viewpoints and arguing for their European underpinnings or even c oncentrating on white atrocities and Indian victims. (12) Scholars such as Arnold Krupat and Elvira Pulitano argue fo r the \"hybridity\" of Native texts, insisting that written production by Native peoples is alwa ys already hybrid. For example, in her 2003 book Toward a Native American Critical Theory , Pulitano criticizes Womack's tribally centered approach: By envisioning a Native American theory exclusively grounded in indigenous categories... both [Robert Warrior and Craig Womack] seem to overlook the complex level of hybridization and cultural translation that is already operating in any form of Native discourse (including their own). (61) Establishing Native texts as inescapably hybrid and as artifacts of \"cultural translation\" again invokes the relationship between Indigeno us people and their co lonizers as the key source of Indigenous identity and the major factor in Indigenous creative works. On the other hand, several scholars, including the abovementioned Kimberly Blaeser and Craig Womack, have suggested the necessity of tribally specific approaches, as well as approaches that pl ace Indigenous cultures, historie s, and peoples at the center, rather than the margins, of study. Nota bly, Osage scholar Robert Warrior, in Tribal 11Secrets: Recovering American Indian Intellectual Traditions (1994), argues for the recovery and centering of I ndigenous epistemologies in scholarly work, and Craig Womack, in Red on Red: Native American Literary Separatism (1999), develops a tribally-centered methodology for reading Na tive texts. Neither author denies the importance of colonization in American Indian culture; instead, both focus on the influence of Indigenous literature and cu lture on Native Ameri can literature and intellectual life. Womack's book insists on the importance of specific tribal contexts to the work of Native American authors; he begins with the statement that This book arises out of the convictio n that Native literature, and the criticism that surrounds it, needs to s ee more attention devoted to tribally specific concerns. (1) He also makes very clear that he is not wr iting \"in a rejectionist mode,\" and that his \"argument is not that this is the only way to understand Creek writing but an important one\" (2). Womack's tribally specific way of r eading is not in any way in conflict with an Indigenous internationalist appr oach such as the one I am su ggesting here; rather, the two are complementary. As Womack points out, tribally specific readings do not exclude other readings; instead, they provide a methodology that proceeds from an Indigenous cultural center, a perspective focused not on Eurowestern co lonialism but on Indigenous traditions and communities. In fact, Womack suggests that approaching Indigenous literature from the local level may lead to a greater understanding of the international aspects of such literature: 12One of the obvious areas of inquiry in Native studies in the future will have to be the effect of pan-tr ibalism on Native cultures...[including] beginning global alliances and awar eness among indigenous populations worldwide.... How does a study such as this, with its intense concentration on tribal specificity, deal with pan-tribalism? To answer this question, I look at a Muskogee poet whose work is solidly rooted in both Oklahoma Creek Indian realities and national, and international, indigenous perspectives....[I explai n] how Harjo's Creek nationalism strengthens, rather than weakens, her ability to take on pa n-tribal concerns. (18-19) A tribally specific approach thus neither ignores the impact of colonialism or Eurowestern cultures on Native peoples, nor does it deny a pan-tribal or international Indigenous perspective; rather , it suggests that understa nding an Indigenous writer's national culture and history is central, and wi ll in turn provide a solid foundation for a more internationalist approach. Combining tribally specific and internationalist readings also enables an approach to Indigenous internationalism that fore grounds lateral contacts among Indigenous peoples and reads these political and cultu ral contacts in light of strong local\u2014not colonial\u2014traditions of movement . Indigenous internationalism exists in part because of the strength of tribal traditions and identifica tions, traditions that include mobility as well as contact with other peoples. Contemporary in ternational political contacts are not mere 13products of a recent globalization but ar e the continuation of a long tradition of Indigenous travel and contact. Definitions Indigenous identity is neither uni tary nor static but is instea d in constant motion, resisting easy definition. However, although there is no si ngle, fixed definition of the term, it is still necessary to explore the term and its va rious meanings. It remains a valuable project to determine some of the term's multiple meanings and how these meanings are invoked in resistance to colonialism, even while the term is in constant motion, fixable and definable only as it is alr eady vanishing. Ronald Niezen, in The Origins of Indigenism (2003), states that Indigenous peoples themselves have often been the ones to resist a fixed definition of the term, fearing that it may then be invoked to exclude community members and limit communal rights. Indigenous delegates to international meetings have often expressed the idea that a precise, legal definition of the term \"indigenous\" would impose standards or conditions for participat ion in human rights processes that would be prejudicial to their intere sts. For one thing, such a definition would be controlled by the very state powers that they see as the principal source of their exploitation, marginal ization, and suffering. What is more, Member States of the United Nations do not follow a formal definition of the nation or the state, so a double standard would be applied to 14indigenous peoples if the terms that ar e key to their bene fits of belonging were interpreted too inflexibly. (18-19) Even in the necessarily precise field of law, \"[t]here is no ge nerally agreed definition of the term [indigenous peoples]\" (160), accordi ng to Martin Scheinin's 2000 Right to Enjoy a Distinct Culture: Indige nous and Competing Uses of Land,\" which offers an overview of international and hu man rights law as it relates to Indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, Scheinin emphasizes th at it is generally understood that \"[t]here must be another ethnic group and a power relationship involved before the descendants of the original inhabitants are understood as i ndigenous in the legal meaning of the term\" (161). The first recorded use of the term \"indigenous,\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is in a 1646 text by Sir Thomas Browne, Pseudodoxia Epidemica: or, Enquiries into Very Many Received Tenents [sic] , and Commonly Presumed Truths . 4 A look into the archives of the Journal of the Royal Ge ographical Society of London suggests that by the 1830s British colonists and adventurers we re using the term regularly to describe people (rather th an flora and fauna). Exactly when Indigenous people adopted this usage is uncertain, as many Indigenous record s were kept orally rather than in written archives, and what was written may not have been preserved. However, it appears to have been familiar enough by the 1970s, and possibl y earlier, that the World Council of Indigenous Peoples used the term when the Council was founded in 1974. 4 Browne explores why \"some men...should acquire an d still retaine the glosse and tincture of blacknesse\" (323); the term \"indigenous\" is used to explain that black people in the Americas were \"all transported from Africa...and are not indigenous or proper natives of America\" (325). A search on Early English Books Online found five other texts from the late 1600s to use the word, four of which were dictionaries of new or difficult English terms. 15 While Indigenous organizations tend to resi st codified definitions of the term and have what Niezen calls an \"open-door policy to ward participation\" (21), there are still implicit definitions at work. Niezen reca lls an anecdote from the UN Working Group meeting in 1999, where a representative of the Rehoboth Baster Community addressed the Working Group, claiming discrimination ag ainst this community by the Namibian government. Their claim to be Indigenous was at best tenuous, as they are descendants of Dutch colonists who were also allied w ith German colonizers in the area. The representative was not denied the right to speak, but as he spoke, \"hundreds of indigenous delegates silently left the room, then resume d their seats when he had finished\" (22). The descriptions of Indigeneity put forth by the World Council of Indigenous Peoples and other Indigenous peoples' organiza tions center on what Chadwick Allen in Blood Narrative: Indigenous Identity in Amer ican Indian and Maori Literary and Activist Texts (2002) terms \"the blood/land/memory co mplex\": loosely translated, a focus on community, land, and history. He quotes the words of the WCIP's founding Solemn Declaration, We are the Indigenous Peoples of the Earth. We are proud of our Past, Our lives were one with the Earth, Our hearts were one with the Land. (203) In her introduction to the anthology skins: Contemporary Indigenous Writing (2000), Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm places similar empha sis on history, land, and responsibility to the community: 16The writers [in this anth ology] come from diverse cultures and histories, from the far north of Canada to th e south Pacific islands of Aotearoa. Despite these differences, what all of the writers share is our connection to our homelands, our histories of colo nization, genocide, and displacement, and our will to survive and pass the tr easures of our cultures to future generations. (vi) A shared history of colonization, discrimi nation, and displacement, combined with a close connection to the land, form the basis for Indigenous identity as expressed by the WCIP and by Akiwenzie-Damm. They stop s hort, however, of e xplicit definitions; by implication, then, community acceptance is a central component of Indigenous identity. Some international groups, however, do have explicit definitions of what constitutes \"Indigenous peoples.\" These definitio ns originate in the International Labour Office's Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989; a revision of the original 1957 documen t), and the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations' draft Declaration of Indigenous Rights (1994). From these two definitions, the following four points may be distilled: Indigenous peoples: 1. Were native to a given country pr ior to the arrival of colonists; 2. Consider themselves a distinct group within the nation and may further be distinguished by their social, cultural and economic conditions; 3. Are determined to maintain their ethnic identity and to transmit their identity and knowledge to future generations; they al so strive to maintain their ancestral territories; 174. Form \"non-dominant sectors of society, \" which in practice is usually held to mean that they are a numerical minority in their country. These definitions raise as many questions as they answer. In particul ar, the questions of when colonization begins, and whether colo nizing groups might after some amount of time become Indigenous, are not addressed. A furthe r issue raised by Indigenous self- definitions is that many Indigenous writers have considered African s in general to be Indigenous, whether or not they are member s of a national minority group, a notion not supported by the above definitions. The issue of \"non-dominance\" raises ma ny questions\u2014were black South Africans Indigenous in the apartheid er a, and are they no longer Indigenous now? In that case, the distinction between \"native\" and \"Indige nous\" is particularly clear and hinges on precisely this issue of non-dominance. What degree of economic and cultural power, if any, might justify or eliminate claims of Indigeneity? Richard Perry, in From Time Immemorial: Indigenous Pe oples and State Systems (1996), argues that there is a significant economic component to Indige nous identity. He focuses on Indigenous peoples in the settler societie s of Mexico, the United States, Canada, and Australia, but in his third section also considers \"other states and Indigenous peoples\" (8). In discussing Papua New Guinea, Perry notes that \"un like Australia, Canada, or the United States...[Papua New Guinea] is not a settle r society....[After political independence,] Papua New Guinea returned to the possession of its Indigenous peoples\" (209). But the salient fact, for Perry, is not the political independence, but the continued economic dependence of this former colony. Papua New Guinea's policies and decisions are largely 18determined by powerful transnational corpor ations, leaving the nominally empowered native people still at the mercy of outside, neoc olonial forces. Thus, they are for Perry not only native but still Indigenous: Indigeneity is centrally about access to power, which he considers in an international framework. In Perry's analysis, the I ndigenous are the new subalterns, the ones who, apparently by defin ition, lack access to mechanisms of power. There may indeed be great internationalis t potential in Perry 's conception of Indigeneity, as most of the world's peoples begin to fall under the rubr ic of \"Indigenous.\" The potential for broader-based action based on class begins to take on reality. Tellingly, he discusses some of these notions in a s ection entitled \"Are They Us?\": \"The trend seems clear. The mass of the indigent popula tions of states are tending to become 'indigenized' regardle ss of their ethnic heritage\" (251). Indigenous here becomes indigent, the new iteration of the proletariat. While such an international, class-base d alliance of the dise mpowered would be an important social movement, the use of the term \"Indigenous\" for such an alliance is misleading, for it ignores what Indigenous definitions tend to foreground: the land. Leslie Marmon Silko's novel Almanac of the Dead (1991) critiques Karl Marx's ideas, in particular his disregard of the importance of the land: \"True leaders of the people made return of the land first prio rity. No excuses, no postponements... First the land\" (524). Perry's effort to construct a broad coalition of the underp rivileged avoids the central importance of land in the context of Indige nous identity. This importance goes beyond a purely economic analysis\u2014it is not merely about access to the land's resources and power. For example, in 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court awarded $106 million to eight 19Sioux tribes as compensation for the Black H ills, taken illegally from the Sioux by the government and mining corporations in 1877. The Sioux reservations are among the poorest in the nation, and yet th ey refused the settlement, in sisting on the return of the land itself. The settlement has now grown to around $600 million, but the tribes still refuse to take the money because the Black Hills have cultural importance. The Sioux response to the legal settlement illustrates the central importance of place and land in Indigenous identifications. Finally, Perry's equation of Indigenous with disempowered\u2014 an equation also suggested by the ILO and UN definition of Indigenous people as \"non-dominant sectors of society\"\u2014calls to mind Gayatri Spivak's caution that claiming agency from victimage may be a profoundly disempowering act. David A. B. Murray offers a critique of popular views of Indigenous people in his 2004 article \"Takat pui, Gay, or just HO-MO-SEXUAL , Darling? M ori Language, Sexual Terminology, and Identity in Aotearoa/New Zealand\": \"Indigenes\" are located in societies wh ere the colonizing population (us) is said to manifest a modern, cosm opolitan identity and the colonized population (them) is said to have a \"traditional indi genous\" identity represented through a totalizing, stat ic, pre-European contact culture concept, revealing \"indigenous\" to be a very modern term and thus complicating the borders of the us/them binary. (166) While the stereotypical view of Indigenous cult ures is that they ar e static and unchanging, traditional Indigenous cultures are anything but static. However, the false dichotomy that 20Murray identifies between \"Indigenous\" and \"cosmopolitan\" remains remarkably common. History of International Indigenous Contacts Studying the history of colonized peoples is always a challenge, as the question of \"whose history is it?\" looms large. It is imperative that we rely not just on those scholarly histories validated by the academy, but that we prioritize Indigenous archives, including oral traditions and written stories, that prov ide an Indigenous view of history. Moreover, we must recognize that there is no \"master narrative\" of Indigeneity out there to be \"discovered.\" Instead, there are a wide range of stories that, when connected to each other, offer us a sense of the historical depth and breadth of international Indigenous contacts, and that may provide new insight into local as well as global histories. Rather than offering a historical master narrative, this history provides a variety of moments in which we see some movement toward international Indigenous alliances. One of these moments comes around 1785, in the United States. In a sermon, Mohegan tribal leader and Presbyterian mi nister Samson Occom me ntions Captain Cook arriving at \"Otaihite\" (Tahiti) and giving the \"Indians\" there venereal diseases. Though his use of the term \"Indian\" follows Cook' s own usage, we should not dismiss it as unimportant. Occom, who had been instrument al in forming a pantribal community at Brotherton, in New York, was a skilled orat or who well knew the power of language. He was also invested in forming alliances betw een Native Americans from different tribal 21backgrounds, and may well have seen, in the Tahitians, a kindred group about to undergo experiences similar to those of the native peoples he was familiar with. While we can only guess what the impact of his sermon was, it is quite possible that it gave Occom's Christian Indian community of Brotherton a se nse that they were c onnected not only to other Americans, but to Polyne sian native peoples as well. Throughout the 1800s, Polynesian people, Ha wai'ians in partic ular, began settling in the U.S. and Canada. There is, of course , a long history of Po lynesian voyaging, both within and outside of Oceania, and Polynesian s were sought after as sailors on European and American ships. David Chappell, in Double Ghosts: Oceanian Voyagers on Euroamerican Ships (1997), explains that \"Oceanians knew that the sea was a road map, not a barrier, and that saili ng routes, like highways, connect ed worlds\" (173)\u2014what Epeli Hau'ofa famously referred to islands.\" Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851) is perhaps the most well-known imag e of the mixing of cultures that was common in the shipping industry throughout the 1800s.5 In 1787, a Hawai'ian chieftain named Kaima traveled aboard a U.S. ship to China and North America, and returned to Hawai'i a year later. His e xperiences encouraged other Hawai'ians to travel abroad. As a resu lt of their seafaring, a relatively large number of Hawai'ians were present in North Amer ica even in the early 1800s. Many Hawai'ians lived and worked at Fort Vancouver in the Northwest, under a deal made between the Hudson's Bay Company and the Hawai'ian ki ng; after being rele ased from their indentured service, many of the Hawai'ians st ayed in the U.S., and there is evidence that 5 Chappell notes that by the mid-1800s, Polynesians compri sed about one-fifth of the sailors in the American whaling fleet (42). 22they intermarried with local Native Ameri can communities. By the 1810s, Chappell notes, Hawaiians in the Northwest of North America were serving on ships, at shore stations, and alongside French Canadian and Iroquois voyageurs in fur-trapping expeditions (102). The number of Hawai'ians on the U.S. East Coast was somewhat smaller, but not insignificant. One of the early documents of these expatriate Hawa i'ians is the 1819 book Memoir of Henry Obookiah, A Native of Owhy hee, Who Died at Cornwall, Connecticut, February 17, 1818, Aged 26 . The memoir, published by Edwin Welles Dwight, draws from a variety of different sources, includi ng, in all likelihood, Henr y Opukahaia himself. (The memoir refers to him as Henry O bookiah; however, his name was Opukahaia.) Opukahaia was an enthusiastic Christian conve rt who wished to return to Hawai'i as a missionary. What was to become the Co rnwall (CT) Foreign Mission School was founded in order to provide him and other \"h eathen\" students with an education that would qualify them for such missionary work. The Cornwall school represents an early moment of Indigenous internationalism; at its inception, it had \"eleven pupils, seven of them coming from the Sandwich Islands [Hawai'i]. There were twenty three students the second year and at its peak in 1823, there were thirty six\" (Reuman 7). According to headmaster James Treadwell's inaugural address, the Cornwall pupils' backgrounds we re as follows: Six men from the Sandwich Islands (Hawai'i), six from the Society Islands , an \"Indian youth\" from Pennsylvania and one from Canada (one of whom was probabl y Abenaki), seven Cherokees, two Choctaws, two Malays, and two whites. Intriguingly, th e Cherokee students include two prominent Cherokee leaders, John Ridge and Elias B oudinot; Choctaw leaders McKee and Israel 23Folsom also attended the school. This suggest s that the school played a role in shaping the leadership of two major North American tribes and may well have fostered ideas of international Indigenous community, even if that was not the school founders' intention. Opukahaia's Memoir proved so popular that a second edition was issued in 1819, and it was translated into bot h Choctaw (1827) and Haida (18 57). More research remains to be done into the reasons for the translation into these two Native American languages, but the translations suggest that someone, pr esumably either white or Native American missionaries, believed that Choctaw and Haida people could identify with this Native Hawaiian travel and conversion narrative, perh aps because of some perceived kinship of these three culturally and lingui stically distinct groups. The whaling and sealing industries were among the few places in the Americas where people of color could relia bly find employment. Aboard su ch ships, as ships' logs show, contacts among Indigenous peoples fr om a wide range of places was not uncommon, but since few if any Indigenous voyag ers kept their own journals, the nature of those contacts\u2014even whether they shared a language in common\u2014remains unclear. As a centers of the whaling industry, Aotearoa New Zealand played host to a great many voyagers, among them Indigenous peoples from across Polynesia and the Americas. One of these voyagers was a Pequot man named Elisha Apes, who jumped ship and settled in Aotearoa in the 1830s, marrying a Maori woma n of the Ngai Tahu iwi. Rather than becoming subsumed in the dominant culture \u2014as happened to so many Native Americans who married whites and whose descendants no longer know thei r tribal background\u2014 Apes must have maintained some connecti on to his own culture of origin, for his 24contemporary Maori descendants are still well aware of their Pequot ancestry. In fact, Nicola Walsh, one of Apes's descendants w ho works for Ngai Tahu and who spoke to me about her family, visited the Pequot tribe in Connecticut se veral years ago to let them know they had cousins in Aotearoa. Knowle dge of a Native American-Maori connection appeared, anecdotally, to be re latively widespread, if perhaps not common, in Aotearoa. I first heard about it from a Maori man on th e North Island, and encountered a number of other people (both in person and online) who were familiar with some version of the story (though often, the tribal background wa s mistakenly identified as Cherokee). Alongside the awareness of kinship with othe r Polynesian peoples, such (potentially) widespread awareness of familial connec tions between Maori and non-Polynesian Indigenous peoples may cont ribute to an openness toward international Indigenous alliances, both politic al and cultural. Contact among Indigenous peoples certai nly contributed to an awareness of shared experiences and shared oppression. Fo r example, in 1847, only sixteen years after the Choctaw Trail of Tears, a traumatic re moval accompanied by starvation and massive casualties, a group of Choctaws raised $710 to send to Ireland, where the colonized Irish were suffering through the catastrophic potato famine, including massive dislocation as well as starvation. To raise such a large sum of money only a few years after the devastation of forced removal suggests the importance the Choctaw attached to their felt connection to the colonized Irish people (a s well as the significance of Choctaw intermarriage with Irish Americans). Geor ge Copway, an Anishinaabe minister who 25traveled to Europe around 1850, also notes a particularly sympathy for Ireland in his narrative Running Sketches of Men and Places . One fertile area of inquiry\u2014as well as possible source for the perception of kinship between radically different Indige nous groups\u2014are the various Lost Tribes theories of the 19th centuries. Such theories held that particular Native American, Polynesian, or other peoples were actually Lo st Tribes of Israel. William Apess, a Pequot minister, offered a lengthy excursion on this topic in his 1829 autobiography; interestingly, his writing al so gestures toward unity not only among Indians, but among all peoples of color. Other 19th-century authors focus on the topic as well, and it was a popular method for missionaries to raise mone y for converting Indigenous peoples, since Christian doctrine holds th at the Second Coming can only occur once the Lost Tribes have been found and converted to Christianity. These are only a few of the historical connections among Indigenous peoples. There are many more, such as the First Universal Races Congress in London in 1912, and the Pequots who were exiled to Barbados during the 17th century and to this day have maintained a community there. The wide range of these connections suggests that such contacts may not have been as exceptional as they may at first appear. While more research is necessary in this area, it is equa lly important to connect existing research and knowledge in order to gain a more complete picture of these contacts. 26Travel and Migration Many contemporary definitions of \"Indigenous\" emphasize rootedness, connection with the land, as a primary source of identity for native peoples, and I do not wish to suggest that this connection is anything less than cr ucial. However, this emphasis on rootedness has often, both in theory and in politics, served to elide the importance of travel and migration in Indigenous culture . The distinction I make betw een travel and migration is that travel is movement by an individual, or a small group of people, while migration involves the majority or all of the community. There are ma ny different kinds of travel and migration, and especially in the case of Indigenous peoples these have not always been voluntary. Indigenous travel has, historically, rarely been recreational, the kind of diversionary or experiential tourism that Erik Cohen di scusses in \"Phenomenology of Tourist Experiences\" (2001), and that is fam iliar from many modern travel narratives. Even those Indigenous people who composed tr avel narratives, like George Copway or Henry Opukahaia, were not traveling for the sa ke of tourism, but in stead were traveling because it was a necessary el ement of supporting themselves financially. Indigenous travel was and is affected by the economi c reality that Indigenous communities and travelers often do not have access to financ ial capital. While contemporary Indigenous travelers need not secure their transpacific passage by working a board a whaling ship, their travel may nonetheless re late to work, as internati onal conferences of Indigenous activists, librarians, artists, or other groups become more and more common. Such travel 27may or may not require extens ive financial resources, as it is sometimes subsidized by local communities or international organizati ons\u2014as is the case for the protagonist in Witi Ihimaera's The Uncle's Story , whose Maori protagonist's trip to Canada is funded by an arts organization. Traditionally, individual travel is present in many tribal stories. For example, as I discuss in my first chapter, in her 1996 book of essays Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit , Leslie Marmon Silko tells an old Laguna Pueblo story of Kochininako/Yellow Woman and her travels: Each day, Kochininako has to walk fart her and farther from the village to find fresh water for her husband and children. One day she travels far, far to the east, to the plains, and she fi nally locates a freshwater spring... Just as she fills her water jar and turns to hurry away, a strong, sexy man in buffalo-skin leggings appears by the pool... Able to transform himself from human to buffalo in the wink of an eye, Buffalo Man gallops away with her on his back. Kochininako fa lls in love with Buffalo Man, and because of this liaison, the Buffalo Pe ople agree to give their bodies to the hunters to feed the starving Pueblo. (70-71) Yellow Woman is a traveler who travels in service to her people; without her mobility, her water-deprived community would be unabl e to maintain its roots in the land. Her travel, individual though it is, is in servi ce to the larger community; without her willingness to venture out of familiar territory, her people might have perished. Kiowa author N. Scott Momaday tells a similar story in The Way to Rainy Mountain (1969): 28Long ago there were bad times. The Kiowas were hungry and there was no food. There was a man who heard his ch ildren cry from hunger, and he went out to look for food. He walked four days and...came to a great canyon. ...A voice spoke to him and said, \"Why are you following me? What do you want?\"...The man answered that the Kiowas were hungry. \"Take me with you,\" the voice said, \"and I will give you whatever you want.\" From that day Tai-me [the sa cred Sun Dance doll] has belonged to the Kiowas. (36) Among the Maori, the voyager Kupe, who, on hi s own, explored and named much of the Aotearoa coast, is a culture hero. He is sa id to have opened the North Island up for Maori colonization, and while there is some debate on the timing of his voyage in relation to Maori voyaging overall, 6 his voyages of exploration are still commemorated today; a statue of him stands ne ar Wellington harbor. Group migration also plays a significan t role in many tribal stories. Some Cherokee origin stories, for example, suggest that the Cherokee origin ally came to their homeland from an island off the coast of Sout h America, while others suggest an eternal presence in their homeland in southern Appalachia. The Cherok ee leader Sequoyah, who developed the Cherokee alphabet, is widely believed to ha ve died in Mexico while searching for the southern kin of the Cher okee who remained behind after the Cherokee migrated northward. Daniel He ath Justice points out that, 6 See Ranginui Walker, Ka Whaiwhai Tonu Matou: Struggle Without End , 34-37, for more on this debate. 29Although Cherokee wisdom traditions in clude stories abou t the creation of the world in what is now southern Ap palachia, they also include stories about migrations and movements fr om lands far removed from those mountain ridges. The specter of re moval first begins to haunt the Cherokees in these stories. (48) In light of these stories, Ju stice suggests that \"Indigenousne ss doesn't always require an eternal presence in a particular location: though not necessarily elastic, the relational principle of peoplehood is adaptable to multip le spirits and sacred landscapes\" (49). Indeed, many Indigenous groups, including the Ma ori, the Anishinaabe, the Kiowa, the Hawai'ians, the Crow, and many others tell how their people traveled over long distances before finally settling in the place that b ecame their homeland. (It should be noted that while migration stories are common, some tribes' origin stories suggest that they have always occupied the same lands, although\u2014as in the case of the Laguna, discussed in Chapter One, movement may still play an important role.) The example of the Cherokees also serves as a reminder that there is a vast gulf between voluntary migration and forced removal, and that many Native communities today were driven from their ancestral lands against their will by colonizing forces. These forced migrations, such as the Cherokee Trail of Tears, or the Potawatomi Trail of Death, and even the many removals of the pantribal Christian Indian community of Brotherton, which occupy a middle ground between forced and voluntary movement, are generally experienced as traumatic events, unlike the vol untary migrations of traditional stories. Traditional migration stories generally invo lve the tribe seeking a particular location, 30often with a sacred aspect to it (like the Anishinaabe, who were told to seek a place where \"food grows on water\"), and when the people ar rive at their destin ation, they recognize the place as always and alrea dy their home. Forced removals involve the loss of precisely that home, with no possibility of return, and in addition to the traumatic loss of sacred and ancestral land, also usually entail ex tensive loss of life among the community. Contact among Indigenous peoples after co lonization contributed to an awareness of shared experiences and sh ared oppression, in particular the experience of forced removal, as the example of the 1847 Choctaw donation to Ireland demonstrates. The wide range of such transnational connections suggests that such contacts were not as exceptional as they may at first appear, and also that they have played a larger role in contemporary Indigenous culture s than many scholars acknowledge. Rather than an exclusive emphasis on roots, those of us work ing in Indigenous Studies should recognize what Indigenous migration stories are telling us, and be open to what scholars of the interconnected islands of Oceania already know : \"[T]o search for roots is to discover routes\" (Teaiwa, qtd. in Diaz and Kauanui 319). Summary This dissertation places severa l works of Indigenous literature in a framework that acknowledges the importance bo th of local traditions and of transnational contacts between Indigenous cultures. Because my or iginal plans for this project\u2014examining works by Indigenous authors from every c ontinent\u2014would have required a multi-volume 31set, I narrowed my focus to the Anglophone world. Though Indigenous peoples do connect with each other across linguistic barriers, focusing on groups who share a common language and who were all at some point subjects of British colonization narrowed the field to some degree. I also c hose to focus on authors who were relatively well known, as introducing new authors is ofte n a project unto itself, and might have overwhelmed the underlying issues of Indigenous internationalism. However, while I do incorporate the most well-known works of the authors I chose\u2014Thomas King's Green Grass Running Water , Leslie , and Witi Ihimaera's Whale Rider \u2014I decided to focus primarily on novels wh ich had not received a great deal of critical attention, but which foregrounde d international contacts among Indigenous peoples. The first chapter, \"Home is Where the Indians Are: Intern ational Indigeneity, Mobility, and Home in the Wo rk of Thomas King,\" focuses on the work of Canadian Cherokee author Thomas King, including his radio show Dead Dog Caf\u00e9 Comedy Hour. A member of the Cherokee diaspora, Ki ng has often explored the common ground between his Cherokee heritage and the First Nations cultures of hi s chosen Canadian home. Both his work and his biography refl ect Cherokee traditions of migration and travel. Rather than imagining diasporic, ur ban Cherokee like himself as alienated from the community by physical distance, King sugge sts that for people far from their own nation's land base, home may be found with ot her Indigenous people, anywhere there are Indians\u2014places that feel familiar even as th ey are also different. And as all of North America was once Indigenous land, King's Indige nous internationalism also serves as a 32critique of the stereotypical alienated Indian who cannot thrive away from his nation or reservation. Instead, King lays claim to all of North America as an Indigenous homeland, and suggests that alienation is in the eye of the beholder. The second chapter, \"' We are internationalists!': R ootedness, Migration, and Indigenous Internationalism in Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead ,\" examines the 1991 epic novel by Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko. Almanac imagines a world where Indigenous peoples unite to challenge multinational corporations and corrupt governments, thereby reclaiming th eir land and their sovereignty. Silko's Indigenous peoples include not only Native Americans from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, but also African Americans and Af ricans, a vast imagined community. The novel suggests that international contacts ar e essential to Indige nous peoples in the struggle for sovereignty. Ancestral connections to the land are vital, but so are the links created by those who have journeyed away from their ancestral lands\u2014a perspective that can be traced to Laguna traditions and storie s like the narrative of Kochininako/Yellow Woman. The third chapter, \"A Maori Destination: Travel, Transnationalism, and Cultural Survival in Witi Uncle's Story ,\" focuses on Maori author Witi Ihimaera's novel The Uncle's Story (2000). This novel tells the st ory of Michael Mahana, a young gay Maori man, and of Michael's uncle, erased from the family's memory for the crime of loving another man. Torn between hi s homophobic Maori community and his own sexuality, Michael only begins to synthesize these two elements of his identity after meeting gay or Two-Spirit First Nations peopl e at an Indigenous peoples' conference in 33Canada. Upon returning to Aotearoa New Zeala nd, Michael begins to fight for change in Maori attitudes toward gay people, while simu ltaneously fighting for the preservation of Maori culture. Culture has long been a battleground for Indigenous peoples under colonialism, and Ihimaera's novel points out that lateral contacts and alliances among Indigenous peoples, rather than the hierarchical relationships between colonizer and colonized, can motivate change within Indi genous communities w ithout the fear of culture loss, or of one culture dominating the other. Rather than merely seeking the legacies of colonialism in Indigenous texts, this way of reading, even as it acknowledges the devastating impact of colonialism on Indigenous peoples, does not give colonialism center stage. In stead, the center belongs to Indigenous traditions and the dialogue that takes place between the stories being written today and the ancient stories and histor ies that have been passed down through generations. In exploring these novels and the cultural landscapes thei r authors call home, we see that travel, migrations, and the resul ting intercultural contact s are not incidental, but integral to many Indigenous cultures. This mobility is not in conflict with, but instead coexists with the sense of rootedness. Thus , as we look at contemporary cross-cultural contacts among Indigenous authors, artists, and activists, we must understand the long Indigenous histories both of routes and roots. 34CHAPTER ONE Home is Where the Indians Are: International Indigeneity, Mobility, a nd Home in the Work of Thomas King [W]hat remains is the firm base that we have in places\u2014even if sometimes the places aren't our own to begi n with. I'm Cherokee from Oklahoma, but I don't think of Oklahoma as home. If I think of any place as home it's the Alberta prairies, where I spent ten years with the Blackfoot people. I'm not Blackfoot, but that feels like the place I want to go back to. Thomas King1 The artificiality of borders is a constant undercurrent in Canadian Cherokee author Thomas King's work, in particular the U.S.-C anadian border and the problems it presents for Aboriginal individuals and communities . This border marks the boundaries between two colonial powers, and thus does not resona te for Indigenous peoples on an emotional or ideological level. As King writes in his 2003 book The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative, \"the border doesn't mean that much to Native people in either country. It is, after all, the figment of some one else's imagination\" (102). On a material level, however, the border remains extremely significant, as it has the force of two colonial states behind it, states currently interested in tightening border controls due to the so-called \"War on 1 Canton 3. 35Terror,\" the \"War on Drugs,\" or for health-related reasons, as during the SARS outbreak, the avian flu epidemic, or the more r ecent drug-resistant tuberculosis scare.2 The simultaneous insignificance and power of the border are vividly illustrated in King's story \"Borders\" from his 1993 collection One Good Story, That One . In \"Borders,\" a Blackfoot mother and son trying to go from Ca nada to the United States wind up trapped in the no-man's-land between the U.S. and Canadian borders. As they leave Canada, they are waved through the Cana dian border controls, bu t when they try to enter the U.S., they are asked to declare th eir citizenship. The moth er claims Blackfoot citizenship, for the U.S.-Canadian border crosses through Blackfoot territory, and maintains that she does not rec ognize the legitimacy of either the United States or Canada to claim her as a citizen. When the U.S. border guard asks her, in an attempt to ascertain her citizenship, \"Now, I know that we got Blackfeet on the American side and the Canadians got Blackfeet on their side. Just so we can keep our record s straight, what side do you come from?...Canadian side or American side?\"3 she responds, \"Blackfoot side\" (135-136). But because the Blackfoot are not recognized by the U.S. or Canada as an independent nation, she is refused entry to th e U.S., and when she turns the car around to re-enter Canada, she is also refused re-entry into Canada. When she tells the Canadian 2 In February 2006, the New York Times ran a front-page article on drug trafficking in Indian country, entitled \"Through Indian Lands, Drugs' Shadowy Trail, \" which strongly suggested the need for more federal control of Indian reservations close to or straddling U.S. national borders, as there is a \"violent but largely overlooked wave of traffick ing and crime that has swept through the nation's Indian reservations in recent years...In the eyes of law en forcement, reservations have become a critical link in the drug underworld. They have helped traffickers transport high-potency marijuana and Ecstasy from eastern Canada into cities like Buffalo, Boston and New York, and have facilitated the passage of cocaine and methamphetamine from cities in the West and Midwest into rural America.\" 3 \"Blackfoot\" is the term used in Canada, \"Blackfeet\" in the U.S.; thus even the tribe's name indicates the existence of the colonial border. 36guard that she is Blackfoot, the guard responds, \"I know...and I'd be proud of being Blackfoot if I were Blackfoot. But you have to be American or Canadian\" (138-9). The dilemma is only resolved when, after two days of being confined to the no- man's-land, the media arrive to cover the st ory, and a government official instructs the U.S. border guards to let them pass.4 The resolution to the problem is thus highly individual rather than struct ural, and the family's return to Canada a week later is uncomplicated only because the guards st ill remember them. King's story thus acknowledges both the systemic power of the bor der and the possibility for individuals to destabilize it. In another illust ration of the simultaneous reific ation and destabilization of this border, this stor y is anthologized in skins: contemporary Indigenous writing (2000), one of the first intern ational anthologies of Indigenous literature and the first to be edited by Indigenous people. In the table of cont ents, which is divided geographically, King's story falls under the categor y \"First Nations and Inuit - Canada.\" The geopolitical divisions of the table of contents suggest the continuing power of the border, while King's inclusion in the Canadian section even though his Cherokee tr ibal roots fall on the U.S. side of the border also suggests that individuals may cross over and maintain multiple connections across that border. King's novels\u2014 Medicine River (1989), Green Grass Running Water (1993), Truth and Bright Water (2000), and the pseudonymously authored DreadfulWater Shows Up and The Red Power Murders (2002 and 2006 respectively, writing as Hartley 4 This is implied, but not explicitly stated, in the st ory: a man in a suit arrives (though it is not specified which side he might represent) and talks at length to the border guards and to the Blackfoot woman, and it is after that that she is let through. 37GoodWeather)\u2014as well as hi s short story collections ( One Good Story, That One (1993) and A Short History of Indians in Canada (2005)) and the Dead Dog Caf\u00e9 radio show\u2014 all offer a range of Native char acters but often focus on Aborig inal Canadian rather than Cherokee protagonists, though there are gene rally secondary Cherokee characters. The stories are usually set in Canada or along th e U.S.-Canadian border, and the interactions among Indigenous characters from different I ndigenous and colonial nations suggest that King envisions an intertribal community that includes all of Indigenous North America. This intertribal community stil l understands the importance of tribal affiliations, and so King should not be misunderstood as sugges ting that anyone can become Indigenous merely by living close to Indigenous people. Instead, his work suggests an Indigenous internationalism: for Indigenous people who are far from their own tribal land base, home may be found anywhere there are Indians. As all of North America was once tribal land, King's Indigenous internationalism also serves to critique the stereotypical narrative of th e alienated Indian who cannot thrive away from the tribal nation or reserv ation. Instead, King sugge sts that alienation is in the eye of the beholder. King re-frames th e discussion of what is \"truly Indian\" to include a far wider range of be haviors and peoples than the stereotypes allow, including the ability to travel and live far away from ancestral lands without losing cultural connections. In this chapter, I will also discuss th e importance of a pantribal view of King, a view that can and should exist side by side with a tribally specific an alysis of his work. I will examine the role played by Cherokee hist ory in his writing, primarily in the novel 38Truth and Bright Water , and how he uses the idea of tr avel and mobility in that novel and in Green Grass Running Water to question stereotypical ideas about Indians as static and fixed rather than changing and mobile. Thomas King: Background Thomas King is of Cherokee, Greek, and Germ an descent and grew up in California. His Cherokee father left the family when Ki ng was a young child, but his mother actively maintained ties to his father's side of th e family, traveling to Oklahoma regularly and making sure that her two sons knew their Ch erokee relatives and their traditions. As a young man, King traveled widely, living for a time in Australia. He ha s spent most of his adult life living in Canada and considers it to be home, for he is now a Canadian citizen. During his time in Canada, King has devel oped strong cultural ties to Canadian Aboriginal communities, 5 and he has spent far more time living in or near Canadian First Nations territories than Cherokee communities (which are found in Oklahoma, North Carolina, Arkansas and Georgia). His artist ic collaborators are usually Aboriginal 5 While the term \"Aboriginal\" is rarely used in the U.S. to refer to American Indigenous peoples, it is in common use in Canada; similarly, the term \"Native American\" is common in the U.S. but is not commonly used in Canada. (Canadian Indigenous people are also rarely referred to, in Canada, as American Indians.) The term \"First Nations\" is a designation for those tr ibes (or enrolled members of those tribes) which have a treaty relation to the Canadian government; for a variety of reasons, not all Aboriginal Canadian people are members of First Nations. Perhaps for this reason , Thomas King most often simply uses the term \"Indian,\" which, while less common in scholarly works, is still a common term outside of academia. These linguistic differences in terminology should also serve to remind us that, though similar, U.S. and Canadian cultures are quite distinct; though I do not intend to valorize the very border that King problematizes, I also do not wish to continue a tradition of U.S. critics ignoring the cultural and political distinctiveness of Canada. 39Canadian people.6 As Arnold E. Davidson, Priscilla L. Walton, and Jennifer Andrews point out in their criti cal study of King's work, Border \"throws...[nationa l] demarcations into question, since as a Cherokee writer who moved to Cana da, he can be read as a Canadian writer and a native writer, but he cannot be a Canadian Native writ er because the Cherokees are not 'native' to Canada\" (13). Although King's Cherokee ancestors were not native to the territory that is now Canada, his close ties to Indigenous Canadians and his ancestral affiliation with the Cherokee suggest not only that the colonially imposed U.S.-Canadian border is problematic at best but also that King's work can and should be read as both tribally specific and pantriba l. In fact, his stories suggest that for Indigenous North Americans, \"home\" can be plural, or that it may even encompass the entirety of the continent\u2014everything that was once Native territory. Where others might see his physical distance from Cherokee communities as evidence of alienation or rootlessness, King's closeness to the First Nations where he now makes his home as well as his continuing engagement with Cherokee cultur e instead provide evid ence of Indigenous mobility and internationalism. \"Home\" may thus exist in multiple places. In spite of his physical distance from Cherokee communities, King is aware of Cherokee traditions and the im portance of connections to ho me. Thus, a tribally specific critical approach, as Craig Womack calls for in Red on Red: Native American Literary 6 King edited the first anthology of First Nations writers, entitled All My Relations (1990), and his radio series Dead Dog Caf\u00e9 Comedy Hour regularly featured Aboriginal Canadi an artists, actors, and authors. He is included in several anthologies of First Nations writing, and in international anthologies he is generally categorized as a Canadian Native author (though not necessarily as a Native Canadian). Biographical information can be found in Davidson et al., Border Crossings: Thomas King's Cultural Inversions , esp. 12-13, as well as throughout The Truth About Stories . 40Separatism (1999), is vital in understanding those el ements of King's work that are in dialogue with or emanate from Cherokee history and tradition. In Our Fire Survives the Storm: A Cherokee Literary History (2006), Cherokee critic Daniel Heath Justice suggests that King's Cherokee connec tions are central to his work. Although on the surface King's work seems to focus almost entirely on non-Cherokee subjects...a closer re ading demonstrates a profoundly Cherokee sensibility at the heart of his literary texts... [A]n outland Cherokee like King, raised far from the home and land bases of the People, has had to reconnect to the familia l and cultural bonds of nationhood in a different way, but one that is no le ss Cherokee...just a different kind of Cherokee experience. (213) Because King consistently focuses on First Nations characters and issues, however, it is equally important to supplem ent a Cherokee reading of King like that Justice offers with an Indigenous internati onalist reading of his work. Craig Womack provides a potential template for such a read ing in his chapter on Creek poet Joy Harjo in Red on Red . Harjo has lived away from the Cree k land base (in Oklahoma and Georgia) for a large part of her life; the Southwest, her adopted home, and its tribal peoples are often a focus of her work. In Womack's chap ter, whose first sect ion is entitled \"The Power of a Pan-Tribal Vision When the Writer Is Rooted in a Solid National Center,\" he shows that regardless of physical distance, Harjo's work is explicitly grounded in Creek traditions: 41Harjo's themes often concern the Sout hwest, which has been her home for most of her adult life, but in every co llection of her work there have been poems that deal directly with Cr eek culture and throughout the work a Creek sensibility pervades many of the poems. In interviews, Harjo has attributed her muse to an old Cr eek woman who speaks to her. (223) Although Harjo primarily writes about the Sout hwest, Womack reads Harjo's writing as promising, eventually, her return to Creek territory. King's work, by contrast, could not be read as suggesting his return to a Cherok ee home\u2014largely because, while he identifies himself as Cherokee, he also feels his home to be Canada. In the 1994 interview quoted at the beginning of this chapter, King says, [W]hat remains is the firm base that we have in places\u2014even if sometimes the places aren't our own to begi n with. I'm Cherokee from Oklahoma, but I don't think of Oklahoma as home. If I think of any place as home it's the Alberta prairies, where I spent ten years with the Blackfoot people. I'm not Blackfoot, but that feels like the pl ace I want to go back to. (Canton 3) King thus sees Blackfoot te rritory, rather than the Cherokee nation, as home, a perspective that may explain why his works ar e set not in Cherokee territory but in the homelands of Native Canadian peoples. Often, his characters' tribes are not mentioned by name, as in Truth and Bright Water or DreadfulWater Shows Up; the Canadian or U.S.- Canadian borderland settings, however, as well as other contextual clue s, indicate that the unnamed tribes are often similar, if perhaps not identical, to the Bl ackfoot or the Cree. King's internationalism does not invoke a singu lar, Cherokee center and is not \"rooted in 42a solid national center\" as Womack suggest s Harjo's pantribalism is. Instead, King's work suggests multiple centers and many potential homes. Perhaps because King has had so many hom es, the authors and storytellers who have influenced King also come from a range of backgrounds. In The Truth About Stories , King identifies Kiowa author N. Scott Momaday's Pulitzer-prizewinning House Made of Dawn (1968) as the \"advent of the modern period in Native written l iterature\" (102), one which does not supplant oral storytelling but which, through the power of the printed word, commands a far larger audience than oral storytellers could. King defines Native novels as those texts which creat[ed] a Native universe. For N. Scott Momaday, the answer, in part, was to write a novel in which the as pects of an unfamiliar [Native] universe stood close enough to parts of a known world so that the non- Native reader, knowing the one, migh t recognize the other. (108) Momaday's novel, King posits, and the many Na tive novels that followed its publication, suggest that there are ot her ways of imagining the world, ways that do not depend so much on oppositions as they do on cooperations, and they raise the tantalizing question of what else one might do if confronted with the appearance of evil. (110) The Native novels King discusses include works by Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, James Welch, Tomson Highway, Loui se Erdrich, Simon Ortiz, Lee Maracle, and Jeannette Armstrong, and these writers fo rm part of King's own genealogy as an author. 43Oral stories have shaped King as well, a nd they exist in dialogue with written stories: [T]he advent of Native written litera ture did not, in any way, mark the passing of Native oral literature. In f act, they occupy the same space, the same time. And, if you know where to stand, you can hear the two of them talking to each other. (101-102) Throughout his discussion of his creative fore bears, King reminds the reader that oral stories still exist and maintain their power; t hus, King stands \"in a ci rcle of storytellers, most of whom will never be published, who have only their imaginations and their voices\" (101). As King suggests, oral stories heard from his Cherokee relatives and from friends and elders among Firs t Nations people have influenced him as much as any written literature. The diverse influences King describes i ndicate a background that is pantribal, international, and resolutely Indigenous. The fact that his own work participates in a dialogue with both the varied texts that form his creative roots and th e varied places that shape his personal roots shows the importa nce of viewing King from an Indigenous internationalist perspective. 44Alienation and Belonging In Green Grass Running Water Thomas King suggests that th e narrative of the alienated urban Indian exists as a corollary to the st ereptypical narrative of the vanishing Indian.7 One of the main characters, Eli Stands Alone, is a Professor emeritus from the University of Toronto who had published on Shakespeare and Francis Bacon; he returns to the reservation almost by accident, coming back for a visit, as he initially told his sister Norma: \"I just came back to see the place.\" \"Of course, being as you're the oldest, you can stay as long as you like.\" \"It's just a visit.\" \"Everyone should have a home.\" ... Looking back, Eli could see that he had never made a conscious decision to stay. And looking bac k, he knew it was the only decision he could have made. (263) Eli has been successful in the world outside of the reservation, even winning Teacher of the Year twice (262); he has al so maintained his connections to his home. As he explains to Sifton, who is both his friend and his ne mesis (he is employed by the corporation seeking to flood the land Eli's cabin is on), he speaks Blackfoot as well as he speaks English, as do his niece and nephew; he move s between the dominant white culture and 7 For background on the \"Vanishing Indian\" stereotype, see Dippie, Brian W. The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy . 45the Blackfoot culture of the reservation w ith ease (141-142). The ease with which he navigates cultural differences is, Eli recogni zes, at odds with ge neral perceptions of Indians who live away from their tribal reserves: The Indian who couldn't go home. It was a common enough theme in novels and movies. Indian leaves the traditional world of the reserve, goes to the city, and is destroyed. Indian leaves th e traditional world of the reserve, is exposed to white culture, and becomes trapped be tween two worlds. Indian leaves the traditional world of the reserve, gets an education, and is shunned by his tribe. Indians. Indians. Indians. Ten little Indians... The Indian who couldn't go home. (286-287) As the familiar nursery rhyme enters King's story, the alienated Indian becomes the vanishing Indian\u2014both of whic h are stereotypical portrayal s that King challenges and, through his novels, revises. Leav ing home, here, does not auto matically equal alienation; distance does not necessarily mean disappearance. Alberta, one of the protagonists in Green Grass Running Water , serves to illustrate this ease of movement as well. Albert a enjoys travel as long as she is the one in control: Alberta liked to drive. She liked to drive her own car, and she liked to drive alone. She didn't like the idea of a trip, but once she was on her 46way...a feeling of calm always came over her... She rarely flew, hated planes, in fact. In a plane, she was helpless... (85) Here we see the vital distinction between tr avel under one's own cont rol and travel under the control of others; in order for movement to be empowering, it is absolutely vital that it be a product of choice, and be under the control of the traveler. Cars play an important role in the nove l; at some times compared to horses, at others to ships, they represent freedom fo r many of the characters, but also echo the origins of colonialism in North America in Columbus's ships, as a Nissan, a Pinto, and a Kharmann-Ghia float through the water at the novel's end. In an essay which King refers to in The Truth About Stories, mixedblood author Louis Owens muses on the omnipresence of cars in photos of his family: Something is going on in my grandmot her's instability and this strange, vehicular, photographic iconography, and I think it has to do with the past, present, and present past of India nness...Part of it, certainly, is purely American, for motion is the real Am erican dream. To be on the road indefinitely, free of root s and responsibilities...is the oldest and most destructive of all American metanarra tives...But something else is also going on...It has to do with what I will call indigenous motion. Tribal people have deep bonds with the earth, with sacred places that bear the bones and stories that tell them who th ey are... But of course almost all tribal people also have migration stories... Motion is genetically encoded in American Indian bein g...How in the world did tribal people survive all 47[of the forced removals] unless we know how to pick up and carry our selves, our histories, our st ories, our self-knowledge? ( Mixedblood Messages 162-164) The cars in Green Grass Running Water have a similar symbolic value as the ones Owens describes; they repres ent both colonial destruction and Indigenous survival. The novel offers numerous reminders of colonial travel, including characters who assume the names of Robinson Crusoe, or, echoing Herm an Melville, Sergean t Cereno and Ishmael. King is keenly aware that, like the cars, travel per se is neither positive or negative; it can reinforce colonialism just as much as it can provide Indigenous people with freedom. King's Indians can move easily between tribal and non-tribal society, and many are at home in cities as well as on rese rves; some, however, cannot negotiate the stereotypes and expectations of Aboriginal people. Thes e characters\u2014in particular, Portland Looking Bear, a former movie star \u2014lack a strong sense of self that is underscored by travel. Rather than showing hi s independence, as Alberta's driving does for her, Portland travels to find himself a nd only loses himself further. As Portland becomes more and more well known and begins to net starring roles in Hollywood, he discovers that he is not \"Indian\" enough. As one of his co-stars points out, \"Just because you are an Indian doesn't mean that you can act like an Indian for the movies\" (185). Caught in a world where ideas about his identi ty are determined by stereotypes, Portland changes his name to Iron Eyes Screeching Eagle (an allusion to Iron Eyes Cody, the Italian actor who played the ic onic Crying Indian in the 1971 environmental commercial), and also agrees to wear a rubber nose that makes him look Indian enough for the movies. 48Portland is trapped within the story that the dominant society tells about Indians, and in spite of all of his travel, he cannot escape this story. Thus, travel is not necessarily liberatory; for Portland, travel reinforces hi s rootlessness, providing him with countless Indian stereotypes but few models of real tribal identity. As Stephen L. Pevar notes in the legal handbook to U.S. Indian law, The Rights of Indians and Tribes , There is no single definition of the term Indian. Determining who is an Indian can be difficult, even controversial.... Each government\u2014tribal, state, and federal\u2014determines who is an Indian for purposes of that government's laws and programs. This can result in someone being an Indian under tribal law but not under federal law, under federal but not tribal law, under tribal but not state law, and so forth. (18) As there are in the United States over 560 federally recognized Indian nations, 8 it is difficult to generalize about trib al definitions of membership; most tend to include either a required minimum blood quantum (that is, perc entage of Indian \"blood\" or parentage, such as or 1/16th) or proof of lineal descent fr om an ancestor registered on tribal rolls; some recognize only matrilineal or patrilineal descent. Membership requirements may also include additional factors such as community recognition, residency on tribal lands, or expression of cultural belongi ng. Even United States federal 8 Of these, Pevar notes, 226 are located in Alaska, th e rest are distributed across 34 other states. Native Hawaiians are not included in this tally, as they have, under U.S. laws, a legal status that is distinct from that of continental Native Americans and Alaska Natives. 49law, however, does not work from a single defi nition of \"Indian\"; th at definition varies from program to program, as Pevar points out: [The U.S.] Congress has created many programs for Indians, using varying definitions of the word Indian ; for some programs, anyone of Indian descent is eligible...; for othe r programs, the applicant must have a minimum blood quantum...; and still other programs allow all members of federally recognized Indian tribes to qualify, regardless of how these tribes have defined the term. (18) Canadian law, like U.S. law, also offers different definitions of Aboriginal or First Nations people; as demographer Andrew J. Siggner notes, There are many different ways of defining the Aboriginal population, which can result in different estimates of its size. There is no single or \"correct\" definition of the Aborigin al population, and the choice of a definition depends on the purpose for which it is to be used. (20) The Canadian Census in 2001 listed four possibl e official categories: \"Aboriginal Origin\" (having at least one Aboriginal ancestor; th is group, with 1,319,890 respondents, is by far the largest); \"Aboriginal Identity\" (\"identifying with at leas t one Aboriginal group,\" that is, American Indian, Inuit, or M\u00e9tis ; 976,305 respondents); \"R egistered Indian\" (registered as an Indian with the Canadian government under the Indian Act; 558,175 respondents); and \"First Nation/Band Member\" (registered as a a tribal nation or band; 554,860 respondents) (Siggner 20-21). In a 1986 essay, Roger Gibbins and J. Rick Ponting offer another set of categories: Status Indians are the same as the 50census's \"Registered Indian,\" while non-status Indians are Indians who \"have lost their registered status by marriage to a nonIndian or by a process...known as enfranchisement\" (18), or are the children of such non-status Indians. Some one like King, whose ancestry is U.S. Indian, would not even be considered \"a non-Status Indian\" under Gibbins and Ponting's criteria, though he would qualify as having \"Aboriginal Identity\" according to Canadian Census forms.9 In his pseudonymously authored detective novel DreadfulWater Shows Up, King suggests that there are more possibilities fo r Indian identity than \"traditional\" and \"modern\"; again, he demonstrates that it is po ssible to be connected to tribal culture even when far away from one's tribal ground. When the protagonist, detective Thumps DreadfulWater, a Cherokee man who once lived in California but has moved to Canada, comes across a medicine bag, he is uncertain what exactly it is, but because he respects the power of tribal beliefs, he is unwilling to \"fool around\" with a potentially sacred object. Thumps takes the medicine bag to Mo ses Blood, \"one of the more traditional men on the reserve\" (205). As they flip through the channels on Moses's big-screen satellite television, Moses explains that the bag is not a medicine pouch. Thumps realizes he has made off with someone's offering, and Moses opens it to find a bundle of tobacco (which is a traditional offering) and four golden filter tips (which are not). The novel critiques Indian stereotypes in popular culture and media; for example, when DreadfulWater is 9 There are separate categories for the M\u00e9tis populatio n, a mixed-race group originally descended from Indian women's relationships with Fren ch fur traders, and for the Inuit population, who are also treated as a separate group (much like Alaska Natives are in the United States). 51trying to track a suspect, the supposed skill of Indians at tracking is heavy on his mind as he stumbles through the woods: The clich\u00e9 of an Indian gliding throu gh a forest, alive to the vagaries of turned stone, broken branches, and scents on the wind, only happened in movies... The more Thumps thought a bout what he was doing, the more he realized how crazy this expediti on was... Wilderness might not be as wild as it once was, but it could still kill you if you took it for granted. (87) However, in spite of the skepticism Ki ng displays toward any supposed \"innate\" connection of Indigenous people to nature, he is also very aware of the importance and necessity of land to Native communities. What [is] not readily apparent at fi rst glance...[is] the intimate relationship that Native people had with the land. And here I am not talking about the romantic and spiritual clich\u00e9s th at have become so popular with advertisers, land developers, and well-meaning people with backpacks. While the relationship that Native people have to the land certainly has a spiritual aspect to it, it is also a prac tical matter than balances respect with survival. It is an ethic that can be seen in the decisions and actions of a community and that is contained in...the stories that they tell about the nature of the world and their place in it, about the webs of responsibilities that bind all things. Or, as the Moha wk writer Beth Brant put it, \"We do not worship nature. We are part of it.\" (113-114) 52 In addition to critiqui ng cultural stereotypes, DreadfulWater takes on economic systems and issues of tribal political rights. The murder that sets the novel's action in motion takes place just prior to the opening of a tribal casino, and much of the novel deals with tribal economic sovereignty. King's tribal activist charac ters, some of whom oppose the casino, see tradition and modernity neither as opposites nor even necessarily as separate. The traditionalist characters in King's novel make sacred offerings along ancient paths in the forest and also devel op computer viruses. Moses Blood explains the finer points of computer systems and databa se searching to Thumps DreadfulWater, which leads to the mystery's solution. Instead of an individual crimin al, the three murders suggest a more complex systemic problem, indicting multinational corporate profiteering and suggesting that the government's interests lie with corporat e entities rather than with tribal ones. Both the Canadian and the U.S. governme nts share an interest in decreasing the number of recognized Indians, as the U.S. a nd Canada must fulfill treaty obligations to \"registered\" or \"federa lly recognized\" Indians indi viduals and tribes; these responsibilities include health care, some educational programs, and a range of other duties (which, again, vary from tribe to tr ibe). Fulfilling these obligations costs money, and, as a result, many government officials ha ve acted to limit the number of recognized Indians. There are notable exceptions to this rule, times when the central governments have acted to preserve Native sovereignty and culture, but as Pevar points out, in general, official policies have acted as governmental extensions of the expectation that Indians would vanish. 53In his seminal essay \"Identity in Mashp ee\" (1988), anthropologist James Clifford shows the degree to which governmental rec ognition of Indian tribes is bound up in stereotypes. The essay chronicles the many stories and histories that were compressed into a 1977 trial in Boston Federal Court in which the Mashpee Wampanoag sued for federal recognition as a tribe. The Mashpee we re attempting to reclaim land in the town of Mashpee, \"Cape Cod's Indian Town\" (277) , and in order to sue for the land under the relevant statute, the tribe had to gain fe deral legal recognition as a tribe. Clifford describes the trial in his introduction to The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art : \"Modern Indians, who spoke in New England- accented English about the Great Spirit, had to convince a white Boston jury of their authenticity\" (8). At the begi nning of \"Identity in Mashpee,\" Clifford points to the power of the Vanishing Indian ideology: Indians had long filled a pathetic im aginative space for the dominant culture... Their cultures had been st eadily eroding, at best hanging on in museumlike reservations. Native Am erican societies could not by defnition [sic] be dynamic, inventive, or expansive. Indians were lovingly remembered in Edward Curtis' sepi a photographs as proud, beautiful, and \"vanishing.\" But Curtis...carried pr ops, costumes, and wigs...The image he recorded was carefully staged. Co uld [an all-white jury] be made to believe in the persistent \"Indian\" ex istence of the Mashpee plaintiffs without costumes and props? (284) 54The definitional issue at hand was twofold: whether the Mashpee were Indians, and whether they were a tribe; finally, the jury had to decide whether they had been a tribe continuously since 1790. The question of whether they were in fact a tribe was at issue because the defense held that the Indian to wn of Mashpee, whose existence had been documented since at least the 17th century, was comprised of Indians from various other tribes in the area and thus did not comprise a tribe in and of itself. However, as Clifford notes, \"Aboriginally, the concep t of tribe has little meaning. Cape Cod Indian groupings seem to have been flexible, with significant movement across territories. Communities formed and reformed\" (302). The notion of tr ibal purity is not an Indigenous concept, though it was a key issue in the Mashpee trial. Indigenous tribes have often incorporated \"outside\" influences into thei r tribal knowledge or traditions without giving up their tribal identities. The other major question in the trial, wh ether the Mashpee were Indian or not, was equally vexed. Racial purity, like tribal pu rity, is not an Indigenous concept, and like many Eastern Indians, the Mashpee have a long history of intermarriage with other communities, particularly with African Americ ans. Outsiders who married into the tribe, and their children, were recognized as Mas hpee Indians by the trib e, regardless of how non-Mashpee saw these people. Here again the question of authenticity arises, as the federal government attempted to determin e who was \"authentica lly\" Mashpee and who was not. The efforts by those outside the tribe to determine Mashpee authenticity has not only led to problems with federal recogniti on, but occasionally with recognition by other 55Indian people. In a now-infamous 2002 essay entitled \"These Are Not Indians\" which was published in American Indian Quarterly , Oglala Lakota writer Delphine Red Shirt argues that New England Indians are not really Indians because they do not look Indian: I am an Indian. I grew up Indian, lo ok Indian, even speak Indian. So it offends me to come east and to see how \"Indian\" is defined in [Connecticut]. What offends me? That on the outside (where it counts in America's racially conscious societ y), Indians in Connecticut do not appear Indian. In fact, the Indians in Connecticut look more like they come from European or African stoc k. When I see them, whether they are Pequot, Mohegan, Paugussett, Paucatuck, or Schaghticoke, I want to say, \"These are not Indians.\" (643) Many Native commentators rushed to defend the New England tribes and point out the many problems inherent in such a purely phenotypic definition of \"Indian,\" albeit one that Red Shirt suggested was ultimately rooted in blood quantum. The editors of Indian Country Today described Red Shirt's commentar y as \"profound... myopia,\" and noted that \"Indian commentators, from Navajo Nation to Oklahoma and Washington, have denounced Ms. Red Shirt's approach\" (\"M yopic Commentary: Bigoted Assertions Belong in the Past\"). 10 Nevertheless, her commentary shows the profound power of the colonial concepts of race and racial pur ity, a power to which Native people are not immune, and which certainly affected the 1977 trial for Mashpee recognition. Clifford 10 The editorial went on to add that \"a more proper question might be: who ultimately will have the right to define our grandchildren, whether they will belong to us or not, regardless of 'race?'\" 56notes that the Mashpee \"were not helped by the fact that fe w of them looked strongly 'Indian'\" (285). In th e end, the case was decided agains t the Mashpee because the jury held that the Mashpee community of Indians had not been a tribe continuously since 1790, although it recognized, somewhat paradoxically, that they had been a tribe at least at certain points in the 19th century.11 Acknowledging that \"looking Indian\" or having a certain quantum of \"Indian blood\" does not necessarily coincide with cult ural belonging, several recognized tribes in the U.S.12 have opted not to require a particular blood quantum for tribal membership, including the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.13 In order to enroll as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, individuals must be able to trace their lineage to one of the Cherokee men and women listed on the Da wes (Allotment) Act rolls, which were taken between 1899 and 1906 and which list \"Citizens and Freedmen residing in Indian Territory (now NE Oklahoma)\" (Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Regi stration Page). As long as they can prove thei r relationship to a single Oklahoma Cherokee ancestor on these rolls, descendants are entitled to citi zenship. This policy has made the Cherokee the butt of jokes in Indian count ry (one common joke asks, \"What do you get when you have eight (or sixteen) Cherokee in a room? -One full-blood\"), but it has also made the 11 The Mashpee continued to pursue federal recognition through the Bureau of Indian Affairs rather than through a trial court; they were granted recognition by the BIA on March 31, 2006. 12 These tribes generally have been recognized by the government in treaties prior to 1871, when a congressional resolution ended Indian treaty-making. Tribes like the Mashpee, which did not have treaty recognition and/or which ended their tribal status under the 1950s Termination legislation, have had to fight for decades for tribal recognition, in some cases unsuccessfully as yet. 13 The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma is the largest of the three federally recognized Cherokee nations. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina and the United Keetoowah Band of Oklahoma are smaller Cherokee nations. The Eastern Band requires 1/16 th Cherokee blood as well as lineal descent from a tribal member listed on the 1924 Baker rolls; the Un ited Keetoowah requires 1/4 degree Keetoowah or \"Old Settler\" blood for membership, \"Old Settlers\" be ing Cherokee who removed to Arkansas under treaty agreements in 1817 and 1819. 57Cherokee Nation one of the la rgest and most politically powerful tribes, with 240,000 registered tribal members.14 More importantly, this policy ensures not only the continued legal existence of the Cherokee, but allows th e tribe to grow in numbers at a time when many tribes find their numbers steadily decr easing. Stephen L. Pevar notes that the \"increase in mixed marriages has caused many tribes to reduce the tribe's blood quantum [requirement] for membership\" (94); as Cher okee scholar Daniel He ath Justice notes in Our Fire Survives the Storm: A Cherokee Literary History , \"Degree of blood quantum...shouldn't be read as a measure of commitment to Cherokee nationhood or identification as Cherokee\" (6), someth ing the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma membership policy recognizes implicitly, but which federal policies generally do not. As King points out in his essay \"You're Not The Indian I Had In Mind\" from The Truth About Stories (2003) stereotypical ideas about I ndianness and authenticity still play a significant role in the live s of Indigenous people today: [M]any Native people now live in cities, with only tenuous ties to a reserve or a nation. Many no longer speak their Native language, a gift of colonialism, and the question of identity has become as much a personal matter as it is a matter of blood... [L]anguage and narrow definitions of culture are not the only ways identity can be constructed. Yet, in the absence of visual confirmation, these \"touchstones\"\u2014race, culture, language, blood\u2014still form a kind of au thenticity test, a racial-reality 14 This policy is, of course, not without its own problems, particul arly because a number of anti- assimilationist Cherokee refused to sign up for land under the Dawes Act regulations (an act designed to break up tribal land bases and make Indians individual owners of land parcels rather than holding tribal land in common) and therefore do not appear on th e rolls, thereby, in many cases, eliminating the possibility of Cherokee citizenship for their descendants. 58game that contemporary Native people are forced to play. And here are some of the questions. Were you born on a reserve? Small, rural towns with high Native populations will do. Cities will not. Do you speak your Native language ? Not a few phrases here and there. Fluency is the key. No fluency, no Indian. Do you participate in your trib e's ceremonies? Being a singer or a dancer is a plus, but not absolutely required. Are you a full-blood? Are you a status Indian? 15 Are you enrolled? (55-56) King's answer to these questions would in all cases be \"no,\" and throughout his 2003 book of essays The Truth About Stories , he tells personal anecdotes about his life and heritage and insists that \"Native\" be define d on his terms rather than someone else's. Thomas King's characters negotiate with al l of the complexities of Indian identity; some, like Portland Looking Bear, can see the problems with governmental determinations and stereotypical representa tions, but when they are away from the reserve lack the groundedne ss of tribal experience that w ould allow them to counter these stereotypes. Others, li ke Alberta, are confident in th eir identity both within and away from their tribal community. Unlike Eli, Albert a does not decide to re turn to the reserve; 15 A \"status Indian\" is one who is officially enrolled in a tribal nation that has a treaty relationship with the Canadian government, a variation on the U.S. question \"are you enrolled?\" 59her connections to her family and tribe are clear, and do not require constant geographic proximity. And then there are the tric ksters, who narrate some of Green Grass, Running Water . They are Indian, although they can appe ar non-Indian to some observers; their gender varies from scene to scene; they seem to be moving back and forth in time; they are in constant motion. Although there are seve ral attempts throughout the course of the novel to confine them, they stay only when th ey wish to stay, and escape when they need to. They are voluntary inmates at an asylum, from which they have a record of disappearing: [Dr. John Eliot said,] \"It's just one of those mysteries, Joe.\"... So the Indians were gone again. Dr. [Joe] Hovaugh watched John gesturing and smiling. He envied the man his easy manner in the face of disaster. Eliot paused at the door. \"Wha t I can't understand is how they escape. And where do they go? Have you every thought about that, Joe? And why, in God's name, would they want to leave?\" (48) The tricksters' purpose is to turn the world on its head, to destabilize fixed notions of the world, what Gerald Vizenor might refer to as \"terminal creeds.\" Their identities are fluid, allowing them to escape and challenge dominan t expectations of I ndians and Indianness. For these tribal storytellers, movement and flexibility is key to their Indigenous identity as well as to their power as storytellers. Mobility and movement are essential to their power. 60\"More to a Story Than Just The Words\": Place, Migration, and the Trail of Tears In any discussion of Indigenous migration a nd mobility, the issue of forced migration looms large, nowhere more so than with the Cherokee. The splintering of the Cherokee nation into several different bodies originat es in the Cherokees' forced removal from their territory in Georgia in 1838. This remova l, known as the Trail of Tears, is perhaps the most well-known episode in North Ameri can Indian history. A small, pro-removal faction of the Cherokee, who were not re presentatives of the Cherokee government, signed a treaty with the U.S. government at New Echota in 1835; in spite of massive Cherokee protests to Congress as well as th e fact that the trea ty signatories had no standing to speak for the Cherokee nation, Congre ss ratified the treaty by a margin of one vote. In 1838 the U.S. government sent federal troops to enforce the New Echota treaty's terms, namely the removal of all Cherokees from the East to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Some few Cherokees managed to evade the troops, and their descendants now form the Eastern Band of Cherokee, loca ted in North Carolina. Additionally, about 5,000 Cherokee citizens moved to Oklahoma prior to 1838. The majority of the Cherokees, however, were forcibly removed fr om their homes in 1838 to walk what is now called the Trail of Tears; most estimat es suggest that about 4,000 people\u2014a quarter of the Cherokees on the Trail of Tears \u2014perished, though demographer Russell Thornton, in his 1984 article \"Cherokee Population Lo sses During the Trail of Tears: A New Perspective and a New Estimate,\" argues that th e number may in fact be twice as high. 61 Migration and movement are common and accepted elements in Indigenous cultures, as tribal stories, including those of the Cherokee, suggest, but forcible removal is a very different creature. Even the pro-re moval faction of the Cherokee recognized that leaving the tribal homelands would be extrao rdinarily difficult, and most who spoke in favor of moving to Oklahoma did so only b ecause they believed such a move to be inevitable: better that the Cherokee move on thei r own rather than be forced to do so at gunpoint. Elias Boudinot, editor of the Cherokee Phoenix and one of the signatories of the Treaty of New Echota, explaine d his views in an 1837 publication: \"What is to be done?\" was a natural enquiry, after we found that all our efforts to obtain redress from the General Government [of the United States], on the land of our fathers , had been of no avail. The first rupture among ourselves was the moment we presumed to answer that question. To a portion of the Cherokee people it early became evident that the interest of their countrymen, and the happiness of their posterity, depended upon an entire change of policy. Inst ead of contending uselessly, against superior power, the only course left was, to yield to circumstances over which they had no control. (4; emphasis in original) Boudinot invokes and emphasizes \" the land of our fathers \" yet suggests that what is even more important is \"the happiness of [our] posterity\"; in Boudinot's view, the only way for the Cherokee nation to preserve its future is to give up the la nd of its ancestors. Boudinot's primary opponent, John Ross, pr incipal chief of the Cherokee nation, rarely emphasized the traditional importance of the land in published statements, nor did 62he focus on the potential trauma of such a move for the Cherokee people. Instead, Ross's published statements tended to use the disc ourse of rights and justice, emphasizing both the illegality of United States actions as well as the \"civilized\" state of the Cherokees.16 Ross's choice of the discourse of law is a contextual one: the audience for most of his statements was U.S. officials who were not generally sympathetic to the Cherokees, although they were nonetheless supposed to en force the laws of the United States\u2014laws which, in this case, were on the side of the Cherokees resisting removal.17 Thus, rather than explaining the damaging impact that fo rced removal would have on the Cherokees, Ross focused on the legal and moral aspects of the case. Similarly, the absence of Indigenous traditions in his statements should not be take n to mean that Ross viewed them as unimportant. Instead, he did not see th em as an effective means of appealing to his intended audience. One of the few mentions he did make of the ancestral importance of the land was in a speech made in 1834 (published in 1985) to a Seneca delegation, whom he addressed as \"Brothers\": [T]his charming country was once ours; and over these fields and through these forests our beloved Fathers once, in careless gaiety, pursued their sports and hunted their game...And amidst of all this innocence, simplicity and bliss -- the whiteman came; and lo! the animated chase, the 16 John Ross's written statements on the issue of Removal were published by Ross in 1835 under the title Memorial of John Ross and Others: On Behalf of the Cherokee Nation of Indians ...; Boudinot's 1837 publication is in response to Ross's Memorial . Ross's publication consists primarily of letters exchanged with the Secretary of War (Indian Affairs was under the Department of War's purview at the time) and other U.S. officials, which emphasize the legal aspects of the debate. 17 In two 1832 cases on the legality of forcible removal, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia and Wooster v. Georgia , the Supreme Court of the United States under Chie f Justice John Marshall ruled that the state of Georgia had no right to expel the Cherokee, and that the removal laws were unconstitutional. However, both the State of Georgia and President Andrew Jackson ignored this ruling; Jackson is supposed to have commented, \"John Marshall has made his decision. Let him enforce it now if he can.\" 63feast, the dance, the song of fearle ss, thoughtless joy were over. And ever since, we have been made to drink of the bitter cup of humiliation; treated like dogs; our lives, our liberties, the sport of the whiteman; our country and the graves of our Fathers torn from us, in cruel succession: until driven from river to river, from forest to forest...we find ourselves fugitives, vagrants and strange rs in our own country... (285) Ross was well aware of the cruelty of remova l, and maintaining th e connection of his people to their ancestral land was one of the major concerns of his chieftaincy. In spite of the protests of the Cheroke e government and the vast majority of Cherokees, the U.S. government considered the Treaty of New Echota to be binding and in 1838 forcibly removed the Cherokees west ward to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). This move is a central trauma in Cherokee history, as Cherokee literary scholar Jace Weaver points out: The Cherokee can never forget the Trail of Tears\u2014not because of some genetic determinism but because its impor tance to heritage and identity are passed down through story from generation to generation. (7) The Trail of Tears figures important ly, though subtly, in King's 1999 novel Truth and Bright Water. The novel is set in two towns on either side of the 49 th parallel\u2014Truth, a \"railroad town,\" lies on the U.S. side, while Bright Water, \"the reserve,\" is in Canada (1). The novel tells the story of tw o cousins, the narrator Tecumseh and his cousin Lum, living in Truth and in Bright Water, over the course of a summer. An enigmatic young Cherokee girl named Rebecca Neugin, whose fa mily is traveling from Georgia to 64Oklahoma, befriends the narrator Tecumseh and his family. The family's presence in Canada\u2014which is certainly not on the wa y between Georgia and Oklahoma\u2014raises questions for the reader, questi ons that might lead the read er to understand that this family's journey has something to do with the Trail of Tears. As Daniel Heath Justice points out, Rebecca's \"name is that of [an act ual] Cherokee survivor of the Trail of Tears...[who] stands as the representati ve survivor of Removal\" (218): King repeatedly draws on Cherok ee history to inform the novel's emotional landscape; although Tecums eh doesn't understand the true nature of [Rebecca's] oddness, her arriva l heralds a meaningful shift in the narrative toward the storied burdens of history. (220) Rebecca represents the Cherokee survivors of the Trail of Tears, and she is a somber presence in the book, searching for her lost duck\u2014a duck who echoes both a story told by a Trail of Tears survivor who walked to Oklahoma with her goose, and also the duck in the Cherokee creation story who creates the world. Rebecca is the storyteller, the one w ho carries the sorrow of the Trail in her heart... That she's a spirit is ma de clear by her association with the skull [that Lum and Tecumseh find] (s he wears the same red ribbon in her hair that is threaded through the ey e sockets)... She's a spirit of the Cherokee past who walks in the present. (223-224) The skull, a recurrent image th roughout the book, is that of an Indian child which one of the novel's protagonists, Monroe Swimmer, ha s taken from a museum in order to rebury it. Its exact provenance is unclear, but when Tecumseh's shows it to his grandmother, she 65tells him is of a girl who \"had a short life...a nd died hard,\" and who is \"a long ways from home.\" As a survivor, Justice notes, Re becca stands for the Cherokee \"who weren't destroyed by the events of the Trail of Tears\"; the skull reminds readers of those who were. Because she is a survivor, Rebecca is, in spite of her ghostly presence, a hopeful figure. At the Indian Days festival, Rebecca en ters the lodge of Tecumseh's grandmother, which she is sharing with Teresa and Lucille Rain, and they invite Rebecca in for a bowl of stew. My grandmother takes her plate and fills it again. \"Now the rules are,\" says Lucille, \"if you're a guest, we have to feed you, and you have to tell us all about the Cherokee.\" Rebecca tries to smile but she l ooks like she's going to cry, too. (219) Instead of telling the story of Removal\u2014which readers may expect since Rebecca looks as if she will cry\u2014Rebecca tells a creation st ory. Her voice becomes stronger as she does so, showing that, as Justice says, \"hope inhabits young Rebecca to the core as much as grief and loss\" (224). Moreover, upon their urgi ng, she tells the story in Cherokee, even though her listeners are not Cherokee and do not speak the language. \"Do you speak your language?\" says Teresa. \"Yes, ma'am,\" says Rebecca. \"Good,\" says Lucille. \"Then you can tell your story in Cherokee.\" \"You guys don't speak Cherokee,\" I say. 66\"More to a story than just the words,\" says my grandmother. ... \"Gha! Sge!\" says Rebecca, and now her voice sounds better, too. \"Hila hiyuhi u':sgwanighsdi ge:sv:'i...\" \"Ah,\" I hear my grandmother sa y. \"A creation story. Those ones are my favourite.\" (219-220) Rebecca's story is rooted in tribal partic ularities, including the Cherokee language, and yet Tecumseh's Indian (but non-Cherokee) grandmother can understand it. Tecumseh himself cannot yet understand it, though he says it \"sounds pretty nice\" (220). Tecumseh's grandmother is aware of the shar ed histories and stories that connect her people and the Cherokee and which allow her to hear the story as \"more...than just the words.\" She understands the systems of thought and the systems of oppression that mark Rebecca's experience, and she sees the para llels not only between her past and the burdens of Rebecca's history but also betw een Rebecca's creation story and her own. In Muting White Noise: Native Amer ican and European American Novel Traditions (2006), James Cox writes, Sacred stories define the basic structures and values of a community, and when two communities or nations come into conflict, so do their storytelling traditions. In a colonial context, an invader's storytelling traditions are the foundation of \"the law, order, and good government\" that dominates Native people, while Native storytelling traditions are the foundation of a social equality, balance, harmony, and co-operation that resist domination. (62) 67The telling of stories, and of creation stories in particular, is centra l aspect of much of King's work. In The Truth About Stories (2003), King argues that Native creation stories portray \"the world...at peace, and the pivotal concern is not with the ascendancy of good over evil but with the issue of balance\" (24). As Rebecca tells the Cherokee creation story, she not only offers hope while honoring past losses but also begins to weave a pantribal community into being, a community that can heal while remembering the past. Through her, Tecumseh begins to understand the histor ies of oppression and hi stories of resistance of which he is a part, and thus begins to see that there is far more to a story than just words. Stories are powerful means of making contact between Indigenous nations and peoples, according to Daniel Heath Justice: Distance is arbitrary; geography is less binding than its perception. The Indian Nations continue. Through the Cherokees\u2014living and dead\u2014who populate Truth & Bright Water , King breaks down the illusory boundaries between nations, between times, and between the ancestors and their descendants\u2014without...ignoring the contex tualized particularities of each. (226) Without downplaying the tragedy of the Tra il of Tears and, through the unnamed bones that Monroe Swimmer has collected, the suffering of other Native peoples, King's story suggests both the immense losses suffered by Indigenous communities and the rebirth of those communities. The losses continue on into the present, as Lum, who is fascinated with death, runs off the half-finished bri dge into oblivion. Rebirth, however, is also 68constant: though he mourns his friend, the novel's narrator Tecumseh survives his friend's death and begins to understand the stories he has been told as a means of continuing with life without denying Lum's suffering or his death. The young narrator's name, Tecumseh, which is mentioned only once in the story, also suggests that, beyond merely survivi ng, he has the potentia l to link Indigenous people together. The historical Tecumseh, a Shawnee political and military leader (his father was Shawnee, his mother Creek), was an early advocate of intertribal alliance and unity. In 1811 he visited many tribes in the southern United States to raise support for a multitribal Indian confederacy that could politically and militarily resist further incursions of Euroamerican settlers into Indian land. Cherokee historian Robert J. Conley notes that the Cherokee nation was among thos e Tecumseh hoped would join him; the conservatives among the Cherokee pushed for the alliance, but the faction known as the progressives favored a more conciliatory stan ce toward the U.S. government and white settlers (89-90). 18 The progressives won the argument, and the Cherokee did not join Tecumseh's confederacy, which went to war against the U.S. in 1812. Though his alliance did not long outlast him\u2014Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in Ontario, Canada, in 1813\u2014he is remembered as an early advocate of pantribalism. The character Tecumseh's name thus represents the pantribal approach that King often takes in his fiction, a pantribalism that exists side by side with tribal specificity. 18 The progressive faction, led by Major John Ridge, was also the faction which, in the 1820s and 1830s, argued in favor of Cherokee removal. Tecumseh's visit occasioned similar disagreements among the Cherokee's neighbors, the Creeks, and led to the Creek civil war, also known as the Red Stick War; the Cherokee progressives' intervention in that war led to the progressives' victory over the conservative Red Sticks. 69In an interview with Jeffrey Cant on conducted while King was working on Truth and Bright Water , Canton remarked, \"You're a Canadian citizen and define yourself as a Canadian writer, but your most recent fiction seems to be pan-Indian in its scope\" (3). King replied, Consciously so, too. ... There are issues\u2014not universal\u2014that are important to look at. Authenticity is one, for me. Identity...is one. And the issue of borders. I hold Canadian citizenship and think of myself as a Canadian writer...At the same time, I hold U.S. citizenship, too. I can flop back and forth across the border like a big fish. The novel that I'm working on now is set on the border....It should be interesting to see how I play that one out, and how I make it work. (4) Aside from being set on the U.S.-Canadian border, Truth and Bright Water also offers many characters who have physically left thei r communities, but who are still present in the life of the community through told st ories and gossip. These include Tecumseh's grandfather, \"who had gone to Italy for a war and had come home with a taste for operas and musicals\" (16); Tecumseh's aunt Cassie, who, Tecumseh explains, \"has travelled all over the world, and whenever she gets to a new place, she sends us a postcard. We have postcards from places like New Zealand a nd Mexico, France and Japan\" (117); and Monroe Swimmer, a \"famous Indian artist\" who has spent the last y ears living in Toronto and exhibiting \"everywhere. Paris, Berli n, New York, London, Moscow, Madrid, Rome\" (129). These characters have spent much of th eir lives away from Truth and Bright Water, 70but are still considered a part of the comm unity; their mobility does not mean alienation from their Indian identity. Monroe Swimmer demonstrates that mob ility can be not only a part of an individual's Indigenous identi ty, but also a benefit for the home community. Though he has gained renown as a painter, Monroe tells Tecumseh that pain ting is not his true talent: \"But you're not a painter?\" \"Oh, I did that for a while.\" Monr oe goes to a wall and straightens a small painting. \"Made a bunch of money. Problem was, I was lousy. Stinko. Reactionary. Predictable.\" Monroe is on the move again, and I figure it'll be safer if I stop asking questions and just let him talk. \"What I was really good at was restoration.\" (129) Monroe's form of restoration involves restori ng (or, as his detractors suggest when they have him fired, adding) Indian figures to early American landscape paintings; in his travels he has surreptitiously recovered the bones of Indian children from museum storehouses in order to bury them properly. Upon his return to Truth and Bright Water, he makes a church disappear from the actual, physical landscape, dismantles the U.S.- Canadian border, and returns the buffalo to the prairies by means of his art. He is also in constant motion, as in the scene above; Tecumseh, who helps Monroe with his various projects, often cannot find him because he is always in a different place on the prairie. Moreover, Monroe is painting the old church in which he is living in such a way that it disappears, adding to the diffi culty of finding him even when he is at home. While 71Monroe suggests that, when he was younger, he was \"always running away\" (194), it is clear that by the time the book's events take place, he is not running away from anything, but instead is constantly in motion becau se he is constantly creating. Thus, in Truth and Bright Water, motion is figured as a creative force, a central element in the creation of an Indigenous world. Mobility, Motion, and Home Home is an important place in King's work, and yet there is no single, central home space which he creates. Instead, home is wherever Indians are. King, whose Cherokee ancestors came from what is now the southeastern Unit ed States and who gr ew up in California, has adopted Canada as his home; similarly, his ch aracters show an abili ty to feel at home in a range of places. Rather than envisioning the world as a series of contrasts between home and alienation, King envisions a world in which Indigenous people, in spite of tribal differences, can be at home with ot her Indigenous people, people who share their world view, whose specific stories may differ but whose perspectives and experiences are parallel. What Thomas King's biography and works reveal is the mobility and resilience of Indigenous people and communities, and the connections that remain strong even as community members move away and perhaps join other communities. Indians who move away do not vanish, nor does absence from th eir original community connote a loss of 72authenticity. Scholars must continue to recogn ize the central importance of land to Native American cultures while moving toward an understanding of Indigenous cultures that acknowledges their simultaneous mobility. What King's biography and his cross-genre works suggest, Indigenous trad itions and stories bear out: rootedness and migration can and do coexist, and even in the face of tr aumatic removal, motion can be a force for creation. 73CHAPTER TWO \"We are internationalists!\": Rootedness, Migration, and I ndigenous Internationalism in Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead A journey to Paguate from Laguna...retr aces the original journey from the Emergence Place...The eight miles, mark ed with boulders, mesas, springs, and river crossings, are actually a ritu al circuit, or path, that marks the interior journey the Laguna people made: a journey of awareness and imagination in which they emerged from being within the earth and all- included in the earth to be the culture and people they became, differentiating themselves for the fi rst time from all that had surrounded them, always aware that interior di stances cannot be reckoned in physical miles or calendar years. Leslie Marmon Silko 1 In the front matter of Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead readers discover a map of the Americas with several boxes that contain keys not fo r interpreting the map, but for understanding the book. The boxe d text includes the following: When Europeans arrived, the Maya, Azteca, Inca cultures had already built great cities and vast networks of roads. Ancient prophecies foretold the arrival of the Europe ans in the Americas. The ancient prophecies also foretell the disappearance of all things European. (14) In this text, the European presence in the Americas, though destructive, is not permanent. What Silko is suggesting with \"the disappearance of all things European\" is not that people and things with European roots will di sappear but instead that their Europeanness 1 \"Interior and Exterior Landscapes: The Pueblo Migration Stories\" 36-37. 74will cease to exist. The Indigenous nature of the Americas is powerful enough to absorb new technologies and new people without losi ng any of its Indigenousness. America is not hybrid; it is, will be, a nd always has been Indigenous. Almanac of the Dead describes an Indigeneity that can be both locally gr ounded in the land and in ternational at once. The characters in Almanac of the Dead reflect the importance of movement: everyone is in motion, and even the map at the book's beginning seems composed as much of vectors as of fixed locations\u2014the connections between places as important as the places themselves. The map's locations ar e connected with lines tracing the journeys of characters or materials, with labels lik e \"Sterling accidentally goes to Tucson\" or \"cocaine to finance arms\" (14-15). Tucson, the locale of much of the book's action, is at the center, but the map extends as far as Hait i (marked as \"The Firs t Black Indians\") and Cuba; Alaska is indicated as well. These connections establish the book's intertribal, international orientation, and th e examples of Haiti and Cuba in particular detail both the possibilities and problems Indigenous peoples fa ce in an international struggle. The map is not made to geographic scale; instead, the distances correspond to an interior scale\u2014a \"journey of awareness and imagination\" ( 37) much like the migration story Silko describes in her essay \"Interio r and Exterior Landscapes: The Pueblo Migration Stories\" (1996) and which is quoted at th e beginning of this chapter. The map also suggests the importance of travel and mobility in this novel. Anishinaabe author Gerald Vizenor consider s maps an important element of Indigenous stories: \"Maps are pictures, and some native pictures are stories, visual memories, the source of directions, and a virtual sense of presence\" ( Fugitive Poses 170). The 75Indigenous communities Silko describes here are firmly rooted in place, connected to the land and their ancestors. This rootedness exists alongside the mobility of Indigenous individuals who are fighting for their communities' survival. Those people who physically move away from their community\u2014whether by choice, coercion, or some combination of the two\u2014are still members of the community; physical absence does not translate into isolation, and is in fact sometim es necessary to ensure the survival of the rooted community. Almanac 's contemporary setting emphasizes the continuity of Native people in the Americas at the same time that the stor y addresses their dispossession and oppression. Issues associated with gl obalization, militarization, or drug and gun smuggling surface here, and the novel's harsh crit ique of international corpor ations draws consciously on Marx. In this context, Silko's novel does not represent a departure from, much less a disavowal of, Indigenous tradit ions. Instead, it invokes ancient traditions and shows their flexibility and continuing power in this globalized world of multinational capitalism. The Indigenous armies use computers, high- tech weaponry, computer networks, and television to aid in bringing about the ancient prophecies. These tools and technologies become part of their Indigenous environment; they are assimilated, part of a continually Indigenous world. Like the almanac at the novel 's center, the America envisioned here is the combination of many cultures but still remains resolutely Indigenous. 76Almanac of the Dead The novel sprawls; at 763 pages and over fifty characters, it eschews linear structures and often flows into what appear to be tangential narratives.2 Silko has said that she \"could not think of the story of the Almanac as a single line moving from point A to point B to point C\" (\"Notes on Almanac of the Dead \" 140) and as a result, th e novel's structure is more like a spiderweb than a straight line. At the spiderweb's center is an ancient almanac of prophecies that has been ha nded down through generations of Indigenous people; from here, stories radiate outward. L echa, an old Yaqui woman, is the almanac's current keeper, a job passed to her by he r grandmother Yoeme, whose name in Yaqui means \"person,\" \"human,\" or generally \"the Yaqui language,\" and is synonymous with \"Yaqui\" as a tribal name (Shaul 181). Lecha has hired a young white woman, Seese, to help her with the almanac. Seese, meanwhile , is hoping for news a bout her abducted baby. Lecha's twin sister Zeta, living on a ranc h near Tucson, is engaged in cross-border smuggling activities. Sterling, a man recently exil ed from Laguna Pueblo, helps Zeta with the ranch work. Both sisters have connectio ns with Indigenous pe oples in Mexico, among them the Mayan Indian twins Tacho and El Feo. These male twins are leading a people's army, the Army of Justice and Redistributi on, northward toward the border; they are aided by the Indigenous Marxist Angelita La Escap\u00eda, who has procured guns and financial support from the Cuban government and others. The Army of Justice and 2 As Silko explains in her essay \"Language and Lite rature from a Pueblo Pers pective,\" such divergent narratives are an essential part of the story, and a sign of traditiona l Laguna storytelling. However, to readers unaccustomed to this storytelling style, they woul d appear peripheral and perhaps even distracting. 77Redistribution is mirrored in the U.S. by the Army of the Homeless, a group of the disenfranchised organized by Clinton, an Af rican American Vietnam veteran, and Root, a disabled white man. All of these characters, though they are at times unsympathetic to the reader, are nevertheless allied with the for ces working for the liberation of the Americas from colonial and corporate domination. Another group of characters is referred to in the novel as the Destroyers, likely an allusion to a legendary Laguna \"secret Destro yer clan, which worships destruction and death,\" to which Silko refers in her 1994 essay \"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit\" (70). The Destroyers in Almanac represent the forces of colonialism and of multinational corporate capitalis m. Generally part of govern ment, high finance, or the real estate industry (or al l three), these characters include Menardo, a Mexican businessman selling insurance to large corporations agains t any kind of disaster, whose secret shame is that his grandfather was one of \"the Indians\" (258). On the U.S. side of the border we find Max and Leah Blue, a pair of real-estate developers trying to usurp the land and water rights of Indigenous peoples in order to squander the valuable resources on desert golf courses. There are also a numbe r of gay men, most of whom pathologically link sex and death, like Beaufr ey and Serlo, two aristocrat s whose only pleasure comes from the destruction of others.3 In addition, the Destroyers include an assortment of military officers, weapons and organ dealers, and pornographers, to whom sex, death, and commerce have become inextricably intertwined. 3 Silko's lamentable use of homosexuality as a me taphor for misogynistic Western society and her connected, very problematic invocation of anti-gay stereotypes is discussed in detail in Janet St. Clair, \"Cannibal Queers: The Problematics of Metaphor in Almanac of the Dead .\" Louise K. Barnett and James L. Thorson. Leslie Marmon Silko: A Collection of Critical Essays . Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1999. 207-221. 78As the novel progresses, the forces of liberation and oppression come into increasing conflict, and an all- out battle for the future of th e Americas begins\u2014a battle the ancient almanac predicts will be won by Indigenous peoples and the disenfranchised, those who have already rejected the Eur opean ideas of capitalism and state-based nationalism in favor of Indigenous worldview s. Like the map at the beginning, the novel's scope stretches from Mexico to Alaska , Arizona to Haiti, and across more than five hundred years of history. It combin es history, legend, storytelling, almanac fragments, prophecy, Marxist political theo ry, Mayan codices, ta lk shows, novelistic discourse, and more, as it chronicles a revolutionary uprising of tribal peoples across the Americas against five hundr ed years of colonization. Almanac was published in 1991, one year before the quincentennial of Columbus's voyage to the Americas; as the five-hundred year domi nation of Europe over the Americas plays a central role in the nove l, Denise K. Cummings suggests that the publication date of Silko's novel \"[positions] it as a sort of pre-emptive strike against the anticipated excesses of the quincentenary\" (83). In 1990, Spain had blocked the proposal to establish 1992 as the United Nations' Year of Indigenous People, insisting that a focus on Indigenous concerns would detract from the planned celebrations of Columbus's voyage. Indigenous peoples had to wait a year for their official recognition, as 1993 became the UN Year of Indigenous People. Even the name of the year was a source of controversy, as the singular \"people,\" rath er than \"peoples\" (which Indigenous groups pushed for), indicates nonsovereign minority status rather than sovereignty in international law. Indigenous peoples, however, refused to acquiesce to this deferral and 79held conferences and commemorations of their own in 1992. The Nobel Prize committee also recognized the struggles of Indigenous peoples in awarding the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize to Guatemalan Indigenous activist Rigoberta Mench\u00fa. Several North American Indigenous writers commemorated the five- hundred-year anniversary of Columbus in their works, \"writing back \" against the beginnings of empire. Among the many who invoked Columbus were the novelists Gerald Vizenor (Anishinaabe), Thomas King (Cherokee), Sherman Alexie Louise Erdrich (Anishinaabe) and Michael Dorris (Modoc). 4 The stories these authors tell of Columbus and the colonization of the Americas differ radically from the Columbus hagiography generally practiced in Europe and the Americas, and ev en differ from much of the criticism of Columbus. The difference is not a mere reve rsal of Eurowestern values\u2014Columbus now figured as bad instead of good, a harbinger of death and destruction rather than a grand adventurer. Instead, the entire value system shifts, and Columbus and colonization are placed within an Indigenous framework. Th e European colonizers are foreigners and strangers, sometimes rude, often incomprehe nsible, and even, in Vizenor's and King's trickster narratives, the offspr ing of earlier Native American travelers to Europe or the products of Coyote's imagination. In these re tellings of the story of colonization, the colonizers are contained within a Native American world view where the Native is normative and the European foreign and strange. 4 Gerald Vizenor, Heirs of Columbus ; Thomas King, A Coyote Columbus Trickster Story and Green Grass, Running Water ; Sherman Alexie, Reservation Blues ; Louise Erdrich and Michael Dorris, Crown of Columbus ; 80A similar perspective is reflected in Almanac of the Dead , even though Columbus himself does not appear as a character. Silko presents Columbus's voyage and the subsequent conquest of Mexico not merely fr om an Indian perspective, but as events foretold by Indigenous prophecies and, in fact, emanating from the Americas rather than Europe. [T]he old story came back to Sterling as he walked along. The appearance of the Europeans [in America] ha d been no accident; the Gunadeeyahs [the Destroyer clan] had called for th eir white brethren to join them...No wonder Cort\u00e9s and Montezuma had hit it off together when they met; both had been members of the same secret clan. (760) In Almanac 's version of the Conquest, Europeans have been instruments, not actors.5 Thus, even colonization itself emanates fr om the power of Native people\u2014albeit from the evil Destroyer clan, those who \"caused the old-time people to flee to Pueblo country in Arizona and New Mexico, thousands of year s before\" (760). But just as the almanac foretells the Europeans' arrival, so does it predict the \"disappearance of all things European,\" as the book's front matter notes. Ev en at the very beginning of the colonial enterprise, its destruction\u2014which the novel chronicles\u2014is already assured. 5 This common theme in Silko's work is further elaborated in Ceremony , where white people are the product of a contest between evil Indigenous sorcerers, akin to the Destroyers in Almanac . \"Long time ago/in the beginning/there were no white people in this world/...This world was already complete.../Then it happened./These witch people got together./...for a contest.../in dark things./...Finally there was only one/ ... This one just told them to listen:/\"What I have is a story\"/...this witch said/... as I tell the story/it will begin to happen. /...white skin people/like the belly of a fish/covered with hair./Then they grow away from the earth.../The wind will blow them across the ocean.../They will kill the things the fear/all the animals/the people will starve. \" 132-136. 81Almanac of the Dead also refigures the colonization of the Americas in terms of the colonizers' abandonment of their homela nds. Because the connection of people with the land is primary and sacred, to leave one's land without intention of return and without honoring the place of origin is a form of be trayal\u2014one the European emigrants practiced on their own land. In an early section of Almanac , Menardo reflects on what his Indian grandfather had told him about the Europeans: He thought their stories accounting for the sun and the planets were interesting only because their storie s of explosions and flying fragments were consistent with everything else he had seen: from their flimsy attachments to one another and their children to their abandonment of the land where they had been born....their God had created them but soon was furious with them, throwing them out of their birthplace, driving them away. The ancestors had called Europeans \"the orphan people\" and had noted that...few Europeans had remained whole. They failed to recognize the Earth was their mother. (258) As Adam Sol notes in his arti cle \"The Story as It's Told: Prodigious Revisions in Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead ,\" the \"colonization of the Americas in general is seen as the 'abandonment of the land where they had been born,' rath er than the daring adventures or flights from persecution familiar to us\" (38). This \"abandonment\" is figured in the novel as a casting-out as the gods of Europe turning their backs on the people. This interpretation of the story agai n places agency somewhere other than with 82the colonizers, who in failing to recognize the ear th as their mother also fail to see that land, and connection to the land, is sacred. In spite of a number of negative review s the novel initially received in the popular press, literary scholars are on the whole posi tively disposed toward the novel. Recent scholarship tends to view Almanac as a monumental achievement and an important moment in Native American letters. The publication of Studies in American Indian Literature 's special issue on Almanac in Fall 1998, and of Louise K. Barnett and James L. Thorson's book Leslie Marmon Silko: A Co llection of Critical Essays in 1999, have rectified the relative l ack of criticism. In fact, Creek critic Craig Womack suggests in Red on Red: Native American Literary Separatism (1999) that the novel is \"one of the most important books of this century\" (252): [Silko's] argument in Almanac seems to go that either way, voluntarily or by force, the land will regain its in digenous integrity. Unfortunately, the importance of Silko's novel is so gl aringly obvious that no one can see it, and whether American consciousness is voluntarily altered by choice rather than involuntarily by disaster is a frightening question that no one wishes to face. (256) Almanac raises uncomfortable questions about la nd rights, class, and dispossession. Silko does not hesitate to point an accusatory fi nger at the European-based ideology of the Destroyers, who destroy because they do not see the sacredness of the land. Womack writes, 83One of the reasons Silko's novel was so unpopular in comparison to her earlier works was because she refused to divest ancestral memory from the responsibility that such memory implies. If one has racial memory, then one of the primary recollections has to be the fact of genocide and land theft, and the ancestors may have more in mind than quick spiritual highs; perhaps a call to action is being elicited. (233-234) Almanac connects Native traditions to the real ities of oppression\u2014a connection Womack suggests many readers are more comfortable ig noring: \"America loves Indian culture,\" he writes; \"America is much less enthusia stic about Indian land title\" (11). Almanac of the Dead is not just fiction; it can be read as a guide to global events, a work of political theory, and a hand book of the revolution. The book's engagement with contemporary political and economic real ities, its extensive de bates about Marxism, and its positing of transnationa l actions against international corporations and capital all place it well within the realm of the political as well as the fictional, a mixing of genres that Joni Adamson, in American Indian Literature, Environmental Justice, and Ecocriticism: The Middle Place , shows is characteristic of almanacs. Adamson takes Almanac of the Dead at its word and reads the text as an almanac. She points out that there is a long almanac trad ition in the Americas, and refers to the pre- Columbian Mayan almanacs as \"the most ancient 'American' literature\" (133). Almanacs have a long history of challenging those who claim the privilege and authority to represent \"reality\" from only one perspective. In early colonial America, for example, alman acs were compiled by colonial elites, 84but authors of both genders and diffe rent races participated in their production...Although colonists might not dare dispute [or add to the biblical Scriptures]...they often felt free to record the events of their daily lives on blank pages of their almanacs or to scribble in the margins any objections they had to what they we re reading. So, a lthough authoritative texts attempt to maintain hegemony ove r representational space, almanacs challenge the very notion of authorit ative discourse. As Silko observes, almanacs are \"designed so that you don't have control when you confront [them].\" (134) Because almanacs represent the work of more than one author\u2014the one in Silko's novel has had countless authors, some of whom wrote in languages no longer comprehensible to the almanac's current guardians\u2014they are non-authoritative, refl ecting the kind of \"production of multiple meaning\" that Silko has identified as \"in with in general.\" As Adamson s uggests, the anti-authoritative nature of the almanac form renders it an ideal method fo r describing the violent fragmentation that colonization imposed upon colonized cultures (1 39). In her 1989 essay \"Fifth World: The Return of Ma ah shra true ee, the Giant Se rpent,\" Silko explains the multivocality of her work as part of ancient Pueblo beliefs. There have been attempts to confin e the meaning of the [great stone] snake [which inspired Almanac of the Dead ] to an official story suitable for general consumption. But the La guna Pueblos go on producing their own rich and continuously developing body of oral and occasionally 85written stories that reject any deci sive conclusion in favor of ever- increasing possibilities. This production of multiple meani ng is in keeping with Pueblo cosmology in general. (133) At the same time that the almanac shows fr agmentation, it is also a powerful image of unity, as disparate authors and texts are colle cted into one volume. Silko's invocation of the almanac connects her novel with a pre-C onquest, written Native American tradition, countering the idea that written Native Am erican stories are a product of European domination. Laguna Pueblo has a connection to writt en Native traditions in its history. Describing the life of a Laguna leader, Kwi me, who led the Pueblo in the 1870s and 1880s, historian Florence explains, During [the Laguna leader] Kwime's yout h he had studied for seven years with the priests in Durango, Mexico, and upon his return he carried a large book which he said set forth a way of life for his people. As almost no other Lagunas could read or write at the time...the actual contents and title of the book\u2014which eventually disappeared\u2014are unknown. (334) Ellis suggests that this book may have been a Bible, but the book's exact nature is, for this study, not as important as the fact that it existed at all. Although many Lagunas at the time of Kwime's return were not literate, the book was considered important even by those who could not read it. Not only did this book set forth a way of life for the people, but it\u2014and the memory of it today\u2014also serves to further connect Laguna to the people of the south, some of whom had already been absorbed into Laguna. And in a further 86suggestion of written traditions in Laguna histor y, Ellis relates that some storytellers include a manuscript in the list of items carried by the original leaders of the Pueblo: According to the origin legend, Hatr amuni Kaiuk (Broken Prayer Stick), who led the people in their migra tion from the north and thereafter directed them, was the original hocheni or main leader. Working directly with him was Kamakashia (White Hands). They carried the basket representing the important ceremonial items provided by Mother Nature. This basket, the sacred toocheni , contained prayer plumes, seeds, the image of a man and of a woman (Our Mother Nature), and\u2014some add\u2014a written manuscript indicating how the people should live! (335) Whether the manuscript component of the origin story was added after Kwime's return or before, the fact remains that in Ellis's tim e, and presumably afterward, Laguna stories told of written traditions, connecting the Pueb lo people to books that spoke of the way of life for the people. Silko continues this work in Almanac of the Dead , which connects not only its characters but also the novel itself to pre-Columbian written tradition. Even writing, which Arnold Krupat in the case of Native American autobiography has located as a marker par excellence of European influence (220) , has a long, pre-colonial tradition among the Indigenous peoples of what is now the U.S. Southwest and Mexico, and Silko's novel evokes this written Indigenous tradition in the ancient almanac that Zeta and Lecha keep. This almanac represents the continuity between pre- and post- colonization written traditions that are contin ued, albeit changed, in the present day, as 87Lecha and Zeta add their stories and inte rpretations to the almanac in pages of typewritten English Among the disparate texts that form the book's basis are the works of Karl Marx, and the interpretations of Marx's work by others. Silko's preoccupation with Marx throughout the novel has also been a source of irritation for some critics. This critical response may in part be due to knee-jerk an ti-Communist sentiment but it also suggests that such a theoretical debate is somehow in authentic (for Indians should not engage with European theory) or inappropr iate. Such a response is not hing new, as Homi Bhabha noted in The Location of Culture (1994) in the chapter entitled \"The Commitment to Theory\": There is a damaging and self-defeat ing assumption that theory is necessarily the elite language of the socially and culturally privileged.... The Olympian realms of what is mistakenly labeled \"pure theory\" are assumed to be eternally insulated fr om the historical exigencies and tragedies of the wretched of the earth. (19) Silko's novel rejects the distin ction between theory and politi cs, as well as that between theory and creativity. Too Familiar or Not Familiar Enough: Internationalism, War, and Alienation 88Leslie Marmon Silko's best -known novel is her first: Ceremony (1977), which tells the story of Tayo, a man from Laguna Pueblo w ho leaves to fight in World War II and returns scarred by his experiences and the alienation they cause. The novel's basic plot is quite similar to N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn , and it too hinges on a ceremony to complete the main character's re turn to the Pueblo. However, Silko deals with Tayo's war experiences far more explicitly than is the case for Abel's experiences in House Made of Dawn , and draws particular attention to the similarities between the Japanese soldiers Tayo is fighting and the Pueblo people who are his family. In Ceremony , Tayo's visions blur the boundari es between the enemy and the community. During his WWII service, Tayo serv ed in the Pacific, and was assigned to shoot a number of Japanese prisoners, a scene he returns to again and again. The trauma of that experience lies not merely in the fact of killing, but also in th e fact that the dead looked so familiar: That had become the worst thing for Tayo: they looked too familiar even when they were alive. When the sergeant told them to kill all the Japanese soldiers lined up in front of the cave with their hands on their heads, Tayo could not pull the trigger... [I]n that instant he saw [his uncle] Josiah standing there; the face was dark from the sun, and the eyes were squinting as though he were about to smile at Tayo. So Tayo stood there, stiff with nausea, while they fired at the soldiers, and he watched his uncle fall, and he knew it was Josiah. (7-8) 89The Japanese soldiers look \"too familiar,\" and because the prisoners look like his uncle, Tayo is convinced that he is responsible fo r Josiah's death. Tayo's international travel and his identification with other people of co lor are sources of trauma. However, the root cause of the trauma is neither his travel nor his identification with the Japanese prisoners, but the war itself. Tayo's war experiences represent a very limited and largely involuntary kind of mobility. His presence in Japan has been determined by the U.S. Army, and even his enlistment in the army is not entirely his own choice. His cousin Rocky is the one who makes the decision to sign up, and Tayo simply follows his lead, remembering too late that he is the one who should be st aying home and helping the family. Opportunities for international travel have often been limited by the economic means of Indigenous travelers. Historically, many travelers served either as sailors (and, especially in Polynesia, as sealers or whalers) or as soldiers in the armed forces of the colonizing power. Service in colonial armies became one of the major means of travel abroad for Indigenous peoples. Indigenous people have frequently served in the armed forces of the United States, New Zealand, and Canada, and have often enlisted at relatively high rates. In the United States, for example, Rudi Williams notes in a 1998 article for the American Forces Press Servi ce, \"Historically, Native Americans have the highest record of military service per capita when compared to other ethnic groups\" (\"Marine Creates\" par. 13). A number of Nativ e Americans served in Vietnam, the war in which the titular uncle of The Uncle's Story also fights, and experiences of Indigenous Americans in twentieth-century wars have had great impact on literature as well as lives. 90Two Native memoirs of service in Vietnam point out the strangeness of fighting an enemy who looks more like you than most of your fellow enlistees. Leroy TeCube, a member of the Jicarilla Apache Trib e and author of the autobiography Year in Nam: A Native American Soldier's Story (1999), observed a group of Vietnamese children near his platoon in Vietnam. I noticed for the first time that they could pass for some kindergarten kids back home. The resemblance was strong. Some kids came over to me, and one said, \"You same-same Vietnam.\" This was the first of many times that expression would be directed at me. Fo r the rest of my tour of duty these people considered me a lot like them. (32) Similar, Blackfeet writer W oody Kipp, in his 2004 memoir, Viet Cong at Wounded Knee: The Trail of a Blackfeet Activist , also found more than a pa ssing resemblance between American Indians and Vietnamese during his t our of duty there for the U.S. Army; indeed, he even recounts a parallel turn of phrase, \" You same same Viet Cong\" (126, emphasis in original). After seeing a fellow soldier throw a concrete block at an aged Vietnamese civilian, injuring and pos sibly killing him, Kipp writes that I eventually realized that what I had seen had in fact taken place over and over as the Europeans stormed into a so-called New World...Other old men\u2014my grandfathers\u2014had suffered si milar treatment at the hands of American soldiers. (44) 91Kipp's memoir shows that while he was aw are of some of the similarities between Indians and Vietnamese duri ng his tour of duty, it took him some time to thoroughly understand what connected these two peoples: Many years later, after digesting what had happened to the Native American peoples after the coming of the Europeans, I began to understand my connection to the Viet namese through thei r understanding of nature and family, animist beliefs, and Buddhism. (41) Though his mention of Buddhism is intriguing in light of the role that Buddhism plays in The Uncle's Story (which I discuss in Chapter Th ree), Kipp does not elaborate on it further. Though its setting is in WWII, not Vietnam, Ceremony addresses the traumatic effect when the enemy looks uncannily like your family back home. Although he knows it is impossible, Tayo remains convinced th at his target was actually Josiah: My uncle Josiah was there that da y. Yet I knew he couldn't have been there. He was thousands of miles aw ay...But I've got this feeling and it won't go away even though I know he wasn't there. (124) Tayo's story makes explicit his sense of kinship with the Japanese soldiers he was supposed to view as his enemy. As in th e Vietnam memoirs discussed above, such a sense of kinship complicates his participation in the war and adds to the trauma of his experiences as a soldier fighting for the United States. Unlike the members of Army of Justice and Redistribution and the Army of the Homeless in Almanac of the Dead , Tayo is not fighting on his own land. In fact, the novel 92suggests that Tayo's presence on foreign soil to some degree echoes colonial occupations, as the Japanese colonization of Korea a nd occupation of China find no place in this novel.6 The exclusion of Japanese colonialism as an issue is intriguing, as it hints at one of the weaknesses in Silko's internationalism both here and in Almanac of the Dead . When looking outside of the Americas, Silko te nds to portray countries and continents in broad, sweeping strokes\u2014in Ceremony , the Japanese, fighting off U.S. forces, correlate too easily with Native Americans; in Almanac of the Dead , Africa is treated as a unitary cultural entity, with one set of gods common to the whole continent and a single history. What keeps these generalizations about non-American cultures from being a fatal weakness is Silko's understanding of global economic forces, in particular as they relate to imperialism. In particul ar in her later work, like Almanac of the Dead and Gardens in the Dunes , she foregrounds economic issues as th e connective tissue in the oppression of diverse oppressed groups. Almanac of the Dead in particular offers multiple ways of opposing the contemporary corporate coloni alism she critiques. The story of Ts'its'tsi'nako, Thought Woman, w ho imagines the world and th erefore calls it into being, suggests that Silko's novel can be understood as a form of prophecy which invokes the change it seeks. Silko retells the Ts 'its'tsi'nako story at the beginning of Ceremony : Ts'its'tsi'nako, Thought Woman, is sitting in her room and whatever she thinks about 6 I in no way mean to suggest that the U.S. Army's purpose in the Pacific during WWII was to oppose colonialism, as the U.S., too, had clear colonial goals and interests in the Pacific. However, I wish to underscore the fact that it is overly simplistic and ah istorical to ignore the role of Japanese colonialism when talking about WWII in the Pacific. 93appears. She thought of her sisters... and together they created the Universe... Thought-Woman, the spider, named things and as she named them they appeared. (1) In Laguna stories like this one, words have the power to create th e world, to call the subjects of stories into being. As things ar e named, they appear; words have the power to create. The emergence of the Zapatistas two ye ars after the publica tion of Silko's novel, blurring the lines between the novel and rea lity, underscores this element of Pueblo tradition. In her 1996 essay \"Books: Notes on Mixtec and Maya Screenfolds, Picture Books of Preconquest Mexico,\" Silko connects the Za patista uprising with Zeta and Lecha's almanac, which includes not merely record ings of events that had happened, but predictions of events yet to come. There are three known surviving Ma ya screenfold books... Of course, those two old Yaqui women in my novel Almanac of the Dead possess large portions of a fourth Maya book, which survived the five-hundred- year war for the Americas. Recently th is old almanac of theirs correctly predicted the Zapati sta uprising. (158) 94The \"old almanac\" has not only survived the European conquest but also remained in Indigenous possession. The three other codices, in European museums far removed from their native context, have through this rem oval become mere artifac ts, ancient but dead\u2014 or at least in suspended animation. Sil ko's almanac has remained among Indigenous peoples and has been added to by each gene ration of caretakers and as a result is no artifact, but a living, changing text. Its predictions\u2014like cal ling forth the Zapatistas\u2014are not curiosities but show the power of wo rds to bring change. (Though the visionary nature of Almanac of the Dead is perhaps most obvious in th e parallels between the Army of Justice and Redistribu tion and the EZLN, it is also worth noting that the book anticipates the Internet, which was a ni che phenomenon at most when the book was published in 1991.7) Whether the Zapatistas read the book or not, they were imagined in the book, long before their real presence could have been felt. As Daria Donelly points out, When the book was published in 1991, de spite the extreme inequalities of land distribution and the brutality of land bosses in Chiapas (all well described by Silko), there were no indications that organized resistance would erupt there...The prophetic tenor of Almanac and its handling of contemporary events breeches the boundary between the world of the book and the world in which the reader lives so successfully that the novel 7 Although e-mail was beginning to be more widely used in the early 1990s (I recall frequently needing to explain what e-mail was when I began using it in early 1991), hypertext (HTML), the basis for what we know as the World Wide Web, was first developed for network use in 1991, and the first widely used Web browsers, ViolaWWW and Mo saic 1.0, were not released until 1992. 95becomes a credible means by which to interpret ongoing global events. (246-247). The Zapatista revolution bega n a good two years after th e novel's publication, on New Year's Day, 1994, when Indigenous people from Chiapas burst into that state's capital city, San Cristobal de las Casas, took over public buildings, and reclaimed the land for the Indigenous people. Responding to histor ical injustices and corrupt government authority, the revolutionaries, who took thei r name from Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata, fought for Indigenous rights. Th ey were also remarkably attuned to the possibilities of technology; one of their leaders, Subcommandan te Marcos (himself not of Mayan ancestry), and other fi ghters struck romantic revolut ionary poses in photos, while news and manifestos were distributed via the Internet . Their technological savvy undoubtedly played a substantia l role in garnering both in ternational attention and support. But in the eyes of the Mexica n government, among others, the Zapatistas' approach, combining the traditional with the modern, made the Indigenous activists \"inauthentic.\" As Adamson notes, this dismi ssal echoes responses lik e that by Alan Ryan, described above, to Silko's novel: There are some notable similarities between the Mexican government's disdain for an indigenous movement b ecause its most prominent leader is non-Mayan and Ryan's dismissal of Almanac of the Dead because its author seems to him to be speaking inauthentically. Ryan's criticism of Silko is based, in part , on the fact that Storyteller and Ceremony placed Silko among the ranks of nationally recognized American Indian writers 96because they mirrored and helped to construct the expectations many readers bring to their reading of works by American Indian writers.... [including,] in Ryan's words, some ki nd of \"insight\" into the \"lives and minds\" of American Indians (read: some kind of insight into the ancient traditions and sacred ceremonies of tribal people). (132-133) I would suggest that, in addition to Subc ommandante Marcos's non-Mayan ancestry, the Mexican government initially rejected th e Zapatistas as not sufficiently Indigenous because of their able command of modern te chnologies, which was not in keeping with the stereotype of Mayans as nature-bound farmers. Similarly, cr itical rejection of Silko's novel focused the presence of graphic violence and on her use of Marxist theory, two elements that seemed to be at odds with a Pueblo culture stereotyped as ever-peaceful and pure.8 \"Movement Must Be Emulated By The People\": Traditions and Travel As she has noted many times in interviews and essays, Pueblo traditions are central to Leslie Marmon Silko's writing. Like many of the Southwestern Pueblos, although it has lost some of its land base Laguna is still located in its ancestral area in central New Mexico. The Pueblo peoples underwent displ acement and destruction as a result of 8 I am not disputing that peace has a high value among the Pueblos, as does balance; however, peace and balance are not always the same thing, and the stories collected in Hopi Tales of Destruction certainly show that at times, violence may be necessary to preserve or restore balance. 97colonization (notably in the aftermath of the 1680-92 Pueblo Revolt, when the Spanish made a concerted and violent effort to de stroy existing Pueblo social and political structures), but the Pueblos' history of travel and migrati on is a different one than the often more familiar history of Southeastern tribal removals like the Cherokee Trail of Tears. In \"Language and Literature from a Pueblo Indian Perspective,\" Silko discusses the relation of the land to story: One of the...advantages that we Pueb los have enjoyed is that we have always been able to stay with the land. Our stories cannot be separated from their geographical locations, from actual physical places on the land. We were not relocated like so many other Native American groups who were torn away from their ancestral land. And our stories are so much a part of these places that it is almost impossible for future generations to lose them. (58) In large part as a result of this history, the Pueblo Indians tend to be viewed as sedentary\u2014their very name, Pueblo, which in Spanish means a village 9 (and which is a linguistic legacy of the Spanish conquest), speaks to the permanen ce of their cities and villages and the perception that the Pueblos, unlike other Indi ans, are anchored in place. Moreover, as discussed earlier in this chapter, public per ception of Pueblo Indians like Silko is that they should be \"paragons of peace.\" The apocalyptic violence of Almanac of the Dead contradicts this peaceful image. 9 Though \"pueblo\" can also mean \"people,\" in the colonial context it referred to the towns and villages of the Pueblo Indians. 98 However, as the tales of destruc tion in Ekkehart Malotki's book show,10 both violence and excess are part of Pueblo stories; while balance is the ideal, the tales provide examples of when the world was out of bala nce and the restoration of balance was made possible only through violence. The villages in the stories are destroyed by forces of nature or by force of arms, all of which are brought about by the people themselves, usually in response to evil or excessive behavior. The violence in these stories, though it may destroy entire villages, is cleansing in the end and restores balance to the world. Silko's own familiarity with Hopi culture emerges in the character of the Barefoot Hopi, a leader who plays an important role near the end of Almanac of the Dead : The message [of liberation] had arrived. The Barefoot Hopi was the messenger. The Hopi had no permanent location but kept moving... The Hopi traveled the world to rais e political and financial support for the return of the land to indigenous Americans... (616) Given the key role that a H opi character plays in Silko' s novel, and also given the cultural ties between the various Pueblo peoples , it is reasonable to suggest that the Hopi stories of destruction collected by Malotki may provide another key to Silko's novel. These traditional tales of violence, destruc tion, and cleansing offer a reading that places the novel's graphic violence within, rather than outside of, a Pueblo framework. 11 10 The tales were collected from Hopi storytellers Michael Lomatuway'ma, Lorena Lomatuway'ma, Sidney Namingha Jr., and an anonymous man from Second Mesa. 11 Charles F. Lummis recounts a similar tale of the destruction of Pecos Pueblo, which was related to him by two Pecos men living in Jemez Pueblo and a destruction story in \"Puy\u00e9 and Pecos\" ( Taos Tales 171), so it is likely that such stories of destruction and restoration of balance are common to other Pueblos as well. 99The statement that the Barefoot Hopi \"had no permanent location but kept moving\" also shows the importance of motion in a Pueblo context. Place and land are of vital importance in Pueblo culture; the Pueblos are deeply rooted in their ancestral lands. As Silko says, \"our stories cannot be separated from their geographical location\" (58) However, it is equally important to recognize th at this rootedness does not preclude travel and migration, both individual and communal. Moreover, such mobility does not make anyone less than Pueblo, removing them from the community, but rather is in keeping with the traditions and st ories of the Pueblos. In her essay \"Thoughts on Migration by Santa Clara Pueblo\" (1995), Santa Clara author Tessie Naranjo suggest s that migration is a central element of Pueblo thought. In terms of migration stories the essential thing is that movement happened. Santa Clara people acknowle dge that the old people moved continuously - and that was the way it was...Movement is one of the big ideological concepts of Pueblo thou ght because it is necessary for the perpetuation of life. Movement, clouds, wind, and rain are one. Movement must be emulated by the people. (248) Movement thus is not only important but n ecessary for life to continue. It is also important not because of the distance traveled but simply because it happened; the movement of migration, not the final de stination of the migration, is the essential element. The stories related by Silko in her essay \"Interior and Exterior Landscapes: The Pueblo Migration Stories\" show the value of such movement in a Laguna context. The stories describe places that are still visite d by the people today: \"Laguna people continue 100to follow the same route that, according to the Migration story, the ancestors followed south from the Emergence Place\" (35), an eight-mile journey between Laguna and Paguate Pueblo. Here is a relationship similar to that described by Na ranjo: the key to the story is not in the relative ly short distance traveled but in the journey's symbolic importance, describing \"an interior jour ney the Laguna people made: a journey of awareness and imagination in which they em erged...always aware that interior distances cannot be reckoned in physical miles or calenda r years\" (37). The lengt h of the journey is less important than the fact that it was made. The Kochininako/Yellow Woman stories, which frequently appear in Silko's work (in Storyteller , several short stories, and her book of essays Yellow Woman and the Beauty of the Spirit ), provide another illustration of the importance of movement. The movement in this case is not the migration of an entire Pueblo but one individual's travel and contact with others (non-Laguna people and also animals) . In one Kochininako story that Silko retells, Laguna Pueblo is suffering from a great famine. Each day, Kochininako has to walk fart her and farther from the village to find fresh water for her husband and children. One day she travels far, far to the east, to the plains, and she fi nally locates a freshwater spring... Just as she fills her water jar and turns to hurry away, a strong, sexy man in buffalo-skin leggings appears by the pool... Able to transform himself from human to buffalo in the wink of an eye, Buffalo Man gallops away with her on his back. Kochininako fa lls in love with Buffalo Man, and because of this liaison, the Buffalo Pe ople agree to give their bodies to the 101hunters to feed the starving Pueblo. (\"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit\" 70-71) Kochininako's willingness to move, to travel \"far, far to the east,\" and her liaison there with Buffalo Man, are the fact ors that allow her people to survive the drought. Without such mobility on the part of individuals, the community could not have stayed in place, on the same land where their ancestors lived. Movement is indeed \"necessary for the perpetuation of life.\" Kochininako's mobility, while individual, is very much in service to the community. It is equally important to note that never in her trav els is Kochininako removed from the community. As Maori auth or Linda Tuhiwai Smith notes in Decolonizing Methodologies , Indigenous concepts of space and place often do not translate well into Western concepts of space and distance. In particular, Smith suggests that the Western notion of distance is not shar ed by Indigenous cultures. One of the concepts through which West ern ideas about the individual and community, about time and space, knowledge and research, imperialism and colonialism can be drawn together is the concept of distance. [In the Western view, the] individual can be distanced, or separated, from the physical environment, the community. (55) Smith's reading of the differing concepts of distance illuminates the fact that Kochininako's physical location away from the center of her community need not\u2014and does not\u2014translate into a dist ance from the community itself. However far she may have traveled, she is still an integral member of her community. Though she may be with the 102Buffalo Man at a freshwater spring far, far to the east, Yellow Woman is also still with her community, and her community is also with her. Other Pueblo stor ies bear this notion out; while protagonists are often physically re moved from the community either by space or transformation, they never cease being part of the community. Even as they become coyotes or eagles, are stolen away into the sky or onto unreachable ledges, and stay gone for years at a time, they are still at hear t Pueblo people, and are always, in the end, recognized by the community.12 Travel, and even transfor mation, thus do not equal distance from the community; physical distan ce does not translate into spiritual or communal distance.13 And just as the community contains all individuals, each individual also contains the community. That community, too, is more diverse th an popular perceptions would have it. A common misconception about the Pu eblos (and Indian tribes in general) is that they are homogeneous. Unlike Arnold Krupat, who in Ethnocriticism: Ethnography, History, Literature claims cosmopolitanism as a relatively m odern social trait, suggesting also that it is a luxury that minority communities cannot always allow themselves (246), Pueblo historians have noted that th e cosmopolitan makeup of Pueblo societies is the norm rather than the exception. As historian Florence Hawl ey Ellis notes in her essay \"An Outline of 12 See, for example, \"The Ants th at Pushed on Becomes a Deer : The Stolen Mirror\" (Parsons, Taos Tales , 151-153), as well as two stories that Silko retells in Ceremony : the boy who turns into a bear (128-130) and the man who turns into a coyote (139-141). 13 A similar lesson might be drawn from the experien ces of Native American voyagers to Aotearoa New Zealand, where some of their descendants still preser ve the knowledge of the Indian travelers' tribal affiliations, indicating that, though spatially dist ant, these voyagers still preserved their communal attachments and viewed them as important elements of their identity, as their descendants still do today. 103Pueblo History and Social Organization,\" the population at Laguna Pueblo included migrants from other Southwestern tribes: The cosmopolitan of popula tion in Laguna [included] a few Hopis, a Zuni family or two, and a spri nkling of Navajos as well as of Zias, Santa Anas, Jemez, Cochitis, and Do mingos from the Rebellion period [1680-1692], plus some Acoma additions through accretion and intermarriage - all grafted onto the or iginal small tribe of Lagunas. (329) The Pueblos also traded with other Indige nous nations; as Joe S. Sando, Director of Archives at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Cent er and a member of Jemez Pueblo, notes in his book Pueblo Nations: Eight Centuries of Pueblo Indian History , Trading expeditions [prior to the Spanish Conquest]...also furnished new articles and ideas, enriching their liv es....Exactly how far a distance away such trade extended is not precisel y known, but evidence exists that sea shells from the Pacific Coast were in use by the Pueblos....Macaw or parrot feathers have also been used in the social and ceremonial dances of the Pueblos for centuries. These were tr aded with tribes to the south, and it is believed they came from Mexico. (37) Thus, it is evident that the Pueblos consistently encountered and absorbed new people, articles, and beliefs. What migrants from ot her tribal nations brought to the community was anything but marginal, and Laguna people recognized that such intertribal, international relationships were a valuable resource for the tribe. Ellis, for example, shows that beliefs imported from Zuni Pueb lo are central to Laguna worship practices. 104Similarly, Silko's engagement with appare ntly \"non-Laguna\" beliefs like Marxism does not represent a departure from her tribal roots, but instead can be seen within the context of a tribal culture that constantly absorb s new peoples and new ideas and comes out of the process not hybrid, but still firmly Laguna. 105Tribalism and Internationalism in Almanac of the Dead Almanac of the Dead 's characters can be divided roughl y between the forces of liberation, which include Indigenous people, the Army of the Homeless, and a number of others,14 and the forces of the Destroyers, which include governmental officials, arms contractors, and real estate agents. One of the major charac ters in the forces of liberation is Clinton, a homeless African American Vietnam veteran w hose first appearance comes in a chapter entitled \"First Black Indian\" (404). Clint on, who has his own radi o show, has a strong interest in the history and traditions of Africa, and an equa lly strong interest in Haiti, which functions as a syncretic location where the cultures of Africa and the Americas mix. Black Haitian culture and people include elements of the native Arawaks, who aided early runaway slaves before their communitie s were largely destroyed, and Clinton plans to dedicate his first radio broadcast after the revolution \"to the ch ildren born to escaped African slaves who married Carib Indian surv ivors... the first African-Native Americans\" (410). The presence of descendents of African slaves in the narrative suggests yet another history of migration, a forced migration based on colonialism and th e drive for profit as Africans were taken from their communities and sold as slaves far from home. The novel posits that, much like the lost community memb ers in Pueblo stories, the descendants of slaves are still recognized as part of an Indigenous community. Through the character of Clinton, who is reclaiming ancient African traditions, Silko suggest s that for African 14 These others include a Korean computer specialist, Vietnam veterans, a disabled white man, and eco- warriors, among whom is a gay man with AIDS who gives his life to blow up the Glen Canyon Dam; the inclusion of the latter among the liberators to some degree complicates the book's otherwise relatively simplistic portrayal of gay men. 106Americans, a homecoming is possible\u2014a return to the spiritual, if not physical, community of Africa. In her effort to make connections between Africa and the Americas, Silko tends to oversimplify the diversity of African cultures, as I mention above. She often treats the continent as if it were one culture rather than many\u2014suggesting, for example, that all African peoples share the sa me deities. Neverthele ss, the novel's belief that African and Native American peoples shar e a spiritual kinship forms the basis for an internationalist movement that acknowledges the power of rootedness while at the same time reaching out to other peoples and contin ents, although it reduces the complexity of other cultures and regions. In Silko's view, Africans and Native Amer icans are both tribal people, and the syncretism of Haiti shows the spiritual kinship between Africa and America. From the beginning, Africans had escaped and hid in the mountains [of Haiti] where they met up with survivors of indigenous tribes hiding in remote strongholds. In the mountains the Africans had discovered a wonderful thing: certain of the African gods had located themselves in the Americas as well as in Africa... Righ t then the magic had happened: great American and great African tribal cultures had come together to create a powerful consciousness within all people. (416) Silko's tribalism entails a worldview that acknowledges the sacredne ss of the land and of the physical world, what Ami M. Regier, in \"M aterial Meeting Points of Self and Other: Fetish Discourses Leslie Marmon Sil ko's Evolving Conception Cross-Cultural Narrative,\" calls the \"collaps ed distinction between subjec t and object\" (188). The land 107and objects are characters in th eir own right, not merely passiv e, but active, a fact Clinton recognizes in both Native Ameri can and African religions. Haiti is the location of the first successful15 anticolonial revolution, in 1791. In a novel whose central concern is de colonization, the history of Ha iti is instruc tive both as example and as warning, as important for its successes as for its challenges. The forces the Western world arrayed against the is land as it moved from colonialism to independence were immense, showing that political independence won by one small country did not necessarily mean the end of imperial, economic domination. In the novel, the Haitian experience shows that alliances like those between the Afro-Caribbean population and the Caribbean Arawaks are important, but such alliances on a small scale are not enough. Silko demonstr ates that while the unity of Africans and Indigenous Americans on one small island is worth celebra ting, it is only through the larger unity of all tribal peoples thr oughout the continents of America a nd Africa that imperialism in its modern form of globalization can be effectively countered. The history of Haiti can also be read as a testament to the power of stories. Haiti faced not only colonialism but also col onial epistemologies and responses, which materially affected the young revolutionary democracy's ability to succeed and support its people. As Michel-Rolph Trouillot shows in Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History , Haiti's accomplishments were initially not even recognized in 15 The term \"successful\" is, clearly, not without its problems; I use it here to indicate that Haiti is the earliest country to revolt against colonialism and prevent further political colonialism. That Haiti still suffers the effects of not merely political but econo mic imperialism is, of course, without question. 108Europe, as the colonial mentality did not al low for the possibility that Black people had successfully resisted whites and set up a functional government. When the news of the massive upri sing of August 1791 first hit France, the most common reaction...was disbelief: the facts were too unlikely; the news had to be false....Confirmation did not change the dominant views... A serious long-term danger coming fro m the blacks was still unthinkable. (90-91) The imperialist worldview was incapable of imagining, let alone recognizing, Africans and Afro-Carib peoples as agents, as subjects rather than objects\u2014 even in the face of clear evidence. This lack of recognition led to political and economic troubles for Haiti, and illustrates clearly the power of stories. Imperialist narratives left no space for Black agency, and so Haiti was isolated, attacked with economic force when it could not be taken militarily. And because Western Europe was largely in control of global economic systems, Haiti's economy, which had become dependent on trade after colonization, served as a means of imperial control and domination. Haiti's history shows that independence must be not merely political, not merely the decolonization of the mind, but the decolonization of the economy as well\u2014ideal and material at once. Given the prominence of Ha iti's role in Sil ko's book, the reader might reasonably expect that Cuba would play the part, so familiar from leftist discourse, of a country which has achieved both ideal and material liberation. However, Silko's take on Cuba is determined by the Cuban erasure of Indige nous history, the one-sidedness of the Cuban Revolution's historiography, and Cuba's failure to acknowledge the contribution of 109Indigenous peoples to its decolonization str uggles. As such, for Silko the Cubans have become merely a variation on a European them e; they are still the colonizers, because like Menardo, the insurance man who is asha med of his Indian heritage, they do not understand their own Indigeneity. On the book's map, Cuba is identified only with the character of Bartolomeo, a resolutely dogmatic Marxist sent to help tr ain the Indians to use Cuban arms and achieve their revolution. Thus Bartolomeo and his politi cal backers stand not for internationalism but for paternalism, particularly leftist paternalism and the attempt to assimilate Indigenist political struggles into a pre-existing leftist worldview. Bartolomeo represents a Leninist interpretation of Marx's work wh ich posits the necessity of a vanguard party, an elite group of intellectuals who will prepar e the way to a communist utopia. This is the primary type of Marxism discussed in the nove l, and Marxism-Leninism lends itself quite easily to the paternalism that Bartolomeo displays. Angelita La Escap\u00eda, one of the leaders of the Indigenous Army of Justice and Redistribution, accuses Bartolomeo of precisely the same kind of col onial attitude Trouillot identif ies in European responses to the Haitian revolution. Angelita considers that Indigenous American uprisings had b een far more plentiful than any Europeans wanted to admit, not even the Marxists, who were jealous of African and Native American slave wo rkers who had risen up successfully against colonial masters without the leadership of the white man. (Almanac 527) 110The Leninist vanguard is here cast in racial rather than class terms, linking Bartolomeo's Marxism directly with colonialism. Bartolomeo 's insistence on his privileged place as a vanguard fighter and his concomitant refusal to acknowledge Indigenous history are what finally kill him. He stands in for \"all Eur opeans\" (527) as he is put on trial in an Indigenous Mayan village and convicted of \"crim es against history\" (531). At his trial, Angelita La Escap\u00eda reads a list of \"a few of the big uprisings and revolutions\" in the Americas, a list which goes on for about three pages and spans the time from 1510 (Hateuy's rebellion against Eu ropean slave hunters in Cuba16) to 1945 (the formation of the National Federation of Peasants in Bolivia). Whereas Haiti is liberation on an ideal level but without material power, Cuba is ma terial liberation wit hout the ideal. Cubans like Bartolomeo are still in thrall to coloni alist views of Indigenous people. Neither the ideal nor the material can be ignored in a succ essful uprising, and this is why so many of Silko's characters keep notebooks and almanacs of stories unrecognized in the dominant narratives, and why they fight simultaneously on political and economic levels, engaging with multinational capitalism a nd Marxist theory while battling to restore Indigenous land rights. Bartolomeo's trial is the clearest representation of the relationship between Silko's tribal traditionalism and Marxism. While Angelita La Escap\u00eda loves Marx, she does not consider herself a Marxist, making a distinction between Marxism (and its many interpreters) and Marx the man. Marx, she sa ys, understood a great deal, and was inspired by his awareness of colonized pe oples. Silko treats Marx w ith sympathy but is aware of 16 Ironically, Hateuy is today a well-known name in Cuba, even if his contributions have largely been erased; one of the major Cuban brands of beer is named for him. 111his limitations when applied to an Indigenous co ntext. Marx is a stor yteller, and like all storytellers, his words have immense pow er. But Marxism, which helped inspire numerous anticolonial revolut ions, not to mention texts like Frantz Fanon's seminal Wretched of the Earth (1963), has no place for the sacred\u2014the land, animals and objects are present primarily in terms of their utility. As Vine Deloria, Jr., notes in his essay on Native Americans and Marxism, \"Cir cling the Same Old Rock\" (1983), Rejecting the [Marxist] idea that there is a human world distinct from the rest of existence, American Indians would include experiences of wholly religious content within the scope of their inquiry... Marxist exclusion of some kinds of experiences, particularly those which seem to motivate human beings, appears wholly unnecessary and weakens the explanation that Marxists would expect us to accept. (120) The recognition of the sacred is part of wh at distinguishes Indigenous internationalism from the proletarian International. Ancestral lands are the center of the struggle, and at issue are not the fruits of or profits from thos e lands, but the lands in and of themselves. According to Almanac of the Dead , only those who recognize the centrality of the land for its own sake can take part in the struggle for true liberation. The roots of Silko's liberat ory Indigenous internationalis m lie in a world without nation-states and borders. \"Native American s acknowledge no borders,\" the map at the beginning of Almanac of the Dead states. While this might suggest that Silko is romanticizing the pre-Conquest Indigenous past\u2014which was by no means devoid of territorial conflict\u2014Bernie Harder, in his article \"The Power of Borders in Native 112American Literature: Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead ,\" offers another possible interpretation. Harder makes the di stinction between cu ltural or political boundaries and borders as sites of state violence and control: State borders continue to be the lo cus of conflict between Native people and dominant societies internationally. The fragmentation that the nation- state imposes on indigenous nations a nd peoples is a result of conflicting constructions of space, culture, and identity.... Almanac of the Dead ... [challenges] the legitimacy of the dominant ideology [of the nation-state] with alternative views grounded in an ol der historical reality of the First Nations in North and Central America....Power, as practic ed by the state, is weak in comparison to the nature of power that prot ects the sovereignty of tribal people... The novel demonstrates that the state's right to exist in America is based on force, not legitimate power. The problem of the border shifts radically from the illegi timacy of particular borders to the illegitimacy of the state itself as the instrument of colonial oppression against historically valid nations, such as the many First Nations on Turtle Island\u2014America. (95-96) The distinction Harder makes here, between European nation-states and sovereign Native nations, is, in the novel's terminology, the di stinction between trib alism and nationalism. Silko's tribalists insist on cultural sovereignty while organizing internationalist opposition to state and corporate power. This tribalism is also one of the sources of the novel's critique of Marxism: 113The Cubans had received unconfirmed re ports that these mountain villages were hotbeds of tribalism and native religion. Marxism did not tolerate these primitive bugaboos! \" Us? Not us! Their spies are liars! We are internationalists! We are not just tribal!\" rnationalists! (515) In 2002 'Network of Tr ibal Coalitions': Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead ,\" Channette Romero suggests that Silko hopes ...that contemporary manife stations of these [ancient] alliances can be used to resist injustice. These people are connected not through their national affiliation or location on either side of the [U.S.-Mexico] border but through their relationships to land and the spirits of the land. (628) The tribal relationship to the land and its spirits is vital; without it, even characters with Indigenous ancestry are doomed, as in the cas e of Menardo, a Mexican entrepreneur who sells \"insurance of all kinds\" (260), running a company protecting th e wealthy and their property from everything from earthquakes to civil war. Through his grandfather, Menardo has heard Indian stories, but he has disavowed both their power and his own Indian heritage. Menardo had loved [his gr andfather's] stories right up until the sixth grade when one of the teaching Brothers had given them a long lecture about pagan people and pagan stories... Around the time the [other children] had called him Flat Nose [a slang name the Indians were called]...Menardo 114had made a horrible discovery. His grandfather's nose had been much shorter and wider than his was; the people the old man called \"our ancestors,\" \"our family,\" were in fact Indians. All along, Menardo had been listening to the one who was responsible for th e taunts of the others. Without the family nose, Menar do might have passed for one of sangre limpia [clean blood]. (258-259) Menardo immediately abandons his grandfathe r, and when the old man dies shortly thereafter, Menardo is relieved, for with hi m disappears the eviden ce of his own \"dirty blood.\" He begins to claim that his nose was flattened by an opponent in a boxing match, and that he is not mestizo or mixedblood, but as white as the other members of the upper classes whose business and approval he want s and needs. He marries Iliana, a woman whose family is \"among the oldest in Tux tla Guti\u00e9rrez\u2014her great-grandfather on her mother's side had in fact been part of the original Guti\u00e9rrez family that had settled the area\" (260)\u2014ironically, of course, the oldest families in that area would be Indigenous rather than Spanish, but it is a sign of Mena rdo's commitment to dominant histories that he does not recognize this fact . Even with the help of this marriage, Menardo is only grudgingly accepted by the white upper-class so ciety, but his money opens the necessary doors. Not only can he do business and play golf with the elites, but Iliana's family accepts him as a suitable husband for her. But Menardo's Indian heritage is more easily expunged from his social life than from his own memory, as is evident in Menardo's relationship with his Mayan chauffeur Tacho. 115 Tacho is well versed in ancient Mayan traditions and beliefs. He keeps sacred macaws and a sacred opal, and unbeknownst to Menardo, Tacho and his twin brother El Feo are the leaders of the Army of Jus tice and Redistribution. Though Menardo scorns Tacho's traditions as mere supe rstitions, he is also intrigued by their possible power. As he and Tacho wait for the arrival of Alegr\u00eda Martinez-Soto, the archite ct who is to design Menardo's new house, he watches Tacho play an \"old Indian game\" that he can recall his grandfather playing. Menardo had known it was a gambler's game, but today Tacho told him it was a fortune-telling device too. Menardo...[made] a guttural sound expressing his impatience with Indian superstition. \"The pebbles can't tell you any more than I already know,\" Menardo said crossly. \"The plan e is two hours late...and my guest will...regret she ever heard the name of Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez.\" Tacho the I wouldn't worry, boss,\" Tacho sa id without raising his head. \"I asked the pebbles. They say she will like it here, sir.\" Menardo said nothing to this. He hated the way I ndians tried to please you, telling you whatever they thought you wanted to hear so you would be tricked and believe their stupid superstitions or at least be manipulated to give them a bonus on payday. (277) Menardo sees traditional beliefs either as markers of ignorance or signs of trickery, a tool used by Indian servants for their own financial profit. Always aware of his precarious 116social standing, Menardo is intent on not falling victim to such trickery, as it might lead not only to economic loss, but al so to social loss, as it might serve as evidence of his own Mayan heritage. Still, he cannot help but wonder about Tacho's powers, because \"Menardo had heard the cook and the downstair s maid quarreling over hot [lottery] tips they had purchased from Tacho... Tacho had given the [maid] only one winning number while the cook...had won with five numbers\" (2 76-277). In spite of his suspicions about the power of traditional culture, Menardo remains firm in his decision to throw in his lot with the forces of capitalism and colonial ism. These forces, the Destroyers, are the negative image of the Indigenous internationalists Tacho is al lied with; connected to each other by ties of money, they form a transnati onal alliance dedicated solely to their own profits. Both Iliana, Menardo's first wife, and Alegr\u00eda, whom he marries after Iliana's death, refer to Tacho as \"the sullen Indi an chauffeur\" (269, 277). The women are unable to see beyond their prejudices, and unw illing to acknowledge Tacho as a subject. Menardo, on the other hand, comes to appreciate and rely on Tacho's abil ities, even as he underestimates Tacho's intelligence and s ophistication. At the funeral of a bombing victim, Menardo is possessed of a strong urge to touch the body, and wants Tacho's blessing to do so. However, before formula ting the question he wishes to ask Tacho, he stops himself. \"Menardo could not say it. No t even to this Indian who had no sense of propriety, of which questions might be aske d and which could not\" (304). Secure in his assumption that Tacho has no sense of what is proper, Menardo believes that he is free to 117say almost anything to his chauffeur. As Menard o's life spins increasing ly out of control, he finds himself trus ting no one but Tacho. [Menardo] told no one his dreams except Tacho, his driver, who came from a village near a Mayan temple ruin. In Tacho's village they were all trained to decipher dreams. Menardo paid Tacho twice the going rate to ensure strict confidentiality. Enemie s could use your dreams to destroy you, that's what Tacho had told Me nardo in the beginning. Right then Menardo knew he must double the Indi an's salary or tell Tacho nothing about his dreams. (321) Menardo, who gave up his family and heritage in order to pursue greater profits, is incapable of imagining that Tacho's loyalt y cannot be bought, no matter how much salary he is paid. Moreover, because he sees Indians only as servants (albeit potentially trusted and powerful servants), Menardo does not realize that Tacho mi ght not merely be the tool of one of his enemies, but might actually be one of his enemies. These mistaken assumptions about Tacho lead Menardo to trust him completely\u2014he trusts Tacho far more than he trusts either of his wives or any of his business associates\u2014even as Menardo continues his awkward balancing ac t between believing and scorning Tacho's traditions and knowledge. This disregard for Indian beliefs fi nally leads Menardo to misjudge his relationship with Tacho, in part because Menardo fails to see that Tacho is still rooted in his community. To Menardo's eyes, Tacho' s physical distance from his community means that he has lost his tribal connec tion, and therefore means that his primary 118allegiance is to his employer. Believing that his servant is utterly loyal, Menardo comes to depend on Tacho's dream interpretations. However, Tacho's dream interpretations are given only to soothe Menardo; Tacho keeps their true interpretations to himself, understanding how they fit w ithin the ancient prophesies about which Menardo knows nothing. Menardo, whose life speaks of the alliances , or at least tolera nces and silences, that money can buy, also fails to unders tand that Tacho's loyalty cannot be bought. Whether he doubles his pay or not, Tacho remains Menardo's enemy\u2014but this is a truth Menardo cannot see. The fact that Menardo eventually dies\u2014apparently accidentally\u2014at Tacho's hand again underscores the misrecognize d power of the chauffeur and the spirits with whom Tacho is allied. Menardo's failure to believe in the power of spirits\u2014and his concomitant belief in the power of money to overcome anything\u2014is what leads to his death. Having purchased the best bulletpr oof vest money can buy, Menardo orders his Indian chauffeur to fire a gun at him so as to prove the efficacy of the vest in front of potential customers. Menardo wanted perfect timing\u2014he wa nted Tacho to wait until the cars had pulled up, then he would greet hi s fellow shooting-club members, then Tacho must shoot. Snap! Snap! Snap! One two three! Before the others could even open their mouths! What an exhibition they would see! Here was a man to be reckoned with\u2014a man invincible with the magic of high technology. (503) 119What Menardo does not recognize is that even \"the magic of high technology\" can be indigenized, and can be mobilized against him and his fellow capitalists. As Ami M. Regier notes, [E]ven high technology can participate in the animation often associated only with sacred objects in an indigenous tradition. It is this charged and changing relationship between sacr ed objects and \"impure,\" nonsacred objects now affected by tribal beli ef systems, whose politics of transmission occur throu gh infection, that most defines a politically operative fetishism offered in Almanac of the Dead . (191) Regier shows that fetishism in Silko's novel works as a means of drawing initially non- tribal objects into tribal systems, thereby indigenizing them. Menardo's own thoughts suggest that he too is not immune, as he re fers to \"the magic of high technology.\" There is indeed more than merely high technology at work, and it is the union between magic and high technology that kills him. Tacho fires the gun at Menardo only once, and Menardo is undone by \"microscopic imperfections in the fabric's quilting; a bare millimeter's difference and the bullet would have been safely stopped\" (509); instead, it strikes his heart, killing him al most instantly. Tacho later reflect s that the vest had a spirit of its own, that technology t oo was beginning its revolt agains t the forces of oppression. Blood: even the bulletproof vest want ed a little blood. Knives, guns, even automobiles, possessed \"energies\" that craved blood from time to time. ...Airplanes, jets, and rockets were already malfunctioning, crashing and exploding. Electricity no longer obeyed the white man. The macaw 120spirits said the great serpent was in charge of electricity. The macaws were in charge of fire. (512) The bulletproof vest is merely one link in a chain of objects and events showing that technology has its own spirit, a spirit which is no longer controlled by white men but by ancient gods and spirits. The vest serves to illustrate the pow er of the Indigenous world to absorb what was once foreign; as people fr om outside Laguna settled there and slowly became part of the Laguna people, so this technology has gradually been indigenized, no longer obeying the Eurowestern world from wh ich it once came. Menardo lacks the faith and commitment to Indigenous ways of knowing which he would need to accept and possibly change his fate. But in stead of seeking aid from tr aditional powers, he puts his trust in his bulletproof vest, which he beli eves to be a triumph of technology wholly within his control. The vest betrays him, turning on him and becoming a tribal fetish from which nothing can save him. Nothing in this no vel exists outside of tribal belief systems; modern technologies like the bul letproof vest and, elsewher e in the novel, airliners, televisions, and computers, are easily assimilated. Menardo's fatal mistake is thus his insi stence that technology and tribal beliefs exist in two separate worlds\u2014his subscription to the colonialist idea that Indian traditions are things irrevocably linked to the past, at odds with contemporary life. Unable to transcend the prejudices he subscribes to, and unwilling to give up his comfort and his capital, Menardo's allegiance lies with capitalis m rather than tribalism. In the end, photos of his death are circulated on a flyer above the words \"This is how capitalists die\" (510). Capitalists are the Destroyers, and like the tribal witches who call white men into 121existence in Ceremony , Destroyers may, like Menardo, ha ve Indian blood, but they do not share the sense that everything is inte rconnected which would prevent them from trying to destroy the world. This sense of connectedness is not only of paramount importance in the novel, but also forms a central component in Indigenous internationalism. As Silko explains in her 1996 essay \"Interior and Exterior Landscap es: The Pueblo Migration Stories,\" Pueblo potters, the creators of petroglyphs and oral narratives, never conceived of removing themselves from the earth and sky. So long as the human consciousness remains within the hills, canyons, cliffs, and the plants, clouds, and sky, the term landscape, as it has entered the English language, is misleading. \"A portion of territory the eye can comprehend in a single view\" does not correctly desc ribe the relationship between the human being and his or her surroundi ngs. This assumes the viewer is somehow outside or separate from the territory she or he surveys. Viewers are as much a part of the landscap e as the boulders they stand on. (27, emphasis in original) Rather than conceiving of themselves as dist ant from the earth or the animals, Silko's tribal activists are wi thin the landscape, and intimatel y connected to the land. They are aware of the land as not merely landscape, and understand that its worth cannot be measured in monetary terms. As Tacho's twin El Feo recognizes , true liberationists recognize the importance of land in the struggle against the Destroyers. 122El Feo had devised a simple and clear test to reveal whether so-called \"leaders of the people\" were true or only imposters sent by the vampires and werewolves of greed. The test wa s easy: true leaders of the people made return of the land the first pr iority. No excuses, no postponements, not even for one day, must be tole rated by the people... First the land. (524) True tribal leaders cannot be bought off with the promise of m oney or rewards, as the U.S. government has attempted to do most prominen tly with the Sioux, who have consistently refused the government's monetary compensatio n for the theft of the Black Hills. Thus, even as the novel looks to a global, transn ational Indigenous move ment, it nevertheless serves as a reminder that Indigenous internati onalism must remain firmly rooted in the land and the local. The liberatory alliance includes Native people from North and South America, African Americans, white environmentalists, an Asian American computer scientist, Chicanos, a disabled white man, and the \"a rmy of the homeless,\" which includes many veterans. It is a broad coalition, almost as broad as the group it is fighting against, the international capitalists, who count among their number wome n as well as men, gays and straights, and, in Menardo, at least one man who denies hi s own Indigenous background. The liberatory alliance is referred to as the tr ibal army, and it initially appears to have a great deal in common with th e international Indigenous movement that Richard J. Perry describes in From Time Immemorial: Indige nous Peoples and State Systems . 123One of these externally imagined, then internalized identities is the very notion of an international undercla ss or \"underethnicity\" known as \"indigenous peoples.\" It is a categor y of human society first invented through human rights reforms, then adapted, internalized, personalized, and collectively transformed by \"indig enous peoples\" themselves, with conviction and occasionally strident passion. (11) The salient point of Perry's de finition is the notion of the international underclass, an alliance of the dispossessed; and dispossession app ears, at first glance, to be at the root of the alliance in Almanac of the Dead as well. However, \"Indigenous\" is not the same as \"international underclass,\" ch aracter El Feo Indigeneity is not primarily a factor of dispossession, but of a felt connection to the la nd and its spirits: Politics didn't add up. In the end only the Earth remained, and they'd all return to her as dust. El Feo left books and politics to Angelita [La Escap\u00eda]... El Feo himself did not worry. History was unstoppable. The days, years, and centuries were spirit beings who traveled the universe, returning endlessly. The Sp irits of the Night and the Spirits of the Day would take care of the people... El Feo focused all his energy into one desire: to retake the land. (523) Indigeneity is more a set of beliefs than a blood inheritance, an understanding of the central importance of land. Th is definition would seem to suggest that anyone can become Indigenous, a notion that many critics would find troubling gi ven the long history 124of dominant appropriations of Indigenous cultu re. However, it is worth returning here to Womack's reading of the book: Silko refuse s \"to divest ancestral memory from the responsibility that such memory implies\" and insists that \"the ancestors may have more in mind than quick spiritual highs\" (233-234). Moreover, while the novel seems to leave the door open for an eventual indigenizati on of those Euroamericans who do not have Indigenous ancestry, it also makes clear that this will not happen in the near future. Thinking about white environmentalists, computer programmer Awa Gee muses that \"it took two or three thousand years before migr ant humans were once again comfortable on a continent\" (688) Nor is Indigeneity available for piecemeal appropriati on \u00e0 la New Age spiritualism, as Silko makes clear in her fina l section, which begins with several chapters set at the International Holistic Healers C onvention. Unlike the inte rnational Indigenous conferences organized in 1992, this is a conve ntion organized and at tended primarily by whites, including New Age shamans and othe rs who are trying to co-opt Indigenous cultures. Lecha attends the conference because she knows that some of her allies will be there, among them Wilson Weasel Tail, a Lakota poet who, at the conference, bills himself as \"a Lakota healer and visionary.\" [A]s far as Lecha knew, Weasel Tail ha d no training of any kind in healing, Lakota or otherwise. Weasel Tail had sw orn to take back stolen tribal land; he was a political animal, not a heal er. Lecha wondered what new angle, what new scheme, Wilson Weasel Tail had up his sleeve. (716) 125Weasel Tail is at the conf erence to drum up support for the tribal armies marching northward from Mexico. Like th e other Indigenous people Lech a recognizes, he is also there to make money from the many white New Age spiritualists at the conference, who \"[line] up obediently to buy whatever\" Indi genous people have to sell them (720). Lecha saw a hotel conference room full of women chanting...In the next room...it looked as if tree worship was making a comeback in northern Europe. In the corridors there were white-haired old hippies selling cheap crystals and little plastic bags of homegrown chamomile. There were white men...in expensive new buckskins, beads, and feathers who had called themselves \"Thunder-roll\" Horn.\" African medicine men...[and] Incas and Mayas [were] sell ing dry stalks of weeds wrapped in strips of dirty rag. ...Money was ch anging hands rapidl y; fifties and hundreds seemed to drop effortlessly fr om the white hands into the brown and the black hands. (719) The outer trappings of Indigenous culture do not make these conference attendees Indigenous; Indigeneity cannot be bought or sold, and no amount of expensive buckskin will change that fact. Indigeneity is also a quality of the land itself\u2014material and sp iritual, the land and the ancestors are together, and therefore the la nd is Indigenous; Indige neity is a belief and a power, not a fixed group. Thus, Silko's text posits a critical, activist Indigeneity that requires a connection with the land and the an cestors, belief in the old traditions, and understanding of the global links between struggles. 126The leaders of Silko's transnational Indi genous movements share an international orientation and a clear willi ngness to adopt new technologies and ideas and absorb them into their own cultures. Silko's Indigenous warriors know their way around computers and guns, often speak multiple languages, a nd understand the connection between other peoples' struggles and their own. In fact, other peoples' struggles are their own, for all the tribal armies are fighting a common enem y, multinational corpor ate capitalism, and a blow against the enemy in Africa weakens it in America. It is El Feo's task to \"remind the people never to lose sight of their precious land\" (524), to ensure the return of the land \"to the people whose ancestors had lived on the land for twenty thousand years continuously\" (524) . The spirits of the ancestors are a part of the land, and they are what allow the tribal army to succeed. This, then, is the paradox of Silko's Indigeneity: Indigenous pe ople are disempowere d, but through their connection to the land, they have great power. Indigenous internationalism thus exists at the nexus of dispossession and power, and both are intimately connected to the land. Indigeneity is, at its heart, about the conti nuing presence of the anci ent in a modern world, and the understanding that ancien t and modern, rooted and inte rnational, local and global, fixed and traveling, are not oppositional pairs, and need not be in contradiction with, but are instead complementary to each other. 127CHAPTER THREE \"A Maori Destination\": Travel, Transnationalism, and Cultural Survival Witi Uncle's Story I think I am...a modern Ulysses\u2014th ough I prefer a comparison with a hero from my own history, like Maui \u2014trying to locate or fix a Maori destination for all Maori who negotiate their lives through the postcolonial constructs of a universal reality a nd a hybridised world. My advantage is that I know who I am and where I am because I was an inhabitant of an essential Maori world. I am not tryi ng to find my way back but, rather forward, to where Maori could be. Witi Ihimaera1 In Maori writer Witi Ihimaera's 2000 novel The Uncle's Story , international travel provides a solution to a seemingly intracta ble local problem. The novel describes a situation in which the homophobia of traditi onal Maori culture and the racism of Pakeha2 gay communities means that gay Maoris must choose between being gay and being Maori. 3 At the novel's outset, there is no space for being both gay and Maori; one either remains closeted or assimilates into Pakeha society. In the end, however, the novel posits a possible solution to this dilemma, one which challe nges Maori traditions without invoking the dominant Pakeha culture. The in spiration for change comes from Indigenous 1 Meklin and Meklin 362-3. 2 Pakeha : Originally, \"foreigner\"; now used to mean white New Zealanders. 3 Throughout his novel, Ihimaera uses the term \"gay\" to describe his characters' identification, when he uses a term at all. As David A. B. Murray writes in \" Takatpui, Gay, or just HO-MO-SEXUAL , Darling? Mori Language, Sexual Terminology, and Identity in Ao tearoa/New Zealand\" (2004), \"'gay' is the most commonly used term for 'homosexual identity' in public institutions...as well as in more informal day-to- day conversations [in Aotearoa/New Zealand]\" (163). In talking about Ihimaera's characters, then, I defer to the terminology of the novel itself and refer to them as gay rather than as takatapui or queer. 128Canadian First Nations peoples at an inte rnational conference, thereby avoiding the specter of colonial domination and assimilation so familiar to Indigenous peoples. The experiences of other colonized peoples offer new ways of l ooking at the situation of the gay Maori characters and ultimately allow the protagonist to lead the way \"forward, to where Maori could be,\" using Maori origin stories to develop a narrative that allows for the inclusion of gay Maoris. The Uncle's Story focuses on the lives of two main characters: Michael Mahana, a young gay Maori man in 1990s Aotearoa New Zealand, and his uncle, Sam Mahana, who in the 1960s fought for the Australia a nd New Zealand Allied Command (ANZAC) forces in Vietnam alongside the U.S. forces . Sam survived the fighting in Vietnam but died shortly after retu rning home and being cast out of the family for loving another man. The novel is divided into five parts, interspe rsing Michael's story w ith that of his uncle. Sam's story is told via diaries that Sam's sist er Pat passes on to Michael, diaries that she secretly saved from the fire in which her fa ther attempted to burn any and all trace of Sam. The Mahana family has thoroughly erased Sam's story; at the outset of the novel, Michael is unaware that his uncle even ex isted. In the process of coming out to his family, Michael discovers not only the existe nce of this previously unknown uncle, but also the reason Sam has been expunged from the family's memory: Sam's love affair with Cliff, an American soldier. As the novel progresses, Sam's story becomes a counterpoint to Michael's; as Michael gradually discovers hi s uncle's story, he comes to terms with and develops a fuller understandi ng of his own identity. Only after Michael 129attends a Canadian Indigenous arts conference does he begin to envision the possibilities for acceptance of gay Maoris with in his own Maori community. The novel demonstrates how internati onal contacts among Indigenous peoples can offer inspiration for cultural changes in other Indigenous cultu res. These contacts provide an alternative to th e hierarchical relationship be tween colonizer and colonized that has often been a source of forced, rath er than voluntary, cha nge. As Ronald Niezen documents in The Origins of Indigenism: Human Rights and the Poli tics of Identity (2003), the experience of seeing their culture under siege by the dominant settler culture often makes Indigenous communities wary of change when the impetus for change appears to come from the co lonizers (91-93). (This may be particularly true when it comes to issues of sexuality, as I discuss la ter in the chapter.) C ontacts among Indigenous peoples\u2014that is, lateral rather than hierarchi cal relationships\u2014may thus be perceived as \"safe\" motivators for change within Indigenous communities, as they allay the fear of one culture dominating the other. The Uncle's Story shows that such contacts, and the travel that facilitates them, are important elements in not merely maintaining but promoting the cultural flexibility that has allowed the survival of Indigenous cultures. \"...To Where Maori Could Be\": Traditions of Travel and Transformation Traditional Maori life has always included tr avel. Like all Polynesians, Maoris made ocean voyages both before and after European colonization of their lands. As historian David Chappell points out in his book Double Ghosts: Oceanian Voyagers on 130Euroamerican Ships (1997), \"Oceanians knew that the sea was a road map, not a barrier, and that sailing routes, like highw ays, connected worlds\" (173). In his work, Witi Ihimaera often discusses the importance of travel in both contemporary and traditional settings. In the 1993 study Witi Ihimaera: A Changing Vision, Umelo Ojinmah notes the importance of myth in Ihimaera's first novel, Tangi (1973): Ihimaera's use of Maori mythology, bot h in the thematic structure of Tangi and to carry the narrative, is also an affirmation of Maoritanga [Maori culture]. In using Maori myths, Ihimaera claims ... that he is trying \"to make the past live in the present.\" 23 At the outset of Ihimaera's 1986 novel The Matriarch , the family matriarch tells her grandson their tribal origin story. In the beginning, she e xplains, there was nothing\u2014Te Kore, the Void. Out of this void came Te Po, the night, the world of darkness, and, through many changes, eventually Te Ao Marama, the world of light, emerged. From the Void also came the first gods, the Earth Mo ther, Papatuanuku, and the Sky Father, Rangi awatea (elsewhere referred to as Ranginui), who were clasped in tight embrace\u2014so tight that no light could reach the world. Their children lived in the darkness and were unsuccessful in bringing light to the world until their son Tane Mahuta pushed the sky and earth apart against their will, separating his parents and letting in the light. When light finally reached the world, creation was resumed. As Ihimaera points out, this story also is \"the first setting apart of the roles of male and female\": \"The sky is high, sacred and male while the Earth is low but fruitful, profane and female\" (3). 131 Among the offspring of the gods, the ma triarch explains, was the demigod Maui, who not only brought death into the world but also created the islands of Aotearoa New Zealand on a fishing voyage. He pulled a fish ou t of the ocean, Te Ika a Maui, the fish of Maui, which became the North Island; the South Island was formed around his ship, Te Waka a Maui. The matriarch then describes the origin of the Maori people on these islands: The fish of Maui became the land of the Maori, and we call it Aotearoa. We are the tangata whenua, the people of the land. How we came to be here, nobody knows. Perhaps we have always been here\u2014Ancients descended from the Time of Gods. Bu t at the same time, later Maori voyagers came here also, like Kupe around 700 A.D. ... Then, in tribal histories, we are told of the arrival of legendary canoes from Hawaiki. (4) These legendary canoes, or waka, colonized the land of Aotearoa, and most Maori iwi 4 trace their lines of descent back to an cestors who arrived on one of these waka. Though the term waka is often translated as canoe Maori historian Ranginui in Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle Without End , points out that this ve ry translation is part of the colonial legacy of New Zealand: 4 Iwi means tribe or clan, though its meaning is not exactly the same as the term \"tribe\" when used in a North American context. Unlike th e North American context, in whic h most Native American tribes or nations did not share a single common indigenous language or culture, Maori language and culture has been far more standard across the various iwi, although there are still significant di fferences in certain areas such as women's leadership. Makereti Papakura descri bes the kinship hierarchy as follows: \"[The] families [who originally settled Aotearoa] began as a man with his wife and children. When their children married and had children, they would call themselves a whanau, or family group... As these families increased to a great extent, say about one hundred and fifty to two hundred or more, they formed themselves into a hapu ... and the different hapu made up the Iwi (tribe), who would all be descended from the common ancestor [who arrived in the original] canoe\" (35). 132Because waka were unlike their own vessels, early European explorers designated them canoes. The image conjured up by the word canoe\u2014a dugout propelled by paddles\u2014is hardly an accurate rendering of waka... These vessels stocked with provisions, laden with cargo, and carrying up to a hundred passengers were ships in their own right, capable of blue- water passages of a thousand miles or more. But because they were different, they were not ships and we re therefore consigned to the more primitive status of canoe. (25) Although there is some disagreement among scholars and storytellers as to the timing and coordination of the different wa ves of Polynesian settlement, 5 both Maori genealogy and archaeological evidence suggest that this first major phase of colonization occurred around one thousand years ago. Besides Aotearoa, another homeland\u2014the fabled Hawaiki\u2014plays an important role in Maori tradition. Hawaik i is the place to which the so uls of the dead return: the souls depart from the very tip of the No rth Island and journey across the ocean to Hawaiki. Ranginui Walker explains the concept of Hawaiki as follows: The tribal traditions refer to Hawaik i as the place of origin of Maori people. The word Hawaiki is simply the generic term for homeland, and in their seafaring history of migration across the Great Ocean of Kiwa [the Pacific], there are for the Maori ma ny Hawaiki along the route all the way 5 Many scholars (Peter Buck (Te Rangi Hiroa) and Pe rcy Smith, among others) espouse the popular theory that Polynesian settlers arrived in a fleet of five, seven, or more canoes. However, in 1990 Ranginui Walker suggested that this \"fleet \" theory represents \"the expropriation and transformation of knowledge by the coloniser. Nowhere in the [Maori] traditions is the clai m made of a large number of canoes arriving in New Zealand at the same time\" (39). See Walker, 28-3 9, for more details on these disagreements. 133back to Samoa and Tonga. But the word Hawaiki is used to refer only to the last homeland and not a specific island. (37) In Ihimaera's novel Whale Rider (1987), which features a gr oup of sentient whales who follow the same stories and traditions as Maori communities, the whales have a place they call Hawaiki, \" The Place of the Gods. The Home of the Ancients \" (57) The whales are migratory, and have a strong sense of home and place, mirroring the voyages and home places of the Maoris. The Maoris thus have a very clear connection to a homeplace other than where they live now, yet they are also the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. This seeming paradox calls into question the noti on that to be called \"Indigenous,\" people must have lived on their land from time immemorial. Modes of Maori Travel: Warfare, Conferences, and Urbanization Travel is often a force for cultural change, as varied cultures come into contact with each other. There are few records of how these contacts might have happened for the Maori people during pre-colonial times, but one of the earliest Maori voyages after European contact indicates that the cultu ral changes wrought by travel (in this case, under colonial auspices) can threaten the home community. Early in the history of Maori-British 134contact,6 in 1820, Hongi Hika, a Maori chief, vis ited England and Australia and returned with a substantial number of muskets (Harri son Wright suggests th ree hundred, Michael King one thousand), laying wast e to his enemies and esta blishing his iwi's dominance over the North Island (Wright 92-94, King 29). Hongi Hika's story illustrates that a voyager's return home could spell danger not only for the voyager but also for those who had stayed behind; perhaps for this reason, returnees sometimes became objects of violence. Chappell cites one of the earliest reported returns, in 1529, of a New Guinean native who had been forcibly abducted by a Spanish ship some years earlier and who, over time, learned the Spanish language and became a Christian. Explorer Alvaro de Saaved ra narrated the man's attempted return to his native New Guinea: \"We landed him on the same island whence we had taken him. He had become a Christian and acquired our la nguage. He had been taught that he might tell the natives what people we were... [A]s he was ready to swim, the Captain let him swim of his own accord. But the natives of the island killed him in the water, and he cried out to us, but nevertheless they killed him. So we made sail...\" It was a clumsy, tragic homecoming, the only attempt of its kind in the Spanish records until the early eighteenth century. (24) 6 The first contact between Maoris and Europeans occurred in 1769 on one of James Cook's voyages. European settlement in the country began in the 1790s, and Britain proclaimed sovereignty over the islands in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. 135Thus even from the early days of coloni al migration or travel\u2014most of it lying somewhere between voluntary and forced\u2014the return home was fraught with difficulty and potential dangers. Chappell do es point out that not all such returns ended in violence, although many returnees endured an initia l period of threats and distrust. Maori soldiers have served the New Zeal and government in a number of wars, the earliest examples being those who fought fo r the colonial government in campaigns against other Maoris. During the First Worl d War, Maoris fought in the New Zealand Native Contingent and Pioneer Battalion; in a 1926 history of these Maori units published by the Maori Regimental Committee, James Cowan describes\u2014with some poetic exaggeration\u2014the extensive part icipation in these units: With the exception of the Waikato, Ta ranaki and Urewera districts, the Maori tribes were denuded of their young men during the war. As in the Highland glens, the English shires and on the New Zealand farms, the native villages were deserted by the able-bodied: it was a matter of shame to be found lagging behind....In Rotorua there were scarcely any but the older people, the women and the ch ildren; every Arawa who could pass the doctor and look fit to carry rifle and swag went into camp to train for the great adventure. (3-4) Only a few decades earlier, many Maori sold iers had been fighting against the British colonial forces in New Zealand during the Land Wars (1845-1872, and the subject of Ihimaera's historical epic The Matriarch ), although some Maori iwi also fought on the side of the Pakeha. 136The Land Wars and the associated Maori resistance were behind the relative lack of WWI volunteers from Tara naki, the Waikato, and Urewera; even the 1900s saw widespread and tenacious resistance to th e colonial government in those areas. The invasion of the Waikato had been one of th e biggest battles of the Land Wars, and the colonial government had confiscated vast sw aths of land. Iwi in those areas not only resisted the Pakeha and their Maori allies during the Land Wars, but also harbored a number of anti-colonial Maori religious and political leaders like the prophets Te Kooti (one of the subjects of Ihimaera's The Matriarch ) and Te Ua Haumene, and the Maori King Matutaera Tawhiao. According to Cowan, at least 2,227 Maori sold iers participated in the First World War (out of a Maori population estimated at about 50,000); in WWII, over 3,500 Maoris volunteered for service with the armed forces (out of a population of about 75,000), and the Maori Ba ttalion of World War II is pr obably the most well-known instance of Maori people fighting for the government of New Zealand. Maoris also fought in the ANZAC forces in Korea, and one of these soldiers provided the inspiration for Uncl e Sam Mahana's character in The Uncle's Story, as journalist John McCr ystal recounts: In the 1970s, Ihimaera learned of a Maori soldier who had formed a relationship with a U.S. chopper pi lot during the Korean War; the relationship continued in New Zealand after the war until the soldier died in a car accident....Because he wanted Michael to be young and contemporary, he had to place Sam in the Vietnam War rather than the Korean conflict. (32) 137Perhaps because New Zealand's contingent in Vietnam was small\u2014just under 4,000 troops during the time from 1962 to 1973\u2014there was no separate Maori contingent in Vietnam. It is difficult to determine exactly how many of the troops were Maori, though in a 2006 speech to Parliament, Te Ururoa Flavell stated that 60% of NZ Vietnam veterans were Maori. Assuming this statisti c is accurate, it suggests that Maori, like Native Americans, had a proportiona tely high enlistment rate. One of the other significant opportunities Indigenous travel also addressed in The Uncle's Story is the international conference. Unli ke warfare, where Indigenous soldiers are as likely to be fighting ag ainst each other as alongside each other, conferences have great potential for developing inter-Indigenous contacts. Since the creation of the United Nations in 1945, and in particular after the formation of the World Council of Indigenous Nations in 1975 and the U.N. Working Gr oup on Indigenous Populations in 1982, there have been a steadily increas ing number of conferences focused on issues relating to Indigenous communities. The U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which was created in 2002 in response to concer ns from Indigenous representatives and recommendations from the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, is one of the largest Indigenous organizati ons and holds annual sessions. 7 Other groups, such as the International Indigenous Librarians' Forum, also convene regularly and include members from a wide range of Indigenous peoples. 7 The UNPFII website states, \"Indigenous peoples and others in the Working Group on Indigenous Populations felt that the structures of the United Nations were not well-suited to consider issues of concern to indigenous peoples comprehensively. In addition, they felt that the participation of indigenous representatives in the United Nations was limited. In light of these concerns, indigenous peoples and others proposed establishing a new body that would focus on global issues related to indigenous peoples and that would offer the opportunity for indigenous peoples to participate effectively. 138One-time or irregular conferences are also common, and Ihimaera himself points to the 1993 \"Beyond Survival\" conference, held in Ottawa, as the inspiration for the conference in The Uncle's Story (e-mail exchange with au thor, 2003); according to the organizers of the \"Beyond Survival\" conferen ce, participants for that conference were invited \"from the Americas, the Circumpolar region, Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Japan, the Asian Pacific regio n, the Caribbean, and Africa\" (\"RE: Beyond Survival Conference\"). \"Beyond Survival,\" in turn, was inspired by the 1990 International Indigenous Education Confer ence, which was held in Aotearoa New Zealand. Conferences like these provide th e opportunity for Indigenous people to exchange ideas and experiences and, as Ihimaera points out in The Uncle's Story , may also offer financial assistance to enable attendees to travel. Another form of travel, the migration of Maori people from rural villages to the cities, is a recurrent theme in Ihimaera's novels. As Umelo Ojinmah points out in his 1993 book Witi Ihimaera: A Changing Vision , What Ihimaera observed was a migration of Maori from their rural and agriculturally based communities to the urban areas: an inversion in the ratio of rural to urban Maori, and an attendant cultural discontinuity. (2-3) In Ihimaera's early works, including Whanau (1974), The New Net Goes Fishing (1977), and The Matriarch (1986), which are the subject of Ojinhmah's st udy, this \"cultural discontinuity\" is ultimately negative, and the protagonist's only choice for wholeness is 139to return home.8 However, some of his later work, in particular The Uncle's Story , complicates this view. The distance betw een the rural home and the city becomes productive and potentially positive, a space of possibility as well as loss. Like many of Thomas King's characters, Ihimaera's protagonis ts still maintain strong ties to their home communities, and they remain firmly Indigenous as they build lives elsewhere and become parts of other communities. While he is fiercely protective of Maori culture, Ihimaera also believes that it can\u2014and should\u2014change. As he says in th e interview with Andrew and Margaret Meklin quoted at the beginning of this chapter, \"I am not trying to find my way back but, rather forward, to where Maori could be\" ( 363); later in the same interview, Ihimaera says, \"I am a believer in cu ltural transformation, one that acc epts differences and creates alternatives and options\" (364) . It is important to see Ih imaera's critiques of Maori society in light of these comments; he is s eeking Maori ways of a ddressing the problems he sees and attempting to locate \"a Maori destination\" (362). What is Maori is determined by a cultural journey rather than by static definitions. 8 This pattern of urban alienation and rural renewal is also a theme in works by other Indigenous authors, like Kiowa novelist N. Scott Momaday's House Made of Dawn (1969) or Salish & Kootenai author D'Arcy McNickle's Wind From an Enemy Sky (1977). 140Gender and Sexuality and the Possibilities of Mobility In his fiction and in interviews, Ihimaera ha s often criticized wh at he sees as the patriarchal nature of traditional Maori culture and the strictures of its gender roles. Ihimaera's most well-known work is the novel Whale Rider (1987), which was made into a movie in 2003. The film received interna tional acclaim and, like the novel, drew attention to the role of gender in Maori cu lture. The novel tells the story of a young girl, Kahu, who is drawn not only to her Maori culture but to leadership roles that, at least in her iwi, have been occupied exclusively by me n. The role of women in leadership varies considerably by iwi, as the novel itself makes clear: While Kahu's grandfather is resolutely opposed to women in leadership positions, his wife Nanny Flowers\u2014Kahu's grandmother\u2014comes from an iwi where wome n have held positions of power. This background is one of the reasons that Na nny Flowers is supportive of Kahu, and she serves as a reminder that not all Maori tradi tions are as patriarcha l as the one Ihimaera critiques in the novel. Kahu's grandfather, Koro Apirana, leads their community at Whangara and does not believe women should have the right to community leadership. For him, Kahu's birth upsets the rightful order of things. Koro Apirana could not reconcile his traditional beliefs about Maori leadership and rights with Kahu's birt h. By Maori custom, leadership was hereditary, and normally the mantle of prestige fell from the eldest son to the eldest son. Except that in this ca se, there was an eldest daughter. (16) 141Though Koro Apirana holds the leadership position, his family often opposes him, especially when it comes to Kahu. Named after her ancestor Kahutia Te Rangi, the Whale Rider, Kahu is clearly destined for great ness. Recognizing her potential, Nanny Flowers and the narrator, Kahu's uncle Rawiri, subvert and circumvent Koro Apirana's rules as much as they can. Kahu, meanwhile, becomes ex traordinarily attached to her grandfather even as he ignores her existe nce. Her attachment to Koro Apirana represents her strong connection to the traditions and place of her iwi; as the narrator observes, she is firmly rooted not only by her emotional and familial ties but by the burial of her birth cord at Whangara and by her name, which \"[joins] her to our lands\" (29). Unlike Kahu, the narrator Rawiri does not feel the same strong connection to place, which he suggests is because his \"birth cord must not have been put in the ground at Whangara\" (61). He initially moves to S ydney, Australia, where he meets a lot of fellow Maori expats, all of whom he calls \"cous,\" or cousin. While ther e, he gets to know Jeff, a young white man from Papua New Guinea, who invites Rawiri to come visit his family's plantation in Papua New Guinea. Rawiri accepts the invitation, tellingly comparing himself to a cowboy as he does so: \"Say,\" [Jeff said,] \"you wouldn' t like to come with me?\" I hesitated. Ever since speaking to [my family at home], I had actually been thinking of going back to New Zealand. Instead, I said, \"Sure, I've been a cowboy all my life. Let's saddle up, partner.\" (66) The fact that he describes himself as a cowboy underscores that, in this visit to Papua New Guinea, Rawiri identifies with the colonizers\u2014with the cowboys rather than 142the Indians. (Only a page earlier, Jeff's moth er complains to him that \"the natives...are always drinking\" (65), so the fact that Jeff's family is among the colonizers is already vividly clear.) Like Hongi Hika over 170 years earlier, Rawiri is traveling as the guest of colonizers to a foreign count ry, and for Rawiri this means spending his visiting in a liminal space wherein he is both a colonizer and a native. Jeff's moth er finds Rawiri \"too dark\" (68), while Jeff's father warmly accepts Rawiri as part of the family, and so it is up to Rawiri to determine where he thinks he belongs. Jeff's parents have made a living by building a plantation on the New Guinean so il\u2014a difficult living, as Rawiri notes. Putting the plantation back on its feet was a challenge the countryside really threw at us; I have never know n a country that has fought back as hard as Papua New Guinea. I doubt if it can ever be tamed of its soaring temperatures, its terrain...and its tribalism. But we tried... (69), Interestingly, at this point Rawiri is clearly identifying with the colonizers against the \"tribalism\" of Papua New Guinea. He sees hims elf as part of the \"we\" that is trying to tame the country and its people. But over th e course of his two years in Papua New Guinea (which take up less than ten pages of the text) he comes to change his mind about who his allies are. Prior to traveling abroad , Rawiri never spends much time thinking about what it means to him to be Maori, but the more time he spends away from home, the more he realizes what home means to him. In Papua New Guinea, his position somewhere between colonizer and colonized puts issues of culture and imperialism into sharp relief, and the two years there bring him to articula te a sense of connection between Maoris and 143the native peoples of Papua New Guinea, no ting that \"[i]n many re spects, the parallels with the Maori in New Zealand were very close\" (70). The moment at which Rawiri finally decides that his kinship is with the Indigenous Papua New Guinean peoples rather than with Jeff and his family and, by extension, the white co lonizers comes when the family is driving home one night and their car hits a pedest rian. When Jeff's mother insists that they drive on, because \"it's only a native\" (73) and they might be subject to retaliation, Rawiri re fuses to continue on with them. He recognizes the man they have hit as Bernard, one of the workers on the plantation, but this makes no difference. Even Jeff, whom Rawiri has previously viewed as at least somewhat at odds with his famil y, seems to fear possible retaliation more than he cares about Bernard's well-being. Disillu sioned with his friend and angry with the family's callous disregard for Bernard, Rawi ri gets out of the car. Explaining why he could not continue on with Jeff, Rawiri explains, \"a cous is a cous\" (74)\u2014although he is not Maori, Bernard is a cousin, kin to Rawiri in a way Je ff will never be. Rawiri has a new confidence in his identity as an Indige nous person as well as a new understanding of the need for resistance to colonialism, even when colonialism wears a face as friendly as Jeff's. The confidence he has gained allows him not only to return to Whangara, but to help Nanny Flowers and Kahu as they struggle against ingrained patriarchal traditions. His experiences in Papua New Guinea are vita l to Rawiri's willingness to challenge the sexism of his home community, because it provides him with a sense of Indigenous identity that is changing rather than static. 144While the sexism of some traditional Maori iwi has been a preoccupation in Ihimaera's work for some time, until 1995 his wo rk dealt primarily with interactions and relationships among heterosexual men and wo men. Less conventional characters, like the drag queens who help the protagonist's family win a so ccer game in Ihimaera's 1994's Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies , or the drag queen Rawiri meets, in passing, in Sydney in Whale Rider , exist only on the stories' peripheries. Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1995) is Ihimaera's first novel centere d on gay characters, though it focuses almost exclusively on the Pakeha protagonist David. The only gay Maori in the novel is a marginal character who is never referred to by name, only as \"The Noble Savage.\" Since the narrative reflects David's point of view, this stylized and stereotypical rendering of a gay Maori man is evidence of the gulf that separates the Pakeha and Maori gay communities. Describing his rationale for focusing a novel on Pakeha characters for the first time in his career, Ihimaera explains, [The novel] is about David's journe y as a Pakeha man. The story could have been about David's journey as a Maori man, but because I wanted this book to have a universality a bout it, I decided David should be someone who was an 'everyman' kind of character. As well, if he had been Maori that would have changed the politics. (Amery 14) The supposed \"everyman\" quality of the novel did not extend to include the Maori population. Usually an astute critic of white normativity, Ihimaera seems to have fallen prey to it himself in describing this nove l as \"universal\" while at the same time acknowledging that it would have been diffe rent if his \"everyman\" were Maori. 145Nights in the Gardens of Spain does not imagine a world in which it is possible to live as an openly gay Maori man. In a passa ge near the end of the novel, The Noble Savage leaves Wellington to return to his hometown and marry a woman. His wife-to-be knows of his sexual orientation and accepts it; she merely wants a child, and The Noble Savage explains to David why he has agreed: \"The choice is not to be selfish, as your society is, David. If I was to choose between being Maori or being gay I would have to choose to be Maori. That is how I was born and th at is how my people will bury me. Not as a gay person. But as one of th e iwi. I guess, when it comes to the crunch, my cultural registration is more important than my sexual orientation after all.\" (234-235) Like his character The Noble Savage, for years Ihimaera perceived a contradiction between being Maori and being gay. As he told interviewer Anna Dunbar in 2000, he was unable to reconcile his Maori identity with his life as a gay man until he wrote The Uncle's Story. 9 The question that Michael is asked [in The Uncle's Story], what is more important[,] being gay or being Maori, is at the very, very heart of the book. I was asked the same thing in the 1980s and I am ashamed to say that I was totally flabbergasted and I couldn't answer. Michael is stronger and he says that one shouldn't need to choose. It has taken me 20 years to come up with that answer. 9 In this context, it would be interesting to compare Nights in the Gardens of Spain to James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room . 146Like Michael, who asserts that \"My people are among the most homophobic in the world\" (22), Ihimaera believes th at Maori traditions reject no t just gay identity but any same-sex sexual relationship. The one excepti on, Ihimaera explained in an interview with John McCrystal, are drag queens li ke the marginal characters in Bulibasha or Whale Rider : Traditional Maori thought has cons tructed Maori gay men as being feminine rather than masculine, so they're not sp oken about...[and] treated as if they're not there. Unless they wear a dress. If you wear a dress, you're fine. But if you want to be just an ordinary guy who plays rugby, who goes surfing, who has a few drinks and is gay too? Give me a break. It doesn't fit into the masculine image in Maori or New Zealand society. (32) This perception of gay men as feminine is part of Ihimaera's motivation for focusing The Uncle's Story on gay characters who are not just \"o rdinary guys,\" but, in Sam's and Cliff's cases, Riemenschneider's 2000 article Maori Cultural Practice\u2014 From Biculturalism towards a Glocal Culture\" discusses The Uncle's Story alongside two other books by Maori authors, Robert Sullivan's Star Waka and Alan Duff's Both Sides of the Moon, in order to examine the intersection of global and local cultures in those texts. Riemenschneider cogently argues that Ihimaera's novel, \"located at the intersection of ethnicity and gender and quite generally of the global and the loca l\" (149), represents 147the author's commitment to Maori dynamic, changing Maori culture\u2014in an age of globalizing influences. For the narrator as much as for Ihimaera the challenge posed to the essentializing homophobia of his own people is to modify the internal or local by a revised readin g of its own cultural framework, which does not have to be replaced; however, its revision is instigated by a global discourse. (151-152) The \"global discourse\" of gay rights, in Ihim aera's novel, is incorporated into the Maori worldview, offering a new way of being both Maori and gay. The \"revised reading\" of the cultural framework is not merely a result of international gay rights discourse but comes about partly in opposition to a normative discourse of gayness which emphasizes individual fulfillment rather than commun ity responsibility. The model of gay living suggested in The Uncle's Story (which I discuss at length later in this chapter) is quite unlike that described in the Pakeha world of Nights in the Gardens of Spain . Established in dialogue with both gay ri ghts discourse and internati onal Indigenous movements, Ihimaera's model is, in the end, uniquely Ma ori, relying heavily on Maori history and tradition. As Ihimaera ex plained to interviewer Mark Amery in 1995, As a Maori I have always fought ag ainst the European definitions of Maori and the forcing of Maori people into European structures. I have 148tried to subvert those definitions. In terms of gay culture the kaupapa10 is the same. My concern is about coming to an appropriate definition for Maori men which takes account of their sexu ality...Most of the gay Maori men I know have had relationships with wo men and most have had children or would like to have children. So I think we have to start talking of a Maori definition for Maori, that is more in clusive of options than exclusive. But part of the problem for us is that just as on the wider scale Maori are becoming identified by Pakeha, so too is Maori sexual identity. Gay culture often means...performing in a certain way and adopting the same codes that that particular culture has already established for itself. I don't believe those codes are necessari ly the same for Maori. (15) While it appears that Ihimaera sees Western gay culture as far more monolithic than it is, his effort to find a self-definition that emanat es from Maori rather than Western culture suggests that traditional culture cont ains the seeds for its own change. It is worth noting that there is some disagreement on Ihimaera's interpretation of traditional Maori culture as homophobic.11 In Male Call/Waea Mai, Tane Ma Report No.3: Maori Men Who Have Sex with Men , an in-depth 1998 report for the New Zealand AIDS Commission, Aspin et al. find that Maori society trad itionally accepted a range of 10 In his article \"'To Be True One Must Find One's Kaupapa ': Moments of Agency in Maori Fiction\" (1997), Otto Heim defines kaupapa as \"a set of cultural rules and policies associated with public administration...In a very broad sense the word kaupapa ...denotes an enabling relational and performative situation or condition\" (2). 11 There is similar disagreement on whether traditional Maor i culture is as sexist and patriarchal as Ihimaera often suggests in his writing. 149sexual behaviors and suggest that it is only due to European (and, in particular, Christian) influences that homosexuality is no longer considered acceptable in Maori communities: Evidence from both oral and written accounts of early M ori society confirm that a range of different forms of sexual expression was a fundamental feature of M ori society. Ng huia Te Awekotuku (1996) writes that \"sexuality was enjoyed in many forms. People chose partners of either sex for pleasure, and same-sex love was not condemned or vilified.\" ...Traditionally, M ori society was known for its sexual diversity...The data from this survey indicates that the sexual practices and relationships of M ori [men who have sex with men] are as diverse in the 1990s as they were in the past. This is despite almost 160 years of attempts by Church and State to regu late the sexual behaviour of both Mori and tauiwi [non-Maori inhabi tants of Aotearoa]. (8-11) It is possible that some of the different inte rpretations of tradition arise from differences among various regions and iwi (Ihimaera's family is from the Gisborne area in the East of the North Island and is affiliated with Te Whanau A Kai, Te Aitanga A Mahaki, Ngati Porou, and Rongowhakaata). Ihimaera's observations, in Whale Rider and The Matriarch , on the different attitude s in various iwi toward wo men's leadership at least suggest the possibility that atti tudes toward sexual diversity mi ght also vary across iwi. In any case, Ihimaera's view of traditional culture as inherently homophobic is by no means the only possible interpretation. However, re gardless of whether Ihimaera's book is the most accurate representation of overall Maori tr aditions, it is clear from many interviews 150that Ihimaera writes from his own experiences as a gay Maori man. The Uncle's Story is thus at the very least an accurate repr esentation of his own experience of Maori traditions. Ihimaera's criticism of Maori homophobia doe s not lead him to valorize Western culture. Rather, he also criti ques the gay Pakeha community for its pervasive racism and intolerance toward Maoris and Maori culture. Of his own decision to come out in print in 1995, Ihimaera says, Insofar as my coming out was concerned, it was not facilitated by [W]estern values, but rather compelle d by the need to be in opposition to those values. M ori gay men were doubly discri minated against, both by race and by sexual practice. I am not trying to establish a western framework for M ori gay men, but rather a fram ework that evolves from a Polynesian and M ori tribal perspective. (Meklin & Meklin 364) While Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1995) still imagines an opposition between being Maori and being gay, The Uncle's Story , published five years after Nights , insists that being gay and being Maori should not be mutually exclusive. When, in The Uncle's Story, Michael's aunt asks him, \"What matters more to you, Michael? Being Maori, or being gay?,\" he replies, \"I don't believe a ny of us should be made to choose, Auntie\" (28-29). Thus The Uncle's Story attempts not merely to co me to terms with homophobia but to challenge it\u2014and to challenge it fr om a resolutely Maori perspective. The Uncle's Story 151 The Uncle's Story deals centrally not only with gay Ma ori characters, but also with the complex relationship gay Maoris have w ith what Ihimaera sees as the homophobic traditions of Maori culture on the one hand and the colonialism of Pakeha gay culture on the other hand. Whether volunteering to fight with the Americans in Vietnam or deciding to date a Pakeha man, most of the characters ' life choices are cast in both personal and political terms and, more specifically, are connected to histories of oppression and imperialism. Occasionally, the novel veers into preachiness; in particular, the character of Roimata, a Maori lesbian polit ical activist and Michael's best friend, is prone to making sermons. However, for the most part, discussions of colonial legacies serve to flesh out the novel's characters as they struggle to find their own place in the world. Sam must come to terms both with his engagement in th e Vietnam War and with his love for a U.S. soldier, and the relationship between the two. Michael, in turn, must work through his relationship with his Pakeha lover Jason, who is both unwilling and unable to understand the importance of Maori culture and family. In fact, it is his lover's disregard for Michael's cultural background and family that force Michael to re alize that the life models that exist for white gays are not sufficient for him. For Sam, travel places him in the eye of the imperial storm in the jungles of Vietnam.12 It is not merely his travel but also his homecoming that is fraught with difficulty. His experiences have changed him wh ile his home has not changed; as a result, 12 I am using the term \"colonial\" to describe the political domination of one country by another, as distinguished from \"imperialism,\" the economic domination of one country by another country, by corporations, or by other economic entities. This distinc tion, however, is difficult to maintain in the context of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, a nd thus both terms are in use here. 152Sam cannot see how or where his life might fit into a Maori framework, and dreams not of changing the world but of running away w ith his lover and living on a small American farm far away from society. His experiences abroad, marked as they are by imperialist war and trauma, have not shown him possibili ties for change at home; unlike Rawiri in The Whale Rider , Sam cannot envision any way that he might return to Maori society while being fully himself. In contrast to his uncle's travel to Viet nam, Michael's travel to Canada, two and a half decades later, is a very di fferent experience. He is trave ling not as a representative of an imperial power, but as a spokesperson for Maori arts and a guest of the First Nations people hosting the conference. Where Sam's connections abroad are almost exclusively with people on the imperial ist side of the equation, 13 Michael is primarily in contact with Indigenous people whose experi ences parallel his own. Michael's relationship with his hosts is a nonhierarchical one which opens up new possibili ties for sharing and learning, particularly about ways of being both gay and Indigenous. Once he sees the possibility for the inclusion of Two-Spirit14 people by the First Nations representatives at the conference, Michael returns to Aotearoa committed to fight for acceptance for gay Maoris by Maori communities. Rather than dist ancing himself from his Maori heritage or denying his homosexuality\u2014the only options he saw pr ior to his trip\u2014Michael recognizes that culture is constantly in the process of changing, and that he himself can facilitate a cultural change without making the culture any less Maori. While Sam's travel 13 There is one exception, which I discuss later in this chapter. 14 \"Two Spirit\" or \"Two Spirited\" is currently used as a self-designation by many GLBT Native Americans. 153changes only him and, as a result, endangers him upon his return to his home community, Michael's travel changes both Michael and the community to which he returns. For both of Ihimaera's major characters , Michael and Sam, travel opens up possibilities for existence as gay Indige nous people where such existence seems foreclosed and forbidden at home. In order to live as an openly gay Maori man, Michael decides he must move away from his home in Waituhi (on the eastern coast of the North Island, near Gisborne) to the city of Welli ngton, a distance of about 540 kilometers, half the length of the North Island. This move aw ay from home is also, to some degree, a move away from Maori traditions, as Mich ael no longer takes part in most of the ceremonies that take place on his home marae. 15 Both Michael's connection to and distance from home are emphasized in the novel's opening scenes, in which Michael retu rns from Wellington to Waituhi to attend his twin sister's wedding. As he leaves Wellington, he debates with his Pakeha lover Jason about whether to come out to his family. Initially, Mich ael argues that there is no way he can come out at home and be accep ted. Being both gay and Maori necessitates a double life, and so he has no choice but to remain in the closet if he wishes to remain part of his family. Jason, Michael's boyfriend, rail s against Michael's s uggestion that being closeted at home is simply how it must be and demands that Michael stand up for their relationship by coming out. Jason's lack of understanding about the source of Michael's reluctance is largely conditioned by his complete lack of awareness of and interest in Maori culture. At the same time, however, so me part of Jason's de sire for Michael to 15 Marae : Here, central meeting area of a Maori community. For a more complex and complete analysis of this term in contemporary Maori culture, see Chadwick Allen, Blood Narrative (2002), 47. 154come out lies in his genuine sympathy for and frustration with a situation that limits Michael's ability to be honest with his family: [Jason said,] \"You don't recognise me for the person I am, Michael. You don't recognise us for the couple we 're supposed to be. Until you come out to your people, we'll never work.\" I had not expected that my be ing Maori and him being Pakeha would ever be an issue. I tried to make him understand. \"My people are among the most ho mophobic in the world,\" I told him. \"I'm not supposed to exist.\" \"But you do, and I do too. It's all a matte r of recognition for me. Either you choose to recognise me or you don't. It's up to you.\" \"I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the consequences.\" (22) In addition to fear of losing his fam ily, Michael's own internalized homophobia also prevents him from imagining ways he might be able to exist as an openly gay Maori man. After he comes out, his aunt asks him, \"What matters to you most, Michael? Being Maori, or being gay?\" Michae l's thoughts betray his discom fort and sense of shame: I didn't know how to answer. All my life I had been Ma ori. Who knows? All my life I had probably been gay as well. One was affirmative, something to be proud about. The other was negative, something to be ashamed of. (29) Michael's journeys, both actua l and symbolic, eventually give him the means to transform this shame into pride, but at th e novel's outset, he cannot imagine a positive 155gay Maori identity\u2014or any ga y Maori identity at all. As Michael flies between Wellington and Waituhi, half the length of New Zealand's North Island, for his sister's wedding, he thinks to himself: On [the first day I left Waituhi] the plane flew through a rainbow, the symbol of our tribe's protective de ity, Kahukura. On the other side was Wellington, a place wrapped around with squalls and a strange luminosity compounded out of sleet and wintry li ght. In those days I saw Wellington as a place in another land. I saw Waituhi as some country left behind in the past. Since that time I had flown backwards and forwards countless times... Although I grew up in Waituhi I became a man in Wellington... The longer I stayed, the more I e xulted in the freedom. And Wellington offered other infinite possibilities. Like my life. (199) This passage suggests that the distance betw een Waituhi and Wellington is not merely a physical journey. To use Leslie Marmon Silko's words, it is an \"interior journey\" which enables Michael to become a man and claim his life and his freedom. Michael lives\u2014and thrives\u2014in the city of Wellington, while in his home village of Waituhi he feels alienated and alone. At the beginning of the novel, retu rning to Waituhi for his twin sister's wedding, Michael observes, 156Nothing is worse for a single man or woman than to go home for a family celebration at which all th e conversations, all the c odes, are involved with family. You have failed, have not conformed. You are isolated. (16) Although Michael is not single as his family assu mes, his relationship is the source of an even deeper sense of isolation because Mich ael is dating a man. Waituhi is portrayed as an extremely homophobic place where homosexuality is considered an insult to family honor, and, as a result, Michael cannot be co mfortable there. Wellington, on the other hand, with its flourishing urban gay communit y, allows him the freedom to live his life openly in a community that accepts his relationship with another man. Returning from Waituhi after the weddi ng, Michael describes Wellington as \"picture perfect\" (21); ho wever, the city is not quite as perfect as it app ears, for Michael tires of having to explain hi s Maori culture to his Pakeha boyfriend Jason and his non- Maori friends. Though he is able to embrace being gay, in Wellington he cannot live fully as a Maori, surrounded as he is by people w ho do not consider Maori culture important. Unable to give up either identity, Mich ael travels \"backwards and forwards\" (199) between the rural Maori worl d and the urban gay communit y, carefully keeping them separate. \"Backwards\" and \"forwards\" are with out a doubt value-laden terms, and at first glance it appears that Ihimaera is describing the traditional rural Maori community as \"backwards\" in contrast to the \"forward\" modernity of the non-Maori urban community. However, if we revisit Ihimaera's statement, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, that \"I am not trying to find my way back but, rather forward, to where Maori could be\" (Meklin 363), it is possible that these terms instead reflect a sense that while the rural 157Maori village is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, Maoris themselves will continue on into the future, changing their society as they go. When Michael comes out to his family, th eir initial response is exactly what he expected. His parents are horrified and his tw in sister is hurt, though she is hurt more by his having kept this secret from her only to announce it the day before her wedding than by the fact that he is gay. Appalled at his son's revelation, Michael's domineering father Arapeta denounces and disowns him, casting him out of not only the family but the community. Arapeta tells Michael, \"People like you are outcasts. They do not belong. If you are a Maori, one of the privileges is that when you die your iwi will honour you by coming for you and bringing you home to be buried. No matter what you've done\u2014murdered somebody even\u2014they will honour their obligation.\" (27) The clear, though unspoken, message is that while even murderers may come home, Michael cannot; his iwi will refuse to bury him for the transgression of being gay. His father's disavowal marks not the e nd but the beginning of Michael's journey toward reconciling his identitie s\u2014a journey that, as his uncle Sam's fate shows, is one fraught with danger, for Sam's very existen ce in the family has been erased. Unlike his uncle, however, Michael has a st rong ally in his family, a member of his father's generation: his Auntie Pat, Sam's sister. Th rough her, Michael first discovers Sam, who died before Michael was born and about whom he was never told, and begins to reclaim a history of gay Maori life. 158The first time the separation between Michae l's Maori and gay selv es is lifted, he is far from home, at an Indigenous Arts conf erence in Canada. There, at the end of the conference, he speaks up for the acceptance of Two-Spirit people within Canadian First Nations, exhorting his listeners not to forget the contribution that Tw o-Spirit artists have made to Indigenous arts: \"The issue here is that for too l ong all of you who come from traditional cultures have profited by the efforts of those gay men and women who, for the love of their nations, developed the songs, the poems, the dances, the arts of all of us. You need only to lo ok in your hearts to know that what I say is true. You need only to look into each others' eyes to know that all our genealogies are intertwined with people of two spirits. But they are people who, to do their work, had to pretend they did not exist. They had to deny themselves the right to walk proud among us.\" (344) After his speech to th e conference, Michael begins to understand that it might be possible to create a Maori community where he feels fully at home as a gay man. His understanding comes both through his newfound awareness of Sam's story and through his conversations with Two-Sp irit Indigenous people about thei r tribal histories. Michael now understands that gay Maoris have always been there, and have been erased. He returns home with the understand ing that he must reclaim their history in order to find a new, complete way of being a gay Maori man. Thus it is ultimately through travel that Michael discovers the possibility of a home space where both his identities are accepted and customary. The novel's solution to Michae l's dilemma reflects the importance of 159movement, for it relies both on ideas en countered while traveling and on Maori traditions. Sam's story, which takes place a generation earlier in the Vietnam era, is one of isolation. Whereas Michael finds a gay commun ity (even if it is not a Maori one) in Wellington and meets gay Indige nous people at an internat ional conference in Canada, Michael's uncle Sam Mahana has far fewer options. While the novel does not give the precise dates of Sam's life, New Zealand's i nvolvement in Vietnam lasted from 1962 to 1973, so the bulk of Sam's story must take place sometime before the mid-1970s. As David A. B. Murray notes, \"gay and lesb ian activism throughout New Zealand (although particularly in urban centers) began to gather momentum during the late 1970s and early 1980s\" (171), which is after the time period of Sam's story, but well before Michael's. Like Michael, Sam travels, but his travel abroad is occasioned by an imperialist war. Sam's father, a veteran of the Maori Br igade of the First World War, insists that Sam must volunteer to fight for the ANZAC forces in Vietnam. The Vietnam War was among the twentieth century's most visibl e and bloody imperial conflicts, and the chapters on Vietnam do not shy away from the horrors of warfare. In Vietnam Sam first discovers his at traction to another man\u2014Cliff Harper, a white American serviceman\u2014which suggests that Sam had to leave home to even imagine the possibility of loving another ma n. Sam's shock at and resistance to his own attraction runs deep. The day after he and Cli ff Harper share their first kiss, Sam flees to a nearby Buddhist monastery to med itate and pray for guidance: 160[Sam] closed his eyes [in the temple] and a feeling of vertigo overwhelmed him, sweeping him off his feet and, before he knew it, he was tumbling through Te Po, the Night. Down, down, down he plummeted. Was this his punishment? He felt Harper's kiss, and his heart was pounding with fear. He saw Harpe r's face above him, heard himself whimpering, caught between desire a nd self-loathing. He saw that they were both tumbling through darkness, sending ripples that disturbed the entire universe... A black hole was opening below them and stars were cascading into it: the entrance to Te Kore, The Void. Once through its gateway there would be no return...[W]ith one quick surge of strength Sam kicked at Harper and sent him spinning away... Alone, Sam fell through the black hole. Punishment was for him alone to take... The sin was his and his alone. (159-160) Sam's resistance to his desire for Cliff Harp er stems from the teachings of his Maori traditions, his sense of the place of gay men within Maori cosmology. Their transgression disturbs the universe, and they will be punished by being re legated to Te Kore, The Void, which is emptiness or nothingness. While th ere is often a sense of potential about Te Kore\u2014because this world, Te Ao Marama, the World of Light, arises out of Te Kore, Te Kore is sometimes called a womb\u2014it is used here as an exclusively negative concept. However, this scene's setting at a Buddhist temple also suggests a different and less negative connotation for emptiness and nothi ngness. The heart sutra, which religious 161scholar Cuong Tu Nguyen points out is \"probably the most frequently chanted scripture in East Asian Buddhism\" (63), revolves around th e concept of emptiness (it is the source of the well-known lines \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\"); the realization of emptiness, in turn, changes the nature of aloneness, as Jefferson Humphries shows in his book Reading Emptiness: Buddhism and Literature (1999): The synonymic concept of sabi refers to an aesthetic sense that results from the realization of Buddhist \"emp tiness\": \"A person awakened to the essential mutability of life does not dread physical waning or loneliness; rather, he or she accepts these facts with quiet resignation and even finds in them a source of enjoyment.\" (8) The scene in the Buddhist temple serves to unde rscore that Sam's resistance to Harper is conditioned by his Maori traditions and also suggests that these traditions have a range of interpretations. Thus not everything trad itional must be valorized and preserved unquestioningly, and there is room for reinterpretation and cha nge within these traditions. Ihimaera's reference to Buddhism in this scene is not incidental, for he revisits the topic again later, as Sam's nephew Michael beco mes involved with a Maori Buddhist (289- 290). 16 Sam's flight to the Buddhist temple also suggests the role that non-colonizing cultures might play in reinterpreting traditions . Surrounded quite literally by the forces of 16 It is worth noting that Buddhism is not a proselytizing religion, and its presence in this text likely serves as a contrast with missionary Christianity. Missionary work, particularly in New Zealand, was an equal partner with colonialism, and thus Christianity (and missionary religion in general) is intimately associated with colonialism, as Ihimaera explores in greater detail in The Matriarch . Buddhism lacks this missionary aspect, meaning that engagement with its ideas ha ppens freely and without force, much like the engagement with the ideas and cultures of other indigenous peoples Michael encounters in Canada. 162colonialism but unwilling to s eek answers there, Sam instead seeks out those who are Indigenous and who are fighting against im perialism. Sam flees to a Vietnamese Buddhist monastery even t hough he does not understand Vietnamese and none of the monks know English. While Sam discovers hi s love\u2014and lust\u2014for another man through imperialist warfare, it is ultimately his med itation at a Buddhist monastery that allows him to come to terms with and accept his feelings. As he leaves the monastery, Sam sees the world in a new light: The world seemed to stop, to glow, to find serenity. With a sigh, a deep exhalation, the world began to renew itself...[Sam's] life had reached a point of perfection. A kind of understanding. A moment of revelation... It was going to be okay . When he next saw Harp er he would explain, and maybe Harper would understand and, if there was a God of second chances\u2014... He heard the universe singing. (162) Thus, while some of his impetus for change comes from experiences under colonialism, Sam chooses to turn to a different and non-colonizing culture for guidance on how to reconcile the new experiences with the old traditions. While there is signifi cant irony in the fact that Sam's discovery of his homosexuality comes through imperialism in its bloodiest form, his tr ansformation is not a historically inaccurate charac terization of the role that travel under the auspices of colonialism played in the lives of Indigenous peoples. Colonial travel , whether forced or voluntary\u2014or as in Sam Mahana's case, in \"varying combinations of choice and coercion\" (Chappell 158)\u2014was often a factor in cultural change. The fact that Sam, 163fighting on the U.S. side in Vietnam, falls for a blond Illinois farm boy who is the very image of the American heartl and, illustrates the role imperialism plays in Sam's self- discovery. In spite of the inescapable presence of colonialism and imperialism in the Vietnam War, colonialism is never discusse d openly\u2014in fact, is not even named\u2014in the passages set in Vietnam. The issue is raised on ly subtly, as in the following scene, when Sam and his company have just marched into a village and encounter an old Vietnamese woman in front of her home: The old woman stood up and greeted Sam. Her voice reminded him of singing. Of an aged grand-aunt who lived long ago. He was taken to her once, to the place where she lived, a hut just like this\u2014except that it was called a whare 17 -and she welcomed him and his mother in a similar singing language. Later that evening, after dinner, he had traced the moko18 on her chin and listened as she sung him to sleep with oriori, 19 lullabies for children. Po! Po! E tangi ana kit e kai mana Waiho me tiki ake ki te Pou, a hou kai Hei a mai te pakake ki uta ra - The rain, the shivering trees and, when Sam blinked, he was back in Vietnam and an old lady was looking quizzically at him.... 17 Whare: Home. \"Wh\" is generally pronounced \"f.\" 18 Moko : Traditional Maori tattoo 19 Oriori: In addition to being lullabies, oriori are often a child's lesson in genealogy and tribal traditions. 164Sam paused. He felt himself falli ng, as if her were going through the looking glass, and he remembered again the whare of his grand aunt. Like that house, this one also had mats on the floor, but instead of greenstone and feather cloaks it had an altar with a house God. Placated with offerings, the house God brought good fortune... As if that wasn't enough, the old woman looked at Lieutenant Haapu [another Maori soldie r], Sam and the rest of the platoon and began to chastise them... \"The old mother wants to remind us,\" Flanagan [the translator] said, smiling, \"that she is still our enemy. When the French ruled the country she had no sympathy for them\u2014they killed her father. Neither does she have any sympathy for us.\" (89-91) The old woman here is simultaneously represented as kin and enemy\u2014much like the Japanese prisoners Tayo is asked to execute in Leslie Marmon Silko's Ceremony . The old woman's insistence that Sam and his platoon are as much enemies as the colonizing French is as clear a mention of imperialism as the Vietnam chapters offer. While the old woman encourages Sam's sens e of kinship\u2014she offers him food, because she says, \" You are a boy. You were hungry, like all boys, and all boys must eat \" (91, emphasis in original)\u2014she also resists it because of the role he is playing as an ANZAC soldier. Sam, meanwhile, is torn between hi s presence as part of the occupying army and the kinship he feels with the Vietnamese peopl e he meets. He identifies with Vietnamese villagers and sees similari ties between the Viet Cong fighters and his own Maori 165family\u2014even the languages seem similar to him. The oriori he recalls upon seeing the old woman mentions new food sources to be found under the guidance of the ancestors, suggesting a time when change was necessary and was made with the help of tradition. Because the oriori serves to convey family a nd tribal history, its pr esence also suggests a strong feeling of family c onnection between Sam and the old Vietnamese woman. This kinship, of course, is at odds with Sam's role as a member of an invading force. Even when faced with the old woman's disavowal of any sympathy for the Maori soldiers as she reminds them that she is \"sti ll [their] enemy,\" Sam cannot bring himself to question his own presence in Vietnam. He is unwilling to face the political consequences of his emotions, to question what his feelings of kinship with the old woman might mean for his participation in the war. Later, when he recognizes and acts on his attraction to a fellow soldier, Sam reacts in much the same way, unwilling to examine what these feelings might mean for the way he live s his life and how they might change his relationship to Maori society. Sam leaves his feelings of connection unarticulated, drawing no conclusions from the conflict betw een his sense of commonality with the old woman and his participation in the colonial war on her land. Interaction among Indigenous peoples under the aegis of colonial powers was not uncommon, either historically or in the more recent past. David A. Chappell reminds us that \"indigenous voyagers were not necessari ly any more sympathetic or adept at interpreting local cultu res than Euramericans were\" (75), and that some Indigenous travelers were, in fact, active agents of colonial expansion. Sam, at least, feels some sympathy for the people he is supposed to be fighting, due to his connection with 166Vietnamese people in general and the old wo man in particular, a sympathy that weighs heavily on him as the fighting draws to a close. In a coda to the scene with the \"old mother,\" Sam comes upon her village the next day and discovers it has been razed by the Viet Cong in retaliation for the villagers' (unasked-for) contact with Sam's battali on. The old woman who had offered him food has been left to die in a field, brutally disemboweled but still painfully alive when Sam arrives. She has been singled out for such torture because she offered food to Sam\u2014the enemy, as she herself labeled him. Seeing Sam again, she begs him to kill her and end her suffering, and he recognizes his own complicity in her fate: \"I caused this,\" Sam said. \"I caused this to happen. Your village to be destroyed. You and your husband to die -\" \"No, it was me,\" [Sam's Maori squa dmate] Lieutenant Haapu said. The old woman looked at them both. You must bear your pain. I must bear mine . (102, emphasis in original) Realizing that she faces only a slow and painful death, Sam accedes to the old woman's wish and kills both her and her husband. He immediately swears, \"Utu. There must be revenge\" (103), but it is unclear against whom he is swearing this revenge, as he reiterates in conversation with his lieutenant that \"it was my fault\" (104). This confusion about the appropriate target of revenge seems to clear up in the action that follows, as Sam's platoon becomes involved in a strike against a Viet Cong base. In a scene of firepower and destruc tion reminiscent of Apocalypse Now , the \"Battle Hymn of the 167Republic\" plays in Sam's mind (\"Mine eyes ha ve seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\"), offering him a sudden sense of moral cl arity. Sam attacks five enemy fighters in a foxhole with a flamethrower, but what happe ns next catches him off guard and shows that his moral clarity was false and fleeting: Five screaming figures, human torches, spilled up and over the lip of the hole. Their bodies danced like candl es. Sam saw his mother putting her hands to her eyes. She didn't want to look. And the tape was in front of him and - \"You did it, Sam, you won!\" (116) In spite of his platoonmate's celebratory shout , Sam does not feel the elation, relief, or pride that should have come with utu, revenge. In fact, upon insp ecting the field of battle later, Sam discovers that these five \"human torches\" were women, and one, in fact, might have been the daughter of the old woma n who gave Sam food. Sam's mid-battle flashback to his own mother, covering her ey es, again suggests that his family is oddly present in this war, on both sides of the ba ttle field. Caught in the contradictions of fighting in a war of liberation on the side of the colonizer, Sam finally recognizes the \"sheer lunacy\" of the war (116). The final line of the \"Battle Hy mn of the Republic\"\u2014 \"His truth is marching on\"\u2014echoes as the sc ene closes. There is no moral clarity here, and if there is a truth, Sam knows that it is not what he is fighting for.20 In spite of the irony and the indictment of the war in the above scene, only after the war is over does any character articulat e a critique, and it is Cliff Harper, the 20 The Battle Hymn of the Republic has its origins in the U.S. civil war, a connection that may be worth exploring further. 168American soldier, not Sam, who does so. During Cliff's visit to New Zealand, Sam asks him, \"Were we right, Cliff?...Or were we wr ong to be there in Vietnam? I know when I went I thought God was on our side...Were we right, or were we wrong?\" (226) Sam, in a flashback to the \"old mother\" who gave him food and was brutalized for it, suspects the answer, but remains unable or perhaps unwilling to express it as anything but a question. Instead, he looks to the American soldier for an answer, and Cliff is the one to offer the critical view of the war, telling him: \"You know, when I was drafted I went to fight in something called the Vietnam War. But do you know what the Vietnamese called it? They called it the American War. So I guess your question depends on which side you were on....All I know is that war is war and those kind of questions about whether we were right or wrong get suspended when you're there, in the middle of it all...But, in my heart of hearts, I think we were wrong to be in Vietnam. Know ing it doesn't make it any better for my conscience to cope with. But pretending that those moral issues shouldn't be dealt with is condoning what happened.\" Sam sighed, and relaxed against Cliff. \"Thank you for saying it wasn't right. And for telling me the truth.\" (226-7) Unlike in the earlier scene in the Buddhist monastery where Sam also sought guidance on moral issues, he here does not try to discover the truth for himself but instead relies on a member of the imperial forces, albeit a very sympathetic one, for an answer. Although 169Cliff's statement demands that the moral issu es raised must also be dealt with, the conversation ends there, and is never revisited. Later in the narrative, at the Canadian Indigenous arts conference that has been paid for and organized largel y by (well-intentioned) white Canadians, the book offers a critique of such reliance on colonizers' e xplanations, however well-intentioned. Waiting for whites to provide answers suggests that the legacy of colonialism has not been overcome, and at the conference in ques tion, Sam's nephew Michael leads a charge against the well-meaning but nonetheless cont rolling financial power that whites have over the Indigenous people in a ttendance. In contrast, Sam, a generation before Michael, does not yet see how his personal relationships , genuine though they are, are nevertheless influenced by colonial ideologies. Although Cliff comes to visit Sam at home in Aotearoa and is ready to be open about the nature of their rela tionship, Sam prefers to remain discreet, fearing discovery by his family and in particular by his father, Ar apeta. Cliff is more than willing to learn about and respect Sam's culture and, unlike Michael's Pakeha boyfriend Jason, makes no demands on Sam to come out to his family. Sam has been welcomed back to his community with ceremony and good will, a nd Cliff, too, is welcomed\u2014until their intimate relationship is accidentally reveale d. As a result, it becomes clear that while abroad Sam has changed in ways that presen t a serious challenge to his home community. Chappell suggests that at least throughout the ninet eenth century, participation in warfare abroad rarely precluded a harmonious return home, for it did not challenge the structure of the home community. Actions that call into question the hierarchies and established 170mores of communities, however, such as relig ious conversion, acting above one's station, or a romantic or social attachment to th e wrong person, are likely to alienate and even endanger returnees (137). Sam, too, is initially welcomed home; he is even celebrated for his deeds in the war and honored as a soldier. It is not his participation in an imperialist war that damns him in the eyes of his family but rather his unaccepta ble desire for Cliff. Sam's young sister, Michael's Aunt Pat, is the one who discovers the relationship between Sam and Cliff. Because she develops a crush on Cliff, she steals after them one day and comes across Sam and Cliff kissing in the barn. Shocked and jealous, she tells their father, who confronts Sam about his relationship with Cliff. Cliff challenges Arapeta's authority, telling him that he is a powerless old tyrant and even knocking him down before asking Sam to leave with him. To Cliff's dismay, however, when Arapeta orders his son to stay, Sam comp lies with his father's demand: [A]ll his life Sam had been obedient. All his life the one thing he had wanted was for his father to love him. No matter what his father was like, the template of his authority could not be broken. No matter what his people were like, he was, after all, Maori. And Cliff saw that he and Sam were in Te Po, tumbling through the darkness. He heard Sam cry out, You must go back. Let go, damn you . Ahead was the entrance to Te Kore, The Void. It was a black hole and stars were showering into it. And Sam was calling to any gods who were listening: The price is mine alone to pay. If there is any sacrifice to be made, then I will make it . With one quick surge 171of strength he kicked at Cliff and sent him spinning away - and passed alone through the gateway. And Cliff knew that he had lost. (254) Powerless in the face of Sam's filial obedience, Cliff leaves for the airport alone, while Sam attempts to salvage his place in the family. In spite of the fact that Sam has chos en his family over his lover, however, Arapeta casts Sam out of the family, calling upon Maori tradition in order to do so: \"You are an affront to your iwi. You ar e an affront to all that I and my Maori Battalion mates [in Wo rld War II] fought for.\" His hurled accusations were like blows to Sam's head. \"Your ancestors are crying in their graves... You deny yourself the rights, the mana, the sacredness of man. I am ashamed of you... You say you love me when you have abused everything that I have given you? Your manhood, your tribe, your histor y? You disgust me, Son, you make me wish you had never been born.\" (257) This scene of rejection is a prelude to Arapet a's brutal beating of Sam, in which he whips him in an attempt to force him to admit th at his desire and hi s actions were wrong. Paradoxically, it is only through his father's violent rejection of his homosexuality that Sam finally defends himself. In contrast to his earlier acceptance that he was being cast out into Te Kore, The Void, Sam now rec ognizes that the fault does not lie with him but rather with the mores of his family and cu lture. As his father beats him and the rest of the family watches, Sam recognizes he has made a mistake: he should, in fact, leave with 172Cliff. This belated realization, however, does not save their relationship, nor does it save Sam; on his way to the airport, Sam stops to help a woman with car trouble and is unceremoniously killed by an oncoming car. Afte r the passionate and violent nature of the previous scenes with Sam and his famil y, this sudden end to his life follows the narrative arc of rejection and de struction, although stra ngers, rather than Arapeta, deal the final blow. Because Sam is killed before he reaches Cliff, Cliff leaves without knowing that Sam was coming to join him after all a nd their connection appears to be severed. When Sam's body is returned to his family, Arapeta refuses to bury Sam in the family plot, taking him instead to an unmarked grave. In a small but significant act of resistance, Sam's mother, Florence, tells her daughter Pat to follow Arapeta and memorize the location of Sam's grave, ensuring that Arapeta's attempt at erasure cannot be completely successful. In his attack on Sam, Arapeta uses the homophobia and stri ct gender lines of traditional Maori society as a weapon, much as some anticolonial activists have asserted that homosexuality is a byproduct of the white man's ways. As such, there are no traditional roles for gay men and women, and they should not exist in a truly decolonized society. Such argumentation is familiar from Frantz Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks , where in a footnote he suggests that homosexuality is present in the An tilles only due to colonialism (Fanon 180, note 44). Fanon is perhap s the most prominent, but certainly not the only, anticolonial author to assert that hom osexuality is the resu lt of colonization, as Arapeta suggests in his speech casting Sam out of the family. Most of the writing on the issue of tradition and homosexuality in decolonization struggles focuses on Africa, but 173the issues are similar to those Ihimaera explor es in his fiction and his interviews. In his book African Intimacies: Race, Homosexuality, and Globalization , Neville Hoad explains: Lesbian and gay human rights circulate transnationally and appear as an extremely unstable placeholder for a set of desires, anxieties, claims, and counterclaims around modernity and cultural authenticity in the discourses of postcolonial nationalisms, which are themselves transnational. Within these national discourses, they are frequently described as a threatening imperialist import. (69) Arapeta's violent behavior i ndicates that he sees Sam's homosexuality not merely as anathema to Maori society but as a part icularly \"threatening imperialist import.\" Arapeta's insistence that gay Maoris do not exist and have no history also find their echoes in discourses of African homosexuality. Bill Stanford Pincheon points out in his 2000 article \"An Ethnography of Silences: Race , (Homo)sexualities, and a Discourse of Africa\" that \"one of the olde st arguments [in Africa] is that black gay people lack a history traceable to indigenous African societies\" (41). Si milarly, in his article \"The Unsaying of Indigenous Homosexualities in Zimbabwe: Mapping a Blindspot in an African Masculinity,\" Marc Epprecht begi ns with the statement that \"Many black Zimbabweans believe that homosexuality was introduced to the country by white settlers and is now mainly propagated by 'the West'\" (631). These are precisely the same issues that crop up in the argument between Sa m and his father, and which are echoed throughout the book. 174 Perhaps in part because they believe that they do not have a cultural history, Sam and Cliff remain unable to define their relations hip. Just as Sam is una ble to articulate his commonality with Vietnamese villagers, Sam and Cliff have no name for their togetherness, referring to it as \"whatever this is,\" or \"this thing.\" Sam and Cliff exist in the absence of any kind of gay community and, unable to name their feelings, they cannot look for others who might be like them. They are alone together and content to be that way; their idyll is to live alone on an Illinois ranch, far fr om Sam's home and from any other people, in the middle of nowhere. Only by being alone together can they avoid the many issues raised not only by their relationshi p but also by their part icipation in the war in Vietnam. Life among family or friends, within a wider commun ity, would raise too many awkward questions and would require th em to put a name to their relationship. In a further illustration of their isol ation, Sam and Cliff share a language just between the two of them: the sign language that Cliff lear ned in order to communicate with his deaf brother and Sam to communi cate with his deaf basketball coach: [Cliff explained,] \"I got to know how to sign so well that in the end Mum and Dad gave up on it and whenever they wanted to talk to him they'd say to me, 'Cliff, tell your brother this\"... [W]e loved talki ng together in our own way and it got so bad that it us ed to annoy the hell out of everyone... So how about you? How did you learn to sign?\"... \"Well, [my basketball coach] Elder Crowe was partially deaf and dumb...Because I was captain of the team , I learnt to sign and was able to pass on instructions.\" (68-9) 175Aside from the rather implausible coincidence of such a shared sign language, this is nonetheless an interestin g passage for what it tells us about Sam's and Cliff's potential communities. On the one hand, sign language connects them to deaf people, who are unable to make their voices heard in the la rger society without the assistance of go- betweens like Sam and Cliff. In this contex t, their shared language is a symbol of disempowerment as well as of community. On the other hand, sign language allows them to form a secret community of two, unnoti ced even by those seated next to them, enabling their relationship to develop even when they do not have private space. The separate language ensures that they are thei r own community and that they need not reach out to others. Language, however, does not always create community. In the book, we encounter one other person who understands th e Sam and Cliff's secret language\u2014Sam's mother, Florence. At the same time that she reveals her understanding of sign language, Sam's mother also warns him that she will not stand up for them against her husband: \"Your father lives for you and through you. He expects a lot of you, more than anybody can humanly be expected to fulfill. That's why he rides you so hard. He has never forgiven you a ny weakness, any failing in the past. So do not expect him to forgive you any weakness or failing now or in the future. If he discovers your secr et, his rage will know no bounds.\" Sam's heart stopped. He looked at Florence. Behind her he could see a huge spider's web, shivering in the rain. \"You know my secret?\" 176 \"Every woman knows her son's secrets and his desires...\" Florence began to cry. \"The reason why I am telling you this is because you must not expect me to help you.\" (222) Because she is married to the abusive patriarch Arapeta, and because she has absorbed traditional teachings about the powerlessness and baseness of women, Florence has little sense of self. Thus, although she supports Sam, she cannot act on her support. Even though she shares their language\u2014and hence thei r secret\u2014Florence refuses to be a part of the small community that Sam and Cliff have created for themselves, a community characterized both by others' rejection of them and thei r rejection of others. Michael's Story Unlike his uncle Sam, Michael Mahana co mes of age in the 1990s, a time when connections between the personal and political are becoming more and more of an issue, when Maoris are insisting on the cultural autonomy guaranteed in the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, the founding document of Aotearoa Ne w Zealand. Michael is active in a Maori arts organization working toward cultural self-determination for Maoris, which signals that he is intimately familiar with the imp act of colonialism on his people. At the book's outset, however, he has not yet come to terms with colonialism's effects on his own personal life. Much like Sam, Michael is ini tially unwilling to politic ize his life choices, preferring to see his relati onship with his Pakeha lover Jason, for example, as transcending the issues that sepa rate Maori and Pakeha cultures. 177The division between the personal and polit ical that Michael appears to desire proves impossible to maintain. As Michael delv es deeper and deeper into Sam's story and considers his Maori community's exclusion of gay people more fully, he also comes to see the limitations of the predominantly Pakeha gay community of which he has considered himself a part. He lacks connectio ns with other gay Maor is, particularly men, even though hints of their presence are given throughout the first part of the book. After Michael has begun to explore Sam's story and through it, his own history, Roimata, his best friend and a very politic ally savvy Maori lesbian, ad monishes him for dating only white men: \"I only wish, Michael, dear, that you would see th at you've been colonised twice over. First, by th e Pakeha. Second, by the gay Pakeha. Even in the gay world the White majority hold s the power, the money, the decision making power\u2014and it is their images which tell you what is desirable, what you should be like and wh at you shouldn't be like.\" (131) Roimata often seems to act as the book's pol itical conscience (so much so that one reviewer suggests that she \"was invented fo r [the] purpose\" of informing the reader \"of the correct political interpreta tion of whatever is going on\" (Connor)), and this passage is no exception. She challenges Michael's desire to see his personal life as divorced from larger sociopolitical issues. As Roimata explains, in order to be fully who he is, Michael must counter not only the homophobia of Ma ori culture but also the racism and stereotypes of the non- Maori gay community. 178The Uncle's Story makes clear that what works for gay Pakehas may not work for gay Maoris, and that gay Maor i men and women must find their own model rather than merely emulating the white gay world around them. Before Michael can synthesize the various parts of his identity, he must deco lonize his mind by recognizing the effects that colonialism and homophobia have had on his own life and history. In order to do so, Michael needs to travel because, as he muse s, traveling allows him to see his own life from a distance and to discover new ways of being: I have always loved long journe ys. The act of leaving accustomed surroundings is a release from real ti me, real life. You can place that familiar life on hold, freeze it, secure in the awareness that it will be there waiting for you when you come back. The journey itself becomes an opportunity to explore para llel lives, those other op tional lives which have always been there. (310) Sam's story, a \"parallel life,\" proves to be an essential component in Michael's decision to travel. When Michael and Roimata are invi ted to the Indigenous arts conference in Canada, Michael sees his chance to find Cli ff Harper and explain to him that Sam was killed on his way to the airport. Cliff neve r knew that Sam was coming to join him after all\u2014a mistaken impression that Michael want s to correct. Michael also wants to give Cliff a greenstone pendant that Sam had pr omised him years earlier. Although he is leaving his home, Michael is car rying his history with him\u2014a nd he is traveling, in part, to continue discovering his unc le's story, a history he need s to save from erasure. 179The past, throughout this novel, is omnipres ent. In the beginning of the fourth section, just before he and Roimata leave for the conference, Michael meets Tane Mahuta, a gay Maori activist who lays the groundwork for Michael' s later activism (and who plays a major role near th e end of the novel, which I disc uss in more detail later in this chapter). Michael also breaks up with his Pakeha boyfriend Jason, signifying a readiness to enter into a ne w realm of being. Echoing the Maori creation stories, the section begins, Tuia i runga, tuia i raro. The world was being constructed again. Tuia i roto, tuia i waho. The top and bottom bound together by the light. Tuia i here tangata ka rongo te Ao. Now the outer framework and the inner framework. Fixed firmly, the knots soldered by the shafts of the sun. The promise of life, the impulse of history, was reborn. (193) This opening passage, with its mention of both history and rebirth, foreshadows the connection between tradition and innovation that eventually enables the emergence of a gay Maori community, the seeds of which are laid in this section's meeting between Michael and Tane. In spite of Michael's gradual and grow ing understanding of the role of history\u2014 both national and personal\u2014in his life, he ca nnot yet conceive of how gay Maoris might be included in the Maori community as a w hole. Such an understanding comes only after 180he travels to the Indigenous conference as a guest speaker to talk about Maori cultural renewal. In Canada, Michael meets several Canadian First Na tions people who identify as gay or Two-Spirited. These Two-Spirit peopl e discuss with Michael and Roimata the differences among their tribal traditions: some come from nations where Two-Spirit people were historically honore d, and others from nations w ho erased their presence. As the conference draws to a cl ose, the Two-Spirited First Nations acquaintances ask Michael to bring forward a resolution reque sting that the conference recognize the contribution of Two-Spirit people to Indige nous cultures. They choose Michael because he as an outsider, he has a freedom at this conference that the Fi rst Nations people do not. Michael's travel thus provides an opportunity for his hosts as well, showing that travel is important not only for travelers and their home communities but also for the host communities. In Canada, Michael can identify openl y as gay without worrying about his community's reaction. Being away from home represents an opportunity to explore the \"parallel life\" of an openly gay Indigenous man, an opportunity that exists because he is on the other side of the world from his home. Ev en so, he is initially reluctant to come out to his fellow conference participants. While he is deciding whether to propose the resolution honoring Two-Spirit people, Michael takes the opportunity to travel to Illinois and find Cliff Harper, who has been avoidi ng Michael's phone calls. Unwilling to allow yet another silencing of his uncle's life, Mich ael makes the trip to Cliff's home only to find that he is out of town. Michael does , however, meet Cliff Harper, Junior, whose middle name\u2014and what everyone calls him\u2014is Sam. While Cliff Junior knows that 181Michael's Uncle Sam was important to his fath er, he is not sure wh at their relationship was, though it becomes clear he suspects that they were lovers: Cliff Junior initially panics upon meeting Michael, thinking that Sam might be coming as well and might represent a threat to his parents' marriage. Once Michael explains that Sam is dead, however, Cliff Junior relaxes and allows Mi chael to leave the gr eenstone pendant that Sam wanted to return to Cliff. As Michael depa rts, he is disappointed that Cliff Senior is apparently not interested in meeting him but relieved to have returned the pendant, thereby fulfilling Sam's last promise to Cliff: Had Uncle Sam met up with Cliff Harper, perhaps this is where they would have ended. Together, in Muskegon County, on a small Illinois farm. ... But they never found the safe place that is the right of every human being. All of a sudden the wind came out of nowhere. The dust swirled high. The trees began to sigh and whispe r, showering petals. At first they were like tears, but as they continued, I knew they were lik e a benediction. No, Michael. Don't grieve, Nephew. You've done your job. Thank you. (342) Though his meeting with Cliff Junior is not the closure he hoped for, Michael has at least discovered that Sam's memory lives on in the name of Cliff's son, even if Cliff never explained to his son what Sam had meant to him. The meeting with Sam's namesake, which exposes the fact that Sam is remembered but his sexuality is erased, c onvinces Michael to introduce the conference 182resolution that his hosts wanted. He brings it \"for all the Sams and Cliffs of the world\" (322), all those who have been erased from history. Although the audience response is initially skeptical, several First Nations peopl e stand up with Michael in a demonstration that while this motion is brought by an outsider, members of the local community support it. Thus the presence of the outsider allows local communities to become aware of their own subject positions in new ways. After an old chief speaks in favor of the motion, thanking Michael and the other young people for their courage in standing up for themselves, the resolution passes with no di ssenting votes. To Michael's surprise, the passage of the resolution is anticlimactic: No thunderous acclamation. No dancing around the totem pole. Change is not always telegraphed in big ways and with grand gestures. Sometimes it comes quietly from the silent places of the heart. (346) It is this moment of quiet change that fi nally allows Michael to recognize that being Indigenous need not be at odds with being gay and that he ha s the right to expect non-gay Maoris to support gay Maoris when they ask for recognition. Moreover, it shows him that, contrary to what he had thought earlier, being gay is not \"negat ive, something to be ashamed of\" (29) but is part of a rich cultural legacy, a history that he is restoring and in which he may take pride. Encountering other gay Indigenous people who are true to both their sexuality and their traditions, Michae l becomes aware of the possibilitie s for reconciliation in his own life. The trip to North America\u2014including both the conference and his meeting with Sam/Cliff Harper Junior\u2014allows him to return home on his own terms and to begin the 183work of changing his culture. The meeting wi th Cliff Harper's son convinces Michael that he must not allow the partial erasure of history\u2014suc h as remembering Sam without remembering him as Cliff's lover. The enc ounter with the two-spirited First Nations people and their struggle agai nst discrimination in their own societies gives him the strength and also the inspiration to fight for full inclusion among his Maori people back home. His international travel enables Michael to \"explore parallel lives, those other optional lives which have always been there\" (310) and provides him with a safety net that would not exist if he were to take the risk of coming out in his home community. Unlike the activist Tane Mahuta, who has always been willing to take that risk at home, Michael is only able to do so once he has tried it, successfully, elsewhere. His international experiences also open up hith erto unthought-of possibilities. For example, the changes to Maori cultur e that Michael hopes for do not emanate from colonial ideology but instead originate in the ideas of other Indigenous peopl es. These changes are a result of lateral contacts be tween one colonized group and another, a very different kind of outside influence than the top-down colonizer-colonized influence. This type of contact is not only common to but often welcomed in independence struggles. Frantz Fanon's own crossover, for example, between Martinique and Algeria, suggests a similar pattern, as do the many contacts between African American and African political groups in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, Am\u00edlcar Cabral, a leader of the struggle for independence in Guinea-Bi ssau, toured the United States in 1972 and 184specifically requested to meet with representatives of African American civil rights groups. In a speech made to these repres entatives on October 20, 1972, Cabral said, I am bringing you\u2014our African brothers and sisters of the United States\u2014 the fraternal salutations of our pe ople in assuring you we are very conscious that all in this life c oncerning you also concerns us. (75) Later in the same speech, Cabral makes c onnections between his people's struggle and that of the Vietnamese people, emphasizing that it was \" similar but...not the same \" (77, emphasis in original). In another example of what Fran\u00e7oise Lionnet and Shu-mei Shih term \"minor transnationalism,\" or contact among colonized or formerly colonized peoples, during the 1970s Maori people assisted Black Australians in setting up family education and child care centers.21 The Uncle's Story offers a similar model for cultural exchange (and change): voluntary and lateral contact among Indigenous groups. Material conditions, of course, may preclude contact among Indigenous groups. Resources for lateral travel are generally more limited than resources for margin-to- center travel. Scholarships and funds to aid colonial subjects in traveling to the metropolis\u2014the Rhodes scholarship system serves as an excellent example here\u2014are far more numerous than funds that enable colonial subjects to travel to meet other colonized peoples. The material limitations are very real and represent an important element of the history of Indigenous organi zing. Ihimaera's narrative is quite clear on this point: Michael and Roimata's tickets to Canada are paid for by a predominantly white 21 These Maori-Australian interactions were documented in interviews for the Maori-Aboriginal Family Education Oral History Project, arch ived at the National Library of New Zealand; some are also available at the Radio New Zealand Sound Archives. 185organization that patronizes Indigenous arts , and there are constant reminders throughout the narrative that these tickets cost so much that Michael and Roimata could not afford them on their own. Michael's journey also reflects hist orical developments in Indigenous transnationalism. For example, Michael's c hoice of moving to Wellington, rather than staying at his family home, represents a move toward intertribalism, for once he returns from Canada, he feels a connection with ot her gay Maori people in Wellington regardless of what iwi they hail from. Hence, differe nces among iwis, potential rivalries or old animosities, are not as important as the shar ed experiences of colonialism and oppression. These shared experiences are the roots of intertribalism, as evidenced when Native Americans were forced into boarding schools and discovered that their shared oppression could lead to a sense of intertribal comm unity. Michael, in We llington, creates his own community of other gay Maori people, even t hough initially the community consists only of Roimata and himself. Unlike Sam and Cliff, who are never able to expand their community of two, Michael and Roimata's community becomes public, and in becoming public it grows in numbers and in strength until it is an iwi in its own right\u2014in large part because they connect with Indigenous activists abroad and with the Maori activist Tane Mahuta at home. Tane initially approaches Michael not onl y to discuss politics but also because Roimata has asked Tane to be a go-between in discussing the possi bility of marriage between Michael and Roimata. Roimata has decided that she wants children, and that 186Michael would make an ideal, procreating but otherwise non-sexua l husband and friend. Responding to Michael's objecti ons to marrying his lesbia n friend, Tane explains, \"Marriage [between gay men and gay women] should be an option for gay Polynesian men and women. With it we can establish a tribe\u2014a tribe based not just on sexual identity but on family. A tribe must have children to survive. It must also have parent s, grandmothers and grandfathers. Even though the children may not be gay by practice, they will be gay by genealogy through their fathers and moth ers. When my own children grow up, I want them to think of themselves as belonging to a great new gay family, a wonderful new gay tribe -\" (296) While Michael initially reject s Tane Mahuta's proposal, it do es force him to think of Polynesian gayness as somethi ng new and different from Amer ican, gayness. Michael's process of reconceptualizing gay Maori identit ies is thus set in motion by Tane Mahuta\u2014not coincidentally, a man wh o shares his name with the Maori god who separated the Sky Father and Earth Mother so that their children could live in the light. The god Tane upset the established or der, forcing apart the world's founders to allow his generation to live in the world of light. As Michael says later in the narrative, \"Many people have seen, in this myth [of Tane Mahuta], a metaphor applicable to all kinds of situati ons. That independence does not come without sacrifice. That fighting for space and for light, the universal image 187for knowledge or enlightenment or freedom, is the continual challenge for all peoples who cannot see the sky.\" (343) Thus, even as his characters propose changes to traditional Maori ideas, Ihimaera places them firmly within a Maori cosmology and tr adition, reiterating that these changes are not foreign to Maori culture but are coming inst ead from a reinterpretation of tradition. Upon his return home from the conferen ce, Michael becomes publicly active for gay Maori rights. His activism culminates in a funeral procession for a young gay Maori man to the young man's marae. Tane Mahuta ca lls Michael to ask him to help because the young man is from the same area as Michael: \"A young gay boy has died of Aids,\" [sic] Tane said. \"His name was Waka. He comes from the Gisborne area and somebody needs to lead an ope 22 to take his body back to his marae. Will you and Roimata do it?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"It's time, and I wi ll be proud to lead the group.\" (363) Tane is not the only one with a name out of Maori mythology; the dead youth's name is Waka, the Maori word for the ships that br ought the first voyagers to Aotearoa. These names signal that the new gay iwi begins he re; we are reading its origin story. These mythic resonances also connect Michael's modern voyaging with the voyaging traditions and origin stories of generations of Maori ancestors. As Ranginui Walker points out in his history of the Maori people, Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou: Struggle Without End , 22 Ope: Funeral procession, leading to the tangi (funeral). 188Because the maritime traditions of the Polynesians endured as an important folk memory of Maori tribes, the waka in New Zealand became a potent symbol of tribal identity, mana and territory. (38) The waka, as origin point of tribal genealogi es, is a key component of Maori iwi identity, serving as both a point of connection to th e ancestral homeland of Hawaiki and as a bond to the land where the voyagers came ashore. Th e waka are where routes and roots merge. Because the age of ocean voyages aboard wa kas is over, the \"new gay tribe\" does not have a physical ship in which it arri ves; however, the body of the boy Waka, ravaged though it may be by AIDS, is renewed through its service to the iwi as a figurative ship, the point of origin of the new tribe. While the physical distance this new iwi traverses is not oceanic, the symbolic distance it travels is enormous. Traveling to a traditional marae as openly gay, lesbian, and transgender people, they ask for nothing less than recognition of their full selves. Michael, who before was sa tisfied with a closeted existence at home, has completed what Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko might call \"an interior journey\" in which he emerges with a new awareness and as pa rt of a new tribe, \"always aware that interior distances cannot be r eckoned in physical miles or calendar years\" (Silko 37). Together, Tane, Waka, and Michael in itiate the new gay tribe as they journey toward Waka's home and toward their own emergence as a people. The ope, which includes gay men and lesbians, drag queens, prostitutes, drug users, punk kids, and many more who do not app ear to be traditionally Maori, constitutes the new gay tribe that Michael dreams of building: 189When we arrived in Gisborne, Auntie Pat said it looked like a circus had come to town. ... I didn't care that we looked a rather odd tribe. It took courage to front up to a culture as forbidding as ours. \"We are a people,\" [I said.] \"We ar e a tribe. We bring our dead. If tradition has to be broken, then I will break it. Nobody will stop us from burying our own among the people where they belong. The time for hiding ourselves and our dead is past. The time for burying them in some anonymous cemetery is over.\" (364-5) In spite of Michael's determination, however, the procession cannot merely enter as it pleases. Outsiders must be welcomed onto the marae; without a welcome, their presence is not legitimate, and so Waka's procession is reliant on the support and welcome of someone from his family or iwi in order to be recognized and to complete their journey. By submitting to this requireme nt of recognition and welcome, Ihimaera's characters acknowledge that they are not willing to break with their families, with their relatives, and\u2014in spite of Michael's statement that he wi ll break tradition if need be\u2014 with tradition. Family connections are essent ial to Maori culture, as Ranginui Walker notes: The searches for loved ones [in Maori legends] by heroic figures establish the bonds between parents, children, siblings and spouses as the most significant relationships in Maori culture. (22) The gay Maoris in this new tribe are committed to the importance of existing family connections even while they are making new ones. 190Though they must wait for quite some time without welcome, Waka's grandmother Lilly finally acknowledges th e ope. That it is the grandmother who welcomes them is significant. For one, ag e conveys a certain ma na within society. Moreover, in Maori society, the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is extremely important; often it is the grandpa rents who are responsible for educating\u2014and sometimes even raising\u2014thei r grandchildren (mokopuna). [The boy's grandmother] straightened up. She looked at us. I think we probably gave her a bit of a shoc k. She knew we had brought Waka's body back, but she was trying to figure out some tribal reference point [to welcome us properly]... E hika, we were like no tribe she had ever seen. Ah well\u2014 Lilly raised her right arm... \"Welcome to this marae,\" Lilly called. \"Welcome you strange tribe I see before me! Come forward, you tribe of men who love men and women who love women! Welcome, you brave gay tribe, whom none have seen before! Come! Bring your dead who is also our dead\u2014\" Our tribe was born that day. It was born out of a grandmother's compulsion to take her grandchild back to her bosom. Ou t of a need to accept that a new tribe was coming. Th at day we signaled, \"Make way, we are coming through.\" We would not be stopped. (364-365) 191The welcome from Waka's grandmother is thus a further acknowledgement of Maori traditions. The existence of this new gay tribe, and the change that it signals in the lives of all Maoris, is due both to international e xperiences and to the re claimed history of gay Maoris. The past, in the form of ancestors, is vital to the new gay tribe which is being formed not out of a void but out of a combin ation of many genealogies, both physical and spiritual. \"The past is not behind us,\" Roim ata explains, \"It is be fore us, a long line of ancestors to whom we are accountable and w ith whom we have an implicit contract\" (326). Michael's ability to reim agine Maori traditions stems in part from his awareness that he has historical precur sors like his uncle, and he feel s a great responsibility to recover the history and memory of Sam th at has been erased from his family: Grandfather Arapeta had consigned Un cle Sam to Te Kore, The Void. He had disconnected him from the umbilical cord of whakapapa,23 and sent him falling head over heels like a spaceman trailing his severed lifeline through a dark and hostile universe to oblivion. This was how it was done to all gay men and women. But if we were lucky, oh if we were lucky, someone remembered who we were. Someone stopped us from becoming invisible. Expunged from memory. Deleted from the text. (322) Sam's experience here stands in for that of other gay Maoris. The implication, first presented in Michael's speech before the In digenous conference assembly, is that gay 23 Whakapapa: Genealogy, family history. 192Maoris have existed throughout Maori hist ory but that their existence has been continually denied. When he in itially comes out, for example, Michael is told that there has never been anyone like him in their family. Only his aunt's decision to honor her brother's memory reveals to Mich ael that this is a lie: there has been someone like him in their family, his uncle Sam. The novel de monstrates\u2014with recourse not only to international Indigenous communities but also to specific stories fr om Maori history and legend\u2014that acceptance and celebration of ga y Maori history are possible without abandoning Maori traditions, as long as there are people like Lilly who are willing to make and accept changes. The new ideas Michael brings back from the Canadian conference challenge his iwi's traditions; as they challenge the culture, they also strengthen it, ensuring its continued vitality. The new ideas are absorbed into Maori traditions and in the process, they are \"Maorified,\" becoming Maori rath er than foreign. Thus Ihimaera makes the point that, like all cultures, Maori culture is still developing and changing. While such cultural dynamism seems a commonsense notion, Indigenous cultures are often viewed as timeless and unchanging, and some Indigenous activists have embraced this stereotype in their fight against perceived \"outside\" forces like homosexuality or feminism. The gay iwi, and the cultural challenges it represents , assert the mutability of culture and the importance of an acceptance that goes beyond mere tolerance. It also serves as an illustration of the force of history and transnationalism in Indigenous cultures and in Indigenous literatures. 193CONCLUSION When I first planned this projec t, I had four chapters in mi nd. The first three are the ones present here: one on Canadian Cherokee author Thomas King, one on U.S. Pueblo author Leslie Marmon Silko, and one on Maori aut hor Witi Ihimaera, from Aotearoa New Zealand. The planned fourth chapter was to focus on Aboriginal Australian writing, in particular the poetry of Lionel Fogarty. Fogarty's work is bo th lyrical and radical, and reaches out to a range of colonized an d oppressed groups, including Indigenous groups and African Americans. In fact , the African American civil ri ghts movement is frequently referred to not only in Fogarty's work but in that of other Aborigin al Australian writers, where it often is framed as an inspiration for their ow n struggle. Why the African American civil rights movement played such a relatively large role in the imagination of Indigenous Australians, far larger than in Ma ori or Indigenous American writings, is an interesting question, and one I in tended to explore further in the planned fourth chapter. However, since finishing the first three chapters, I have realized that my plans for the fourth chapter reflect a limitation in my conception of Indigenous internationalism. Internationalism in an Indigenous co ntext is not defined by the boundaries of nation-states. Nevertheless, the chapters I have written are organized not just according to the Indigenous nation to which the authors belong, but also ac cording to the nation-states within whose boundaries the auth ors live. Implicit in this or ganization is the notion that nation-states are more significant in defini ng identity than tribal nations. While that implication is by no means intentional, it does serve to illustrate the depth of colonial 194narratives that devalue tribal sovereignty and which consider Indigenous nations to be, in the words of the U.S. Supreme Court in Worcester v. Georgia , \"domestic dependent nations.\" As I now recognize the unspoken implicat ion of my selection of authors, incorporating another nation-st ate into this project would only reinforce the unintentional focus on the nation-state. Therefore, rather than looking at Lionel Fogarty, it would be valuable for the project as a whole to exam ine writings by Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) authors, in particular Gerald Vizenor , Louise Erdrich, and Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm, as well as a historical component addressi ng the work of George Copway. As Akiwenzie-Damm is also the editor of skins , the first anthology of Indigenous writing to describe itself as consciously international, this chapter would also addre ss the subject of anthologies, which represent a literary demonstration of cross-cultural, international contacts. The Anishinaabe have a long tradition of travel and migration. Traditional stories say that the origins of the Anishinaabe are in the Great Lakes area, where their communities are currently located, but these stories also say that the people were forced to leave their homeland a long time ago because they angered the Creator. The Anishinaabe migrated eastward all the way to th e shores of the Atlant ic, where they lived for some time. Many years later, a sacred miigis shell appeared to lead them back to the land of their origin; a prophet told the people that they would know they had arrived in their homeland because it was the place wher e food grew on water\u2014a reference to wild rice. The traditional story tells of a migration that lasts a long time; the community stopped in numerous places, as they were told to do by the miigis , and while many of 195these places are outside of the boundaries of contemporary Anishinaabe communities, they remain significant today. Anishinaabe authors were also among the earliest Indigenous people of the Americas to travel to Europe and publish a bout their travel expe riences. In 1851, George Copway published Running Sketches of Men and Pla ces in England, France, Germany, Belgium and Scotland, which describes his travels to and in Europe. Copway was born in 1818 in Canada as Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh. At ag e 16, Copway joined missionaries to learn to spread the gospel to the Ojibwe, and in 1838 - the year of the Ch erokee Trail of Tears - began his formal education at a missionary school in Illinois. Ten years later, he published his first and most well known book, The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge- ga-gah-bowh (George Copway), a Young Indian Chief of the Ojebwa Nation, . . . A Sketch of the Present State of the Ojebwa Nation, in Regard to Christianity and Their Future Prospects . Copway's belief in the importance of Christianity and education for Native Americans assured him an attentive and sympathetic audience for each of the three editions that was published (two in the US and one in Britain). Copway's personal identific ation was complex, as he belonged to three different nations: the U.S., Canada, and the Anishinaabe nation. His travel narra tive, in particular, evokes how his national identities shift. Fo r example, in describing his feelings upon leaving America, Copway several times invoke s his love for his \"native land.\" On the first page of the narrative, he tells us, The fact of leaving my native land seems now a reality. The suggestions which were then made as a means of preparation, have been attended to - 196and now I am going to a country where the people will be strangers to me, and whose language will be different from mine - whose habits and manners will be altogether their own. Copway's invocation of \"native land\" is a complex one that resonates with the multiple identities contained in his multiple name s\u2014George Copway and Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh\u2014 and in his multiple citizenships. Before he leaves Boston Harbor he makes it clear that \"native land\" means the land of the Anishinaabe; Boston and New York, for example, where he stays en route to Europe, are expl icitly not his native la nd. Upon hearing of the death of U.S. President Taylor, Copway writes, [Hearing a commotion outside,] I co uld distinguish the following sad sentences, 'The president is dead! He died last evening.' Then General Zachariah Taylor is no more! and we sh all take to Europe the news of his death. My only wish on hearing of th is event was for his safety; and I hoped the Great Spirit had forgiven hi m for killing so many of the red men of my country.\" (13) Copway clearly uses the terms my country in opposition to Taylo r's country. Implicit, though never explicit, is Copway's identifica tion with the \"red men's\" country and not with the United States. It is also worth no ting that in identifying the \"red man\" as his people, rather than just the Anishinaabe, he may be gesturing toward pan-tribalism. Once he has left the shores of the U.S., however, Copway's affiliation shifts dramatically. The passage where he loses sight of the American land itself is fascinating, and worth quoting at length: 197The last thing I could see in the distance was the Bunker Hill Monument, which appeared to tower over all the surrounding country. This column was reared in commemoration of a ba ttle, and in honor of men who fought bravely for their firesides, while they expelled the red man from his native soil. The day I hope is not far distant when the cause of Humanity will be blessed with the men who will change this spirit of hero-worship into adoration for everything noble and elev ating. Then shall columns devoted to the Prince of Peace arise one after another to the clouds, which shall be like beacon lights in the highway of Progress for the generations yet to come. The rocky Islands loomed far off in our view, and soon nothing but the dark outline of the land could be seen - and still I gazed and gazed, and when it had become concealed from sight, I could with a heart full of affection for my native land, say - \"America, America! Heaven's blessing attend her! While we live we will cherish, and love, and defend her. Tho' the scorner may sneer at, and witlings defame her, Our hearts swell with gladness whenever we name her.\" 16-17 (There are other such poems elsewhere in th e book, and in the context of the whole it is clear that the sentiments expressed here ar e not meant ironically.) While Boston is in view, Copway is reminded constantly of th e injustice done to his people by the United States. Only when the country fades out of view completely is it possible for him to 198idealize it and to wax roman tic not about the hills and valleys of his childhood in Anishinaabe territory (as he does earlier in the book), but about America. Only when it is not visible, when it is relegate d to the realm of ideals, does C opway feel he belongs to the U.S. Copway thus belongs to an idealized America, but he does not belong in the real America. As he travels through Europe, he frequen tly implies that Europeans lack manners, suggesting that the French and English are less civilized than he is, though he is careful not to say such a thing outright. He prefers to use irony and sarcasm to make his point, as when he describes his reaction to being give n a letter to be opened only when he is halfway across the Atlantic. I have had my curiosity excited to know what was in it, for an Indian has some curiosity, though he does not show it by opening his eyes and mouth unmercifully, as refined and polite nations do, who have more manners than the red man. (32) The sarcasm here is hardly veiled, but is couched in Copway's typical disingenuous description of his own lack of civilization. The book is full of such moments, Copw ay noting with practiced astonishment the odd behaviors of the supposedly more ci vilized peoples. Of the German hills he passes, he notes that \"Tales and Legends are told at each crevice of the rocks. Wonders and displays of miraculous pow er, and a great deal of superstition, much more than the North American Indian ever had\" (201). Copw ay is dismantling the myth of European superiority. He is not trying to suggest that the Europeans ar e uncivilized savages, as the 199negative qualities he mentions tend to be ba lanced by the positive attributes he also ascribes to the people and countries he visits. Neverthele ss, he has a keen eye for hypocrisy and falsehood, and it is cl ear that he finds the belief in European superiority to be both. Moreover, by his refusal to be so impolite as to say so directly, he appears to take the high road, while nevertheless demonstra ting the truth as he s ees it to his readers. Indians, the readers learn from this unique travel narrative, are no more and no less civilized than Germans, Belgians, or the Engl ish - and as his target audience was not his fellow Indians, but Europeans and Euroamericans, they probably benefited from the reminder. In the end, Copway insists on the equality of Indians to the other nations he visits, and this equality also means the right to self-determination for Indian peoples. Copway hopes for a separate Indian state on the West ern border of the U.S., and part of his European journey involves raising funds to purchase land for the creat ion of this state. But even without such politic al self-determination, Copway demonstrates the value and importance of Anishinaabe culture in his own life. He emphasizes the importance of missionaries and trade schools to teach Native Americans the values of white society, but he also insists that these teachings are act ually in keeping with Native traditions\u2014one need not supplant the other. At a time when the choice many saw for Indians was to assimilate or perish, Copway was suggesting a third way: to maintain traditional culture and learn more from the whites. 200He illustrates this possibility by quoting a letter to his father, which he quite naturally has written in Anishinaabe. Incl uding the Anishinaabe text in the book, he suddenly breaks off after two senten ces and notes in parentheses, (I had better not write this letter in Indian, on the pages of this book, for fear some one will come on me for damages for the breaking of his jaw while trying to speak the words.) (39-40) He then offers the \"interpretation\" - he does not say translation - of these two sentences. This insertion of the Anishinaabe text is a re markable moment of insistence to his white readership that, even though he is mission- school educated and has traveled across Europe and America, he is still very much part of an Anishinaabe world. Moreover, the text is a reminder to white readers that his wo rld is one to which they have access to only when he chooses to in terpret it for them. As Copway travels through the various te rritories of his colonial experience, his resolute and constant identification of hi mself as Anishinaabe first and foremost represents a clear challenge to assimilationi st politics. Intrigui ngly, however, Copway was not a proponent of Anishinaabe sovereignt y; rather, he supporte d the creation of a tribal nation on the West Coast, to which Indians of all tribes would be moved. This proposal was largely a pragmatic one, as Copway recognized that Native peoples were being driven off their lands by increasing num bers of white settlers. But it may also reflect the prominence of communal migration in traditional Anishinaabe stories, as well as an early pantribal orientation. 201 Turning to more contemporary writers, mixedblood Anishinaabe author Gerald Vizenor often invokes the power and importa nce of travel as well as motion more generally. Vizenor views himself as a trickster, and identifies the tr ickster with fluidity rather than fixedness. The trickster, in his ab ility to challenge assumptions and remain in motion, never the same, can be a fundament al challenge to co lonial, categorizing discourse. \"Terminal creeds\" is Vizenor's term for static belief systems that do not allow for motion or change, and which rely on an abil ity to place people in fixed categories. Colonialism in particular is a terminal creed, for it relies on an \"order\" that it imposes on the world. In Vizenor's view, trickster disc ourse inherently resists these \"terminal creeds,\" for the trickster is a vagabond and is constantly in motion. In a discussion with Dr. Jacquelyn Kilpatrick, Vizenor explains, A trickster is not a person, it's a l iterary figure, a character of the imagination, not a real person. ... A tric kster is not a representation and it can't be defined structurally or cau sally. It can't be known. I'm convinced that anything that becomes eas ily defined, and whose causes are established in some interesting a nd convincing way...that it's lucid or knowable - will instantly be commercialized and become the mundane. The trickster resists definition, and is constan tly in flux; motion and mobility is central to the trickster, and to Vizenor's texts as a whole. Travel, too, plays an important part in Vizenor's work; his first novel, the Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles (first published as Darkness in St. Louis Bearheart 202in 1978), involves characters j ourneying from the northern U. S. to New Mexico. In the postapocalyptic narrative, people su rvive in part through the tell ing of stories, and travel is vital in finding new stories: Oral traditions were honored. Families welcomed the good tellers of stories... The listeners traveled with the tellers through the frames of time and place. The telling was in the listening. (162) Moreover, the novel's chaotic setting, in which the U.S. government has collapsed in part due to its abuse and over-use of natural reso urces, would make an interesting comparison with Almanac of the Dead . Vizenor's novel Griever: An America Monkey King in China (1990) features a Native Amer ican protagonist living in China, and is an extended meditation on the similarities that connect the Anishinaabe trickster tradition with Chinese stories of the Monkey King. Meanwhile, Heirs of Columbus (1991) hinges on the notion that tribal people from the Americas voyaged to Europe before Columbus\u2014 and that Columbus himself is a Mayan trav eler who, rather than \"discovering\" the Americas, is returning home. Vizenor in particular is also wary of pantribalism, as he believes it often subscribes to the romantic notion of the stereo typical Indian that has no basis in reality. In Fugitive Poses , Vizenor critiques Native writers a nd activists who buy into and support the dominant discursive formation of the Indian, those he refers to as the \"indian kitschymen\" (39). Those who rely not on tribal id entities but on a pantribal identity that is an invention of colonialism are parodied in a story in his episodic novel Trickster of Liberty: Tribal Heirs to a Wild Baronage (1988). 203De Fountain was an urban pantribal radical and dealer in cocaine. His tribal career unfolded in prison, wher e he studied tribal philosophies and blossomed when he was paroled in braids and a bone choker. He bore a dark cultural frown, posed as a new co lonial victim and l earned his racial diatribes in church basements. The r ace to represent the poor started with loose money and ran down to th e end with loose power. (111) Vizenor nonetheless has sympathy for the \"urban pantribal radical,\" and once idolized Dennis Banks, one of the founders of the American Indian Movement. In the essay \"Confrontation Heroes\" in Tribal Scenes and Ceremonies , Vizenor offers a compelling and problematizing description of the transf ormation of the business-suited Dennis Banks to the choker-wearing Indian warrior Dennis Banks. But overall, in his depictions of the pantribal, internationalist activists of the Am erican Indian Movement, Vizenor is wary of the \"terminal creeds\" they represent, the static, unchanging Indi an they choose to represent. Vizenor's caution vis-\u00e0-vis the potential pitfalls of a pantribal or internationalist Indian identity offers a reminder that, in order to effectively counter colonialist narratives, Indigenous internationa lism must be rooted in a firm local center, and must critically engage stereotypical views of Indigenous people (which, as Silko demonstrates, are not the exclusive provenance of non-Nativ es). Vizenor's use of stories and oral storytelling techniques further emphasizes th e importance of mobility and travel in traditional Anishinaabe culture as well as their ongoing significance today. 204 Finally, looking far into the future, th is project will lay the groundwork for a book about with Native American travel narratives and their place within the field of Native American literature and the travel writing ge nre. By narrowing the focus to individual travel narratives, I will be able to explore how these memoirs of travel challenge the conventions of the travel na rrative and how their inclusion in the canon can broaden the scope of Indigenous literature. The experien ces of Native authors as they move away from and, in many cases, back toward their home can illuminate not only the importance of mobility and travel, but of place and home : exploring routes to understand roots. 205WORKS CITED Adamson, Joni.
