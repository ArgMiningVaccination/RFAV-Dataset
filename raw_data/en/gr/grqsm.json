PARMET* In the spring of 2009, a new strain of type A influenza (H1N1) arrived triggering the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century.1 With the initial discovery of the virus, scientists began working on developing a vaccine, the intervention widely believed to offe r the greatest protection against an influenza pandemic.2 Shortly thereafter, federal health officials utilized a series of legal tools that had been put into place in the years prior to the pandemic to facilitate the rapid develo pment and distribution of a vaccine. 3 By many measures, the use of these tools was a great success. By the end of 2009, approximately 61 million Americans had been vaccinated against H1N1; by January 2010, over 124 million doses of vaccine had been distributed in the U.S. 4 Although vaccination rates varied widely by state, in most states vaccination rates for childre n, a group at high risk for severe disease from H1N1, were higher than their prior rates for seasonal flu vaccination.5 Perhaps more importantly, the Vaccine Adverse Event * George J. and Kathleen Waters Matthews Di stinguished Professor of Law, Northeastern University. 1. A dispute exists as to whether the H1N1 outbreak should be described as a pandemic. In May 2009, WHO changed its definition of a pandemic so as to exclude any consideration of the seve rity of a disease. See Deborah Cohen & Philip Carter, WHO and the Pandemic Flu \"Conspiracies ,\" 340 B RIT. MED. J. 1274, 1275 (2010). Despite this debate, the H1N1 outbreak will be termed a pandemic throughout this article. 2.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 114 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 Reporting System (VAERS) uncovered no \"unusual events or pattern of adverse events,\" different from that wh ich is seen for seasonal flu vaccine.6 By other measures, however, the campaign appeared less successful. Despite scientists' best efforts, the vac cine took longer than anticipated to produce and was in woefully short supply during the height of the pandemic.7 As a result, many children and adults at high risk for severe disease were unable to obtain a vaccine when they most needed it, in the early fall of 2009.8 Yet, by late fall and early winter, as supplies became more plentiful, the public's fear s of the disease abated and were increasingly replaced by concerns about the vaccine's safety.9 Critics also charged that the pandemic had been hy ped by health officials to provide profits for vaccine makers.10 By the winter of 2010, over sixty million doses of vaccine were unused; many we re destined to be destroyed.11 What role did law play in both the successes and the shortfalls of the H1N1 vaccine campaign? What lessons can be learned to guide future efforts to use law to protect the publ ic from pandemic flu? This article explores those questions, focusing on public health emergency laws' impact on the H1N1 vaccine program and the interaction of those laws with the current populist stance in American political culture. 12 Populism, a recurring riff in American history, is a political attitude most pointedly characterized by a profound distrust of elites.13 As such, it represents a significant challenge 6.

Political scientists and political historians have offered many definitions of populism. Michael Kazin, in his history of American populism, writes that the most \"telling definition of SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 115 to public health officials and policymak ers, who are almost always elites, or are at least widely perceived as such , in their attempt to respond to a pandemic. In particular, populism poses a dilemma for public health professionals who seek to protect pu blic health via vaccination because populism builds upon and exacerbates distru st of health officials' assertions about the need for vaccination and its sa fety. At the same time, the public's distrust of vaccines may spur officials to act even more forcefully than they otherwise would. In either case, law may bridge or widen the divide between public health officials and th e populations they are charged with protecting. Part One begins by providing a brie f review of influenza pandemics and recent efforts to prepare for one. The section then describes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine campaign within the U. S. Part Two examines why vaccines are critical to pandemic preparedness and considers the challenges policymakers face in securing both an adequate supply and a robust demand for pandemic vaccines. Part Three reviews the legal responses that have been put in place over the last thirty years to address supply side problems. Part Four turns to the demand side of the equation, reviewing the legal responses that public health of ficials have employed to address the public's reluctance to be vaccinated. B o t h P a r t F i v e a n d t h e C o n c l u s i o n assess the relationship between the legal responses to supply and demand problems, and suggest that the laws that have been enacted to facilitate the development and distribution of pandemic vaccines may heighten the public's distrust of public health offi cials. If so, these laws may fail to achieve their goal of protecting the public from a pandemic. P ART ONE: A PANDEMIC PREDICTED For more than five years, the specter of pandemic influenza has hovered over U.S. and world public health policy.14 In the past one hundred years, there have been three major influenza pandemics, none more lethal than the misnamed 1918 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic. 15 That pandemic, which populism\" is a \"language whose speakers conceive of ordinary people as a noble assemblage not bounded narrowly by class, view their elit e opponents as self-serving and undemocratic, and seek to mobilize the former against the latter.\" M ICHAEL KAZIN, THE POPULIST PERSUASION : AN AMERICAN HISTORY 1 (Cornell University 1998) (1995). 14.

In the 1990s, in response to a plethora of new infectious diseases, as well as broader social developments,25 scientists, health officials, and the media increasingly focused their atte ntion on the dangers of so-called emerging diseases.26 As fear of contagion took hold,27 scientists were quick to warn that no disease has ever proven more lethal than the 1918 influenza and that there was no reas on to assume that such a horrific pandemic could not happen again.28 That prophecy seemed prescient in 1997, when several young, previously healthy people died in Hong Kong from a new strain of avian influenza, known as H5N1.29 Fortunately, Hong Kong was able to quash the outbreak by slaughtering its chickens.30 But the virus did not vanish with the chickens; in the years that followed, H5N1 spread around the globe. By 2005, the virus had infected birds in sixteen countries and over 120 people.31 Although the virus was not easily transmissible among humans (almost everyone who became ill had been in close contact with infected birds), it had a high (approximately fifty percent) 24.

Vaccination is the most important element of this strategy, but we acknowledge that a two-pronged strategy incorporating both vaccines and antivirals is essential. 36 More specifically, the Strategy called for enhancing domestic production of influenza vaccination so that the en tire population could be vaccinated within six months of the start of a pandemic, stockpiling sufficient pre- pandemic avian influenza vaccine to immediately vaccinate \"front-line personnel and at risk populations including military personnel,\" developing distribution plans, and eradicating \"r egulatory and other legal barriers to the expansion of our domestic vaccine production capacity.\"37 The federal government's approach for meeting those goals was spelled out more explicitly in the Ho meland Security Council's 2006 Implementation Plan.38 Underlying the Implementation Plan was the assumption that pandemic influenza would initially develop overseas. The plan aimed to improve surveillance and detection of influenza around the world so that the federal government could try to contain, or at least slow down, the spread of a pandemic within the United States until such time as a vaccine would be widely available. 39 Targeted deployment of pre-pandemic vaccine and 32.

As of March 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that abo ut 12,000 people died from H1N1, 43 meaning that fewer Americans died from the H1N1 pandemic than die from so-called seasonal flu in a typical year.44 That comparison, however, may understate H1N1's impact. In contrast to seasonal flu, but as in 1918, serious illness and death were disproportionately experienced by persons under age forty-five.45 Young children and pregnant women faced especially high risks.46 In the first wave of the pandemic, between April and August 2009, five percent of all deaths from H1N1 were among pregnant women, even though pregnant women represent only one percent of the 40.

There is debate over the death toll of seasonal flu because most deaths attributed to influenza are not confirmed by laboratory analysis, and influenza resembles and may complicate many other illnesses. Estimates va ry from approximately 21,000 deaths per year in the U.S. to over 40,000 deaths per year.

In the summer of 2009, New York's Board of Health, fearing that health workers would reject vaccination, issued an emergency regulation requiring hospital workers with patient contact to be vaccinated for both seasonal and H1N1 influenza. 69 Health care workers responded by filing at least four lawsuits challenging the regulation.70 Shortly after a state trial judge issued a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of the regulation, the state rescinded it, noting the shortage of pandemic vaccine.71 This litigation was echoed in cases throughout the country brought by employees, or their unions, protesting hospital policies mandating vaccination.72 Y e t , w h i l e m a n y h e a l t h c a r e w o r k e r s f o u g h t mandatory vaccination, most people who wanted to be vaccinated could not be.

By March 2010, newspapers reported that the flu season had \"fizzled ;\" cases of flu had dwindled to fewer than those in a typical year.76 With 155 million doses of H1N1 vaccine distributed in the U.S., only 86 millio n individuals had been vaccinated, a number lower than the typical number of people who are vaccinated annually for seasonal flu. 77 Fortunately complications from the vaccine appeared to be relatively infrequent and usually mild. As of April 30, 2010, the VAERS had received reports of 11,029 adverse events followi ng the administration of the H1N1 vaccine, the vast majority of which were deemed non-serious.78 Only 7.5% of reported adverse events were serious; a percentage similar to that expected for seasonal flu vaccine. 79 Fifty-six deaths were reported and were being investigated, but preliminar y findings did not \"suggest\" any association with the vaccine.80 Was the campaign necessary?

PART TWO: INFLUENZA VACCINES - THE PROMISES AND CHALLENGES The central role accorded to vaccines in U.S. pandemic preparedness plans is not surprising. Vaccines are widely recognized as among the most effective public health interventions.81 In the event of a deadly influenza pandemic, vaccines are especially important because of the lack of adequate alternatives. Although antiviral medications may lessen influenza's impact, and when used in conjunction with isolation, reduce the number of cases of influenza in a pandemic,82 many strains of influenza are resistant to one or more antiviral medicines.83 The widespread prophylactic use of antivirals may also lead to the transmission of resistant strains reducing the drugs' efficacy for clinical cases.84 Likewise, non- pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantines, border closings, curfews, and school closings are of limited (a nd contested) utility against influenza.85 They also impose enormous social costs.86 Vaccines, in contrast, can reduce flu's transmission without ex acting widespread social disruption.87 81.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 125 Although vaccines theoretically offer our best defense to pandemic influenza, developing and administering pandemic vaccines is not easy. Both technical and social (including legal and economic) challenges complicate efforts to rely upon va ccines in the face of a pandemic. The technical problems relate both to the nature of the influenza virus and the way vaccines used to prevent it are developed. The influenza virus changes rapidly and thus far, new strains require new vaccines. 88 I n t h e case of seasonal flu, vaccine is pr epared based upon health officials' prediction of the strains that will be prevalent during the next flu season.89 That prediction is generally made in February, leaving a limited amount of time to produce vaccine for the next season.90 Production of pandemic vaccine is even more challenging because a pandemic strain is inevitably a new strain, and as H1N1 illustrate d, cannot be easily predicted. 91 A s a result, an effective pandemic vaccine cannot be developed until the pandemic virus has been detected.92 By that time, however, as was true with H1N1, the virus may already be widely dispersed around the world. Complicating the problem is the fact that influenza vaccine is grown in eggs, a time-consuming and delicate process.93 For years, scientists have eagerly anticipated the development of cell-based technologies that could eliminate the need for eggs.94 This would be especially important in the event of an avian influenza pandemic since that virus kills eggs.95 Although progress has been made in developing this technology, it was not available 88.

Smith & Gigi Kwik Gronvall, Influenza Vaccine Production for the U.S. Market , 7 B IOSECURITY & BIOTERRORISM : BIODEFENSE STRATEGY , PRAC. & SCI. 259, 259-60 (2009). Scientists hope to develop a vaccine that will work for all strains of influenza. See id. at 261-62.

For a variety of reasons, including extensive regulatory requirements, the labor-inte nsive nature of vaccine production, and the fact that vaccines are not given to individuals daily (as are many of the most profitable medications), vaccine s are costly to develop and provide relatively low profits to their manufacturers.98 As discussed below, manufacturers also claim that the risk of legal liability undermines vaccines' profitability.99 Regardless of whether these risks are as great as manufacturers contend, there is little doubt that in the late twentieth century manufacturing capacity in the U.S. dec lined precipitously. In 1967, twenty- six companies produced vaccines in th e U.S.; by 2005, only five companies did so. 100 In 2008, there was only one domestic manufacturer of influenza vaccine.101 The dangers of this meager supply became evident in 2004, when one of two manufacturers licensed to produce influenza vaccine for the U.S. market had to limit production due to contamination in a plant in Great Britain.102 The result was a significant shortage of flu vaccine during the fall flu season.103 As will be discussed below, many of the legal changes initiated as part of pandemic planni ng focused on solving these \"supply side\" problems.

Despite their proven efficacy - indeed, perhaps in part because of their effectiveness104 - vaccines have always been the subject of heated controversy.105 Ever since Edward Jenner demo nstrated the efficacy of the smallpox vaccine in 1798, vaccination has ignited virulent opposition.106 Many so-called anti-vaccinationists have religious objections to vaccination; others simply believe that vaccine s are unnatural and/or dangerous, especially to children.107 This distrust of vaccines and, indirectly, the health officials who recommend them, is wide ly evident on the many Internet websites that stress both the hazards of vaccines (including their alleged link to autism) and the supposedly impure financial incentives of vaccine manufacturers.108 Although overall vaccination rates for American children remain high,109 researchers have noted the growth in ardency, if not in numbers, of this anti-vaccinationist movement.110 Not surprisingly, the public's unease, or just disinterest, in vaccines affects the supply. With the 104. This is especially the case with childhood vaccines. As vaccines have helped make once-feared childhood diseases less common, many parents have come to believe that vaccines pose a greater risk to their child than the diseases the vaccines prevent.

It is not surprising that this skep ticism or distrust of vaccines was prevalent during the H1N1 epidemic which struck during a period in which Americans questioned not only the comp etency but also the intentions of many institutions, including large corporations and the federal government.112 According to a review of several polls taken during the fall H1N1 pandemic, only about half of all Americans stated that they expected to be vaccinated.113 Concern about the safety of the vaccine was the most common reason cited by those who expected to decline vaccination for either themselves or their children.114 Critics went further and questioned whether public health organizations, including CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO), pushed vaccination in order to secure revenue for vaccine makers.115 In response, WHO announced an investigation into its handling of the pandemic.116 The coupling of supply side shortages with the public's disquiet, and even among some, zealous opposition, to vaccination presents policymakers with a difficult dilemma: how can they speed up and increase the supply of vaccine during a pandemic while ensuring that the public will accept the vaccine when it is offered? In other words, can public health officials err on the side of precaution when it comes to pandemic vaccines without undermining the public's support for vaccination? Section Three looks at the legal strategies that have been em ployed to address these issues on the supply side. Section Four looks at th e tools that have been used or contemplated to resolve the problem on the demand side.

Federal Investment and Regulatory \"Reform\" Believing that quick and widespread av ailability of vaccines is critical to combating a pandemic, the federal go vernment has pursued a number of legal strategies to increase the supply of vaccine.117 Perhaps the least controversial policy has been the inject ion of federal money directly into vaccine development and sales.118 As noted above, vaccines are not an especially profitable enterprise for pharmaceutical companies; they are expensive to produce and are used with less regularity than most \"blockbuster\" drugs. 119 These problems are exacerbated in the case of vaccines for diseases that primarily affect the developing world,120 as well as in the case of pandemics that may or may not occur. As a result, private companies, operating without governme nt support, are apt to invest less than optimal amounts (from a public health perspective) in vaccine research and development. Assuming that the private market does not support what health officials believe to be an adequate investment in vaccines, 121 the federal government invests heavily in vaccine development.122 It also acts as a large purchaser of vaccines, helping to ensure a st eady demand. For example, the 1993 Vaccines for Children Program provides federally purchased vaccines to 117. Efforts to increase the supply of vaccine have primarily come from the federal government; hence this section focuses on federa l laws and policies. In contrast, efforts to compel vaccination have originated in both th e federal and state arenas. Thus Section Four, which looks at demand side laws, considers both federal and state legal issues. 118.

Most vaccines are partial public goods; they benefit not only those who are vaccinated but others. For this reason alone, it is unlikely that private investment alone can achieve an efficient and adequate allocation of vaccines. See F INANCING VACCINES , supra note 98, at 41, 43. 122. After 2001 and prior to 2005's focus on pandemic planning, the federal government enhanced its investment in vaccines and other bioterrorist \"countermeasures.\" See, e.g ., Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-188, 116 Stat. 594 (2002); Project Bioshield Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-276, 118 Stat. 835 (2004) [hereinafter Project Bioshield]. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 130 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 millions of children.123 As a result, as of 2004, the federal government purchased between fifty-two percent and fifty-five percent of all childhood vaccines, helping to make vaccines wi dely available to children while also ensuring a market for producers.124 The federal government has employed a similar mix of investment and purchasing programs to secure pandemic vaccine. In 2005, Congress allocated $3.3 billion to DHHS for pand emic planning, including vaccine development and stockpiling. 125 By December 2006, DHHS had obligated $1.3 billion on vaccine-related activities.126 This money was spent primarily on supporting vaccine development and procuring pre-pandemic vaccines for the national stockpile.127 In 2009, in response to the H1N1 pandemic, the federal government purchased the H1N1 vaccine, helping to ensure that manufacturers would produce it. 128 Congress has also sought to address supply problems by easing what producers cite as regulatory burdens on the manufacture of pandemic vaccines. In 2004, Project BioShield Act amended the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 129 to permit the Secretary of DHHS, after declaring a public health emergency, to authorize the emergency use of drugs, medical devices, and biological products (inclu ding vaccines) that have not yet been licensed or approved for use, or have not been licensed or approved for a 123. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396s (2006).

The government's large presence in the vaccine market, however, can also deter production since the government is able, as a large purchaser, to extract lower prices than would private payers.

During the H1N1 pandemic, the EUA procedure was utilized, although not for vaccines. On April 26, 2009, Secretary Sebelius issued an EUA for certain antiviral medications, personal respiratory devices, and diagnostic tests. 133 This declaration was updated numerous times.134 Commentators also speculated that an EUA would be i ssued for the vaccine, especially if it contained an adjuvant, an ingredient that can be added to a vaccine to boost its effectiveness, thereby stretching supplies.135 Ultimately the FDA licensed the H1N1 vaccine without any adjuvant, and without waiting for full clinical trials, reasoning that the vaccine was not fundamentally different than the seasonal flu vaccine.136 Nevertheless, the disc ussion of a possible EUA, and the decision to license the vaccine without full testing, may have 130. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3 (2006). 131.

Liability Protections Vaccine manufacturers and federal health policymakers have long argued that tort liability creates a barri er to an adequate supply of vaccine. The argument and the debate surrounding vaccine liability dates back to the 1950s' campaign to vaccinate children against polio when a contaminated lot of the Salk vaccine killed at least ten people and paralyzed 164. 138 In the litigation that ensued, courts began to impose strict liability on the vaccine's manufacturers.139 Then in the 1960s and 1970s, appellate courts held that vaccine makers had a duty to warn patients of a vaccine's potential dangers.140 Not surprisingly, manufacturers and the companies that insured them were not pleased. Hence, when the Ford Administration decided to vaccinate the entire population against swine flu, insurance companies refused to provide liability coverage to manufacturers. 141 Manufacturers, in turn, refused to produce or distribute vaccine unless the government removed their risk of liability.142 When an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease was initially (incorrectly) feared to be the swine flu that was detected at Fort Dix, Congress capitulated to manufact urers' demands, relieving them of liability by creating an exclusive re medy against the United States for personal injuries and death caused by the vaccine.143 A s a r e s u l t , w h e n cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome aros e among those who were vaccinated, federal taxpayers, not manufacturers or insurers, were left to bear the cost. 144 The 1976 program set a precedent and taught a lesson. The precedent was that vaccine manufacturers would demand and receive liability protection in order to maintain an adequate supply of vaccine. 145 The 137.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 133 lesson was that the government's assumption of liability created significant costs for the federal treasury. In response, since 1976, Congress has consistently coupled liability protection for vaccine makers with limitations on compensation for injured parties.146 For the most part, this coupling has occurred in the context of limited no-fault compensation schemes that, at least theoretically, provide faster and more efficient (if less generous) relief to injured parties. In other words, the schemes provide some benefits to both injured individuals and the federal government.147 For example, the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)148 requires plaintiffs seeking more than $1,000 in damages for injuries related to covered vaccines to file their claim initially before the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).149 Under this program, claimants who suffer from so-called \"table injuries,\"150 injuries that are widely recognized as clearly associated with vaccines an d are listed on an approved table, can receive compensation relatively quickly, without needing to prove causation. 151 Recovery, however, is limited to economic damages plus $250,000 for pain and suffering or death.152 For so-called \"non-table\" injuries, claimants can file a claim be fore a special master of the Federal Court of Claims (the so-called Vaccine Court) and try to prove that the vaccine caused the injury.153 In contrast to the 1976 swine flu program, compensation for claims paid under NCVIA is financed by a special excise tax on vaccines. 154 Importantly, while NCVIA creates significant barriers and disincentives to bringing a civil lawsuit, it does not preclude aggrieved individuals from having their day in cour t. Parties who receive no award, or are dissatisfied with their award from the Vaccine Court, can seek review from the Federal Court of Claims and then the Federal Circuit.155 Claimants can also eventually bring a civ il case in state or federal court, but actions are barred for injuries that were \"unavoidable\" or for a vaccine 146.

In 2009, in Bruesewitz v.

Despite its limitations, NCVIA is more generous to claimants than subsequent statutes limiting the liability of vaccine producers.165 For example, Section 302 of the Homeland Security Act,166 enacted in 2002, created an exclusive remedy against the Un ited States for injuries caused by the smallpox vaccine following a declaration by the Secretary of Homeland Security.167 However, the scope of Sect ion 302's liability protection and compensation provisions were unclear.168 I n c o n t r a s t t o N C V I A , S e c t i o n 302 did not provide no-fault compensation for those who were injured; rather claimants had to demonstrate th at the manufacturer or other covered entity had been negligent.169 Given the relatively high rate of adverse events associated with the smallpox vacc ine, and the fact that there were no naturally-occurring cases of smallpox, Section 302's failure to provide clear and adequate compensation is thought to have deterred many health care workers and others from participatin g in the Bush Administration's 2002- 2003 smallpox vaccine campaign.170 In the spring of 2003, Congress responded to Section 302's limitations by enacting the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 46 (Fed. Cl. 2009). In at least one case, however, the federal government entered into a settlement with parents of child who had a rare mitochondrial defect and claimed that a vaccine, in conjunction with her defect, led to autism-like injuries.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 137 The statute that Congress then quic kly passed provides remarkably broad immunity to the manufacturers and di stributors of vaccines and other so- called countermeasures whenever the Secretary of HHS \"makes a determination that a disease or other health condition or other threat to health constitutes a public health emergency, or that there is a credible risk that the disease, condition, or threat may in the future constitute such an emergency.\" 182 Importantly, the statute does not define the terms \"public health emergency\" or \"credible risk.\"183 As a result, almost any potential threat could provide the basis for a PREPA declaration.184 M o r e o v e r , the Secretary's decision to issue a de claration under PREPA is totally unreviewable185 and the declaration can last for as long as the Secretary specifies.186 Hence, the Secretary theore tically can issue a declaration stating that cancer constitutes a pu blic health emergency warranting the Act's protection for the manufacturer s of all cancer medications for an indefinite period of time. Once a PREPA declaration is i ssued, all civil litigation against manufacturers and administrators of a covered vaccine, or other covered countermeasure, is barred, except in cases of \"willful misconduct.\"187 I n addition, PREPA includes several bro ad defenses available if a willful misconduct claim is brought.188 For example, the Act states that an act or omission by a manufacturer that is su bject to regulation by FDA shall not constitute willful misconduct if neither the Secretary of DHHS, nor the Attorney General, has initiated an enforcement action with respect to such act or omission.189 Following the pattern of previous vaccine-liability acts, PREPA also established, but did not fund, a no-fault compensation scheme to be administered by HRSA.190 The Act incorporates SEPPA's compensation 182. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6d(b) (2006). 183. See id. at \u00a7 247d-6d. 184. The statute does provide factors to be considered in issuing a declaration.

At the start of the H1N1 outbreak, on June 15, 2009, the Secretary of DHHS invoked PREPA to extend the protections previo usly provided to the producers and administrators of the H5N1 vaccine to those who made or administered the H1N1 vaccine. 195 Shortly thereafter, on June 24, President Obama signed a supplemental appropriations act that allocated $7.65 billion to DHHS for the H1N1 pandemic and authorized the transfer of funds to PREPA's compensation program. 196 However, as of May 2010, HRSA had yet to finalize regulations governing the claims process.197 Thus, more than one year after the onset of the pandemic, and more than ten months after the vaccines were licensed, claimants with significant injuries could file a notice 191.

If a pandemic is severe enough, or if populations perceive it as very dangerous, acceptance of a vaccine is not apt to be a problem. People will line up willingly, if not desperately, for a vaccine if they are sufficiently frightened of the disease it prevents. Moreover, because a pandemic vaccine will almost invariably be in short supply at the beginning of a pandemic, the most significant problem policymakers usually face at the start of a pandemic is not a shortage of demand, but of supply. 201 For this reason, public health policymakers and scholars have focused much of their preparedness efforts on develo ping plans for rationing pandemic vaccine. 202 198. However, an injured individual can bring a claim in federal court, subject to PREPA's many defenses and limitations, if he or she can show \"willful misconduct.\" See text accompanying notes 187-89, supra. 199. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6d(d) (2006). See also note 197, supra. 200. Of course, as noted above, the supply of vaccine will almost always be insufficient during the early months of a pandemic. See text accompanying notes 88-100, supra . Because of the shortage in the early fall of 2009, CDC released vaccine to state health authorities, recommending that priority be given to certain high risk groups, including health care workers, pregnant women, an d children with chronic diseases. See Press Release, CDC Advisors Make Recommendations for Use of Vaccine Against Novel H1N1 , C TRS.

For example, in 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee provided recommendations to HHS on how to prioritize vaccine distribution during an influenza pandemic. Those recommendations listed vaccine and antiviral manufacturers, as well as he alth care workers, within the highest tier (i.e. the group to first receive vaccine). Government leaders also appeared high on the list, while healthy individuals betwee n the ages of two and sixty-four, who were not in another category by virtue of their occupation, we re at the bottom of the list. See U.S. DEP'T OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS., HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan D-10 tbl.1 (2005) [hereinafter Pandemic Influenza Plan ], available at http://www.hhs.gov/pandemicflu/plan/pdf/AppD.pdf. Nevertheless, during the H1 N1 outbreak, that plan turned out to be of limited utility, since the groups most affected by the viru s (especially children) were no t those who had been expected to be at greatest risk. Hence in July 2009, the ACIP recommended that the H1N1 vaccine be initially given to pregnant women, caregivers of young children, people between six months and twenty-four years of age, and adults younger than twenty-four with chronic health problems, who were not prioritized in earlier pandemic plans. Press Release, CDC Advisors SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 140 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 Although shortages of vaccine are likely at the start of a pandemic, public health emergency plans have also focused on using law to mandate vaccination of individuals who choose not to be vaccinated.203 The use of law to compel vaccination is not new. Since the 19th century, public health officials have employed both law and sometimes brute force to impose vaccination on the unwilling.204 The use of law to penalize an individual who refuses vaccination during a public health emergency, subject to some exceptions, was famously upheld by the Supreme Court in 1905 in Jacobson v. Massachusetts .205 In 1922, in Zucht v. King, the Supreme Court cited Jacobson in upholding a state law that required children to be vaccinated in order to attend school.206 Despite this precedent, school vaccination laws were not widespread until the 1970s when the federal government urged states to enact them. 207 In the fall of 2001, in the aftermath of the 9/11 and anthrax attacks, the CDC asked the Centers for the Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities to draft a Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA). 208 The draft that emerged proposed granting state public health officials the authorit y to isolate individuals who refused vaccination during a public health emergency.209 Many states have since adopted this proposal.210 Make Recommendations for Use of Vaccine Against Novel H1N1 , supra note 200. This recommendation was largely (but not totally) followed by sta tes in the fall of 2009. Considerable consternation arose when the press reported that certain Wall Street firms and other businesses were able to procure vaccin e supplies for their employees, even while supplies remained short for many high risk individuals.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 141 The federal pandemic planning documents developed in 2005 and 2006 did not emphasize compulsory vacci nation, but they did hint at its possibility. For example, under th e heading of \"legal preparedness,\" DHHS's November 2005 Implementation Plan advised state and local public health agencies to \"[d]etermine whether state and local laws allow mandatory vaccination to [sic] pr otect public health, if needed.\"211 During the actual 2009 H1N1 outbreak, no jurisdictions appear to have used their public health emergenc y laws to compel population-wide vaccination.212 I n M a s s a c h u s e t t s , h o w e v e r , controversy ensued when the state legislature debated a modified version of the MSEHPA, stoking fears that the state was seeking the authority to compel vaccination.213 In New York, Health Commissioner Richard F. Daines promulgated an emergency regulation requiring hospital workers who had contact with patients to be vaccinated against both seasonal flu and H1N1.214 In contrast to standing regulations in other states, such as th ose in Massachusetts, this regulation did not permit workers to decline vaccination unless it was medically contraindicated.215 New York's regulation, which was issued before the H1N1 vaccine was available, was met wi th fear and anger by health care workers, many of whom resented the st ate's imposition on their liberty and 211.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 143 officials significant authority to dispen se with the normal rules regarding the licensing and liability of pandemic vaccine s. In many states, public health legal preparedness has prompted the ado ption of public health emergency laws, often modeled on the MSEHPA, authorizing health officials, upon the declaration of a public health emergenc y, to detain individuals who refuse to be vaccinated. Supporters justify these laws as both practical responses to the supply and demand problems afflicting pandemic vaccines and as necessary corollaries to the widely stated belief that public health protection, especially during an emergency, requir es the sacrifice of individual liberty. 225 In either case, these laws rely, to a si gnificant degree, on a relatively simple vision of the relationship between law and public health, one that assumes that laws can protect a population's health simply by granting officials power to undertake measures that are designed to prevent the spread of disease. In reality, law's relationship to public health is far more complex. Without doubt, the informed exercise of public health authorities can often improve public health.226 But in order to do so, public health laws must do more than simply empower public offici als; they need to foster a social environment that is supportive of health . To do that, public health laws need to take account of and seek to improve the public's perception of public health officials and other parties vital to the public health system, including pharmaceutical companies. In other words, in order to protect public health, laws must promote, rather than erode, the public's trust in the public health system. This can be challenging in an era, such as the current one, in which there is widespread cynici sm and distrust of both governments and large corporations. 227 It is especially important that pan demic preparedness laws inspire the public's trust.228 As a practical matter, no matter how much authority officials are granted, laws cannot ensure that individuals wash their hands, cover their mouths when they cough, or stay at home if they have flu-like symptoms. Nor can laws effectivel y compel masses to submit to a vaccination campaign or wait patiently while others at greater risk are vaccinated. All of these health-p romoting behaviors, which may be essential in the face of pandemic influe nza, require the population's trust in the public health system. If public he alth emergency laws foster that trust, 225. For a more detailed discussion, see Mariner, Annas & Parmet, supra note 204, at 354-55. 226.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 144 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 they may be able to achieve their goals. But if public health laws erode the public's trust, they risk being ineffect ive in the short-term and dangerous in the long-term as they instigate a viciou s cycle in which health officials seek greater and greater authority to impose policies on an ever-more unwilling public. Whether the vaccine laws employed during the H1N1 outbreak enhanced the public's trust in health offi cials or widened the circle of distrust is an empirical question whose answ er remains unknown. Without doubt, H1N1 vaccine was produced and disseminated to large numbers of people relatively rapidly. 229 Moreover, the vaccine appears to have been relatively safe.230 This \"success\" may have boosted the public's confidence in the public health system. Nevertheless, there are reasons to worry that the extant pandemic vaccine legal regime, which effectively reduced the risk faced by vaccine makers while simultaneously dimini shing the rights of individuals,231 might have broadened the gulf between public health officials and a wary public,232 a risk that might have been even greater if the H1N1 vaccine, like the 1976 swine flu vaccine, had been a ssociated with a large number of significant adverse effects. Rather than assuring individuals that their safety is the law's first priority, and that they will be cared for if a vaccine causes them injury, the pandemic vaccine laws that were utilized during the 2009 outbreak may have reaffirmed populist suspicions about the intentions of government, public health officials, an d vaccine makers. At the least, the laws fit comfortably within the populis t, antigovernment narrative, thereby providing, however unintentionally, suppo rt for suspicions about the actions of health officials and the safety of vaccines. Consider first the least controvers ial set of pandemic laws, those providing for government's purchase of pandemic vaccines. Given that pandemic vaccines are partial public g oods, government investment in them is probably necessary to assure an adequate supply. Without government support, manufacturers would probably cont inue to under-invest in vaccines. But by agreeing to purchase vaccines before the need for them was certain, 229. See supra text accompanying note 4. 230. See supra text accompanying notes 6, 78-80. 231. The question of whether PREPA unconstitutionally limits the rights of individuals by limiting review of the Secretary's actions, including, potentially, decisions as to individual claims, is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, the act's jurisdiction -stripping provisions clearly raise serious co nstitutional questions. For a re latively recent discussion of the perplexing and oft-discussed question abo ut Congress' power to strip the courts of jurisdiction, see Douglas E. Edlin, A Constitutional Right to Judicial Review: Access to Courts and Ouster Clauses in England and the United States , 57 A M. J. COMP. L. 67, 70-71 (2009). 232.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 145 the government effectively shifted the risk of over-production from manufacturers to the taxpayers. Indeed by investing so heavily in vaccines and antiviral medications, the government ensured what leading anti-vaccinationist Barbara Loe Fisher called a \"pharmaceutical company stockholder dream scenario\" 233 and what leading public health law scholar Lawrence O. Gostin more dispassionat ely described as a \"windfall for the pharmaceutical industry.\"234 This possible windfall inevitably prov ided fodder for vaccine critics who claimed that health authorities hyped the pandemic to support the interests of the pharmaceutical companies. The belief that the pandemic was exaggerated to benefit vaccine makers was widespread in Europe, where the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, among other entities, have investigated the close ties between members of WHO's advisory boards and pharmaceutical makers, questioning whether the interests of the latter influenced WHO's decision to declare a pandemic. 235 O f c o u r s e , a s Deborah Cohen and Phillip Carter noted in the British Medical Journal, \"[p]lanning for the worst while hoping for the best remains a sensible approach.\"236 If WHO and governments had not declared a pandemic and governments had failed to invest in va ccines, and the virus had proven more lethal, many more lives would ha ve been lost. Nevertheless, by guaranteeing that vaccine makers woul d earn substantial sums even if the outbreak proved to be mild, the federal government, like the WHO, became vulnerable to the perception that it ac ted in the interests of pharmaceutical makers, rather than the public. Other supply side laws utilized by the federal government during the pandemic may have reinforced this perception. As was noted above, the EUA procedure permits unlicensed medications and vaccines to be administered when the Secretary of DHHS declares a public health emergency.237 According to Quinn and colleagues, many members of the public had misgivings about receiving an unlicensed vaccine and the EUA procedure may diminish the public's trust in health authorities. 238 T h i s 233. Barbara Loe Fisher, supra note 10. 234. Gostin, supra note 118, at 9.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 146 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 problem is especially grave amon g populations, including African Americans, who already have high leve ls of distrust of public health authorities.239 Although the research by Quinn and colleagues did not consider whether the EUA process may also provoke distrust among people who believe there are conflicts of interest between the government and pharmaceutical companies, it seems pl ausible that such individuals would be even more troubled than others about the EUA process. In other words, individuals who believe that the risk from the pandemic was over-stated to profit vaccine makers may be especially apt to believe that the EUA process permits the use of dangerous, untested vaccines. PREPA provides even greater fuel for populist conspiracy theorists. By shielding manufacturers from virtually any liability, on the basis of an unfettered and unreviewable declaratio n of a public health emergency, 240 and by limiting review of HR SA's compensation decisions,241 the Act creates the perfect target for anti-vaccinationis ts and others who believe that unsafe pandemic vaccines were foisted upon a vulnerable public. Thus during the H1N1 outbreak, the National Vaccine Information Center, one of the best known and most active anti-vaccination ist groups, posted articles on its website emphasizing PREPA's broad liability provisions.242 For example, a September 2009 article by Barbara Loe Fisher stated: If you or your child are injured from getting a flu [sic] swine flu shot, you are on your own. Because Congress shielded the vaccine manufacturers and any person giving swine flu shots from lawsuits if people get hurt. There is no funded government vaccine injury compensation prog ram for swine flu vaccine. 243 Although this statement was mi sleading because the HRSA-run compensation program was funded by September 2009, Fisher's point was essentially correct: Congress had shielded vaccine makers from almost all liability. Moreover, the quite limited compensation program established by PREPA was not yet up and running. 244 239. See id. 240. See supra text accompanying notes 185-86. 241.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 147 Ironically, as the public's trust in vaccine diminishes, public health officials seem even more anxious to compel vaccination.245 As discussed above, compulsory vaccination laws are likely to be of little merit during a pandemic in which the most pressing problem is a shortage of vaccine, rather than the public's unwillingness to be vaccinated. 246 Nevertheless, as the anti-vaccination movement has gaine d strength, public health scholars have increasingly focused their attention on compelling vaccination.247 Of course, correlation is not causation, bu t it seems plausible to think that the renewed interest in mandatory vaccination responds in part to officials' concern that the public is growing incr easingly wary of vaccines and is ever- more-likely to reject them. 248 What is often overlooked when public health officials attempt to mandate vaccination is that compulsory immunization laws can themselves heighten the public's distrust in va ccines, thereby exacerbating the very problem the laws are designed to counter. This may especially be true when mandates are imposed rapidly, with rela tively little public debate, regarding new vaccines, to which the public has not had time to become comfortable. 249 For example, an executive order issued by Texas Governor Rick Perry in 2007 adding Gardasil, a recently-licensed human papilloma virus vaccine, to the state's list of vaccines required for entering school, 245. Likewise, the fear of frivolous litigation and the cries for immunity may well rise as the public's faith in vaccines diminish. 246. See supra text accompanying notes 200-02. 247. There have been many articles in recent years reviewing and/or advocating for the use of compulsory vaccination. See, e.g. , Lawrence O. Gostin, When Terrorism Threatens Health: How Far Are Limitations on Personal and Economic Liberties Justified? , 55 F LA. L. REV. 1105, 1151 (2003); Elizabeth Weeks Leonard, The Public's Right to Health: When Patient Rights Threaten the Commons , 86 W ASH. U.L. REV. 1335, 1390 (2009); Stewart, supra note 214. 248. There have been outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases that have been attributed, at least in part, to parents' re fusal to have their children fully vaccinated.

Feikin et al., Individual and Community Risks of Measles and Pertussis Associated with Personal Exemptions to Immunization , 284 JAMA 3145 (2000). Childhood vaccination rates for ch ildren in the United States nevertheless remain high. See ALLEN, supra note 110 . 249. School vaccine laws, which generally compel children to have well-established vaccines, and in most states include significant ex emptions, may thus be different. Although these laws have aroused controversy, they may not engender quite the same apprehension as emergency laws requiring vaccines that are perceived as new. For the argument that school vaccine laws should not be viewed as highly coercive, see Parmet, Public Health and Social Control , supra note 25, at 45. See also Gail Javitt, Deena Berkowit z & Lawrence O. Gostin, Assessing Mandatory Vaccination: Who Should Call the Shots? , 36 J.L. Med. & Ethics 384, 385 (2008).

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 148 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 created a furor among both social conservatives and libertarians.250 T h e controversy became even hotter when word came out that Gardisal's manufacturer, Merck & Company had cont ributed to Perry's political action committee.251 Responding to public outrage, the Texas legislature overrode Perry's executive order.252 Likewise, New York's attempt to compel health care workers to be vaccinated against both seasonal an d pandemic influenza ignited heated opposition.253 Without doubt, there are strong public health reasons to support the vaccination of health care workers. As New York State Health Commissioner Richard Daines stated in an open letter to health care workers, \"Medical literature convincingly demonstrates that high levels of staff immunity confer protection on those patients who cannot be or have not been effectively vaccinated, while al so allowing the institution to remain more fully staffed.\"254 However, while laws may be able to increase the vaccination rate of health care workers, Daines' emergency regulation, which required workers to accept what they viewed as a new vaccine (for which they might not be able to receive compensation if they were injured) 255 was almost destined to provoke a protest. The ensuring litigation by angry nurses and their unions was predictable. Although commentators might have been accurate in arguing th at the Constitution permits a state to penalize individuals who reject vacci nation during a health emergency,256 their assessment overlooked both the strength of the protesters' non- constitutional claims,257 and the social impact of unpopular mandates.

Public health lawyers often focus on whether a public health law is constitutional. But litigators protesting such laws are perhaps more apt to succeed by emphasizing administrative law and statutory grounds for relief. In the New York litigation, the plaintiffs argued that the emergency regulation exceeded the scope of th e Commissioner's authority and violated New York's Administrativ e Procedure Act. E.g., Petition at 14-19, Patterson v. Daines, No. 8830- 09 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Oct. 15, 2009); Petition at 14-19, Brynien v. Daines, No. 8853-09 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Oct. 16, 2009). See also New York Court Stops State From Requiring Flu Vaccinations for Health Care Workers, supra note 71, at 1414. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2010] PANDEMICS, POPULISM AND THE ROLE OF LAW 149 New York, protests by nurses contesting the emergency regulation as well as the litigation about the mandate, re ceived significant media attention.258 The impact of these stories, emphasizing health care workers' resistance to vaccination, is uncertain, but surely they did not enhance the general public's faith in the H1N1 vaccine. Ind eed, it is hard to think of an image more corrosive of the public's trust in the vaccine than that of a nurse protesting a law requiring vaccination. Ironically, the battle over New York's H1N1 vaccine regulation was for naught. Commissioner Daines eventua lly concluded that there was little merit in continuing to litigate a regulation requiring health care workers to accept a vaccine that was in short supply.259 The emergency regulation was rescinded before the vaccine became readily available;260 but not before the damage to the vaccine's image, and to the public's trust in public health officials, may have been done. By failing to anticipate the potential social responses to his regulation, Commissioner Daines may have misplayed his hand. Like many public health officials, he may have viewed pu blic health law as a potent tool for promoting vaccination, a worthy goal from a public health perspective. But what Daines and other public health officials and policymakers frequently fail to recognize is that law, without th e public's support, may be of limited utility. Suspicion and mistrust, so wide ly evident today, can cast doubt upon public health laws that may seem both cost-effective and even beneficent to public health officials. Suspicion and doubt can grow when vaccination laws put all of the risk on ordinary individuals and remove all of the risk from health officials and pharmaceutical makers. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that nurses took to the courts; nor is it surprising that millions of doses of va ccine had to be destroyed for lack of use.261 258.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 150 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 CONCLUSION Many public health scholars and officials recognize the importance of trust in determining the efficacy of a public health campaign.262 Writing in the January 20, 2010 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association , Heidi J. Larson and David L. Heymann observed that: Lack of trust can cause health programs to fail with harmful consequences. Measles out-breaks in the United Kingdom and the United States and the spread of polio across Africa from Northern Nigeria underscore the importance of building\u2014and maintaining\u2014public trust in health interventions and in the authorities who provide them. Trust relationships must be built over time so that they become the social framework in which health interventions\u2014and positive health outcomes\u2014can thrive. 263 The authors go on to explain that transparency is \"an essential criteria of trust\"264 and that: rather than becoming defensive in the face of an increasingly questioning public, the medical and public health communities must recognize the importance of changing the conversation with individual patients and the public and the importance of being open to hearing real concerns that will affect the acceptance or rejection of health services. 265 In making these important points, La rson and Heymann echo others in viewing the public's lack of trust in publ ic health policies as a result of poor health communication.266 But while transparency , listening, and honest communication -all elements that Larson and Heymann associate with good public health communication -are each important to the development and maintenance of trust, they may be insuff icient if the underlying architecture of public health campaigns, created by public health laws, is distrustful of the public. By placing all of the risk of vaccine campaigns on ordi nary individuals and none on either public health of ficials or pharmaceutical makers, the laws that governed the H1N1 vaccine campaign reflected a profound 262.

Indeed, when supply and demand side pandemic vaccine laws are viewed together, they appear to have presupposed that the public was both foolish and litigious. Why else did these laws protect pharmaceut ical companies and health officials from the anticipated poor decisions - ei ther to abstain from the vaccine or to sue -of ordinary individuals? By assuming that the public is the problem, rather than the client, of public health services, pandemic vaccine laws risk exacerbating the growing distrust between public health official s and the public. To put it another way, by giving the public a legitimate re ason to fear that public health laws fail to allocate the risks associated with pandemic vaccines in an equitable manner, pandemic vaccine laws risk rein forcing the suspicions and distrust to which they respond. At the very least, these laws provide public health critics with grist to grind in their mill. If this hypothesis is correct, (and without a doubt more empirical support is required to affirm it), the \"sol ution\" cannot rely simply on better communication skills. Honest and tran sparent communication cannot \"sell\" a product that disserves the public's interest. In the case of the H1N1 vaccine, a candid and transparent disclosure of the risk allocation scheme established by the pandemic vaccine laws would have required explaining to individuals that although there was no re ason to believe that the risks of the vaccine were greater than those associ ated with the typical seasonal flu vaccine, individuals who did experien ce an adverse outcome would have been entitled to very limited, or no compensation at all, via a system that was not fully established, and which wa s not likely subject to any external review or oversight. They also woul d have been told that vaccine makers that profited from the vaccine were abs olved of almost all liability, even if the vaccine was produced negligently. They would have been told that the laws of many states permitted health officials (if a public health emergency was declared) to detain them if they refused this vaccine. This transparent and candid disclosure seems unlikely to entice many people to seek vaccination, unless the pandemic itself were sufficiently frightening, in which case, of course, there may have been little need to worry about insufficient demand for the vaccine. What, then, is the solution to th e dilemma of pandemic vaccines? Unfortunately, there are no simple answ ers. Public health policymakers face real and complex problems in trying to ensure a rapid and adequate supply of vaccines in the face of uncertain risks. These problems may make the reallocation of some economic risk to the taxpayers sensible. Still, it is critical that policymakers apprecia te what law can and cannot do. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 152 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 4:113 Public health law is an essential an d powerful tool for protecting the public health, albeit one subject to constitutional and other legal limitations.267 In the case of pandemic vaccines, public health law has been used, successfully and not so successfully, to expedite the production, licensing, and distribution of vaccines. Public health law may also provide officials with significant authority to determine the allocation of vaccine, or even, to impose penalties on individuals who refuse vaccines. But legal authority cannot protect pub lic health without the acceptance, and perhaps active support, of affe cted populations. To garner that acceptance, support, and indeed trust, public health laws must do more than provide officials with authority or corporations with financial incentives. They must also provide a firm basis fo r public trust, so that when public health officials communicate with candor and transparency the story they tell is one that does not incite suspicion. To ensure that the story does not er ode trust, public health policymakers may need to reconsider how pandemic vaccine laws allocate risk, both financial and legal. Almost certainl y government investment in vaccine research and production, and the potential conflicts of interest that may engender, 268 are unavoidable. But PREPA's liability provisions seem far more protective of industry, and far less protective of the public, than is necessary or useful. Vaccine manufa cturers receive significant liability protections under NCVIA; but that Act is far more generous to individuals who believe they have been harmed than is PREPA. Perhaps most importantly, NCVIA provides some ba sis for accountability and oversight, since claimants maintain the right to an independent decision-maker to hear their claims. That most fundamental right, often associated with due process,269 a s w e l l a s o u r s y s t e m o f c h e c k s and balances, is insufficiently recognized by PREPA. In addition, there is little justificat ion for giving individuals who are injured by pandemic vaccine less compen sation than they would receive if they were injured by another vaccine. Indeed, since it is more important, from a public health perspective, fo r an individual to accept a pandemic vaccine, than many other vaccines covered by NCVIA,270 the compensation 267.

This should especially be the case for any vaccines that are distributed pursuant to the EUA process. Individuals who willingly take an unlicensed vaccine should not forfeit their right to compensation for any injuries they may suffer. Rather, just like vaccine makers, individuals should have their risks protected. Public health officials may also wa nt to reconsider their fondness for vaccine mandates, at least during pandemics. As the H1N1 pandemic illustrated, mandates are relatively useless in the early weeks and months of a pandemic when vaccine is in short supply. But talk of mandates can create needless anxiety and garner negative publicity, as anti- vaccinationists, civil libertarians, an d individuals who fear they will be subject to the mandate organize in opposition. Most importantly, public health la wyers and policymakers should rethink their conception of public health legal preparedness. In order to prepare for a pandemic, or any other public health emergency, public health officials must know the laws under whic h they operate. But legal \"powers\" and extraordinary \"authorities\" alone cannot assure the public's health. Trust and the willingness to comply with the advice of public health officials are also essential. For that, public he alth lawyers need to think both more broadly and more subtlety. They need to consider how law can be used to build a robust and resilient community that can withstand the ravages of a public health emergency. 271 Additionally, they need to consider how to use law with a gentle hand that respects the rights and interests of not only the powerful, but also the public that pub lic health laws ar e meant to serve. available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/tetanus.aspx (\"Tetanus has no direct person-to- person transmission.\"). 271.
