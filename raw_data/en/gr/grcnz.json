By working with the body, emotions, mind, and spirit, body psychotherapy assists clients to access feelings more fully and to be supported by being received and witnessed, resulting in healing. Body Psychotherapy believes that anxiety and depression are not feelings but a state or way of being and by working with the person as a whole we discover feelings underneath these states. When allowed to be felt and fully processed and received in a safe therapeutic environment positive long lasting change can occur. As a survival mechanism in our early years of life we create blockages within the body in the form of restricted breathing, tense muscles, certain postures that are coupled with beliefs about life and our place in the world. Within the body's tense muscles old feelings are held. Sessions work with assisting clients to access deeper awareness of their emotions, feelings and behaviours. A combination of talk therapy with specific body work creates shifts that come from deep seated unconsciousness. This can release negativity and opens up the path to healing and long lasting positive change, allowing for a greater capacity to live life in a happier more satisfying way. Clients report great positive change within themselves and their lives with the ability to have more functional healthy relationships with oneself, friends, family and partners.

Deanne aims to assist the couple to work together on individual or shared blockages or painful places that come out in the relationship such as blame, being hurtful, control patterns, and withdrawal. By assisting the couple to meet each other around pain and difficulty and stay present and connected the bond, love and security felt within the relationship develops. By providing a safe environment and strengthening the couple as individuals and together they learn to tolerate conflict and resolve issues. As individuals with different backgrounds we usually come into a relationship with some historical painful influences that affect how we view the world and in the most amplified expression this comes out in our closest and most intimate relationship with our partner. Our intimate relationship requires us to share body, mind, heart, soul and sexuality. Any bumps in these areas will generally show up in some way. Therapy assists couples to express their true selves in a gentle, safe and heart felt way and not hide behind defensive masks. It is a habitual response to use defensive masks even in our closest relationship in order to protect oneself. Relationships often end because one, or both, parties feel they have fallen out of love with one another, the relationship lacks sex and intimacy, or they can't stop fighting, or carry suppressed anger towards the other person. Surprisingly there are often many more layers underneath this. Difficulty in a relationship is usually wounding or blockages around love and sexuality, within our mind, body, heart and soul. Unfortunately we have not all had the right influences to know how a healthy relationship looks. Couples therapy aims to deepen your understanding of each other, to allow what lies beneath the difficult painful places that make us destructive in our relationship to heal. Therapy helps to heal and have a deeper connection and relationship where joy and love are it's drivers and life force. Our intimate relationship highlights our perception about ourselves and how we fit with love and another person. The principle of body psychotherapy is to reach the other person from our higher self that becomes more balanced and emotionally healthy.
