What they are not aware of is that even their doctor is likely unfamiliar with the toxic ingredients contained in vaccines which can immediately begin to degrade both short- and long-term health. If your doctor insists that vaccines are safe, then they should have absolutely no problem in signing this form so that you may archive it for your own records on the event of an adverse reaction. The reality of vaccines is that they are a far [greater risk to human health than benefit](http://preventdisease.com/home/tips78.shtml) and always have been. In fact, [two centuries of official death statistics](http://preventdisease.com/news/10/102510_vaccines_did_not_save_us.shtml) show conclusively and scientifically that modern medicine is not responsible for and played little part in substantially improving life expectancy and survival from diseases in developed nations. In North America, Europe, and the South Pacific, [major declines in life-threatening infectious diseases](http://preventdisease.com/news/09/111009_infectious_disease_decline_vs_vaccinations.shtml) occurred historically either without, or far in advance vaccination efforts for specific diseases. Whenever I personally inform medical doctors of these realities, many of them are quite shocked with the data. That's not surprising considering the fact that medical students are still brainwashed that vaccines immunize which is a myth in itself, since natural or \"real\" immunity can never be artificially induced by a vaccine. Other misinformed educators also still rely on the [myth of herd immunity](http://preventdisease.com/news/09/121609_forced_vaccinations_government_public_interest.shtml) which is nothing short of medical fraud. It is a shame and embarrassment that brilliant students are deceptively led down the path of ignorance every single year at prestigious medical institutions in the hopes of obtaining an education. These students then become the physicians of a good percentage of the population. Physician's Warranty of Vaccine Safety Form The following form was adapted from Ken Anderson's original. Perhaps you can find a physician that will sign it because I have no record of that ever happening: Download PDF English [Physician's Warranty of Vaccine Safety](http://preventdisease.com/pdf/Warranty-of-Vaccine-Safety-English.pdf) Download PDF Espanol [Garantia Medica para la Seguridad en las Vacunas](http://preventdisease.com/pdf/Warranty-of-Vaccine-Safety-Spanish.pdf) One of the problems we have in a society filled with misinformation about health, is that people sit on the fence. They want to conform to the societal norms ingrained in our minds about conventional medicine, but they also want to stand up for their beliefs and conscience. These fence sitters are made up of those who understand that current vaccination practices are unsafe, yet somehow also believe you can make vaccines safer or more effective. That is where we have to shift the opinions of those who are on the fence and have them fall off on the side of natural health rather than conventional medicine. See my article [When It Comes to Vaccines, Don't Sit On The Fence](http://preventdisease.com/news/11/122011_When-It-Comes-to-Vaccines-Dont-Sit-On-The-Fence.shtml)! I have previously written that [if your doctor cannot answer these 4 questions, don't vaccinate](#). Well, if your doctor does make an attempt to answer these questions and a verbal response and statement is not satisfactory for your own peace of mind, then your doctor should be at least willing to provide you with his or her personal declaration of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines he or she (or attending physician or nurse) is about to inject in your or your child's body. Effectively, this becomes your doctor's warranty that the risk factors he or she has identified justify the recommended vaccinations with the benefits exceeding the risks.
