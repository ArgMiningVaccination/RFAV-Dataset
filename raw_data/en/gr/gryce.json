Continuously updated as vaccine technology advances, the CDC schedule provides a convenient roadmap for avoiding many preventable diseases. To help both you and your child, [Abdow Friendship Pediatrics](https://www.abdowfriendshippediatrics.com/) in Rockville, Maryland, is a [pro-vaccine practice](https://www.abdowfriendshippediatrics.com/service/vaccines). Our [team](https://www.abdowfriendshippediatrics.com/providers) maintains your child's vaccine record, ensuring they receive all the benefits of a full slate of immunizations. We also help you catch up with your child's protection if you missed any vaccines during the Covid-19 lockdowns. In the meantime, if you're concerned about vaccine disinformation, we'll set the record straight by debunking common myths about routine childhood immunizations. This misconception originated with a 1997 study that was tainted with conflict of interest, procedural errors, and ethical violations. The author of the study later lost their medical license. Subsequent testing found no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. This myth hinges on the appeal of the word \"natural\" as a synonym for \"better.\" Natural immunity is acquired by having the disease. When you consider that the diseases in question can cause serious illness, long-term health problems, and even death, natural immunity requires quite a gamble. Acquiring immunity through vaccines doesn't infect your child with active forms of the disease. Vaccines do contain ingredients that can be toxic or that have names that sound like toxic substances. However, it's a myth that these ingredients are present in toxic amounts. Virtually any substance is toxic when it reaches a certain level. Even water is toxic if you drink enough. Vaccines can't poison your child. Vaccines protect your child when they're most vulnerable, helping them to develop protection against dangerous diseases. That's why they receive a vaccine for hepatitis B soon after birth. The first 18 months of your child's life are the busiest time for vaccination. Vaccines represent protection for their young immune systems, not a challenge. This isn't really a myth. It's simply wrong. Vaccines are proven to work \u2014 spectacularly \u2014 in study after study. The CDC publishes [lists of studies](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/research/publications/index.html) on vaccines in general as well as for specific diseases that prove both the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. If you have questions about your child's vaccines, make an appointment with us at Abdow Friendship Pediatrics.
