Online Psychiatrists [Hugh Brenner](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/psychiatrists/hugh-brenner-phoenixville-pa/810414) Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, MSN, CNS, CRNP Verified Verified I encourage healing with diet, exercise, friends, family, work, engagement with nature, energy, spirituality , love, play and body-oriented psychotherapy of Wilhelm Reich. Everyone is different, I don't judge. Sometimes people are doing well and just need a new prescriber or an ear to listen. Some want a mind, body, spirit overhaul. Some want to remember to breath, stop mood swings, rediscover their true self, stop hallucinating, reduce stress, find meaning, not harm them self, over come spiritual blocks, be less aggressive, more sexy, or less passive. Clients who want deep change are most likely to benefit if they are willing to look deeply and honestly into their own mind, behavior, body and soul. Change is hard work. Treatments can help remove obstacles but how you walk through life is up to you.
