IAN WILLINK - Kambo medicine | 31/08/2017 by radiOzora published on 2017-09-08T13:03:15Z Kambo is a secretion that comes from an Amazonian Tree Frog and is an indigenous medicine. It's effects are widespread and manifest through the body, mind and spirit. Ian Willinks second home has become the jungle, where 6 months of the year he resides. He's been taught to find and collect the secretion himself and is a trained and qualified Kambo practitioner from the IAKP (International association of Kambo practitioners). Ozora 2017 welcomed Ian to bring us another alternate natural way, that is Kambo.
