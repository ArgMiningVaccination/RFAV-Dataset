Reclaim Vitality in Your Body. Experience Deeper Connections. Ignite the Healer Within & Realign with Your Soul! Welcome, I'm so glad you are here. If you are ready to step away from living from a place of busy, stress, anxiety, or fear; are seeking an alternative or enhancement to talk therapy and/or Western medical care, or perhaps you just have a feeling, or deep knowing of being \"off\" or disconnected holistically (in body, mind, and spirit), then I invite you to read on... What is Holistic Healing Therapy? Holistic healing therapy is a form of both alternative and complimentary therapy that weaves together science and spirituality, addressing the root cause for holistic (physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual) healing and wellbeing. Throughout our lives we can subconsciously repress emotions and feelings that in turn cause the flow of our life-force energy that runs through and around us (EVERYTHING is made of energy, including our thoughts, bodies, and emotions) to become stagnant or blocked. The build up of on-going stress, past traumas, and harboring feelings of unforgiveness and resentment get stored and stuck in the body energetically, eventually contributing to and showing up in ways such as: addictions Anger / rage Anxiety Autoimmune disorders Brain fog Cancer Chronic pain Deep longing for peace and fulfillment Depression Digestive issues Dysfunctional relationships with self and others Fatigue / exhaustion Fear Grief / sadness guilt / shame Headaches / migraines Heaviness in heart Irritability Lack of motivation Low self-esteem / self-worth Muscle tension/pain Overwhelm Panic attacks Past trauma Restlessness Sense of feeling lost Sleep issues Stress Vertigo Weakened immune system Your Body is a Sacred Vessel As long as your body is holding on to chronic emotional and physical stress and pain, it cannot truly heal. By learning and practicing the art of surrendering, allowing, and yielding, you create an environment for old stuck patterns and energy to shift, move, and release. It is from this place that healing, transformation, and manifestation is found, and where you experience joy, peace, and vitality in your body, mind, and spirit! Holistic Healing Therapy with Diane Stakoe As we work together using a variety of energy healing techniques, you'll return to coherence - an interwoven connection and energetic balance between your mind, your body, and your spirit (the wholeness of who you truly are) and the foundation for feeling more bliss, calm, freedom, purpose, and love, no matter what your external circumstances may be.
