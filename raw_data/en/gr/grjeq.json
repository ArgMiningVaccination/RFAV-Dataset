Weglarz, PsyD Str eamwood Behavioral Healthcare System DIRECTOR9 State Health Improvement PlanDEAR ILLINOIS STAKEHOLDERS: Thank you for your interest in the Healthy Illinois 2021 initiative . In January 2016, I shared the State Health Assessment that focused on the current state of health in Illinois. Here you will find part two of this initiative, the State Health Impr ovement Plan . This document repr esents the culmination of a yearlong process, in which stakeholders have committed to bringing their ideas and expertise to the table in order to improve the health of all Illinois residents . I appreciate the work that went into the cr eation of the State Health Assessment and State Health Improvement Plan; it was a truly collaborative process . Healthy Illinois 2021 repr esents three statewide initiatives working to improve the health of Illinois residents . The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) recognizes the need to assess the health status of Illinois r esidents and to establish health improvement strategies that address the identified health issues and disparities . The State Health Improvement Plan details the appr oaches and strategies that can lead to health improvement in our priority areas: behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health . Healthy Illinois 2021 also includes the plans for state health system innovation that started under the State Innovation Model initiative . Healthy Illinois 2021 was made possible through the work and ef fort of many individuals and organizations across the State of Illinois. Participants were convened by IDPH, the Illinois Governor's Office, and the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health MidAmerica Center for Public Health Practice . Members of the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council guided this process using their experience and statewide perspective . I'm grateful for their work and commitment . Action Team members worked specifically on the Healthy Illinois 2021 health impr ovement strategies, and the co-chairs for the Action Teams provided leadership and direction . In order to move forwar d with this plan, we will continue to count on your partnership and commitment to this process . I look forward to continuing this important health impr ovement work with you . Nirav D . Shah, MD, JD Director, Illinois Department of Public Health10EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND Leading health improvement and tackling health equity is the mission of the public health system . In the state of Illinois, one initiative to fulfill this mission is a coor dinated project titled Healthy Illinois 2021. This initiative is composed of three statewide efforts: the State Health Assessment (SHA), the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP), and the plans for state health system innovation that started under the State Innovation Model (SIM) . Collectively, these components work together to align and coordinate plans, processes, and resources to drive health improvement and work toward health equity . Executive Summary continued \u00bb11 State Health Improvement PlanThe Healthy Illinois 2021 SHIP was made possible through the collaborative and coordinated effort of many individuals and organizations across the state of Illinois . Participants were convened by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), the Illinois Gover nor's Office, and the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health MidAmerica Center for Public Health Practice . The Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council, appointed by Governor Bruce Rauner in 2015, guided the initiative and included r epresentation from numerous sectors including transportation, education, health care, environment, and social service . The first product of Healthy Illinois 2021, the SHA \u2014 along with a statewid e databook, Health Data: Core Indicators \u2014 was completed in January 2016. This companion document, the SHIP , represents the work of numerous stakeholders sharing their knowledge and expertise . This process began with a r eview of existing state agency plans and reports, continued with numerous qualitative and quantitative information-gathering sessions with public health stakeholders across the state, and culminated with the development of action plans, led by key stakeholders with expertise in the health priority areas . The fruits of this labor are described in this SHIP document which outlines the goals, measurable objectives, and strategies to impr ove the health of Illinois residents specifically in the areas of behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health . The SHIP builds on the work of the SHA by providing a blueprint to addr ess the social determinants of health, access to quality care, and the state's health priorities . The SHIP should guide overarching statewide goals and objectives that or ganizations can adopt to align their work . This plan is a dynamic document; it is expected to be updated and r efined as Illinois begins implementation. Method (Action Planning Process) The framework used for the development of the SHIP was based on an iterative assessment process with several layers of input from key stakeholders . Data that informed the pr ocess were obtained from several sources, including local needs assessments such as IPLANs (Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs) and community health needs assessments; a health system assessment; state agency reports used to identify statewide strengths, opportunities, and barriers; focus groups and presentations conducted across the state; and health status data . From this pr ocess, Planning Council members established a preliminary list of health priorities, which are described in the SHA . 12 Healthy Illinois 2021The State Health Improvement Plan process focused on the development of action plans to address the health priorities identified specifically in the State Health Assessment: behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health . Action Teams wer e established as an opportunity to engage stakeholders, and to build commitment and accountability around the health priorities . The action planning process r elied heavily upon the expertise of key stakeholders working within the behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health arenas . Action Teams wer e charged with developing action plans and were provided tools to assist with goal development activities, including the establishment of guiding principles and criteria for strategy selection . Action Teams consider ed strategies that focused on social determinants of health, access to quality care, integration of clinical and public health interventions, and other decision-making criteria . In addition to describing the overall process of goal and strategy selection, the SHIP includes specific examples depicting how strategies can be implemented . Results (Implementation Recommendations) Implementation recommendations were developed in six areas with a heavy focus on goals, objectives, and strategies related to behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health . In addition to recommendations specific to the afor ementioned health priorities, guidance also clarified the role of the public health system and integrated social determinants of health and access to quality care through the recommended action steps . Public Health System Role Conversations across all Action Teams helped frame key implementation r ecommendations stressing the need for overall infrastructure to ensure plan implementation . The group str essed that the useful and standardized collection, distribution, and utilization of data is a crucial role of the public health system . Social Determinants of Health and Access to Quality Care The Planning Council r ecommended that social determinants of health and access to quality care be priorities for action planning at the start of the implementation stage; these priorities were repeatedly mentioned during the strategy selection process of each of the Action Teams and were overwhelmingly agreed upon as implementation requirements for the plan . The culminating discussions about the SHIP emphasized the need for continued and even more focused r ecommendations to address the social determinants of health . Health Priority Areas and Action Plans More than 80 individuals and or ganizations participated in one of the three Health Priority Action Teams . After exploring both health data and national, state, and local resour ces, the teams developed goals, objectives, and strategies to achieve health improvement and tackle health equity . 13 State Health Improvement PlanConclusion Many lessons were learned throughout the SHIP development process, and it is expected that many more will evolve throughout implementation . One lesson learned is that in or der to make progress in improving health outcomes, particularly in the areas of behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health, full participation of a broad array of stakeholders within Illinois' public health system is required to build infrastructure and accountability . Additionally, thr oughout the action planning process, many stakeholders identified themselves as ready and willing to assist in this endeavor as the implementation phase begins and further refinement of the action steps occurs throughout the next five years.BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHRONIC DISEASE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH 1 .

In accordance with Illinois state statute 20 ILCS 5/5-565,1 IDPH is designated to lead an effort to create a unified strategy for improving the state's public health system . Introduction continued \u00bb15 State Health Improvement PlanIDPH engaged subject matter experts and community stakeholders in an action planning process to address statewide health priorities . These priorities include behavioral health, chronic disease, and mater nal and child health . Partners and stakeholders have worked with IDPH to develop goals, objectives, and strategies to drive health improvement in these ar eas . Action plans for each priority area build upon statewide and local health impr ovement efforts in order to leverage best practices and align assets and resources . This process is an important strategic component of the Healthy Illinois 2021 initiative, wher e the following three major statewide projects are united . Healthy Illinois 2021 Components Healthy Illinois 2021 is composed of three statewide initiatives that work together to coordinate and align plans, processes, and resources to lead health improvement and health equity . Illinois State Health Assessment The State Health Assessment (SHA) is a systematic approach to accessing, analyzing, and using data to educate and mobilize communities, develop priorities, gar ner resources, and plan actions to improve the public's health . Illinois State Health Improvement Plan The State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) is a five-year systematic plan to addr ess issues identified in the SHA . Based on the SHA, the SHIP describes how the state health department and the communities it serves can work together to improve the health of the population . The SHIP also repr esents the Plan for Population Health . Illinois State Innovation Model The State Innovation Model (SIM) considers multi-payer health care payment and service delivery models that aim to improve health system perfor mance, increase quality of care, and reduce costs . State Health Assessment Healthy Illinois 2021State Health Improvement PlanState Innovation Model16 Healthy Illinois 2021State Health Improvement Plan Purpose and Use This report presents the strategies recommended to address health improvement in three priority areas identified through the SHA: behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health. The SHIP builds on the work of the SHA by providing a blueprint to address priority health issues as well as high-level recommendations for how to improve the public health system infrastructure and address social determinants of health and access to quality care . The document is a framework for implementation that promotes evidence-based best practices and r ecommends ways to address core health issues and factors that impact health. It also identifies gaps and offers strategies for addressing these gaps in a coordinated fashion . This is not a plan for what the state government, by itself, should do . Rather, the intent is for or ganizations and agencies working across the state to adopt these initiatives and join the many agencies working in a common direction. Along with the SHA, the SHIP document represents the first phase of a five-year plan that should be updated and refined on a regular basis. It reflects the work of committed organizations, associations, research institutions, agencies, and many others across the state to create actionable and measurable recommendations to improve health . Healthy Illinois 2021 Measures of Success Healthy Illinois 2021 represents a coordinated approach to lead health improvement and tackle barriers to health equity. With a five-year timeline, the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council agreed that success of the overall initiative would be realized by making improvements to the public health system infrastructure, along with improving specific priority health issues that benefit all Illinois residents. The Planning Council established broad infrastructure goals as an operational vision of success . Healthy Illinois 2021 will result in: Aligned and coordinated clinical and primary prevention strategies Patients and community residents that are viewed holistically Effective data systems and infrastructure Aligned quality measures Innovation that occurs through use of evidence-based strategies and best practices Consumer education improvements Maximized current workers and cultivated new workers within the public health system Community-oriented, asset-based decision making Participants The Healthy Illinois 2021 initiative is guided by a Planning Council appointed by Governor Bruce Rauner in 2015 . Planning Council members repr esent organizations from numerous sectors including transportation, education, health care, environment, and social service . Organizations include state agencies, community- based or ganizations, associations, public health departments, health and hospital systems, insurance companies, and other entities, which collectively constitute the public health system in Illinois . As a statewideThe three priority areas identified through the SHA are behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health .17 State Health Improvement Planbody, the Planning Council is convened by the Governor's Office and IDPH. The MidAmerica Center for Public Health Practice at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health also led this effort . Healthy Illinois 2021 Action Teams wer e established for each priority area . Two co-chairs r epresenting a state agency and an external stakeholder group provided leadership for these teams . Action Teams also included participants fr om local health departments, community-based organizations, universities, and state agencies . Action Teams held open meetings between December 2015 and Mar ch 2016 to establish goals, objectives, and strategies to achieve health improvement in the priority areas . Working meetings wer e held weekly or bi-weekly, and Action Team members provided specific input throughout the process. The agendas, minutes, and other materials are available at http://www .healthycommunities .illinois .gov/action_teams .htm . State Health Improvement Plan Framework The State Health Improvement Plan Framework is based on an iterative assessment process with several layers of input from key stakeholders . Data that informed the pr ocess were obtained from several sources, including local needs assessments such as IPLANs (Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs) and community health needs assessments; 2 a health system assessment; state agency reports used to identify statewide strengths, opportunities, and barriers; and health status data . Planning Council members established a preliminary list of health priorities that was then narr owed down to include just five. The list of five priorities shows strong alignment with the priorities identified through the local IPLANs and community health needs assessments.The three priority areas identified through the SHA are behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child and Infectious Disease Environmental Health Chronic Disease Social Determinants of Health Maternal, Infant, and Child Health Access to Health Information Oral Health Injury and Violence Prevention Tobacco Diabetes Family Planning, HIV, and STIs Substance Abuse Cancer Mental Health Access to Health Services Heart Disease and Stroke Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Weight StatusEXAMPLE OF DATA REVIEWED: PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED THROUGH IPLANs Percent of Participants Identifying this Item as a Priority18 Healthy Illinois 2021The assessment findings and preliminary priorities were then vetted locally and regionally through focus groups and organizational presentations. Eleven focus groups were conducted in five counties representing different regions of the state: Cook County, Lee County, Champaign County, St . Clair County, and Sangamon County . Almost 100 participants repr esented their organizations at these sessions . Additionally, eleven sessions for stakeholder organizations were held with over three hundred people participating . In total, over 400 or ganizational leaders had input in the State Health Assessment through the stakeholder engagement process . There was overwhelming support for the preliminary health priorities selected by the Planning Council . A review of transcripts from the focus gr oup sessions provided rich detail about how health issues are being experienced throughout Illinois and the efforts organizations are making to address them . Over 100 pages of transcripts and notes were r eviewed, and the themes were categorized and tallied in order to identify overarching themes . The biggest issue with early priority setting was the determination of how health priorities ar e defined. Participants requested that more detail on each priority area be available to allow them to better understand the issues . Just over one-third of the additional priorities suggested could easily be categorized under the br oader themes of behavioral health, access to quality care, chronic disease, social determinants of health, or maternal and child health . Most of the remaining suggested priorities focused mor e on specific strategies or target populations, as opposed to health issues. The feedback obtained during stakeholder engagement sessions was reported back to the Planning Council for final prioritization. After a facilitated discussion using standardized prioritization tools (e.g., prioritization matrix and dotmocracy, also known as idea rating sheets or sticker dot voting), the Planning Council selected behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health as the statewide health priorities with social determinants of health and access to quality care as key decision drivers for strategy selection . State Health Improvement Plan Framework The following narrative is a description of the State Health Improvement Plan Framework, which follows the diagram below . During meetings of the Planning Council, the group agr eed that access to quality care and social determinants of health were fundamental overarching issues that should serve as implementation requirements for addressing each of the three health priorities . These implementation requir ements are seen as areas that must be addressed throughout the action planning process in order for the health improvement plan to be successful . Thus, Action Teams, in developing their action plans, consider ed social determinants of health and access to quality care when selecting strategies . Action Teams and the Planning Council also consider ed how these principles relate to the public health system more broadly .Social Determinants of HealthAccess to Quality CareBehavioral HealthChronic DiseaseMaternal and Child HealthPRELIMINARY PLANNING COUNCIL PRIORITIES19 State Health Improvement PlanSTATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FRAMEWORK Public Health System Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council OUTCOMESImplementation Requirements Social Determinants of Health Access to Quality CareStrategies Data PartnershipsInterventionsHealth Communication Data PartnershipsInterventionsHealth Communication Data PartnershipsInterventionsHealth CommunicationHealth Priorities Mental Health Chronic Disease Maternal and Child Heal t hIn order to improve health outcomes in these priority areas, the Planning Council and other stakeholders were asked to consider what types of strategies could be implemented at a statewide level . The group consider ed strategies that have been successful in the past, using examples and evidence from state agency needs assessments and operational reports, and their own experience . Data, partnerships, interventions, and health communication were the ar eas that emerged as most important or impactful . Throughout the action planning pr ocess, these areas provided a lens for examination and were considered when recommending implementable strategies . In discussing the role of the system, the Planning Council r ecommended itself to be the entity to provide infrastructure and oversight for plan implementation . 20ACTION PLANNING PROCESS STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN PROCESS The State Health Improvement Plan process focused primarily on developing action plans to address the health priorities identified in the State Health Assessment: behavioral health, chronic disease, and maternal and child health . Action Teams wer e established in December 2015 to drive implementation, as an opportunity to broadly engage stakeholders and to build commitment and accountability around health priorities . Action Planning Process continued \u00bb21 State Health Improvement PlanThe Action Team meetings began with training that covered the State Health Assessment process, to help newly engaged stakeholders understand the current state of the initiative and the guiding principles for Healthy Illinois 2021 . Each Action Team met several times to develop goals, measurable objectives, and strategies to impr ove health in the priority areas . The Appendix provides a summary of the goals and measurable objectives . Because some of the measurable objectives, such as \"building partnerships,\" were qualitative in natur e, whereas others, such as \"reducing mortality rates,\" were quantitative, the process of setting targets required the use of different approaches for different objectives . Spreadsheets for the work of each of the Action Teams exist as working documents containing additional notes and detail, including suggestions for launch steps, champions to solicit, and r ecommended coordinating organizations for the recommended goals. These spreadsheets also include justification and rationale for the goals and strategies chosen by the Action Teams as they developed the recommendations . These working documents will be available to refer ence and build upon during implementation of the SHIP . The Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council provided input on the action plans by participating as members of the Action T eams and through meetings held in March and April 2016 . Members of the public had an opportunity to comment on the health impr ovement goals and strategies through the open meetings of the Action Teams, as well as through three public hearings that were held across the state about the SHIP .

In line with the national movement to promote primary care and gover nmental public health integration for population health improvement, the Action Teams considered strategies that focused on traditional clinical prevention interventions, innovative clinical prevention, and total population or community-wide prevention .3 These criteria are specific to the needs of the Healthy Illinois 2021 process and include consideration of the following areas: n Social Determinants of Health: These are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life . Each group consider ed how a proposed strategy addressed social and ecological factors . n Access: This is the timely and appr opriate use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes . Attaining good access to care r equires 1) gaining entry into the health care system; 2) gaining access to sites of care wher e patients can receive needed services, including transportation services; and 3) finding providers who meet the needs of individual patients and with whom patients can develop relationships based on culturally competent communication and mutual trust . SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTHACCESSMATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTHURGENCY IMPACTEVIDENCE- BASED OR PROMISING PRACTICESRESOURCES How does a proposed strategy address social/ ecological factors? How does a proposed strategy address access to care? How does a proposed strategy promote maternal and child health? Is there a crisis? Are ther e efforts to build on? How many individuals does this reach? How is disparity addr essed? Has this strategy been used before with measured success? What r esources could be leveraged? Are new resources required?HEALTHY ILLINOIS 2021 GUIDING PRINCIPLES Develop a statewide approach Consider assets upon which to build Leverage resources, e .g ., infrastructure Promote alignment of strategies and resour ces across the state Tactically address social deter minants of health and access to quality care Promote prevention fr om a policy, systems, environmental, and program perspective23 State Health Improvement Plann Maternal and Child Health: This criterion focuses on six population health domains: 1) women/maternal health; 2) perinatal/infant health; 3) child health; 4) children with special health care needs; 5) adolescent health; and 6) cross-cutting or life course . Viewing strategies fr om a maternal and child health life course perspective can reveal disparities that need to be considered in the strategy selection process . n Urgency: This addr esses a particularly concerning aspect of the health priority or strengthens areas where timeliness is vital . Groups consider ed how a strategy addressed the presence of a crisis or opportunity to build on existing momentum . n Impact: This r eferences the ability to reach a broad section of the population . Groups consider ed how many individuals a proposed strategy might reach as well as whether the strategy addressed disparities . n Evidence-Based or Promising Practices: An evidence-based practice is one that has been evaluated and shown to make a positive difference in important outcomes . Groups consider ed whether success of a particular strategy has previously been measured . Sources of evidence-based or pr omising practices include the National Prevention Strategy, Healthy People 2020, the Guide to Community Preventive Services, and national health policy . NOTE: Programs or pol icies that are evidence-based or promising practices are noted in the action plan sections in italics. Additional evidence-based and promising practices were discussed in the context of activities necessary to implement specific strategies, and this infor mation will be considered as a next step for implementation of the SHIP . n Resources: In their r eview of proposed strategies, the groups considered the availability of resources and infrastructure to be leveraged as well as the need for new resources . While recognizing that each strategy might not meet all of the criteria, the Action Teams agr eed that strong consideration of these factors during the strategy selection process would allow them to remain true to the guidelines, principles, and spirit of the Healthy Illinois 2021 initiative . These criteria also allowed for a framework to refer ence in justifying strategy selection and reaching consensus .

Entities recognized for pr oviding public health services include the governmental public health infrastructure, businesses, the clinical care delivery system, communities, schools, and a broad array of nongovernmental organizations and community-based entities, including faith-based organizations, that have the capacity to influence health. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently recommended the formal change of \"public health system\" to \"health system\"; however, for the purpose of consistency this document will continue to use the term \"public health system .\"4 As noted, the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council is a diverse group of representatives from multiple sectors who were appointed by Governor Bruce Rauner to guide assessment and improve efforts around population health and tackle barriers to health equity . Planning Council members serve as repr esentatives of the public health system with a charge to develop a state health improvement plan that will provide direction for identified health priorities. A critical point of discussion for SHIP implementation is the ability of public health system members to act on recommendations at the health priority level while providing the infrastructure for the system to carry out its work . Accordingly , the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council will transition to become the Healthy Illinois 2021 Implementation Coordination Council, or ICC . The ICC may have several roles during the implementation pr ocess, including but not limited to providing ongoing oversight and leadership of SHIP implementation by addressing gaps found in the initial planning phase (e .g ., launch a social determinants of health action team), designing a structural and or ganizational approach to implementation (e .g ., launch health priority action teams and a statewide public health data committee), regularly monitoring and r eporting progress of the plan, and addressing needed improvements . 26 Healthy Illinois 2021Given this pending transition and the need for overall infrastructure to ensure plan implementation, the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council considered ways in which the ICC could implement health improvement strategies related to the health priority areas . Information and discussions ar ound the role of the ICC focused on three areas: 1 . Establishing measur es of success for the overall public health system; 2 . Assessing and reviewing data to vet the identified measures of success for gaps, str engths, opportunities, and challenges in order to produce system strategies and identify a specific role; and 3 . Reviewing Action Team recommendations for system needs within and acr oss the health priorities to make recommendations for overall public health system improvements . Measures of Success As previously noted, the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council identified broad infrastructure goals, including the following operational measures of success for the Healthy Illinois 2021 process . In addition to the following statements that describe how this plan would be successful, use of the plan by Illinois stakeholders is critical to success . The plan is a resour ce to assist stakeholders in Illinois in aligning their work around priority areas to support a collective, unified movement to address the priorities. This document should guide overarching statewide goals and objectives for health improvement in priority areas that organizations can adopt to align their work . 1 . Aligned and coor dinated clinical and primary prevention strategies 2 . Patients and community r esidents are viewed holistically 3 . Ef fective data systems and infrastructure 4 . Aligned quality measur es 5 . Innovation that occurs thr ough use of evidence-based strategies and best practices Consumer education impr ovements 7 . Maximized curr ent workers and cultivated new workers within the public health system 8 . Community-oriented, asset-based decision making27 State Health Improvement PlanFeedback from State Health Assessment data presented to the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council aligns with this conceptual framework and calls for a comprehensive approach to address health priority improvement within a larger systems framework (as shown on page 19) . The SHIP Framework includes a Planning Council and an Implementation Coordination Council that supports implementation of health impr ovements . Data presented and discussed by the Planning Council addr essed the following framework elements: Public health mission and purpose: The system would promote community-level health impr ovement across the state while improving statewide infrastructure . As noted earlier, the system would focus implementation and intervention on the social deter minants of health and access to quality care . In addition, many comments addressed the need to pr omote coordinated, best-practice agendas across the plan \u2014 for both infrastructure and interventions \u2014 to align and leverage resources, prevent duplication, and increase clarity and focus on measured improvement . State Health Assessment: Health System Feedback Handler, Issel, and Turnock proposed a conceptual framework for the public health system .5 The framework has become the basis for understanding the necessary components to undertake and demonstrate health improvement, and includes several key elements and interactions including (but not limited to) iterative relationships among the mission and purpose of the public health system, processes, structural capacity, and ultimately outcomes . CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM (PHS) AS A BASIS FOR MEASURING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE Macro Context Public Health SystemPHS Mission and Purpose Philosophy Goals\"Core Functions\"Structural Capacity Information Resources Organizational ResourcesPhysical ResourcesHuman ResourcesFiscal Resources Processes The 10 Essential Public Health ServicesOutcomes Effectiveness EfficiencyEquity28 Healthy Illinois 2021 Process: Four cor e areas emerged as the key process and strategy steps to plan implementation: data analysis and translation for decision making, partnerships for collective alignment and impact, use of community-clinical linkages, and health communications . Structural capacity: Feedback from public health system partners acr oss the state specifically called for improvement of the health system infrastructure overall and the data infrastructure in particular . This included assessing and evaluating provider and workfor ce capacity; collecting, managing, sharing, and utilizing data; considering fiscal strategies to help support the work; and assuring a coordinated approach to align and implement the work . Outcomes: There was overwhelming inter est in strengthening the public health system's ability to demonstrate returns on investments for proposed interventions, as well as to monitor, measure, report, and evaluate progress . PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ROLE: RECOMMENDATIONS Public Health System Leadership Both the Planning Council and the Action Teams called for public health system leadership to facilitate both plan implementation and ongoing discussion and action beyond the plan to improve the public's health . Specifically, the following r ecommendations addressed ways in which immediate leadership is needed to improve public health system infrastructure . These recommendations ar e a result of multiple discussions throughout this process, including previous Planning Council meetings, focus groups, and action planning meetings, culminating with a final SHIP Planning Council meeting where the role of the public health system was revisited . Prioritization of the plan, including the consideration of winnable battles and a policy framework for implementation . T aking a phase-in approach to the strategies suggested in this plan is recommended, including considering what can be implemented by aligning and leveraging existing infrastructure . A policy, systems, and envir onmental change framework is recommended for a statewide approach . Coordination of cross-cutting issues such as data infrastructur e, training, communication, funding, promising practices, and evaluation approach . Leveraging resour ces and reviewing existing plans and strategies is recommended to improve coordination . Consideration of how cross-cutting factors will be integrated acr oss priorities was identified as an initial step. Develop action items to address social determinants of health and other structural issues such as housing, employment, and education . Further consideration around structural issues, including specific action planning to addr ess them, is recommended. Each of the health priority areas cannot be seen in isolation . Without a clear path out of poverty , including access to stable quality housing, a steady income, and opportunities for education, attending to health issues is a distant priority for the many 29 State Health Improvement PlanIllinois individuals, families, and communities that are currently living in poverty (14 .4% of the population overall in Illinois, see State Health Assessment) . Promotion of the plan and communication with stakeholders around priorities . Recommendations include emphasis on dissemination of the plan, deliberate communication around the health priorities, and an ef fort to further engage stakeholders . Strengthen the statewide data system . Three r ecommendations were provided to improve the statewide data system . First, a vision should be articulated for a statewide data system that rationalizes and streamlines the measur ement approach for assessing and monitoring the full spectrum of indicators relevant to improving the public's health, including structural factors (such as social determinants of health), medical and behavioral risk factors, characteristics of the health care delivery system and of other public health programs, and health outcomes . Second, a statewide public health data committee should be established and charged with developing the technical, or ganizational, and analytic specifications for making the vision a reality. Third, the capacity to implement the data committee's specifications should be ensured, including having adequate numbers of information technology and analytic personnel at both the leadership and staff levels, and ensuring that data, program, and policy personnel work collaboratively toward health improvement . Stakeholder roles for implementation . In or der to continue momentum toward implementation, Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council members and Action Team members were asked to consider their role in ongoing SHIP activities . These responses serve as a commitment fr om the public health community to continue driving toward health improvement . They considered r oles for the Implementation Coordination Council, state agencies, and themselves as the public health community . Additional detail on recommended r oles is provided below . These leadership recommendations are a result of multiple discussions including SHIP Planning Council meetings, focus groups, and action planning meetings.30 Healthy Illinois 2021Recommended Roles of the Public Health Community in SHIP Implementation Success will require the continued engagement of stakeholders across disciplines and at every level in every part of the state . As previously noted, the SHIP is a statewide plan . It is not a plan to be implemented solely by government or by any single sector . Recommended Role of the SHIP Implementation Coordination Council Both the Healthy Illinois 2021 Planning Council and the Action T eams took some time to explore the role of the SHIP Implementation Coordination Council . A variety of roles wer e recommended, falling into three categories: strategic activities, proactive activities, and responsive activities . Strategic Consider and execute innovative models to pr omote prevention (e .g ., public health prevention fund) Advocate for the use of best practices Address system gaps/needs (e .g ., launch a social determinants of health action team) Pr oactive Prioritize SHIP recommendations to develop and oversee a focused statewide agenda Launch implementation structures such as health priority action teams and a statewide public health data committee Cr eate an overarching communication plan Monitor health status and impact indicators, evaluate results, and report on progress Facilitate cross-agency data production (data briefs) Promote common strategic approaches, e .g ., data, partnerships, health communications, community- clinical linkage interventions (common measurement appr oaches, share best-practice/evidence-based interventions across the state, etc .) Explor e approaches to funding mechanisms to support multi-year, scope-based funding Align resources, pr event duplication, and promote coordination (e .g ., align state agencies' approaches to pr evention) Support local-level SHIP plan adoption and alignment, including facilitating stronger integration between clinical care and public health Responsive Respond to funding opportunities collectively31 State Health Improvement PlanRecommended Role of the Action Teams As the action planning process drew to a close, each of the Action Teams articulated a desire to continue to work together with the SHIP Implementation Coordination Council . While each group had a unique appr oach, Action Teams identified similar visions of their role. These visions included the following desires: Partnerships and Collaboration Participate in a learning collaborative Serve as a convener to bring a broad array of public health, health care, and other stakeholders working on SHIP priorities to the table Establish formal implementation workgroups Foster collaboration and partnership building Continue to be partners with each other on population-specific issues Collaborate with hospitals on the community health needs assessment process and with local government on public health issues Support efforts to connect priorities to organizations at the state and city levels to champion work Share information about existing partnerships working on priority areas Communication and Technical Support Disseminate the action plans Help frame and promote messaging regarding the SHIP priorities Provide expertise, resources, and technical assistance to families in Illinois Provide training and collaborate to develop a training institute for integrative behavioral health care in primary car e and schools Monitoring and Participating in Implementation Monitor progress towar d SHIP objectives, including setting benchmarks for different phases of implementation Monitor and report on best practices Participate in pilot or demonstration projects Work toward data collection in new areas Implement recommendations as part of their respective organizations, including policy support Resource Development Increase philanthropic and federal dollars that enter the State of Illinois to fund public health initiatives Collaborate with other entities on federal grant applications32 Healthy Illinois 2021Recommended Role of the State Government Partnerships and Collaboration Continue to provide a space for stakeholders to meet and support implementation Partner with local communities in implementation Communication and Technical Support Issue periodic written reports on progr ess toward SHIP implementation, including successes and identified barriers Intentionally link, where possible, state agency reports, plans, and other communications to the SHIP Provide technical expertise and support to organizations, coalitions, and others working to implement SHIP r ecommendations across the state Monitoring and Participating in Implementation Monitor implementation of all recommendations in the SHIP Lead implementation efforts where appropriate, e .g ., data infrastructure impr ovements Set up an interagency implementation team to support these efforts Resource Development Link state grant opportunities, where appropriate, to the SHIP priorities and recommendations Lead and support efforts to obtain new resources to implement SHIP recommendations Implementation of Infrastructure Recommendations In order to take action on proposed strategies, examples are needed to highlight how the SHIP can be integrated across infrastructure and health priorities . The following is one example of how this work might be achieved . 33 State Health Improvement PlanIMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS STORY: ALIGNING AGENDAS TO INCREASE CAPACITY AND SUPPORT POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENT The Rationale The Illinois public health system members, including statewide, regional, and local governmental agencies and nonprofit, faith-based, private-sector, and many other organizations, are working together to facilitate population health improvement and tackle barriers to health equity . Achieving this vision requir es collaboration and alignment of key clinical, community, and clinical-community strategies . This is an area of opportunity for the public health system . The Illinois Department of Public Health's 2015 Public Health Stakeholder Satisfaction Survey Report (described in the State Health Assessment) r evealed that improvement is needed in research to find new insights and innovative solutions to health problems . Further, a 2013 r eport titled \"Assessing the State of Workforce Development in Illinois: Practice Perspectives from the Field\" acknowledged that greater work is needed to develop and execute a systematic approach to public health workforce development .6 The Evidence A key approach to the implementation and adoption of effective interventions to facilitate population health improvement is the use of workforce development strategies, including education and training .7 Given that approximately 50% or less of the public health workforce has formal public health training, providing opportunities for education and information sharing is vital .8 Moreover, conferences remain an important approach to help increase knowledge, skills, and abilities within the public health system to undertake a process and drive decision making toward best practices to improve population health .9 The Strategy The Illinois Department of Public Health, the Illinois Public Health Association, the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health (UIC SPH) MidAmerica Center for Public Health Practice, and the UIC SPH Prevention Research Center are aligning their practice and research agendas as well as training resources to collaboratively present a statewide leadership conference in September 2016 focused on disseminating evidence-based strategies to address population health improvement . The new conference will be of fered for the first time in the state's history and was initiated through purposeful and strategic alignment with the State Health Improvement Plan . The conference, Public Health on the Cutting Edge: Assuring Equity and Brokering Investment in Population Health, focuses on the role of public health in addressing current challenges and opportunities for population-level health improvements in Illinois, while addressing health disparities and health equity . The conference will pr ovide an opportunity to discuss the strategies identified in the State Health Improvement Plan: data, partnerships, interventions, and health communication . 34 Healthy Illinois 2021SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE: BACKGROUND As previously noted, for the purposes of the State Health Improvement Plan, social determinants of health and access to quality care were considered implementation requirements for achieving health improvement across the state . State Health Assessment Background Information collected through the SHA's stakeholder engagement process showed that addressing social determinants of health is an underlying tenet of health improvement work regionally and locally . For example, one focus group participant indicated that or ganizations are \"looking at addressing all of these [issues], but through the social determinants of health [lens] . So our mission is really to eliminate barriers towar ds accessing health care through working with social service organizations .\" The changing health care envir onment also informed the discussion around access to quality care during the State Health Assessment process . Although health care r eform has increased access to care, there are still concerns about the quality and affordability of services provided . Issues raised in the State Health Assessment included the distribution of primary and specialty care pr oviders across the state, the standard of care across the state, navigating the health care system to find quality providers, and ensuring consumers can receive the services they need at a price they can afford . A CALL FOR INCREASED PRIORITIZATION OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE During the action planning process, broad factors that affect health in all the priority areas were raised as key issues that need to be addressed in order to improve health in any one area . These factors include social deter minants of health and access to quality care . While the Action Teams addr essed various social and ecological factors in the plans, a systematic approach to addressing these areas was recognized as a greater need . Both the Action Teams and the Planning Council acknowledge that social deter minants of health and access to quality care should be stand-alone priorities with corresponding strategies and an action plan . The Planning Council r ecommended that this effort should be an early focus at the start of the implementation stage. The areas of consideration that are reflected in the SHIP action plans \u2014 as well as those that need to be prioritized in the next phase of the planning and implementation \u2014 are described on the next page.\"Our mission is really to eliminate barriers towards accessing health care through working with social service organizations .\" \u00bb Focus group participant35 State Health Improvement PlanPriority Areas Recommended for Action Planning by the SHIP Implementation Coordination CouncilExamples of Current Social Determinants of Health and Access Factors Described in Action Plans Access Built EnvironmentCommunity SafetyEducationEquityHousingJob AvailabilityAccess to Services: Assure integration, linkage, and continuity of services through patient-center ed medical homes Increase access to and quality of behavioral health services Built Environment: Increase policy, systems, and envir onmental (PSE) strategies around healthy living and healthy eating Equity: Increase use of tools and r esources to consider equity in decision making for maternal and child health issues \"Our mission is really to eliminate barriers towards accessing health care through working with social service organizations .\" \u00bb Focus group participant36HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS AND ACTION PLANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHRONIC DISEASEMATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH37 State Health Improvement PlanHEALTH PRIORITY AREAS AND ACTION PLANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: BACKGROUND Definitions As the State of Illinois works to advance prevention, early intervention, treatment, and care related to behavioral health, it is imperative that the terminology used in the SHIP reflect consumer, provider, and community input. The term \"behavioral health\" is intended to be inclusive of both mental health conditions and substance use problems . We understand that the ter m \"behavioral health\" is not universally accepted; however, our commitment is to use respectful language that supports ongoing and future work in the field. Mental health is described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community . The positive dimension of mental health is stressed in the definition of health as contained in the WHO const itution: \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"10 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), refers to substance use disorders as being defined as \"mild, moderate, or severe to indicate the level of severity, which is determined by the number of diagnostic criteria met by an individual . Substance use disorders occur when the r ecurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home .\"11 Given the extent to which mental health and substance abuse problems can co-occur, it was decided that substance abuse and mental health should be addressed under a broader umbrella term of behavioral health . Priority Background In Illinois, approximately 15% to 17% of all Illinois adults reported experiencing poor mental health for more than one week in a month, and in 2014, one of five young adults in Illinois \u2014 ages 18 to 24 \u2014 reported experiencing poor mental health for more than one week in a month . In 2013, 39,501 children and adolescents wer e served in the Illinois public mental health system in various capacities .12 According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 8 .5% of all adolescents in Illinois aged 12 to 17 had at least one major depressive episode within the year prior to being surveyed (in 2009 to 2013) . 38 Healthy Illinois 2021Suicide is related to poor mental health, and disparities exist among those who have committed suicide (1,365 people in 2014) . The suicide rate among non-Hispanic whites is higher than the Healthy People 2020 objective and more than twice as high as that of gr oups whose rates fall below the national objective . Additionally, in 2014, men had a suicide rate four times gr eater than that of women in Illinois . The suicide rates among adults were similar acr oss age groups, although the highest rates were among those age 45 to 64 . Behavioral health problems are further r eflected in data from Illinois emergency rooms . Between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, ther e were 110 .89 emergency department visits per 10,000 people for behavioral health issues, including mental health, alcohol, and substance abuse problems .13 The State Health Assessment (SHA) identified limited access to behavioral health services in specific areas of the state as a barrier, but it also highlighted opportunities to increase access to services . The SHA also found the public health system could impr ove its performance by assuring care and linking people to care, which would include behavioral health services. An emerging concern was the identification of new resources and alternative strategies for addressing behavioral health . Illinois' behavioral health infrastructure is in a time of major transition with budget reductions that have been ongoing for at least eight years, shifts in incentives such as managed car e expansion, new opportunities in Medicaid, increasing capacity of health departments and community health centers (including federally qualified health centers), and the population shift from uninsured to insured via the Affordable Care Act. However, the State Health Assessment indicated that there are still barriers for vulnerable populations accessing treatment for substance abuse and mental health conditions . Unfortunately, it is unclear exactly how much behavioral health capacity is needed and whether the market will addr ess these gaps . It is well known that social determinants af fect health status and that they must be addressed in order to be holistic in approach. Specifically, research and experience in behavioral health has long recognized the impact of employment and housing on health status . For example: Loss of employment can trigger depression, despair, and negative coping behaviors such as substance use . Conversely, attaining employment is well understood as a key to stable r ecovery for people with mental illness and substance use disorders . Lack of decent, affordable housing is a major impediment to healing . Safe, stable, and sober housing is a critical factor in recovery . Exposure to violence, either as a victim, witness, or offender , also impacts health status . Domestic violence, gun violence, and other violent experiences generate stress, anxiety , depression, and despair, and often trigger negative coping behaviors . Community-wide conditions of poverty, unemployment, and poor housing are incr easingly well understood as primary factors in creating poor health status . Behavioral health is heavily impacted by the stress and despair that accompany these situations . \"It's not only having the providers who are able to properly diagnose those conditions and prescribe the right medications for that person, but it's also having an individual who can walk the journey with them .\" \u00bb Focus group participant39 State Health Improvement PlanAlleviating the underlying social and economic conditions is beyond the scope of the Behavioral Health Action Team on its own . However, it is r ecommended that the State Health Improvement Plan Implementation Coordination Council undertake a focused effort to engage the business community, state and local economic and housing development agencies, and advocacy groups to join forces to collectively improve these fundamental social determinants of health . Action Team Background The Healthy Illinois 2021 Behavioral Health Action Team, formed to address this priority, was composed of over 25 members representing a diverse array of organizations involved in behavioral health in Illinois, including practicing behavioral health providers, health systems, local public health departments, state associations, community-based organizations, higher education, and consumer advocacy entities . Many had not previously worked together , which resulted in relationship building amid robust conversations on behavioral health issues in Illinois . The Action Team met five times from December 2015 to early Mar ch 2016. The co-chairs, Diana Knaebe, chief, Division of Mental Health at the Illinois Department of Human Services, and Maureen McDonnell, director for Business and Health Care Strategy Development at TASC, Inc . (Tr eatment Alternatives for Safe Communities), led the group and held weekly calls with each other over an eight-week period to report on and monitor the group's work . The Action Team further divided into three subgr oups to determine goals for the SHIP from a prevention, early intervention, and treatment perspective . The subgroups met individually and together at full team meetings and, in addition to discussing behavioral health issues in Illinois, also reviewed national efforts, such as Healthy People 2020 goals, for reference . This process r esulted in a set of six goals, for which corresponding recommended measurable objectives and strategies were developed . Many of the measurable objectives are pr ocess related . As monitoring and implementation occurs, reference to and r etrieval of data from other sources is recommended because the measures used from the State Health Assessment Core Indicator Summary include those with a focus on suicide and reports of experiencing poor mental health for more than one week per month . Strategies to address the proposed goals wer e selected on the basis of the decision criteria for the Healthy Illinois 2021 process, as well as the group's behavioral health knowledge and experience . Action Team r ecommendations include policy, systems, environmental, and programmatic strategies to address behavioral health improvement . Additionally, there was much discussion on ways to begin working on particular strategies as launch steps that are more specific than those outlined in this document, e .g ., identify means to incr ease awareness among providers and community regarding first-episode intervention programming within the state . This discussion is documented in a separate working document that can be r eferenced and built upon during implementation, as noted earlier . \"It's not only having the providers who are able to properly diagnose those conditions and prescribe the right medications for that person, but it's also having an individual who can walk the journey with them .\" \u00bb Focus group participant BEHAVIORAL HEALTH GOALS 1 . Improve the collection, utilization, and sharing of behavioral health-related data in Illinois 2 . Build upon and improve local system integration 3 . Reduce deaths due to behavioral health crises 4 . Improve the opportunity for people to be treated in the community rather than in institutions 5 . Increase behavioral health literacy and decr ease stigma 6 . Improve response to community violence40 Healthy Illinois 2021IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS STORY: COMMUNITY ASSETS The Rationale Community assets for addressing behavioral health needs exist in health systems, local health departments, health plans, law enforcement, schools, and community behavioral health providers . Building upon the existing system is essential so that problems can be identified early and those in need can have easy access to high-quality services . To maximize ef fectiveness, the assets of these potential partners must be garnered for focused, determined, and collaborative action . Such local action can produce important r esults including, but not limited to, reduction in the initiation of underage drinking and illicit drug use, and reduction in crises such as overdoses, suicide attempts, and emergency department visits . The Evidence Several evidence-based community education and capacity building efforts exist, including Mental Health First Aid; SafeT ALK; Question, Persuade, and Refer; Zero Suicide; the Illinois Youth Suicide Prevention Project; and others . These efforts pr ovide resources and tools that can increase the capacity of community members to effectively respond to others who may be experiencing emotional distress . The successful use of such efforts requir es that all parts of the system be aware they exist, and that they be supported by expert technical assistance and consultation . The Strategy: Building on Strengths for SHIP Implementation The Action Team identified several strategies to build upon local action wit h state-level action: 1 . Create local behavioral health planning councils with diverse membership; 2 . Ensure universal access to naloxone (NarCan) among first responders and health car e providers (as required by HB1/PA 99-0480); 3 . Expand evidence-based community substance abuse prevention coalition efforts such as those that ar e federally funded; 4 . Survey medical group associations' memberships to identify conditions most relevant for childr en, adolescents, and adults, as well as integration practices; 5 . Submit a request for information (RFI) for a r egional training center for primary care provider integrated care; 6 . Identify existing funding mechanisms in Illinois for scr eening and brief intervention; and 7 . Develop training curriculum such as the one used in Cher okee Health Systems .1441 State Health Improvement PlanBEHAVIORAL HEALTH: ACTION PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS GOAL 1: Improve the collection, utilization, and sharing of behavioral health-related data in Illinois .

Develop crisis response teams, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency' s (FEMA) Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), which include clergy, community agencies, and health care providers .46 Healthy Illinois 2021CHRONIC DISEASE: BACKGROUND Definition Chronic diseases are long-lasting conditions that can be controlled but not cured and affect the worldwide population . Chronic diseases ar e described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the leading cause of death and disability in the United States . At a national level, chronic diseases ar e responsible for seven of ten deaths each year, equaling 1 .7 million deaths . Additionally, chr onic disease treatment accounts for 86% of our nation's health care costs . The CDC includes heart disease, stroke, cancer , diabetes, obesity, and arthritis as some of the most common and costly chronic conditions . Background Chronic disease was identified as a health priority by the SHIP Planning Council for several reasons. It was a frequent priority for both local health departments and hospitals identified during the State Health Assessment process. Of 511 priorities raised by 120 not-for-profit hospitals, 152 (or nearly one-third) related to chronic disease or related risk factors . Additionally, the State Health Assessment found that half of the top ten local priorities identified by local health departments r elated to chronic disease. There is also alignment across many state agencies that chronic disease is a major health priority . Health indicator data show continued poor health outcomes related to chronic diseases . The two leading causes of death in Illinois are chr onic diseases: heart disease and cancer, each accounting for approximately 24,000 deaths in Illinois each year . The subset of deaths due to ischemic heart disease accounts for approximately 13,000 deaths in Illinois annually . The age-adjusted mortality rates for ischemic heart disease and for cancer were each close to the corr esponding Healthy People 2020 objectives . However, for each cause of death, the death rates for non-Hispanic blacks in Illinois ar e higher than the benchmark . Hispanics had lower mortality rates for both heart disease and cancer compared to non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites . In 2014, the percentage of Illinois adults who reported having diabetes was similar to the percentage of adults who reported diabetes nationally, at 10 .2% and 9 .7% respectively . A higher percentage of both non-Hispanic 47 State Health Improvement Planblacks (14 .0%) and Hispanics (12 .7%) reported having diabetes, compared with non-Hispanic whites (9 .1%) . Risk factors associated with chronic diseases include but are not limited to obesity , smoking, and lack of physical activity. In 2014, almost one in three Illinoisans were obese. Approximately two of five non-Hispanic black adults were also in this category. Approximately one in five children in Illinois were obese, with closer to one in three non-Hispanic black children in Illinois being in this category . Smoking is perhaps the most well established risk factor for a wide array of negative health outcomes . Overall, one in six adults in Illinois reported being curr ent smokers in 2014, and one in four non-Hispanic black adults reported smoking . Among pregnant women, smoking rates ar e lower, but still problematic as approximately 10% of women reported smoking during pregnancy . Physical activity is recognized as an approach for pr eventing chronic disease and disability . In 2014, around a quarter of adults in Illinois r eported engaging in no physical activity during the past month . Among children, the per centages are lower, but every child should be engaging in at least some vigorous physical exercise . Action Team Background The Chronic Disease Action Team included nearly 40 organizational representatives from state, regional, and local agencies from multiple sectors including health care, governmental public health, transportation, nonprofit agencies, and academia to discuss a coordinated Chronic Disease Health Improvement Action Plan . The formation of the SHIP Chr onic Disease Action Team represents the first time a statewide collaborative approach was undertaken to address risk factors for multiple chronic diseases with the support and input of multiple agencies . The Action Team first convened in December 2015 and held eight meetings. The group also completed two surveys to help gather additional statewide information on existing resources for chronic diseases, prioritize the final risk factors that were then turned into the final action plan goals, and discuss the vision of the group's future . An in-person meeting was held in early February to consider partner organizations' agendas and plans, along with national evidence-based and best practices . Individuals repr esenting statewide or regional organizations presented their prevention agendas . The four goals that were ultimately selected addr ess the primary risk factors associated with chronic disease . Measurable objectives were selected for each of the goals to ensure the ability to monitor pr ogress over time and were drawn from the State Health Assessment Core Indicator Summary . All outcome measures wer e selected from the State Health Assessment Core Indicator list . Throughout the pr ocess, the group considered initiatives that were already underway throughout the state and looked for existing alignment across organizations . In general, a policy, systems, and envir onmental (PSE) framework was adopted to recommend comprehensive statewide approaches to address structural issues that impact health as well as promote sustainable change toward health improvement . CHRONIC DISEASE GOALS 1 . Increase opportunities for active living 2 . Incr ease opportunities for healthy eating 3 . Incr ease opportunities for tobacco-free living 4 . for community- cl inical linkages48 Healthy Illinois 2021Nearly all of the goals also have elements of infrastructure building, and the Action Team agreed to recommend broader public health system infrastructure improvements in the areas of assessment, data sharing and use, training and communication, plan alignment, and evaluation across all areas of the plan . IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS STORY: COMPLETE STREETS The Rationale Getting regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, injury, and depression .15 In 2014, around a quarter of adults in Illinois reported engaging in no physical activity in the past month, and over 8 percent of children 6 to 17 reported engaging in no physical activity in the past week that resulted in sweating and breathing hard for at least 20 minutes .16 Walking or bicycling is an effective way to get regular exercise, but many residents of rural areas lack safe ways to travel to school, work, or errands without a car .17-19 The Evidence To increase physical activity, the CDC's Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends making walking easier through changes to street design and zoning . Complete Streets is a planning and policy appr oach that provides for the needs of all users in the design of community streets . Complete Streets projects make community impr ovements such as adding sidewalks and bicycle lanes that can increase frequency of exercise by 48 .4% and promote weight loss when combined with health education .20, 21 Narrowing traffic lanes and adding bike lanes and trees increase safety for pedestrians by making safe crossing easier and calming traffic.22, 23 The Strategy: Building on Strengths for SHIP Implementation Complete Streets is a well-established strategy in Illinois to increase physical activity and reduce chronic disease risk factors . For example, nearly a quarter million residents wer e reached with Complete Streets policies or resolutions as a part of the IDPH's WeChooseHealth Initiatives from 2011 to 2014 . In addition, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and Active T ransportation Alliance (ATA), among other partners, continue collaborative work toward implementing Complete Streets policies across the state . Opportunities for increasing adoption of Complete Str eets policies remain, including building on the existing successful work of ATA, IDOT, and other partners . One of the goals established by the Chronic Disease Action T eam was to increase opportunities to promote active living by adopting policy, systems, and environmental approaches to increasing physical activity opportunities in the built environment . The Action Team r ecommends a focus on transportation, to increase opportunities for physically active transportation by promoting robust policies, plans, roadway design, construction, and maintenance practices that accommodate pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users . A key strategy includes enhancing new and existing Complete Streets policy adoption and implementation at all levels of gover nment. continued \u00bb49 State Health Improvement PlanComplete Streets is a well- established strategy in Illinois to increase physical activity and reduce chronic disease risk factors. The Action Team recommended that together ATA, IDOT, and their partners launch action steps including to: 1 . Conduct a statewide gap analysis of the pr oposed intervention; 2 . Consider key priority communities based on interest and need (but acknowledge resour ce issues and time); 3 . Explore partnerships with metropolitan planning agencies, state gover nment, nonprofits, schools, academic centers, and others to undertake the work; 4 .

Work in this ar ea seeks to improve access to health care and delivery of quality public health services to women and children . Background MCH was identified as a preliminary priority by the Planning Council and subsequently reinforced through the stakeholder engagement process across the state . During the State Health Assessment stakeholder engagement process, it became evident that or ganizations are already addressing MCH issues through the services they provide and the populations they serve . Focus group participants noted that ther e is a need \"to coordinate with [agencies] and make sure sound public health policies are in sync with Medicaid, WIC, and SNAP .\" It was also suggested that community-based approaches should be assessed and used to addr ess maternal mortality . Several health status indicators reinfor ce the selection of MCH as a priority . In 2014, for example, although infant mortality rates in Illinois were better than the national objective for non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanics, the mortality rate for non-Hispanic black infants was appr oximately three times higher . Although the child mortality rates in Illinois were better than the Healthy People 2020 objective, the pattern over time looks similar to that for infant mortality, with persistent disparities between non-Hispanic blacks and all other racial/ethnic groups . Maternal mortality is very rar e but, like infant mortality, is monitored worldwide as a reflection of the overall health of a society . Historically, mater nal deaths resulting directly from medical complications of pregnancy have been monitored, but it is becoming more typical to also document all deaths of women occurring within one year following pregnancy . In 2013, 19 Illinois women died from causes r elated to pregnancy itself, and a total of 54 Illinois women died within one year of giving birth from all causes combined . 60 Healthy Illinois 2021Large disparities exist between non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites, and also between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, with respect to maternal death due to medical causes related to pregnancy itself . Only the rate for non-Hispanic whites meets the Heal thy People 2020 benchmark . The disparities also exist, though to a lesser extent, when any cause of death within one year of pregnancy is consider ed . Pregnant women with severe mater nal morbidity are women with potentially life-threatening conditions related to their pregnancy . Non-Hispanic black women have higher rates of severe mater nal morbidity than other racial/ethnic groups, but only the rate for non-Hispanic white women in Illinois meets the Healthy People 2020 benchmark . No improvement occurr ed between 2010 and 2014 in the rate of severe maternal mortality or in the racial/ethnic disparities . Variation in rates of sever e maternal morbidity across Illinois may be related to access to care or quality of care . Approximately one in twelve infants born in Illinois ar e low birthweight, a risk factor for infant death as well as other health problems in surviving infants . Although the rates for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women met the Heal thy People 2020 objective in 2013, the rates for non-Hispanic black and other non-Hispanic women did not . Almost one in seven non-Hispanic black pregnant women deliver ed a low-birthweight infant in 2013 . Action Team Background The Maternal and Child Health Action Team included 20 active members representing academia, local health departments, community-based organizations, insurance companies, and state agencies . The Action Team held ten meetings, the majority of which wer e conference calls, culminating with an in-person meeting in March . Weekly calls wer e also held with the co-chairs of this group to discuss meeting and process design . The Maternal and Child Health Action Team gr ounded their work by reviewing a recent federally mandated, comprehensive needs assessment conducted for the MCH Title V program . In 2015, this statewide needs assessment identified ten priority areas for the T itle V program that addressed the range of MCH population health domains . Building on existing efforts, consistent with the Healthy Illinois 2021 pr ocess, the Team selected priorities by reviewing the priorities that emerged from the Title V needs assessment The four goals that were ultimately selected represent areas where work for the Title V program could be leveraged or where implementation gaps existed . The team used the Healthy Illinois 2021 planning process as an opportunity to dive deeper into the T itle V priorities, particularly in identifying activities needed to begin implementing strategies . The groups discussed focusing on the ar eas of greatest impact for this process as a way to narrow down the ten Title V priorities and select the Healthy Illinois 2021 focus areas . The group also noted that all the original priorities would continue to be focus ar eas of IDPH's Title V program and this set of goals was a chance to elevate particular issues . For each of the goals, health or process measurable objectives wer e selected to ensure the ability to monitor progress over time . The outcome measures wer e selected from the State Health Assessment Core Indicator Summary or the Illinois Maternal and Child Health Databook (a central piece of the comprehensive needs assessment) whenever possible . The group discussed including baseline racial and ethnic data with the measur e to ensure a focus on disparities as progress is monitored in these areas . Where possible, this infor mation is included .61 State Health Improvement PlanStrategies to address these goals were selected on the basis of the expertise of the group, taking into consideration the decision criteria for the Healthy Illinois 2021 process . Action Team r ecommendations include policy, systems, environmental, and programmatic strategies to address health improvement in MCH as well as strategies to increase MCH capacity. A variety of activities that are more specific than the strategies referenced in this document were discussed as ways to begin working on particular strategies . For example: Goal 1: Design continuing education ar ound MCH concepts, increase enrollment into programs to ensure that children access ongoing healthcare, and conduct a Well-Woman Campaign. Goal 2: Promote increasing the duration of breastfeeding to the 6-month mark, expand on the policy work of school-based health centers related to pregnancy and birth outcomes, promote preventive medical visits for women of reproductive age, and ensure that providers discuss with mothers key concepts such as birth spacing, family planning, and contraception education . Goal 3: Utilize the online health equity toolkit developed through the work of the Collaborative Impr ovement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, and identify grant programs in which expansion of requirements for demonstrating the use of an equity assessment would be appropriate . Goal 4: Establish interagency partnerships to discuss data-sharing needs and barriers and leverage public health and epidemiology training pr ograms to improve analytic capacity and develop the epidemiology workforce (e.g., CSTE fellowship, EIS officers, graduate students at the UIC School of Public Health) . MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH GOALS 1 . Assure accessibility, availability, and quality of preventive and primary care for all women, adolescents, and childr en, including children with special health care needs, with a focus on integration of services through patient-centered medical homes 2 . Support healthy pregnancies and improve birth and infant outcomes 3 . Ensure that equity is the foundation of all MCH decision making; eliminate disparities in MCH outcomes 4 . Strengthen data systems, infrastructure, and capacity r elevant to MCH62 Healthy Illinois 2021IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESS STORY: IMPROVING QUALITY AND ACCESS TO CARE ACROSS THE REPRODUCTIVE AND PERINATAL CONTINUUM The Rationale Several issues related to reproductive and perinatal health, such as the rising rates of maternal mortality, stagnant rates of infant mortality, high proportions of preterm and low-birthweight births, and continuing disparities in pregnancy outcomes in the United States, have led states to focus on health risks faced by women of childbearing age .24 Addressing these issues is a focus for improving quality and access to care across the continuum . The Evidence In order to incr ease quality and access to care, several steps have been identified as critical to implementation that take into account national guidelines and best practices from other states . For example, a recommendation by the Maternal and Child Health Action T eam is to increase access to early and adequate quality prenatal care as defined by American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines . Additionally, other states ar e launching statewide programs to identify women with prior preterm birth and improve access to, education about, and utilization of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) for women with prior preterm birth . The Strategy There are several opportunities to str engthen work around improving quality and access to MCH services . The Maternal and Child Health Action T eam recommends building on the work of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) program that developed an online perinatal toolkit for dissemination in Illinois . The Healthy Choices, Healthy Futures Perinatal Education Toolkit for providers was created through partnership with numerous MCH stakeholders . It provides information and r esources for providers of women during preconception, prenatal, postpartum, and interconceptive care and can be promoted broadly across Illinois as a mechanism to increase quality of and access to care . Another recommended activity is to identify community ambassadors, home visiting/doula programs, and community health workers that can assist in referring patients to services and promote follow-up for mothers and children at risk of poor health outcomes . Strong community health worker pr ograms and networks exist and could be leveraged to promote these activities . 63 State Health Improvement PlanMATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH: ACTION PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS GOAL 1: Assure accessibility, availability, and quality of preventive and primary care for all women, adolescents, and children, including childrenwith special health care needs, with a focus on integration, linkage, and continuity of services through patient-centered medical homes . MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES Focus Area 1: Implement quality standards, performance measures, reimbursement rates, and procedures for patient-centered medical homes in managed care and fee-for-service environments, as well as technical assistance, consultation, and training resources .

For instance, the systems of preventive and clinical care often still operate separately , making the work to integrate these systems difficult. Another challenge is a tendency to focus on health issues as opposed to system issues or structural issues that often require a longer view . Addressing structural factors such as the social deter minants of health requires time, resources, and dedication . It also takes time to build collaborative groups, both for the guidance of a planning pr ocess and for action or implementation planning, alongside overall coordination of the entire process . Further, taking full advantage of the rich data sour ces available in the state in order to understand and monitor progress requires a more integrated approach to data use than is currently in place . Nonetheless, the asset-based approach taken in this planning pr ocess resonated with many planning participants, and created an opportunity for connectivity, alignment, and action . The planning process also allowed gr oups to focus more on implementation . For example, where strategies wer e already proposed or even underway in at least one part of the state, this approach allowed stakeholders to focus on what would be needed to put them into action statewide . Finally, the pr ocess was an opportunity to build awareness around the health priorities and strategies to address the priorities . The State Health Improvement Plan is a living document and is intended to be monitor ed and built on during the duration of the plan . The goals, objectives, and strategies are an important starting point for work toward addressing the health priorities . The recommendations should be used for implementation, but reflection and improvement is encouraged. The SHIP should be used by public health system partners as overarching statewide goals and objectives for health improvement in priority areas with which organizations can align their work, or that partners can use to identify strategies and practices for their own health improvement efforts . 72 Healthy Illinois 2021Next Steps Recommendations for next steps have been described throughout the document . The most pressing areas for consideration by the State Health Improvement Plan Implementation Coordination Council include: 1 . Developing a framework for plan implementation, including development of roles and responsibilities for implementation leadership, coor dination, action, and monitoring and evaluation 2 . Developing an action plan specifically to addr ess the social determinants of health 3 . Prioritizing r ecommendations made by the Action Teams 4 . Implementing a framework for impr oving data infrastructure, analysis, dissemination, and use In the next phase of the collective movement toward health improvement, a commitment to changing the health of Illinois residents is needed from all partners in the public health system . William Pollar d, renowned physicist and Episcopal priest, said, \"Without change there is no innovation, creativity, or incentive for improvement .\" Now is the time to direct our ener gy toward innovation that results in healthier, more equitable communities across Illinois . 73 State Health Improvement PlanREFERENCES 1 .
