This week we are tackling our 8th herb, nettle (Urtica dioica). Typically known, nettle is a tea or tincture that is used for its nutrients that include minerals like iron and magnesium and vitamins including A, C, E, and K. If you haven't already, please like us on To purchase items from my online store, [click here](https://myherbalapothecary.square.site/s/shop). I love using nettle in tea blends or tincture blends. There are great recipes for usage for when you may feel specific symptoms or want preventative measures, which we will get to later in this post. We know that nettle is a great tool for consuming vitamins or minerals, but what has it traditionally been used for? Let's cover that today. PDFs are coming available for download at reasonable cost for subscribers and be sure to share this with your friends and family. Our first monograph on dandelion PDF is going to be posted this week on our publication! Check out [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6100552/) praising the benefits of nettle and how it can help us. Growing Nettle: you can start indoors if you aren't sure about the weather and transfer outside in spring time after the threat of frost has gone. Finding a spot that is full sun or partial shade is preferable if you want the plant to thrive. pH range can be anywhere from 5 to 8. Keeping moisture is important here. The plant may struggle if it is too dry. Sow into moist soil, do not cover seeds \u2014 press them lightly into the soil. Germination occurs in 2-4 weeks and space them a foot apart. These plants are generally hardy and can take care of themselves if you water regularly. Harvest with gloves about 100 days after sowing seeds. Gloves are important. Harvest top 6 inches in spring/early summer before flowering. Harvest the seeds while green and harvest rhizomes in autumn. After spring, the plants can take care of themselves until they spread out to regrow for the next season. How to use: in tinctures in teas in juice in food in drinks (as a tincture or alcohol blend) infused in vinegar as ground powder and more Keep reading with a 7-day free trial Subscribe to "}
