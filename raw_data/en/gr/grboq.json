The ultimate aim of home economics is to strengthen families,empowering individuals to take action for the well-being of self and others in the home,workplace, community, and world. Our society depends on strong families. Strongfamilies nurture individuals, serve as their first teachers, instill values and standards ofbehavior, and provide human resources for the work force. Unfortunately, statistics withregard to divorce, teen pregnancy, poverty, and family violence suggest that this impor-tant institution is in danger. Ohio vocational home economics programs can providemuch needed support for individuals by empowering them to take responsibility for thewell-being of their families.The Ohio Work and Family Life Program is based upon what students need to know, tobe able to do, and to be like in order to be competent in the work of the family. Thecurriculum engages students in practical problem solving, including practical reasoning,to clarify personal and family issues, evaluate alternative choices and their consequences,develop criteria and standards for making ethical choices, and take action based on theconsequences for self, family, and others. The four process skills listed below, which areessential to competence in the work of the family, are taught in each Work and FamilyLife course:Managing Work and Family ResponsibilitiesSolving Personal and Family ProblemsRelating to OthersAssuming a Leadership Role as a Responsible CitizenThere are six core course areas of the Work and Family Life Program that reflect thepractical, perennial problems faced by families. The six resource guides listed belowprovide assistance to teachers in implementing each core course area of the program.Personal Development (1993 release)Resource Management (1993 release)Life Planning (1994 release)Nutrition and Wellness (1994 release)Family Relations (1995 release)Parenting (1995 release) V The Nutrition and Wellness Resource Guide reflects the expertise of many individuals,including teachers, curriculum specialists, and Ohio Department of Education staff. InDecember 1993, a team of teachers and content specialists met to begin developing themodules appearing in this guide. Their commitment to this curriculum project is to becommended.

The following graduate students in a program planning course at The Ohio StateUniversity contributed to the development of the process modules.Rita SchoolNancy Willis, Oak Harbor High SchoolKathy Kush, Center on Education and Training for Employment, The Ohio StateUniversity, provided technical assistance in formatting the resource guide.In addition, many home economics teachers throughout Ohio reviewed and providedsuggestions for the development of modules for this resource guide. Their time andenergy, which contributed greatly to the curriculum project, are much appreciated. vii8 INTRODUCTION The Ohio Work and Family Life Program, a secondary home economics program, isbased upon what students need to know, be able to do, and be like in order to be compe-tent in the demanding, challenging, and changing work of the family. The curriculum forthe program includes the development of the process skills of managing work and familylife, solving personal and family problems, relating to others, and assuming a leadershiprole as a responsible citizen. The course content is focused on six areas that reflect thepractical, perennial problems faced as part of the work of the family. These six areas arePersonal DevelopmentResource ManagementLife PlanningNutrition and WellnessFamily RelationsParentingAn integral part of the curriculum is reasoning through problems by identifying personaland family values, obtaining adequate information for problem solving, and criticallyevaluating alternative solutions and their consequences for self and others. Once a studenthas reasoned through and decided on a course of action, the emphasis is on developing theskills necessary to take that action, leading to the significant outcome of responsiblebehavior in interpersonal, family, school, community, and work settings.The Nutrition and Wellness Resource Guide is one of six guides developed to helpteachers implement each of the six course areas of the Work and Family Life Program.Ohio's Competency Analysis Profile (OCAP) was developed to identify competenciesrequired for each of the process skills and for each of the six course areas. Thesecompetencies were designed to enable learners to reason thror:gh practical problems andtake action that is best for self and others. This competency list is available from TheOhio State Uni,versity, Vocational Instructional Materials Laboratory, 1900 Kenny Road,Columbus, Ohio 43210-1016 (614/292-4277).The Nutrition and Wellness Resource Guide provides those teaching the Nutrition andWellness course an overview of the course content, teacher background information,learning activities, and assessment ideas. This guide has one teaching module for eachprocess competency and each content competency in the Nutrition and Wellness andProcess Competency units of the OCAP. These modules appear in this guide in the sameorder in which the competencies are listed in the OCAP. The Nutrition and Wellness course focuses on three practical problems:What should I do regarding ensuring wellness?What should I do regarding food choices?What should I do regarding preparing food?Table 1 illustrates how instruction in the Nutrition and Wellness course may be orga-nized to address these practical problems. Each problem is posed through case studiesand shared experiences, and examined using critical questions that will lead to ethicaldecisions and reasoned action. Since the focus of the Nutrition and Wellness course issolving problems related to wellness and food choices, it is recommended that ProcessModule 2, Solving Personal and Family Problems be taught first in the sequence of thecourse content. The remaining three process modules should soon follow, as theseestablish the management, interpersonal relationship, and leadership skills needed totake action on practical problems presented throughout the course. Instructional timespent on each module will vary during an 18-week course according to the students'educational needs. Part of the 18-week period can be spent further developing thecompetencies identified, or addressing other topics as identified by the local programadvisory committee.Laboratory experiences, an essential component of the course, are centered aroundvarious practical problems, as shown in the third column of Table 1. Each laboratoryexperience should provide an opportunity to enhance the practical application of nutri-tion principles in real-life situations. These laboratory experiences are designed to helpstudents take reasoned action concerning simulated practical problems. Since thetraditional nutrition education approach of teaching nutrition concepts before a concen-trated block of food laboratories has been shown not to enhance students' nutritionknowledge and later nutritional food choices, nutrition education has been integratedinto the food laboratory experiences. Thus, the food laboratory provides an ideal settingfor developing good eating habits and understanding the moral responsibility that eachperson has for healthy food choices. As teachers plan these important classroomlaboratory food experiences, the following guidelines should be considered. 1.Provide the practical problem statement for each food laboratory experi-ence. Examples are given throughout the resource guide. The laboratoryexperiences should focus on real-life problems, enhancing skill in time,money, and resource management. In order to enrich the experiences of theentire class, vary the practical problem situation slightly for each food labgroup for the same lab. Forinstance, vary a particular resource, such asequipment, time, or cost. Then each group can report its findings to theentire class as part of the lab evaluation.4 Table 1Resource Guide Modules Related to Nutrition and Wellness Practical Problems Practical ProblemRelated Content ModulesPractical Problem-Solving Questions Addressed in Labsand Other Learning Experiences What should I doContent Module 1:regarding ensuringPromoting Wellnesswellness?and Good Health What 3:Relating PsychologicalNeeds and FoodChoicesContent Module 4:Planning Food Choices Content Module 5:Obtaining andStoring Food Content Module 6:Preparing andServing Food Content Module 7:Selecting and UsingEquipmentHow should I go about assessing my level of wellness'?What strategies should I use to ensure wellness?Where can I obtain reliable information about wellness?What are the consequences of various strategies to managestress?What factors influence my level of stress?What societal issues should I be aware of with regard tonutrition and wellness?What is my role in promoting wellness issues throughoutsociety'?What factors affect the level of wellness of those in other areasof the world?What factors affect the foods eaten by various cultures andregions of the world?What criteria should I use to evaluate my food choices?What health concerns should I he aware of that would heinfluenced by my food choices?How do I go about meeting the varying nutritional needs offamily members?How do nutrients affect my level of wellness?What factors contribute to a health body weight'?How do cultural, family, and ethnic influences affect my foodchoices?What are the consequences of abnormal eating patterns influ-enced by psychological factors'?What criteria should I use to plan food choices'?How should I go about selecting nutritious foods when eatingaway from home'?What criteria should I consider when obtaining and storingfood'?What strategies should I use to comparison-shop for food?What factors will influence my food purchases?How should I go about using available resources to preparefood for family members'?What food science principles should he applied to preparenutritious foods for family members?What criteria should I use to select kitchen equipment?How does my choice of kitchen equipment affect resourcemanagement? 311 2.Each lab experience includes three phases: planning, implementation, andevaluation. The Lab Planning Form (p. 25-26) assists students withplanning and incorporates practical problem-solving skills such as identify-ing factors affecting the problem, finding information needed to solve theproblem, and formulating a plan of action. The Lab Observation Form(p. 51) can be used by teachers or student observers to assess the action orimplementation phase of the lab. The Lab Process Evaluation Form(p. 52-53) can be used by students to assess their lab experience, includingthe processes of planning, management, cooperation, and preparation. TheLab Product Evaluation Form (p. 54) helps students assess the quality,cost, and nutritional value of the food product prepared. 3.Cooperative learning strategies have been incorporated into the lab experi-ences throughout the guide. When establishing lab groups, choose studentsto reflect the diversity of the student population. Team Assignments forLab Experiences (p. 55) establishes the roles of various group members andfosters cooperation and individual accountability. These roles should berotated among group members with each new lab experience. Cooperativeskills are also incorporated into the Lab Observation Form (p. 51) and theLab Process Evaluation Form (p. 52-53). 4.All food products prepared in the lab should be nutritious. Establish nutri-tional standards for each lab cooperatively with students and have studentsrecord the nutritional standards on the Lab Planning Form (p. 25-26).Recipe sources for the classroom should be selected to include nutritioninformation. Foods prepared should be no more than 35 percent fat. Cal-cium, iron, Vitamin A, and Vitamin Cnutrients lacking in the adolescentdietmay also be included in the nutritional standards. 5.Lab experiences should be planned so that the actual food preparation can beaccomplished in one class period. Time management is an importantoutcome of the Nutrition and Wellness course and will best be fostered whenstudents must plan food preparation with time as a limited resource. 6.To reduce the amount of food waste and the cost of lab experiences, considerpreparation of half-portions. 7.The Food Product Evaluation Form (p. 54) encourages the evaluation ofthe product for cost, quality, and nutritional value. Students should beinvolved in identifying the criteria for each lab in each of these categories.In order to facilitate the calculation of cost-per-serving data, collect foodproduct packages commonly used and develop a list of prices of staple 4 ( products. Since these prices fluctuate only slightly, the same prices couldbe used throughout the school year. Some local groceries will providecomputer printouts of price lists for all items sold in the store in a givenweek. Again, once obtained, these prices could be used throughout theschool year. 8.Teacher demonstrations are a valuable tool that can reinforce preparationskills for which there may not be time to teach an entire unit. For instance,use of a microwave oven may be incorporated into several of the labexperiences, depending on the recipes students are directed to use. If onlyone microwave is available in the classroom, the microwave can be rotatedamong lab groups for various labs, and the practical problem statement caninclude the phrase \"using the microwave oven as a resource.\" In thissituation, short demonstrations on using the microwave could be given toindividual groups. During the evaluation phase, students could be asked toexplain to the class the microwave oven cooking techniques they usedduring the lab.For additional information regarding the philosophy and implementation of theWork and Fam:!/ Life Program and the format, use, and implementation ofeach of the six resource guides, please refer to the Work and Family LifeProgram Implementation Guide, available from the Ohio Department ofEducation, Division of Vocational and Career Education, Vocational HomeEconomics Section, 65 S.

Time management Teacher Note: In the Nutrition and Wellness Core Course area the focus of this process skill is tohelp students become aware of how management strategies such as time management can influencepositive nutrition and weli.:ess choices. Studies have shown that when people feel pressed withregard to time, they are more likely to make unhealthy choices. Therefore, the module introducestime management principles that can be applied in classroom lab experiences and projects in real-life settings throughout the course. It is recommended that this module follow Process Module 2,Solving Personal and Family Problems in the sequence of modules taught throughout the course.Since the content of the process competencies remains relatively the same over the six core courseareas of the Work and Family Life program, the teacher background information is the same as thatprinted in previous guides. The learning activities, however, have been designed specifically forthis course area and complement the content modules found in the remainder of this guide. Teacher Background InformationRationaleSociety depends on two constants for its survival: family systems and work (Felstehausen & Schultz,1991). Though these two systems have always been interconnected in numerous ways, the nature of eachsystem and the way in which they harmonize and conflict have changed greatly in the last few decades. 7?4 Managing Work and Family ResponsibilitiesI)MODULEI-Increasing numbers of single-parent and dual-income families, changes in work and family roles, differ-ences between employer and family expectations, and changes in lifestyles have created new perspectiveson the relationship between work and family life. The problem of competing work and family demands isan issue not only for family members but for the economy as well. Society cannot be optimally productiveunless the needs of employer and employees are accommodated.A resolution passed by the American Vocational Association in 1992 recognized the family as the firstteacher and the first setting in which children learn about work: \"The labor force is produced and affectedby families and there is a relationship between family functioning and work productivity.\" The resolutionurges that there be recognition of the value of a strong family unit and the contribution it makes to the workforce and economy. It further states that the curriculum of all vocational education programs shouldinclude appreciation for the interrelationship of family and work. With an understanding of work and family roles, students will be better prepared to make informed choicesregarding their future career and family development. Before making career decisions, students shouldthink about the impact of their career choice on their future family. Increased knowledge of theinterconnectedness of work and family will enable students to increase their productivity, thereby strength-ening the nation's economy and encouraging business, industry, and government policies to enhance thewell-being of families. An appreciation of the important balance between work and family systems canenrich family life and contribute to success in the world of work, and most importantly, allow individualsto lead happier, more satisfying lives.BackgroundThough the wordworkis often associated with paid employment outside the home, it is used in contextsthat imply a wide variety of meanings. These meanings can be classified into two groups: 1. Workmay refer to a product, such as a good, service, thing, or idea that results from humaneffort and has economic, social, and/or personal value to individuals, families, or society. 2.Workmay also be a process, or thehuman action or activity itself. This kind of work refers todeliberate action directed toward accomplishing a particular goal. In either context, work can be a source of personal satisfactiona place to go to interact with other people,a way to enhance personaldevelopment, or a means of earning money to buy things. In fact, the activitiesthat happen in a family may be considered \"work.\" The work of the family can include nurturing otherfamily members, creating or obtaining resources for use by family members, or creating and maintaining aliving space for the family.Students are workers, whether they are employed or not. School and extracurricular activities involve manyof the same responsibilities, time commitments, and conflicts with personal and family life as paid employ-ment. Adolescents are also engaged in the work of the family, with increasing responsibility for familyresources and the care of other family members as they make strides toward their own independence. 81 Managing Work and Family ResponsibilitiesICPROCESS )MODULEEach day, more American families join the ranks of the dual-worker or single-parent family. This trend,as evidenced by the statistics below, contributes to the complexity of balancing work and family responsi-bilities.According to a 1986 report by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the typical married family is nowcomposed of two wage earners, and the number of singe-parent families continues to rise.Since 1960, the number of mothers with children under the age of five working outside the homehas increased from 15 percent to over 60 percent.It has been projected that as many as half of all families in this country may at some time be headedby a single parent, 90 percent of whom will be womenalmost all of them working out of neces-sity, if not by choice (Schreve, 1987).Between 80 and 85 percent of all the children in American will be growing up in the homes ofworking mothers.Work does not exist in a vacuum, nor do individuals and families (Jorgensen & Henderson, 1990).Families do affect the workplace. According to a 1985 Boston University study, nearly one half of theemployees interviewed associated depression at work with the strain of holding a job and raising a familyat the same time. Workers who experience basically stable home environments with minimum frustrationsare generally more dependable, productive workers. Basic skills and abilities learned at home are carriedover into the work world. The workplace, in turn, affects families. Direct results of employment, such asincome, economic benefits, and job satisfaction, clearly affect family life.Balancing life to include an equitable distribution of time and energy for career, relationships, and self isoften a difficult task. Women who work outside the home still assume the major responsibility for thehome and family (Couch, 1989). Men are struggling to grow more comfortable with shared family life.Just as women should not be denied the opportunity for a self-fulfilling, challenging career, men shouldnot be deprived of fatherhood and a life apart from their careers.The most common stressors involved in balancing work and family responsibilities are overload andinterference (Voyandoff & Kelly, 1984). Overload is experienced when the number of responsibilities forone or more roles is greater than the individual can handle adequately or comfortably. Interference existswhen responsibilities conflict and individuals are required to do two things at the same time. Family-related demands such as large family size, conflicts within the family, low spousal support, managinghousehold tasks, finding quality day care, and managing time, stress, and energy are all related to conflictsituations in balancing work and family life (Felstehausen, Glosson, & Couch, 1986; Greenhaus &Beuten, 1985). Family changes such as divorce, death, new relationships, and increased expenses are alsoassociated with work and family conflicts (Voyandoff & Kelly, 1984).The way in which families balance work and family life varies from one family to the next. The balancedepends on the family's values and goals. To help achieve a healthy balance between work and familylife, families need to learn to develop strategies for time management, high-quality family communica-tion, stress management, delegation and prioritization of family work, and support systems (Jorgensen &Henderson, 1990). Flexible occupations and work hours, careful timing of family role demands, mutualsupport, understanding, consideration, and cooperation are also strategies for helping to alleviate conflictsbetween work and family life (Gupta & Jenkins, 1985).916 PNDUR10\u00b0CESSLEManaging Work and Family Responsibilities Developing a balance between work and family is an important life task. Essential are strategies formanaging time, energy, and money. The degree of success in creating this balance contributes to thehappiness and well-being of today's family and leads to increased productivity and job satisfaction in theworkplace.ReferencesCouch, A.

The work ofthe familyLearning Activities a.Collect enough ping pong balls to allow three balls for each member of your class.Place the balls in groups of three and write letters on them so that three groupshave the l0.tter \"A\", three groups have the letter \"B\", three groups have the letter\"C\", and so on until all the groups of balls have a letter. Distribute one group ofballs to each class member. Try juggling the balls for a few minutes. Then findthe other two class members who have the same lettered balls as you have. Atthis point, the class should be divided into small groups with three people in eachgroup. Pose the question, \"What responsibilities do families juggle?\" In yoursmall group, choose a recorder to write on a large piece of paper, a reporter toreport the list to the class as a whole, and a time keeper to keep the group on task.In a five-minute period, create a list of at least ten responsibilities that familieshave.

Nutrition and WellnessManaging Work and Family Responsibilities Systems Thinking About Work and Family A system includes objects and events that are related in their purpose and depend on each other tofunction. All the parts of a system are interrelated, interconnected, and interdependent. A changein one part of a system can affect several things at once. Systems thinking is a way to think aboutthe relationships between complex concepts, such as work and family.In the diagram below, three circles show the relationship between self, work, and family. When wethink about the self as a system, it includes your physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and spiritualself, and all the things you do to maintain your personal well-being. The family system includes themembers of your family and all the activities your family does to support each other, such as meetingphysical needs or needs for love and belonging. The work system includes your responsibilities atschool or on the job, as well as career development activities. The three systems overlap to represent the interconnectedness of self, family, and work. Someactivities you do may really fulfill needs in more than one area. For instance, you may enjoy playinga sport to contribute to your goal of staying physically fit. Perhaps other members of your familyalso enjoy the sport and you spend time playing together. That activity also meets your goal ofspending time having fun as a family.The systems also influence each other. For instance, work affects family life by providing a meansof earning money or affecting the schedule of family activities. Families can affect work by restoringworkers for their work roles or serving as a source of frustration that may carry over into work life.Additional systems could be considered that effect self, work, and family, such as the economicsystem, political systems, or cultural systems.Learning to look at work and family as systems related to you will help you take a new perspectiveon providing for your health and well-being. It is important to see how these important systems areinterrelated, interconnected, and interdependent in your own life now and in the future. /10-10.01MEM Managing Work and Family ResponsibilitiesYou Can Manage Juggling the many responsibilities associated with the work of the family requires skill in management.The purpose of management is to use the resources you have to bring about the results you want. Resourcesare those things you can use to achieve your goals. Examples of resources include:Personal resources: knowledge, skills, creativity, time, or energyEnvironmental resources: natural gas, water, air, plants, minerals, or oilMaterial resources: money, equipment, or suppliesCommunity resources: businesses, government agencies, schools, orroadwaysAll of us possess resources. The management process involves decidinghow to use these resources to reach our goals. Read the situations belowand determine how each situation represents or does not represent anexample of good management. Answer the following questions for eachcase study. Following your review of the situations, make a list of thecharacteristics of good management.Which resources are most important to this situation? Least important? Why?What are the consequences of this situation?Would you make different management choices in the same situation? Why or why not?I 1.Cassie is on a limited food budget.

Thenanswer the questions at the bottom of the page. Kenny is having a surprise birthday dinner for his dad. A few days before the dinner he plans themeal. Using some recipe books from the library, he chooses several of his dad's favorite foods.Since Kenny knows his dad is on a diet, Kenny tries to choose low fat recipes. Good thing he tooka nutrition course at school last fall! A birthday cake is a tradition in Kenny's family, and thoughhe considers purchasing a box cake mix, he decides to use his grandmother's recipe for an angelfood cake and make it from scratch.On the day of the party, Kenny drives the family car to the grocery store while his dad is at work.He shops for all the ingredients he needs, considering cost and quality. He pays for the grocerieswith his earnings from his part -time job.At home, Kenny puts the perishable foods in the refrigerator. He checks his time schedule andbegins to prepare the food for dinner. When he looks at the recipe for the cake, he realizes it's agood thing he has an electric mixer. About two hours before the dinner, he starts to feeloverwhelmed. Maybe he should have purchased a cake that had already been prepared. He decidesto ask a friend over to help. With an extra pair of hands, the work goes faster. After he sets the tableand the food is ready, he takes the cake out of the oven.When his dad comes home after work, he is definitely surprised. Kenny's goal is accomplished!

Nutrition and Wellness Managing Work and Family Responsibilities Smart Tips for Time Management When you are working toward your nutrition and wellnessgoals, you will have many different types of resources tomanage: personal, community, environmental, and material.Among your most important personal resources is time. Timeis something of which we all have the same amount. How youuse this valuable resource can make a difference in whetheror not you achieve your goals. Here are some suggestions formanaging your time. 1.Establish realistic nutrition and wellness goals that reflect your values. For long-term goals suchas maintaining a healthy weight, you will want to establish short-term goals, such as exercisingfor 20 minutes four days a week or choosing the recommended number of servings from eachof the levels of the Food Guide Pyramid. These more specific short-term goals will help youestablish priorities about how to spend your time. 2.Use some time to plan your time. You can get organized when you think ahead about how yourtime will be used. Keep a daily or weekly calendar on which to schedule activities, includingthose related to nutrition and wellness. Make specific time schedules for complicated or time-consuming tasks, so that you use time to your greatest advantage. When developing a timeschedule, consider the following ideas:Set a time when the task is to he completed and work backwards from that time to sequencethe tasks.Estimate how long each task will take, but be prepared to be flexible if special circumstancesoccur.Dovetail tasks to do more than one job at the same time. 3.Make \"to do\" lists and prioritize the items on your list. Cross items off your list as they areaccomplished.Divide large and time-consuming tasks into smaller tasks. Some timemanagement experts recommend doing unpleasant tasks first to get them out of the way. 4.Use small amounts of time. Could ten minutes at the end of your lunch period be used for a walkto get some exercise? Could you use the time waiting at a doctor's office to relax and read yourfavorite book? A conscious decision about the use of small amounts of time can help you findextra time for some of your nutrition and wellness goals. 5.Whenever possible, try to share nutrition and wellness tasks with others. Preparing food for afamily is a time-consuming job for one person, but when shared, becomes far less overwhelm-ing. Sharing and delegating tasks is an important part of planning your time. Consider the timeavailable for each person, other activities scheduled, skills, abilities, and interests. 6.Periodically, evaluate your use of time. How do you feel about your progress toward yournutrition and wellness goals? Have you been effectively using time to accomplish those goals?Why or why not? Did your activities reflect your priorities? Is it time to set new goals? 23 3 0 Nutrition and Wellness Managing Work and Family Responsibilities Achieving Your Nutrition and Wellness Goals:How Well Do You Manage Time?

The focus of this process skill is to help students develop practicalproblem-solving skills to be used in planning, implementing, and evaluating lab experiencesthroughout the course. These skills include identifying problems, finding adequate and reliableinformation, creating alternatives, predicting consequences, and using criteria and standards tochoose alternatives that are best for self and others. As part of this module, students will receivean overview of course content, establish lab practices, and participate in the first lab experienceof the course.Since the content of the process competencies remains relatively the same over the six core courseareas of the Work and Family Life program, the teacher background information for this moduleis the same as that printed in the problem-solving modules of previous guides. The learningactivities, however, have been designed specifically for this course area and complement thecontent modules found in the remainder of this guide. 2734 (-PROCESSMODULE Ao RationaleSolving Personal and Family Problems Teacher Background Information The quality of work and family life depends on the ability to solve practical problems. These practicalproblems are complex, each with a varying context, requiring reasoning about what is best to believeand do in changing contextual conditions. Unfortunately, there is evidence (Perkins, 1985; Laster, 1987) toindicate that both youth and adults do not reason well to answer everyday what-to-do questionsespeciallyproblems involving actions that will affect the well-being of others. Perkins (1987) found that normaleducation at the high school, college, and graduate school levels had only a slight impact on everydayinformal reasoning skills. In fact, with the exception of home economics, educational programs do little todevelop the value reasoning skills needed to solve these human survival and family life problems.All educators are responsible for helping students prepare for their future by developing the critical andcreative thinking skills involved in solving problems. Deep, elaborative, and constructive thinking isrequired for learners to have meaningful !earnings that can be remembered and used later. Since half of theinformation in any field is estimated to become outdated in six years, \"students will be better equipped forthe future if they are good thinkers rather than good memorizers of a fixed body of knowledge\" (Willis,1992, p. 1). Employers' competitive edge is increasingly dependent on their employees' basic thinkingskills, and \"workers are being challenged as never before\" since they often lack the needed learning,creative thinking, and problem-solving skills (Carnevale et al., 1990).As problems become more complex and lead to farther reaching moral consequences, individuals needhelp in developing their moral reasoning abilities. Individual and family issues as well as many of thesignificant problems facing society today have complex moral dimensions. Issues such as family violence,meaningful education, quality environment, care of the young and elderly, declining moral and ethicalbehavior, increasing self-centeredness, and declining civic responsibility require practical, moral reasoningat family, community, and global levels. Such reasoning is necessary because the contexts of these prob-lems are constantly changing: the global environment, people and their developmental stage, relationshipsbetween people, and value priorities.Recent developments in cognitive psychology and home economics have led to the conclusion that think-ing and learning skills can be modified. Practical intelligence, a set of learning and thinking skills neededfor solving everyday problems, can be developed when adolescents are missing essential cognitive pro-cesses. Both Martin (1988) and Vulgamore (1991) were able to significantly increase their students' levelof decision making by offering formal instructional activities. These findings suggest the need to formallyhelp students develop practical problem-solving skills, including decision-making and critical-thinkingprocesses.BackgroundFulfilling work and family roles involves solving both scientific and practical problems and using a varietyof thinking processes to solve those problems, as illustrated in Table 1. Solving both scientific and practical 28 Solving Personal and Family Problems PROCESSMODULE2Table 1Thinking Processes Used in Work and Family Life Problems Practical Problem Solving Scientific Problem Solving Decision MakingPlanning Process[Uses practical reasoning to [Uses scientific reasoning to [Uses technical steps to.[Uses technical steps asanswer a practical or valuequestion concerning what toanswer theoretical Whatis, question:management select,carry out, and managebelieve and do, deciding whataction is best to take.controls, what factors, why,how does2 ]reasoning is assumed andnot encouraged. ]projects.]Considers the questions:whatto do, what should be done,or what ought to be done?

How-ever, scientific and practical problem-solving processes differ in the types of knowledge needed to solvethe problem.Scientific problems, such as what is, why, and how questions, require scientific reasoning in whichconclusions are reached from factual knowledge and inferences gained through observations. Practicalproblems, on the other hand, involve value questions that require rational and moral judgments, affectingpeople and their well-being. Thus both factual knowledge and value knowledge are used to solve practi-cal problems.Practical problem solving, as identified in Table 1, is the process used to decide what is best to do whenfaced with a practical problem. An important component of this process is practical reasoning. Practicalreasoning is the part of the practical problem-solving process required for coming to the best conclusionabout what to do. Practical reasoning involves high-level thinking and deep, elaborative informationprocessing, including both critical and creative thinking skills. Critical thinking skills such as assessinginformation accurately, judging the viability of alternatives, and making a decision, are important to thisprocess. In addition, creative thinking skills such as imagining consequences, conceptualizing alterna-tives, and empathizing with others are important to practical reasoning.Work and family life problems have consequences that may benefit or harm people, and therefore involvemoral consequences. Because complex problems often involve many values, people frequently experi-ence value conflicts when trying to decide between alternative actions or choices. A major component ofpractical reasoning is value reasoning. Value reasoning means reaching conclusions, inductively ordeductively, from values or value principles. Value reasoning involves clarifying the values held by thoseinvolved in a particular problem situation, but goes beyond values clarification to consider the conse-quences of values and evaluate and consciously select the values that should guide actions. Fundamen-tally, value reasoning distinguishes practical problem solving from scientific problem solving, traditionaldecision making, and planning processes (See Table 1).Practical reasoning involves determining an action or actions that have the best reasons for choosing thatparticular action. The best reasons are (1) reliable, truthful, relevant, and adequate supporting facts and(2) morally defensible value claims. Morally defensible value claims are reasons thrt show concern thatthe consequences of the action benefit all who are or will be affected by the act (Coombs, 1971).For example, possible actions and their potential consequences are evaluated, using these values or valueprinciples as criteria to decide what ought to be. Therefore, good practical reasoning involves weighingalternative courses of action and determining which course of action (1) is based on reliable, relevant, andadequate reasons, and (2) fulfills the moral value principle of best consequenceactions benefit, not harm,all who are (or will be) affected with both short-term and long-term effectsto the highest degree possiblewithin the bounds of morality (Coombs, 1971).The planning process used in the FHA/HERO program is a management tool to guide an individual orgroup in selecting and carrying out projects to fit their needs and concerns. It is not a reasoning tool. 30 Solving Personal and Family Problems \\1/4( PROCESS 1)MODULE 4.4Practical reasoning, as compared to the planning process in Table 1, is the most appropriate reasoningprocess for (1) deciding which problem or concern should be selected for action; (2) deciding which goalsto set; (3) deciding who, what, when, and where the activity should take place; and (4) evaluating thesuccess of the activity using value standards or criteria selected as part of the goal. Practical reasoningwill need to be used repeatedly in forming the plan. Encouraging students to collaboratively decide onthe values they will use to decide among alternative actions or to create an action is the key to goodpractical reasoning.When using the practical problem-solving thinkers\" to multiple possibilities and alternativesConsider alternative viewpointsUse and search for evidence to support and refute alternative viewpointsAnticipate and evaluate consequences of actions- Evaluate alternative actions with a variety of criteria or value standards2.Are reflective and deliberate, searching extensively when appropriate3.Believe in being rational4.Believe thinking can be effective5.Use intellectual standards and criteria for assessing their thinking and the thinking of others6.Are ethical and moral thinkersMorally awaresensitive to ethical and unethical beliefs and actions and their consequencesin everyday life- Concerned about the interests of others rather than only their own interestsPractical reasoning is a process that is needed daily in our everyday lives to make the best decisions forall affected. Individuals develop their practical reasoning abilities through individual, family, class,and organizational practical problem solving. As problems become more complex and lead to farther-reaching consequences, individuals need help in developing their reasoning abilities and practicalreasoning skills in larger and more complex groups.

A problem is a situation in which something must be solved or worked outa process that involves selectingfrom many possible solutions. Throughout life, people face a variety of problems. Learning how to solveproblems is part of developing your fullest potential as a person.There are different kinds of problems. Scientific problems involve specific knowledge and \"how to\"questions. Solving scientific problems means using factual knowledge, such as statistics, concepts, prin-ciples, and procedures. Practical problems involve value questions that require both value knowledge andfactual knowledge. Practical problems typically affect people and their well-being. They are action-focusedand involve questions about what to believe and do. Some examples of practical problems related tonutrition and wellness areWhat should I do about maintaining a healthy weight?What should I do about planning family meals?What should I do about world hunger? Practical problms have distinct characteristics that make themdifferent from scientific problems. Practical problemsInvolve conflicting valuesAre complicated and thus messy to solveFrequently have no one right solutionHave consequences for self and othersAre action problemsInvolve the thoughts, feelings, values, and needs of othersAre dependent on the context or situation in which the problem occursArc poorly-structuredCan he unclear in terms of the information needed to solve the problem Write three practical problems related to nutrition and wellness that you have faced recently. Solving Personal and Family Problems My Nutrition and Wellness Problem-Solving Profile How do you make your nutrition and wellness choices? Place a check mark in front of those items thatdescribe how you go about making choices. 1.I take time to think about the food I eat. 2.I carefully consider a variety of options before choosing the behaviors that contribute to a healthylifestyle. 3.I try not to think about food, but just eat what is available. 4.I usually consider the nutritional consequences of my food choices. 5.I usually exercise whenever I feel like it and don't worry about it.6. When choosing food, I usually eat whatever my friends do. 7.I usually choose behaviors that have the most positive consequences for my own wellness andthe wellness of others. 8.I consider the values, needs, and feelings of others before making nutrition and wellness choicesthat affect myself and others. 9.I choose foods that promote well-being of myself and others.10. I usually ignore nutrition and wellness problems and hope they go away. Read the characteristics of reasoning and nonreasoning approaches on How Do You Solve PracticalProblems?

Solving Personal and Family Problems REASONThrough Practical ProblemsTeacher Information In order to reason through practical problems and find the best solution for self and others, it is important to considermany things about the problem, the situation, the possible solutions, and the consequences of each choice. TheREASONmodel can he a guide for thinking through complex practical problems. The components do not needto be used in the order given, but each component is important to the reasoning process.Recognizethe Problem:Practical problems can be very complex, andsometimes just identifying the problem itselfcan be a real challenge. Each practical prob-lem has a unique context, and the context ofthe problem can influence the solution. Atthis point, it is important to consider whatone really wants to happen when the problemis resolved; in other words, determine the\"desired ends.\"What is the problem?Why is it important to address the problem?What is the context of the problem?What caused the problem?Who is involved?What factors about this problem will affect thedecision about what to do?What resources are available?What situational factors affect the situation?What goals do you have for the solution to the problem?What are the desired ends you want to requires both fac-tual and value information. Factual informa-tion includes the concepts and knowledge thatwill help in developing and evaluating choices.Value information includes personal values,the values of others involved, and values thatwill help you in making an ethical choice.What factual information is needed?Where can you obtain this factual information?What are your personal values regarding this problemsituation? Which of these values are most important?What are the values of others involved in this situation? Howwill those values influence your decision about what to do?What criteria will you use to decide which choice is best? These is always more than one choice in-volved in a practical problem. Sometimes theremay he many choices. Even doing nothingabout a problem is a choice. Each choicecarries with itpossible consequencesconsequences for self and others, as well asboth short-term and long-term consequences.What choices are possible?What are the short-term and long-term consequences oeach choice?What are the consequences for you and for others? Making a decision about which alternative isbest means evaluating each alternative againstthe value information and desired ends.Which choice best reflects the values you have and the endsyou aesire regarding this problem?Which choice would result in the most positive conse-quences for you and others?Which choice works best for this particular situation?Problems are not solved until a reasoned deci-sion is put into action. Action requires carefulplanning. Evaluating the outcome of a choice will helpdetermine the success of the solution andwhat was learned from solving the problem.What skills do you need to carry out this choice?What resources do you need to carry out this choice?What barriers exist that might prevent you from takingaction? How con you overcome these barriers?How can you organize the various tasks needed to achievethis solution?Would you make the same choice again? Why or why not?What have you learned?How will this problem-solving experience affect your prob-lem solving in the future?Did your actions enhance the well-being of self and others?Were your actions ethical? 46 Nutrition and Wellness Solving Personal and Family Problems Nutrition and Wellness Decisions: Values in Action Each time someone makes a decision regarding nutrition and wellness issues, certain types of values arerepresented in that decision. In the left column below, types of values are described. For each type ofvalue listed below, write two examples of nutrition and wellness decisions that reflect that value. Adecision could reflect more than one type of value at a time. Types of Values Decisions That Reflect That Value Health and safety values reflect aconcern for physical well-being. Aesthetic values reflect a concernfor appearance and beauty. Environmental values reflect aconcern for the quality of theenvironment. Religious values reflect a concernfor following religious doctrine. Economic values reflect a concern forcost control, efficiency, and management. Intellectual values reflect a concernfor education, reasoning, and logic. Prudential values reflect a concernfor one's own interest. Moral values reflect a concern forothers' well-being. 174 Solving Personal and Family ProblemsYOU BE THE JUDGE:What is Reliable Nutrition and Wellness Information?

Strategies for relating to those different from self Teacher Note: In the Nutrition and Wellness Core Course area, the focus of this process skill is tohelp students develop communication skills to use when making nutrition and wellness decisionswith family members, friends, coworkers, and community members. The process module activities'develop interpersonal skills that will be practiced in cooperative group work, including food labs,throughout the course.Since the content of the process competencies remains relatively the same over the six core courseareas of the Work and Family Life program, the teacher background information for this module isthe same as that printed in the Relating to Others process modules of previous guides. The learningactivities, however, have been designed specifically for this core course area and complement thecontent modules found in the remainder of this guide. 57 PROCESS 2)MODULE 0 RationaleRelating to Others Teacher Background Information Interpersonal, group effectiveness skills are the keystones to maintaining friendships, a stable family, asuccessful career, and strong communities. Yet, no one is born with these skills. Each person must learnthese skills and choose to use them. Although many students learn the needed social skills in their fami-lies and through community experiences, others lack basic social skills. Frequently, this ineptitudepersists into adulthood. These students are often isolated, alienated, and disadvantaged in career trainingprograms. Such \"poor peer relationships have widespread immediate and long-term effects on students'cognitive and social development, well-being, happiness, success, and psychological health\" (Johnson, etal., 1990, p. 87).The need to develop interpersonal relationship skills in the Work and Family Life Program is supportedby six major reasons. 1.Changes in families and society reduce the time and other resources available to enable parents tomodel, nurture, and develop the social skills needed for our complex contemporary life. Childrenlearn their social skills through their family experiences, yet hectic schedules limit family interactiontime. According to one study, typical American adolescents spend only about five minutes a dayalone with their fathers and 40 minutes alone with their mothers. On the average, an additional hour isspent with both parents. With the addition of about 15 minutes with other adults, the adolescentssampled in this study spent about two hours a day with adults other than teachers (Csikiszentmihaly& McCormack, 1986). Mealtime conversation also is declining. Of 2,004 families polled in 1976, 74percent of those with children ages 7 to 17 ate dinner together frequently. By 1986 this number haddropped to 63 percent (Roper Organization, 1987; Rubenstein, 1988). With smaller families-3.5family members in 1950 to 2.6 in 1990 (Aburdene & Naisbitt, 1992), interaction time with siblings iseven reduced. Furthermore, with increasing numbers of children living with only one parent, opportu-nities to observe parent communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution is also limited. Conse-quently, opportunities for developing communication, negotiating skills, and problem solving at homeare decreasing. 2.Strong caring relationship skills will strengthen families. Such skills will help reduce the currentlyincreasing incidents of suffering experienced from family violence, divorce, and dysfunctionalfamilies. Understanding differences in the needs of family members and others, and having the skillsto respond in sincere, supportive ways rather than in dominating, violent, or uncompromising wayswould help reduce these rising statistics and encourage optimum development of family, .,,orkplace,and community members. 3.Relationships encourage or constrain the development of children and adults (Thomas, 1992). Asshown in Figure 1, caring, respectful relationships encourage development (Bronfenbrenner, 1990;McGovern, 1990). Insensitive, unresponsive, intrusive, and dominating relationships constrain C 4581 Relating to Others PROCESS 2MODULE %-7development. Sensitive friends, colleagues, spouses, parents, employers, and community and govern-ment leaders obtain information from the verbal and nonverbal cues of others, then respond to thoseneeds in ways that meet the needs of those significant others. Reciprocity builds on this sensitivityand responsiveness to insure mutual give and takemutual sharingcommunication at its highestlevel. Finally, optimum relationships are supportive. Supportive relationships are caring relationshipsthat help the other person meet his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Such support involvesdeep, reflective, thoughtful, and deliberate planning to create an enriching, empowering environmentrather than to control or dominate the other person (Thomas, 1992). Figure 1Interaction Patterns ThatENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENTInteraction Patterns ThatCONSTRAIN DEVELOPMENTSUPPORTconvey trust, interest, confidence; providean enriching environment that assists theother person in meeting their needs andpursuing their interests.DOMINATIONdirect and control other person's thoughts,feelings, actions, and activities for pur-poses that do not include that person's needsor interests; exert power over other person.RECIPROCITYpractice exchange, mutual give andtake, turn-takingINTRUSIVENESSinterfere with other person's goals andactivitiesRESPONSIVENESSrespond to other person's ways that meet themUNRESPONSIVENESStake actions unconnected to otherperson's other per-son's from Thomas ( I992a). 4.To increase their competitive edge, American employers need employees with these interpersonalskills and an appreciation for diversity. Higher productivity, product quality, and increased quality ofwork life have been linked conclusively with the team approach in the work place (Carnevale, et al,1990, p. 32). Success depends on individuals at all levels of the work force getting along with eachother. Increased cultural diversity and participative problem solving and decision making increasepotential disagreements and the need for group effectiveness skills. Good communication, coopera-tive team work, and negotiating skills provide the foundation for successful leadership and organiza-tional effectiveness. 5.As new technology continues to he introduced into all aspects of our society, caring, respectfulrelationships in the private and public domains are needed as a counterbalance. John Naisbitt ob-served that with the continuing invasion of technology into our factories, offices, schools, homes, andhealth care systems, \"we must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the spiritual 596 5 Relating to Others PROCESS 2_,)MODULEdemands of our human nature\" (1982, p. 40). As technology continues to invade and at times domi-nate our lives, the need for a compensatory \"high touch\" of caring, respectful relationships is basic tomeeting the \"spiritual demands of our human nature.\" 6.As women make life choices that take them away from caregiving occupations and their families, theneed to help both males and females develop loving ways of life is imperative. Today more than threequarters of the caregiving in our own country continues to be provided by women (Sommers &Shields, 1988). Although the exploitation of women as caregivers needs to be changed, the prospectof women ceasing to provide caregiving is horrendous (Noddings, 1988). Who will care for us, asadults, when we are tired, dejected, depressed, misunderstood?BackgroundRelationships with others are an inescapable part of everyday life. In relationships with peers, familymembers, employers, colleagues, and authority figures, interactions continuously move through a rela-tionship life cycle (Portnoy, 1986). This model is.particularly useful in illustrating the development ofworking relationships, such as in classrooms or workplaces, but also reflects the stages experienced inpersonal and family relationships. Seven stages are included in the relationship life cycle: I.Establishing trust2.Becoming acquainted3.Forming attachments4.Clarifying roles and expectations, negotiating to reach consensus, and modeling5.Integration and commitment6.StabilityJOLTDisturbance in relationship7.InstabilityAt any time, a disturbance may interfere with the relationship, resulting in the seventh stage, instability.Basically, when individual or group needs are not met, a relationship becomes strained and instable. Forexample, one person's behavior may be inconsistent with the expectations of another, or a role changemay create instability in the relationship. Misunderstandings may also cause relationship instability. Suchinstability may be resolved by reexamining and clarifying roles, redefining expectations, renegotiating,and possibly modeling.Basic interpersonal skills are needed throughout this relationship life cycle in all contexts. These basicskills include communicating (speaking and listening by mutually sharing meanings and feelings),empathizing with and correctly identifying the emotions of others, working cooperatively with others,negotiating for consensus, and resolving conflict (Carnevale, et al, 1990; Bolin 1990; Westlake &Westlake, 1992). The Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills specified thefollowing interpersonal competencies as essential for the workplace: 601 Relating to Others PROCESSel)MODULEParticipates as member of a teamcontributes to group effortTeaches others new skillsServes clientsworks to satisfy clients' expectationsExercises leadershipcommunicates ideas to justify positions, persuades and convinces others,responsibly challenges existing procedures and policiesNegotiatesworks toward agreements involving exchange of resources, resolves divergent interestsWorks with diversityworks well with men and women from diverse backgroundsHow we relate to others as we use these skills depends on many factors, including one's individualdifferences and identity development. People differ in many ways. We differ in age and gender, physi-cally and developmentally, economically, culturally, racially, ethnically. religiously, and occupationally.From our first encounters with others, these differences are apparent and influence our trusting others,becoming acquainted, and forming attachments.Individual differences can be empowering in relationships or oppressive. While accepting and valuingcultural, racial, and ethnic differences can empower, discrimination based on ethnocentrism, racism,prejudice, and stereotyping is oppressive and limits self-formation and self-actualization. When develop-ment is limited by oppression. society cannot benefit from the contributions of all its people , -,(1 thequality of life suffers for all. Understanding these differences begins with understanding cultur, . con-cepts:1. Culture: the way of life of a people. The sum of a people's learned behavior patterns, attitudes, andmaterial things. Within a country, cultural groups may differ in ethnicity, race, and/or religion.2. Ethnicity: the affiliation of members of a group who retain the customs, language, or social values ofa group. Ethnocentrism occurs when individuals believe that their group is superior personally andculturally and must be protected and defended.3. Racism: systematic oppression of one race by another. Racism occurs at the individual, interpersonal,institutional, and/or cultural level. Like ethnocentrism, racism may be overt or covert, intentional orunintentional. 4.Prejudice: judgment or opinion about others made before one has the facts, and generalizing andapplying that judgment to individuals. Such prejudices may become stereotypes when the judgmentsand opinions become a fixed image of the characteristics and/or behavior of the members of a group.Stereotypes tend to dehumanize people by ignoring their characteristics as individuals. Bigotry occurswhen an individual is intolerant of beliefs and cultures other than his or her own. 5.Discrimination: any kind of action taken to deprive members of a certain group of their civil rights.Civil rights are the freedoms that people are entitled to as members of a community or nation. Indemocratic societies, civil rights include equal opportunity for schooling and employment, and equaltreatment under the laws. Relating to Others PROCESS 2)MODULE .7As we develop our identities (our consciousness about who we are and how we are alike and different fromothers), we have varying attitudes toward ourselves and others, and consequently, relate to others in varyingways depending upon our level of identity with the minority or dominant groups. Depending upon ourindividual differences and our perceptions of whether or not we are in the minority or majority, we mayrelate to others who are different from us in appreciating or depreciating ways; with anger, anxiety, guilt,fear or tolerance; in oppressing, patronizing, or controlling ways; or in nurturing, inclusive, open relation-ships.At the highest levels of identity, we appreciate ourselves and have selective appreciation of others who arefrom minority and majority groups. We are all, at one time or another, from a minority or majority group.Throughout life, we find ourselves in groups that have members who are like or different from us in age,gender, race, religion, ethnic background, ability, or occupation.The overall affective outcome of interpersonal relationships is caring. Developing an ethic of caring isessential if students are to build healthy relationships with peers, family members, and coworkers. NellNoddings (1988) has described caring as an ethical orientation to relationships. The ethic for caring isconcerned with moral behavior and not just moral judgment. Caring effectively requires interpersonalreasoning, skill, and moral affect. The power and necessity of interpersonal reasoning is described by KariWaerness:Caring is about relations between at least two people. One of them (the carer) shows concern,consideration, affection, devotion towards the other (the cared for). The one needing care isinvaluable to the one providing care, and when the former is suffering pain or discomfort, thelatter identifies with her or him and attends to alleviating it. Adult healthy people feel a needto be cared for by others in many different situations. Worn out, dejected, tired, depressedthere are many adjectives to describe states in which what we need or desire is for others 'to carefor us.' In such situations we may feel that we have a right to our need for care being met. Thismeans there must be others who feel that it is their duty or desire to honor this right (1984, p. 134).To prepare all students for their teamwork roles in the workplace and their future families, these skillsneed to be developed now by students who have not developed these skills in their present families andprevious school experiences. The quality of life in families and our workplaces depend on the develop-ment of these skills and the ethic of caring. ReferencesAburdene, P., & Naisbitt, J. (1992) Megatrends for women.

More subtle ways of avoiding conflict are denial. in which angry or hurt feelings are repressedinstead Of expressed, and accommodation, when opponents smooth over a potential conflict by apologizing, makingexcuses, or adapting their behavior to fit the other person's.Confrontation.This aggressive response reflects the belief that in every conflict, there must be a winner and a loser.Confronters are happy to hurl insults or threats. People whose conflict style is confrontational often base their threatson the authority or sense of power they consider rightfully theirs.Problem solving.Advocates of this response see conflict as something that happens in the natural scheme of humanrelationships. Their concern is to arrive at a solution that both parties can live with. Problem solvers frequently usecompromise (in which each party gives up what is less important in order to keep what is most important) orcollaboration (in which the disputants work together to explore the means by which the needs of both can he met,in a \"win-win\" solution).

The steps identifiedbelow can help you work toward resolving conflictsin ways that strengthen relationships because theyinvolve acting in caring, respectful ways. Step1 Show a genuine interest in resolving the issue. Choose a place to talk where you will befree from interruptions. State your goal to resolve the issue fairly for all involved. Asyou go through the process, focus on the problem, rather than making personal commentsabout the people involved.Step 2Take turns stating your positions, interests, and feelings clearly. When others arespeaking, listen actively without interrupting. Ask questions to clarify the perspectivesof others. Restate others' messages to clarify what has been said. When all parties feelthey have had the opportunity to express their feelings and thoughts, you are ready forthe next step.Step 3Make a list of possible solutions. Listen with an open mind and try to not to judge anypossible choices.Step 4Choose a solution that is best for all involved. Eliminate any solutions that are completelyunacceptable to anyone involved. Make a note beside those solutions that are acceptableto more than one party. It may be necessary to integrate different ideas into a singlesolution that may be more agreeable to all.Step 5Make a plan of action. Identify each party's role in carrying out the solution. Questionothers to make sure that they understand their role.Step 6Set a time to talk later and review your progress.Some behaviors can make it difficult to use the win-win process and serve as a barrier to reachingan agreement.

Since the content of the process competencies remains relatively the same over the six core courseareas of the Work andFamily Life program, the teacher background information is the same as thatprinted in previous guides. The learning activities, however, have been designed specifically for thiscourse area and complement the content modules found in the remainder of this guide. Assuming a Leadership Role CPROCESS AMODULETeacher Background InformationRationaleLeaders are needed wherever there are groups of people. Empowering leaders, rather than authoritarianleaders, are especially needed in our complex, changing global age. Authoritarian leaders have powerover people, but empowering leaders help people shape their own vision and goals and work towardachieving those goals. Leadership must be developed in families and other groups with real issues andconcerns. Historically, many people believed that leaders were born, not made, and that great leaderswere discovered, not developed. However, there is now \"consensus among social scientists that leader-ship skills and competencies are not inherited from one's ancestors, that they do not magically appearwhen a person is assigned to a leadership position\" (Johnson & Johnson, 1987. p. 119).Leadership development is ultimately self-development, and can be enhanced in a variety of settings.Teachers, employers, and other leaders who have high expectations and support the self-development ofthose they lead can help others develop confidence in their ability to lead and make a difference. Parents,however, are perhaps the most influential in developing leadership abilities. One researcher concludedthat formal education, mentoring, and other activities in adult life have less influence on the developmentof leadership ability than parental expectations and values and skills reinforced very early in life (Kouzes& Posner, 1987).Most young people face the challenge of genuine leadership for the first time in their teenage years.During this important time in their lives, young people need guidance and encouragement to experiencethe realities and rewards of participatory, shared leadership. Family, educational settings, and studentorganizationssuch as Future Homemakers of America/Home Economics Related Occupations (FHA/HERO) can provide the laboratories for developing the values, beliefs, and skills underlying empoweringparticipatory leadership. Through shared leadership experiences in these settings, young people candiscover that they can make a difference in the well-being of those around them.BackgroundOur democratic society is made up of many groups: private groups, such as families; and public groups,such as neighborhoods, cities, states, and nations. Within communities are civic, social, educational,professional. and religious organizational groups. The purpose of these groups is to help people meettheir needs for love, caring, sharing, giving and receiving, and belonging, and to resolve family or publicissues facing group members.By joining together, group members are more likely to have their needs met than if they try to meet theirneeds alone. Many human needs, such as loving, caring, sharing, and giving and receiving, can be metonly through groups. such as the family or social or religious groups. To resolve issues affecting groupmembers, groups need to (1) complete tasks and (2) maintain effective working relationships between themembers. 76 Assuming a Leadership Role PROCESS A)MODULE -*Leadership is the process of helping a group shape a vision of its purpose and goals, and of gettingpeopleboth inside and outside the groupto commit and recommit themselves to accomplishing thatvision (Woyach, 1991). Effective leadership styles, regardless of the personality or style of the leader,satisfy the group members' needs, achieve their goals, and build the group members' abilities and ,elf-esteem. Leaders who empower others help group members feel confident to act on their ownauthorityon their own judgmentand support the decisions made, even if the decisions are mistakes.True leaders view mistakes as opportunities for learning rather than as opportunities for humiliation(Aburdene & Naisbitt, 1992).Leaders are needed in groups to help group members shape a shared sense of purpose or vision, get thingsdone to meet their needs and goals, and create a cooperative relationship between members. Sharedparticipatory leadership, one of the three leadership styles shown in Figure 1, has been shown to be themost effective in increasing production, innovation, and responsible self-direction and initiative (Peters &Austin, 1985; Bennis & Nanus, 1985; Johnson & Johnson, 1987). Shared leadership means:1.All group members can and should perform leadership functions appropriate to each person and togroup needs. Any member can influence group behavior.2. The leader of the group encourages other group members to make decisions and initiate actionwithout seeking the leader's approval (Carnevale, et al., 1990). Figure 1Consequences of Leadership StylesManagement: Leadership:Authority Power-o- op- Empowering Others Director Style Shared Democratic Style Delegator Style Control Involve InspireDirect Cooperate smallest democraciesare characterized by interactive shared leadershipstyles. For instance, healthy families allow all members of the family to be included in family problemsolving when they are likely to have an opinion. Such interactive, participatory, shared leadership hasbeen shown to be effective in all types of groups and organizations in increasing the responsible self-direction, initiative, and morale of all group members and the quality of decisions and work (Peters &Austin,1985;Benni! & Nanus, 1985;Johnson & Johnson, 1987).Assuming a Leadership Role Thus, different members of a group can share leadership by assuming the behaviors needed to lead to thesuccess of the group. For example, in families each spouse may assume behaviors necessary to completefood-preparation or money-management tasks at different times in the family life cycle, and similarly,each may assume nurturing or caring behaviors to maintain collaborative relationships in the family. Insocial or civic groups, each group member may beCome a leader by proposing activities to complete atask, or to reduce tensions between other group members.Responsible citizenship in a democratic society involves individual accountability and action for thecommon good of the group. Being a responsible family member requires taking action for the commongood of the familynot action for the good of individuals in the family to the detriment of another familymember or the family as a whole. Similarly, being a responsible citizen requires taking action for thecommon good of community members. Responsible citizenship begins in families as children learn tocare for themselves, family members, pets, their home, and nei-thborhood.Responsible citizens are concerned about the well-being of all society members and take social action tomeet those needs. Such action can range from providing social services to those in need of mercy andcompassion, to working for social justice for those being oppressed, mistreated, or denied their rights.Such social-justice action might take the form of advocating justice in individual cases or working forpublic policy change. Social action for public policy development, like other responsible citizenship,should bring about change and transformation for the good of citizens in the community, state, nation, orworld.To successfully bring about social change, six principles of social transformation provide guidance forsocial action (Aburdene & Naisbitt, 1992).Responsible citizens1. Use a win-win perspective rather than a win-lose perspective2.Begin at the grass roots rather than at the top3. Use what works (and is right) rather than what is \"politically correct\"4. Work toward choice rather than from bureaucratic limitations5. Become advocates rather than victims6. Invest in entrepreneurs rather than providing government aidMore than ever before, shared democratic leadership is needed in families, workplaces, communities, andgovernment at all levels. Such responsible citizenship will bring about the social action and change that isneededior the common good of our global community. 78 Assuming a Leadership Role PROCESS A)MODULE \"TVocational student organizations provide a unique program of career and leadership development, moti-vation, and recognition exclusively for middle and junior high, secondary, postsecondary, adult, andcollegiate students enrolled in vocational education programs.

It is difficult to achieveeducational, career, or interpersonal goals if one does not feel well. By developing positive wellnesshabits now, the chances of developing chronic illnesses will be decreased. \\CONTENTMODULEPromoting Wellness and Good Health The Center for Disease Control estimates that nearly one half of the deaths in the United States are due tounhealthy behaviors or lifestyles. Our nation continues to be burdened by preventable illness, injury, anddisability. Effective prevention could lessen the occurrence of the illnesses and injuries reflected in thedata below.Heart Disease: 6 million cases; 490,000 deaths per strokes per year; 145,000 deaths per yearCancer:1 millica cases per year; 506,000 deaths to 1.5 million 118,000 AIDS million hospitalizations per year; 142,500 deaths per year; 177,000 with spinal cord injuriesAlcoholism: 18.5 million people abuse alcohol; 105,000 alcohol-related deaths per yearLow-birth weight babies: 260,000 born per year; 23,000 deaths per yearThese illnesses have consequences for our economic system in terms of greater health care costs anddecreased productivity of our work force. Many of these expenses would be avoidable if Americans madehealthier lifestyle choices. Effective prevention could promote healthier and happier lives for individualsand families, increase the productivity of the work force, and lessen the economic burdens of health care.BackgroundWellness is the process by which individuals actively make choices to promote optimum health. Thisprocess is more than the absence of illness. Being well means taking responsibility for developing healthyhabits and making healthy choices. It means adopting a lifestyle that promotes optimum health in thefollowing dimensions (Heftier, 1984; Whitney & Sizer, 1989).Physical wellness includes caring for oneself with preventive behaviors such as exercising regularly,controlling weight, eating a balanced diet, caring for the body with rest, and avoiding tobacco, alcohol,and drugs.Social wellness involves developing meaningful interpersonal relationships, working within groups,and receiving and giving support when needed.Emotional wc illness includes managing and expressing feelings, coping with problems, solvingproblems, an i managing stress.Intellectual wellness involves self-acceptance, improving oneself, and engaging in creative andstimulating actiiities.Vocational wellness includes achieving and developing vocational competence and achieving balancebetween work and leisure.Spiritual wellness involves seeking meaning and purpose in life, giving and receiving love, joy, andpeace, and pursuing a fulfilling life, and contributing to the improvement of the spiritual health ofothers (Chapman, 1987). 1941 Promoting Wellness and Good Health One way to think of wellness is on acontinuum. At one end is a highlevel of wellness, characterized by ahigh level of energy and a feeling ofphysical, emotional, intellectual,and spiritual well-being. At theopposite end is a low level ofwellness, characterized by prema-ture death or disability resultingfrom several damaging healthhabits. This continuum is repre-sented in Figure 1. Some people on the low end of thecontinuum often rely on others toinfluence their health. Thosepeople at the high end demonstratea high level of responsibility andmotivation for maintaining theirown health.Most people function somewhere inthe middle of the continuum, asopposed to either extreme end. Infact, the level of wellness asrepresented on the continuum, maychange at various times as a resultof a specific decision regardingwellness. For instance, anadolescent's decision to experimentwith drugs or drive while intoxi-cated could result tragically in ill \\FSSpremature death, even though theymay have made many other positivewellness choices. Daily decisionsregarding healthy behaviors (for PRI NIIRI.smoking, and physical activity)would contribute to a graduallyimproved level of wellness overtime.Figure 1. Wellness Continuumexample, proper food choi..es, not of well-being Moderate levelof energy Free from achesand pains Lack of energy,inattention, minoraches and pains Chronic disorders ..,,CONTENT )MODULEPromoting Wellness and Good Health There are many factors that influence health and wellness. Some can be changed and others cannot.Heredity, or the traits and characteristics received genetically from parents, not only include physicalcharacteristics (such as eye color, hair color, and body build), but also a predisposition to certain diseases.Heart disease and certain types of cancer have been linked to genetic factors and cannot be changed.Some behaviors that can be altered are physical activity, nutrition, smoking, stress management, andalcohol and drug use. Increasing physical activity is one area adolescents can concentrate on when settingwellness goals. In spite of the fact that being physically fit can help one achieve a feeling of well-being,give one more energy, help control weight, manage stress, and reduce the risk of developing diseases,many Americans do not feel they get enough exercise. According to data provided in the report HealthyPeople 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objective \"not getting enoughexercise\" was the health concern chosen most often by both men and women. Eighty-two percent ofwomen and seventy-one percept of men felt they were getting less exercise than they needed. This datasuggests that individuals need to develop strategies for lifelong physical fitness. Since the primary reasongiven for lack of exercise is often lack of time, people need to adopt strategies that fit their lifestyles,improve time management skills, and incorporate fun and interesting activities. The idea is to develop aphysical fitness and wellness program that can be enjoyed throughout life.Activities like swimming, brisk walking, running, or jumping rope are activities that are called \"aerobic.\"This term means that the body uses oxygen to produce the energy needs for the activity. Aerobic exercisescan condition the heart and lungs if performed at the proper intensity for at least 30 minutes, three to fourtimes a week (Exercise and Your Heart, 1993). Regular aerobic physical activity increases a person'scapacity for exercise. It also plays a role in both primary and secondary prevention of diseases. Exercisecan help control blood lipid abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Aerobic exercise also has an indepen-dent, modest blood pressure-lowering effect for certain groups of people with high blood pressure.Another aspect of wellness goals is to develop strategies to manage stress. Stress is the nonspecificresponse of the human body to any physical or mental demands. Physically, the body responds to stressby an increased heart rate, irregular breathing, tensing of muscles, cold and sweaty palms, increasedadrenal hormones, and fatigue. Some stress may actually be a positive force in heightening performance,but acute and chronic stress depletes the body of nutrient reserves, and impairs the immune system, whichcan cause serious illness. To prevent harm from stress, prevention and coping skills are needed. Socialand emotional support systems, wise time management, and relaxation skills help minimize routine andcrises stress. Though one may choose many harmful behaviors when crises occur (drugs, alcohol, un-needed food, denial, withdrawal, or rationalization) adaptive coping behaviors that control and channelstress responses are needed. Displacement (channeling emotional energy into productive areas), relax-ation techniques (meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or self-hypnosis), and choosing not tobecome distressed can all be helpful.Environment, or the surroundings in which we live, can effect wellness. The people with whom onelives, works, or socializes can influence physical health habits, as well as intellectual and emotionalhealth. Other environmental factors such as available health care, geographic area, and pollutants can 96n Promoting Wellness and Good Health (CONTENT )MODULEalso have an impact on health. The most important factor, however, is behavior. The choices one makeswith regard to wellness on a daily basis can make a significant impact on wellness. Helping adolescentsunderstand that their decisions are a major factor in their level of wellness is essential to helping themhave a healthy future.The most successful health promotion programs focus on education and prevention rather than on thetreatment of diseases. When setting wellness goals for teens, critical issues include tobacco use, nutrition,exercise, stress management, alcohol, and other drugs. By educating students about better choices and therisks of each factor, the lifestyle behaviors they choose may improve.Over the years, wellness programs have focused on individuals, attempting to motivate them to changebehaviorsstop smoking, lose weight, or start exercising. The success of these programs was dependenton both the individual and environmental factors. The individual factors include knowledge, beliefs,attitudes, and skills. Many individuals have difficulty maintaining behavior change because their envi-ronment is not supportive of their efforts. Be it public policies, programs, or support systems, theseenvironmental factors need to be combined with individual factors in order to maintain healthful habitsover a lifetime.Essential to behavior change is a process that is the same no matter what behavior needs to be altered.This process includes the following stages: 1.Pre contemplation: individuals usually deny that a problem exists. They are not ready to face theproblem or make a change.2.Contemplation: during this stage, people begin to think a change may be a good idea. Changingbehaviors requires motivation and determination. It is important that people attempt goals that theytruly value or believe are important.3.Preparation: once a person has made a decision that a change is needed, he or she may try the newbehavior several times.4.Action: the individual attempts the new behavior regularly but has not been consistent for more thansix months. Setting goals and implementing action plans can help sustain the behavior in the longterm.5.Lapse/Relapse: no matter how well a person is progressing toward his or her goal, things happen tointerrupt the process of behavior change. How lapses are managed is critical and determines theperson's ability to get back on track quickly.6.Maintenance: the person is able to sustain the new behavior long enough for it to become a habit. Once individuals understand the process of behavior change, it is important to set goals and objectives forthe behaviors. The next step is to establish a plan to implement an effective wellness program. To assistin planning wellness activities, a National Health Observances calendar that includes the observanceslisted next may be helpful to give wellness programs a focus. 971\"3 Promoting Wellness and Good Health FebruaryAmerican Heart MonthMarchNational Nutrition MonthAprilCancer Awareness MonthMinority Health MonthMayHigh Blood Pressure MonthNational Physical Fitness and Sports MonthStroke Awareness MonthJuneNational Safety WeekSeptemberNational Cholesterol Education MonthWomen's Health MonthOctoberFamily Health MonthNovemberGreat American Smoke-OutNational Diabetes MonthGood sources of information are the numerous nonprofit health agencies, the health department, countyextension offices, exercise facilities, local hospitals, and businesses with wellness programs.

Anything like walking upstairs, gardening, raking leaves, or evenwalking home from work or school. Moderate-intensity physical activity can also come fromplanned exercise or recreation such as jogging, playing tennis, swimming, and cycling.Every American adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physicalactivity over the course of most days of the week.Changing from no activity to even a moderate level of activity can lead to a good reduction in riskfor disease.If you do not exercise on a regular basis, adopt a more consistent pattern of activity.If you do not currently engage in regular physical activity, begin slowly and build up gradually to30 minutes.Participate in physical activities that develop and maintain muscular strength and joint flexibility.The health benefits of a five-minute walk, four minutes of stair climbing, or a short spell in thegarden raking leaves are comparable to longer, more intense workouts.

Weight ControlThe Benefits of Exercise Exercise not only helps burn calories, but it also increases your basal metabolic rate, whichin turn helps you burn more calories when just resting.2. Looking BetterExercise not only bums fat but also firms your muscles. While dieting removes lean bodytissue and fat, exercise firms up your figure as it removes fat. Weight lost through dietingalone is 75 percent fat and almost 25 percent lean body mass. On the other hand, weightlost through a combination of diet and physical activity is about 98 percent body fat.Therefore, exercise contributes to a higher quality of weight loss. Dieting does nothingfor those muscles, while exercise firms them.3. Heart HealthIt appears that exercise improves your heart, blood, and blood vessels in the followingways:increases the number and size of your blood vesselsincreases the elasticity of blood vesselsincreases the efficiency of exercising muscles and blood circulationincreases the efficiency of the heartincreases tolerance of stressdecreases triglyceride and cholesterol levelsdecreases clot formationdecreases blood sugardecreases obesity and high blood pressure4.Feeling BetterExercise helps you feel better emotionally. Exercise is the perfect antidote to stress andsimple depression. Gain a feeling of self-confidence, stability, and calmness.5. Other BenefitsExercise can make you more flexible, cont, of your appetite, have more energy, and relievestress. 1161 Nutrition and WellnessPromoting Wellness and Good Health \"Couch potatoes\" are a bumper crop in this country. The Centers for Disease Control report that less than tenpercent of adults exercise at the level recommended by the Surgeon General. But most people know thatphysical activity offers tremendous health benefits.So Why Are We So Inactive?The reason most often given is lack of time. But studies show that doing something is better than doing nothing.You don't have to he a vigorous exerciser to obtain health benefits from activity. Just get up off the couch andtake a walk around the block! Or take the stairs instead of the elevator. Activities such as brisk walking,vigorous yard work, dancing, or other comparable activities provide health benefits if done regularly. Andthese can he fun ways to spend time with your friends and family. If you would like to \"get off the couch\" orhelp someone you know become more active, complete the Adopt-a-Couch-Potato event. This is a two-week activity for active and inactive people alike. First, decide whether you v.ould make a better \"Spud\" or \"Tater.\" A good \"Spud\" is someone who enjoysphysical activity and would like to share the fun with someone else. A good \"Tater\" is someone who wouldlike some support in becoming more active. Read How to be a Good \"Spud\"(p. 118) andHow to be a Good \"Tater\"(p. 119). Choose a partner based on whether you are a \"Tater\" or a \"Spud\" and complete Our Potato Pledge(p.120). Remember to choose moderate activities such as walking or other activities of a similar intensity.Sample Goals for \"Spuds\" and \"Taters\"For two weeks:\"Tater\" and \"Spud\" will walk together for ten minutes at least two times the first week and at least three times the second week. \"Tater\" and \"Spud\" will meet to walk at a park or recreation area in the community.\"Tater\" and \"Spud\" will meet during lunch at least one time to walk for 15 minutes.\"Tater\" will he active without \"Spud\" once each week. He or she will report activity to \"Spud.\"\"Spud\" will make a healthful change (give up fried foods, practice relaxation exercises) for the two-week time period.Sample Rewards for \"Spuds\" and \"Taters\" Go to a movie together Treat one another to a healthy meal at a restaurantSend cards, balloons, or flowers to \"Spuds\"Give \"Spud\" a t-shirt to wear when exercisingJoin an activity or class in the community to encourage physical activity S mrce: American Heart Association.

Adapted from Mental Health Is I. 2, 3. Alexandria, VA: National Mental Health Association, 1988. 122 Promoting Wellness and Good HealthDeveloping a Lifestyle Plan to Promote Wellness 1. Begin by reviewing the assessment of your present level of wellness, such as Is Wellness a Part ofYour Life? (p. 11 1 -112) and Wellness Lab Worksheet (p. 113). Identify specific goals related toimproving your overall level of wellness and write them on the diagram below. 2. List any difficulties you might have in achieving these goals. For instance, if you want to stopsmoking, you might have difficulty being around people who are smoking. In order to deal with thisdifficulty, you might avoid being in places where you know there will be others who smoke. As youidentify each difficulty, write one or two choices you have for dealing with that difficulty.3. Develop a plan of action that lists each goal, the activities you need to reach that goal, and thetimeline for accomplishing those activities.4. Decide when you will evaluate your progress toward your goal. For instance, you may choose tohave a support person review your progress with you on a weekly basis. 123 utrition and Wellness Promoting Wellness and Good Health Achieving Your Wellness Goals How can you go about achieving your wellness goals? Consider the following:Check Your MotivationMotivation is having the strong desire to achieve a set goal. Decide what being motivatedmeans to you. Motivated people enjoy working hard at something and mastering it. You haveto have a reason for doing what you are doing, in order to be motivated to do it. Be sure you aresetting a goal for yourself and not for anyone else. Set Definite and Reasonable GoalsThe goals you set should be reasonable and reachable, otherwise you may become discouraged.If your goals are large, try to break them down into smaller, more achievable goals. Believe in YourselfSometimes your good traits don't get enough attention. Stop for a minute each day and reflecton the good things you have done to reach your goals. Use Self-disciplineLearn to control yourself for days on end, not just a few hours at a time. Remember, it takes 21days to break a habit, so discipline yourself until your new changes are \"old hat.\" Avoid Letting Failures Turn into Failure HabitsAll successful people have failed at some point in their lives. They will tell you that often theyhave learned more from their failures than from their successes. Look at your mistakes to seewhere you went wrong. The only time you need to be ashamed of losing is when you use it asan excuse. Accept Responsibility for Yourself and Your ActionsYou are the only person who can help yourself achieve anything. Achievers live today in orderto prepare for tomorrow.

Nutrients consumed today affect normalgrowth and development, athletic performance, and even the potential to contract disease. A person'snutritional requirements are dictated by gender, any special needs, and where the person is in the lifecycle (for example, infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood).Adolescence is a critical time to examine food choices and establish healthy eating patterns. Eatingpatterns of teenagers may be different from those of other family members due to their growing indepen-dence, increased participation in social life, school activities, athletics, and increasing demands on per-sonal time. These factors significantly affect their food choices (Rees, 1992).Teens are particularly likely to fall prey to fallacies related to food choices, such as those associated withweight control or athletic performance. For instance, teens may believe that an ideal weight meanslooking like the thin (sometimes emaciated) models depicted in the media. Since these fallacies can bepotentially dangerous, it is highly beneficial to educate teens about these fallacies along with ways tomake healthy fobd choices.Background\"You are what you eat\" is an insightful axiom. It is well established that what one eats affects bothcurrent and future health. The 1990 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (United States Department ofAgriculture, 1990) recommend a limited intake of fat (especially saturated fat and cholesterol), sugar,sodium, and alcohol, and an increase intake of fiber, vitamins, and minerals through the consumption ofmultiple servings of fruits, vegetables, and grain products. These sensible nutrition practices can reducethe risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and the gastrointestinal diseases (gallbladder disease,diverticular disease, and alcoholic cirrhosis). This is an enlightening concept when one considers that theten leading causes of death in 1987 (Public Health and Human Service, 1986) were (from the highest tolowest incidence): 1.Heart disease (35.7 percent)2.Cancer (22.4 (7.0 percent)4.Unintentional injury (accident) (4.4 percent)5.Chronic obstructive lung disease (3.7 percent)6.Pneumonia and influenza (3.2 percent)7.Diabetes mellitus (1.8 percent)8.Suicide (1.4 percent)9.Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (1.2 percent)10.Atherosclerosis (1.1 percent) 128 Relating Food Choices to Wellness (CONTENT )MODULE2 Of these ten causes of death, five are associated, with diet (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis.and some forms of cancer) and three with excessive alcohol consumption (cirrhosis, accidents, andsuicide) (Public Health Service, 1988).Table 1 below shows how diet affects risk of disease (McGinnis & Nestle, 1989). Table 1Diet Changes Related to liver One's nutritional needs change throughout the life cycle, and at each stage all nutrients are important.However, various factors may place a person at risk for deficiencies. An infant receives solely breastmilk or special infant formulas for the first few months of life, and then semisolid foods are slowlyintroduced. All nutrients are important in infancy, but special emphasis is placed on iron, zinc, andvitamin D (Pipes, 1992). The nutrients most likely to be lacking in children are calcium, iron, zinc andvitamins C and A, and this occurs more frequently in low-income children (Lucas, 1992).Because adolescents are growing rapidly, they have increased protein and energy (carbohydrate) needs.Increased levels of thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin are recommended in large amounts to meet these highenergy re. ,uirements. Vitamin D is especially needed to accommodate rapid skeletal growth. Adoles-cents incorporate twice the amount of calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium into their bodies during theseyears as compared to any other time in the life cycle (Rees, 1993). Failure to meet these needs may resultin delay of sexual maturation and reduction in ultimate overall size. 129 CCONTENTMODULEAdRelating Food Choices to Wellness Adults' needs (ages 19 through 51) are addressed in detail in the NAS/NRC Recommended DietaryAllowances. Other stages in the life cycle are compared to these adult needs (National Research Council,1989). For the pregnant female, requirements for most all nutrients increase, particularly calories, pro-tein, folic acid, vitamin B-6, iron, and calcium. The daily caloric requirements of pregnancy are increasedby 300 calories, and the protein requirements increase by 10 to 16 grams per day, in comparison to non-pregnant requirements. For the lactating (breast-feeding) mother, most nutrient requirements are elevatedas well. The caloric requirements are increased 500 calories per day over the requirements for the non-pregnant woman, and the daily protein requirements are increased by 15 grams of protein (Worthington-Roberts, 1992).The elderly may have life situations that compromise their nutritional status, especially in those over theage of 70. These include financial restrictions, physical disabilities that interfere with purchase andpreparation of food, social isolation, and mental disorders. Many of the prescription medications taken bythe elderly can also adversely affect nutritional status (Podrabsky, 1992).Due to busy schedules, meal patterns of adolescents are often chaotic (Story, 1984). Teenagers miss moremeals at home as they get older, often skipping breakfast and lunch altogether. Females tend to missmore meals than males (Rees, 1992). Teenagers need to know that eating breakfast is actually advanta-geous to them (National Dairy Council, 1993). Eating breakfast can: (1) improve grades because eatingbreakfast enhances concentration, thereby resulting in fewer mistakes on tests and work completed moreefficiently; (2) improve athletic performance; and (3) reduce the urge to snack, which is especiallyappealing to those who are watching their weight.Where do teens get their information about nutritious food choices? Ja a recent survey of 1,409 seniorhigh school students, 36 percent responded that they obtained most of their nutrition knowledge fromtheir families, 33 percent from their schools, 9 percent from their doctor, 8 percent from television, 6percent from magazines, 2 percent from food packages, 1 percent from the newspaper, 1 percent fromtheir friends, and 4 percent \"didn't know\" (Harris/Scholastic Research, 1989). These sources may or maynot provide current, accurate information regarding food choices. Adolescents need help in understand-ing how to assess such information for reliability.One good source of reliable nutrition information that teenagers could use is the American DieteticAssociation. This organization's National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics now has a phone linededicated to answering any nutrition-related questions from consumers (800-877-1600, Extension 4853).A local chapter of the National Dairy Council or local hospital Nutrition and Dietetic department wouldalso connect one with a registered dietitian. The local Dietetic Association has a \"Dial-a-Dietitian\"number through which one can obtain nutrition information and names of consultant dietitians in the area.The Ohio State University Extension is also a good source of sound nutrition information.Adolescents are susceptible to common food fallacies, particularly those concerning weight control orathletic performance. For instance, 24 percent of senior high school students thought that complexcarbohydrates were \"a food they should not eat too much of (Harris Scholastic Research, 1989). This I301 r41 Relating Food Choices to Wellness ( CONTENTMODULE A,misconception prevails because the teens mistakenly think carbohydrates will result in weight gain.Many teens, especially females, believe that self-induced vomiting can help them lose weight. Thisbehavior leads to several dangerous health problems, such as corrosion of teeth and throat from gastricacids and cardiac abnormalities. It is important that teens learn about these and other diet fallacies toavoid serious health problems.1 The sports nutrition myths revolve around three categories: (1) muscle-building myths; (2) quick-energymyths; and (3) performance myths (National Dairy Council, 1989). Muscle-building myths claim thatthe more protein and protein supplements a person eats, the more muscle a person will have. This isincorrect because excess protein is simply stored as body fat. No studies have ever shown that largeamounts of protein help one to \"bulk up.\" Along these same lines, steroids are very dangerous and canlead to stunting of growth, acne, sex organ problems, and even psychosis.The quick-energy myth supports the idea that honey, sugar, or sweets prior to a game or competitiongives one an extra energy boost. Conversely, sweets can do just the opposite by stimulating an over-production of insulin resulting in the fatigue and dizziness of a \"sugar low.\" Most of the energy one hasfor competition is stored in the muscles from the foods eaten the last few days. That is why a highcarbohydrate training diet is so important for glycogen storage in the muscles. The pre competition meal,if eaten at least six hours before an event following an overnight fast, can raise blood glucose levels (in asafe way) and increase liver glycogen levels.The idea that water during exercise causes an upset stomach and may impede performance is also incor-rect. In fact, drinking four ounces of water every 10 to 15 minutes during exercise replaces the bodyfluids lost as sweat, and may even enhance performance. Water should be consumed before, during, andafter exercise.It is imperative that teens know that several factors contribute to their ideal or healthy weight; that alongwith nutritional and exercise habits, genetics, body type, and body frame size also affect healthy weightcalculations. Frame size can be determined by measuring wrist circumference, and after frame size isestablished, charts can be consulted to see if one is in the healthy range, below the healthy range, or abovethe healthy range. These charts are available from the National Dairy Council booklet YouYour Guideto Food, Fitness, and Fun (1993).It is complicated for teens to determine a healthy weight range since adolescence is a time of rapid anderratic body growth and physical maturation. An increase in height of around 15 percent is typical, andweight is nearly doubled. Body composition changes begin to reveal the distinct differences betweenboys and girls: males deposit proportionally more lean body tismie (muscle) and skeletal mass (bone),while females deposit proportionately more fat. In fact, boys average around a 20-pound increase in bodyfat, while girls usually deposit over 44 pounds of body fat during their teen years. Since most malesbegin their growth spurt about two years later than females, an inactive teenage boy might find himselfgetting plumper before he grows taller. 13113 CCONTENT/0MODULE 4,Relating Food Choices to Wellness Media influences and peer pressure have an impact on the fact that many teens feel the need to diet,particularly teenage girls. It has been estimated that 30to60percent of females in their teens are diet-ingwhether they are overweight or not (Start, et al., 1985).The most popular fad diet methods usedseem to be fasting and diet supplements. Teens are particularly at risk for these irrational and dangerousmethods, which are based on nutrition myths.The paradox with teens is that average caloric intakes are actually below the levels recommended forteens, yet body fatness is above the recommended levels for more than one-fifth of today's adolescentpopulation. This means that teens are not necessarily eating too much, but many are getting too fat.Overweight teens must deal with college and employment rejections, dating difficulties, and limitedsocial mobility. A well-designed weight management program includes a balanced diet with decreasedportion sizes, as well as regular physical exercise, and focuses on permanent changes in both eating habitsand level of physical activity.The relationship between food choices, eating patterns, activity, and maintenance of healthy weight is anintricate one. Because teens often eat away from home, they may be including more fast foods thanconventional healthy foods such as milk, fruits, and vegetables in their diet. This illustrates how eatingpatterns, influenced by schedule, also affect food choice. Because exercise can help in the maintenanceof weight, it is very helpful to provide teens with a chart that shows the relationship between the energyobtained from foods and the activities that require that energy. For example:One needs to eat one Taco Bell Beef Taco (183calories) to have enough energy to skate at ninemiles per hour for 36minutes.One needs to eat one McDonald's cheeseburger (305calories) to be able to jog (six miles perhour) for35minutes, or conversely, one needs to jog 35minutes to burn off a McDonald'scheeseburger.A small French fries at Wendy's can be burned off by walking 73minutes.Food choices made by teens are influenced by their busy schedules, exposure to food fallacies, and accessto reliable nutrition information. Genetics, eating habits, and exercise all contribute to maintenance ofbody weight. A third of senior high school students indicate that they obtain most of their nutritioninformation from school, so the high school teacher has quite an opportunity to provide high qualitynutrition education to students and to positively affect their food choices for good health, both now and inthe future.

Activities may he done insmall groups and presented to the class.FatList foods you eat in one day. Using charts or food models with nutrient content information, determine thegrams of fat in the various foods you have eaten. Add up your total grams of fat eaten in that day. Using testtubes, measure out the amount of fat eaten in each food in a test tube (5 grams of fat = 1 teaspoon). Meltvegetable shortening, measure out the appropriate number of grams, and pour into the test tubes using a funnel,allowing the fat to harden at room temperature. Create a display of the fat content of foods commonly eatenby your group members.CarbohydrateUsingTest Tubes of Sugar(p. 150), choose several foods to include in a classroom display. Each gram ofsugar is equal to one teaspoon, and each 15 grams is equal to one tablespoon. Measure the appropriate amountof sugar for each food, fill a test tube with sugar and cap it with a rubber stopper. Compare the sugar contentof breakfast cereals, various drinks, dessert items, and canned fruits.SodiumDisplay a selection of real foods or food models, representing food choices that might he selected for a menufor lunch. Provide a set amount of salt \"dollars,\" representing a recommended amount of salt for one meal.Select foods and spend salt \"dollars\" to make a lunch menu based on your available salt \"dollars.\" Comparethe amount of food received based on salt cost (for example, the amount spent for a bag of potato chips versusthe amount spent for a baked potato).CalciumMake a display illustrating the need for calcium throughout the life cycle. Use a gallon jug with a spout at thebottom, such as an ice tea container, and reconstituted nonfat dry milk. Illustrate the effect of inputting calciumby filling the jug from the following containers:A baby bottle for infancyA sipper cup for toddlersA small milk carton for a school-age childA tall glass for young adultsA small stemware glass for adultsThe milk you are pouring represents calcium from all milk products such as cheese, yogurt, ice cream, etc.As you begin to discuss adulthood, withdraw milk slowly according to the recommended dietary allowancesfor calcium. Add only small amounts to illustate that adults rarely get enough calcium, even though the needfor the nutrient grows as old age approaches. The body's supply of calcium, as illustrated by the jug, canbecome dangerously low, but will never empty because of the calcium stored in bones. Bones can, however,become weak if insufficient supplies of calcium arc consistent.Vitamins and MineralsCreate a display of foods rich in vitamins or minerals, such as iron or Vitamin C. Conduct a taste test of thesefoods and poll students as to which foods they would add to their eating patterns to get more of these nutrients.

Almost every day, we can read our local newspaper's account of thisweek's New England Journal of Medicine article related to diet and health. A few days later, the study is oftenfeatured in the weekly tabloids sold at supermarket checkout lines. What should you look for to determinewhether an article or research study is worthy of your attention? Here are some key points to consider.Who is the author? Examine the author's educational background, employment, experiences, and contribu-tions to the field of nutrition. Scientists, medical doctors, and dietitians/nutritionists often disagree on nutritioninformation. The title of Ph.D., M.D., or M.S. does not necessarily qualify a person to be an expert in nutrition.Carefully evaluate materials produced by unidentified authors and publishing agencies.What is the source? Determine the credibility of the publisher and his or her reasons for the publication. Isthe reason a desire to advance the knowledge and study of nutrition or a desire to legitimize and promote a foodfad, product, or other special food? Remember that many reputable publishers do not necessarily assume theresponsibility for the factual content or their publications.Studies appearing in peer-reviewed journals have undergone critique by qualified scientists, and are publishedas such for the purpose of judging the scientific significance and merit of the research. The New England Journalof Medicine, the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, and the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation are examples. When research papers are submitted to these journals, scientists question thehypothesis, methodology, statistical significance, and conclusions of the research before it is published. Thepeer-reviewed scientific literature is of much greater value than other sources.What is the content of the study? The content should he well-referenced and backed with current research.Opinions and recommendations that differ from the majority of nationally recognized nutrition authoritiesshould he carefully evaluated. Sound nutrition information establishes a relationship between nutrition andgood health by promoting a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods.Is it current? Nutrition research is constantly providing current information that is reflected in sound nutritioneducation materials. The materials should reflect the present state of the science of nutrition.Is it supported by appropriate references? References cited in a paper can give greater validity to the author'sknowledge of the area of nutrition. All references should he related to the topic of the materials or the focusof the research study.What is the source of funding fora research study? The source of funding for a study is sometimes questionedwhen the funding organization appears to have a vested interest in the results. For example, when a companyis seeking approval for a new food ingredient, it is required by law to support adequate studies to demonstratethe ingredient's safety. Government certainly wouldn't invest millions of dollars studying ingredients orproducts that may never come to market.What are the research methods used? Who or what was studied? Was it a particular age group or behavior?How many subjects were in the study? 1)0 the findings reflect scientific data or qualitative case studies?Answers to these questions will help you decide whether or not the study is relevant to your nutrition choices. 1551 \\Nutrition and Wellness Relating Food Choices to Wellness Judging Nutrition InformationSummary Sheet In cooperative learning groups. complete the information below for one article that provides nutrition information.Then form new groups. share information, and add the information about one additional article.

They don't work in the long runand can be dangerous. Some are appealing because they promise quick and easy weight loss. Butresearchers are finding that quick weight loss is often followed by weight gain and may lead to eatingdisorders. Unless a diet is balanced nutritionallyand many fad diets are notit could be harmfulif followed over a long period of time. Diets that encourage little or no eating, diets that limit eatingto one kind of food, diets that are very low-calorie, and liquid diets can all cause health problems.Before you try a reducing diet, be sure it's nutritionally sound. Here are some guidelines to considerwhen you are deciding on a weight-reducing plan. How does the plan measure up? Are there fewer calories in the weight-loss diet than in foodsyou normally eat? You can only lose weight by reducingyour calorie intake below what your body needs and uses.Does the plan encourage slow, permanent weight loss of I2 pounds per week? Quick, dramatic weight loss is nothealthy, and could mean loss of muscle, not fat.Does the plan include a variety of foods from these groups:fruit; vegetable; bread and cereal; milk and milk products;and meat, poultry, fish, and dry beans? It's important to havefoods from each of these groups in your diet every day.Is it made up of appealing foods that you enjoy, not just forseveral weeks or months, but the rest of your life? Weightcontrol is a lifelong process.Are the foods available where you usually shop? If productsare not easily obtainable, you may lose interest in the diet.Does it allow you to eat some of your favorite foodsoccasionally? On a sensible diet program, there's room fora rich dessert in small amounts once in a while.Does the diet recommend changes in your eating habits thatalso fit your lifestyle and pocketbook?Does the diet encourage a safe and reasonable increase inexercise?YesNo If you answer \"yes\" to all of the above, you've probably found a program that you will be able to livewith comfortably as you achieve and maintain a healthy weight.

They often end up gaining more weight than when they started. Still, these diets are popular.Why? It's much more exciting to \"eat all your favorite foods and lose weight quickly and effortlessly\"than it is to make lifestyle changes in food habits and exercise. Who has the patience for slow weightloss? People who want to lose weight tend to believe the enthusiastic claims of the fad diet promoters becausethe advertisements seem so convincing and authoritative. Also, the fad diets are often appealingly andprominently advertised in bookstores, magazines, and other stores. Unfortunately, the promotion ofthese diets is for profit, not for people's good health. Consumers are often an easy target due to theirfalse hopes for quick results!Besides the frustration of not achieving permanent weight loss, roller coaster dieting seems to resultin a change in your body composition. Here's how it works ...Vv'hen you diet you lose some fat butalso protein from muscle tissue, even from the heart! When you go off the diet, you gain back morefat than muscle. What this means is that after a succession of diets you may weigh exactly the sameas you did before your first diet, but you'll have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentageof muscle tissue. Since fat doesn't burn calories as well as muscle tissue, you may have a harder timemaintaining your present weight. The key to successful, permanent weight loss is sensible dieting plusexercise to help tone and maintain your muscle tissue.What are some of the diets to stay away from?1. High protein, low carbohydrate diets.Carbohydrate is not more fattening than protein or fat. Gram for gram, carbohydrate and proteinoffer the same number of calories (4 calories per gram) while fat has more than double the calories(9 calories per gram). Diets that focus on high protein foods such as steak, eggs, and cottage cheeseare also high in fat and cholesterol. High protein and low carbohydrate dieting is dangerous forseveral reasons:a. When your body does not receive enough carbohydrate, a chemical imbalance known asketosis occurs. Ketosis is an undesirable buildup of the by-products of incomplete fatmetabolism, called ketones, in the blood and urine.b. By eating more protein than normal, you place an added strain on your kidneys.c. In addition, these diets are usually very high in saturated fat and cholesterol, which mayincrease your risk for heart disease and strokes.2. Limited food choice diets.These diets often promote unsubstantiated scientific claims that certain foods will \"burn up\" fat orthat special combinations of foods will enhance weight loss. Whole food groups are often eliminatedor severely limited, especially dairy products and protein foods. Use your common sense and don'tbelieve the authors when they claim that dizziness, cold limbs, diarrhea, and muscle weakness aresigns of \"cleansing\" and improved health!

Partial to total fasting.Fasting diets may limit food intake to water only or they may permit other liquids and supplementssuch as juices, tea, coffee, and vitamin/mineral tablets. With no incoming calories, the body'sprincipal source of energy is glucose, which is used up in less than 24 hours. Your body will thenturn to protein stores (in muscle) for energy, as well as to fat stores. These diets can cause manyproblems, including dizziness, fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, ketosis, and even death if carried toextremes. There is no evidence to support the claim that fasting removes toxins or purifies themetabolic system.4. Diet pills and other gimmicks.Diuretics and laxatives cause loss of water weight, not fat. If used in excess, they can also causedehydration, electrolyte imbalances, impaired bowel function, and malabsorption of vitamins andminerals. Appetite suppressing diet pills can be addictive and tend to cause insomnia, increasedblood pressure, and increased breathing rate. They do not promote long-term weight control, andweight is quickly gained back once pill usage discontinues. Other gimmicks such as fiber pills,special candies, and wafers are not necessary and are usually expensive. Directions suggestdrinking one or more cups of water with the pill or candy. This extra fluid is what fills you up andtakes the \"edge off- your hunger, not the product. So fill yourself up with a little water, milk, ora piece of fruit before a meal to prevent overeating, and save your money for nutrient-rich foodsinstead!5. Powdered supplements.Powdered supplements include those diets that replace 1, 2, or 3 meals per day with special drinks.Often your daily calorie intake is well below 1,000 calories, which is very dangerous for normalbody functioning. Dieters tend to lose some weight, but it is mostly water and lean muscle tissue.These diets do not teach you how to handle food choices throughout the day, and are monotonous,expensive and potentially dangerous. 160 Nutrition and Wellness Relating Food Choices to Wellness Rating the R.D. County Extension Agent Newsletter (Chart reprinted from Consumer Reports). Columbus.Ohio: The Ohio State University Extension, 1993. 1611' (1 Nutrition and Wellness Relating Food Choices to Wellness What You Need to Know About Sports Nutrition Myths Serious athletes are always looking for ways to improve their performance. Unfortunately, many athletes wantto improve themselves so much that they will try almost anything. They may be fooled by foods, drugs, or nutrientsthat promise miraculous improvement. Athletes may also listen to inaccurate advice and may avoid eating somefoods that really are nutritious. Athletes should beware of the following sports nutrition myths.Muscle-building MythsThe more protein and protein supplements you eat, the more muscle you will have. INCORRECT. There is noevidence that excess protein will lead to more or stronger muscles. In fact, excess protein is stored by the bodyas fat.Steroids are the best way to develop massive muscles. INCORRECT. Steroids can be dangerous. While steroidsare powerful drugs that help build muscle, they have many risky side effects. Taking steroids can stunt yourgrowth, cause acne, deepen your voice, and alter your sex organs. You can build muscle with diet and exercise.Although it takes a little longer, you're not risking your health.Quick-energy MythsEating honey, sugar, soft drinks or any sweets just before competition will provide a burst of quick energy.INCORRECT. Sugary foods eaten just before competition do not improve your speed or strength. That's becauseit takes the body one to four hours to digest food. So foods eaten just before an event are in your stomach whenyou compete. Most of the energy used in competition or practice comes from food eaten days before the eventthat has been stored in your muscles.Vitamin supplements will give you more energy. INCORRECT. None of the 14 known vitamins supplies energy.Some vitamins help the body use energy. However, these vitamins are easily supplied by an athlete's normal diet.Megadoses of vitamins won't give you more energy or improve your endurance. If you consumer more vitaminC or B vitamins than your body needs, they are simply flushed out in your urine. If you consumer more vitaminsA and D than you need, they arc stored in your fat. Too much of these vitamins can be poisonous.Performance MythsWater during exercise causes an upset stomach and slows you down. INCORRECT. There is no evidence thatdrinking water during exercise causes an upset stomach or any other problems. In fact, drinking fluids duringexercise is very important. Drinking 1/2 cup of fluid such as cool water every 10-15 minutes during exercise helpsreplace body fluids lost as sweat.Drinking milk causes cotton mouth. INCORRECT. Cotton mouth is dry mouth due to lack of saliva. It seemsto he the result of emotional stress and a loss of body fluids, not drinking milk.Muscle cramps are caused by inadequate salt intake. INCORRECT. Cramps are caused by severe losses of waterthrough sweating. Drinking water before, during, and after exercise can prevent these water losses. Salt tabletscan aggravate this condition by increasing the body's need for water.Special supplements such as amino acids, bee pollen, ginseng, brewer's yeast, and DNA improve athleticperformance. INCORRECT. There is no evidence that any of these substances improve athletic performance.Most of these items are expensive. Some may even be harmful to both performance and health.Athletic success is not a miracle. It is the result of talent, hard training, and plenty of preparation beforecompetition. Athletes who look for miracles instead of following a sensible diet and training program canhurt their bodies and their performance. Source: National Dairy Council.

Socially accepted eating behaviors Teacher Background Information Adolescence has always been a difficult transition with unique psychological and social needs. Primitivesocieties had rites of passage to mark maturation; we have them also, though less clearly defined. Themajor challenges of the adolescent years are autonomy and identity. How to fit into a teen world, how tobecome a separate adult. The underlying current is a body that seems to have a mind of its own: break-ing out in pimples one day, growing pubic hair the next; thrusting outward, then upward; generallykeeping life in a state of flux. Overlaid on the normal physical changes of adolescence are stress fromdisintegrating family systems: families plagued by alcoholism, divorce, sexual abuse, and poverty aswell as demands from a very visual culturea culture that insists on an increasingly thin ideal forwomen's beauty. The average fashion model has a weight 23 percent below that of the average women \\<-(CONTENT '0MODULERelating Psychological and Social Needsto Food Choices (Seid, 1989). Health authorities warn that any excess fat above desirable weight will usher in a host offearful diseases: stroke, diabetes, heart disease, even certain cancers. Not only do we believe that thinneris healthier, we see it as \"a reflection of character, moral strength, and goodness\" (Seid, 1989). In the pastdecade, women have achieved more economic, social, and political power than ever before, yet they feelworse about themselves physically than their unliberated grandmothers. Naomi Wolf calls this phenom-enon the beauty myth and says we are in the midst of a \"violent backlash against feminism that usesimages of female beauty as a political weapon against women's advancement\" (Wolf, 1991). We are toldthat we can conquer the plague of fatness if we just exercise enough and diet. Dieting is something weknow how to do. On any given day, most of us think we are too fat, ode-fourth of us are on a diet, andhalf of us have just come off a diet. We eagerly chose foods we think will help us reach our goal forthinnessfoods that are altered to be free of hated ingredients like fat, sugar, cholesterol, and salt. Thisnational compulsion has robbed us of the natural pleasure of eating. Food has become the enemy; eating,a thing to be feared; and the body, a vessel not to be trusted.Food choices by teens are reflective of the confused and conflicted messages teens receive from family,the large culture, and social peers. Dieting has become a culturally accepted eating behavior with seriousconsequences for young people. Addressing this phenomenon requires a fresh look at our prejudices anda new awareness of internal needs.BackgroundWe live in a body-conscious society. A society obsessed with pursuit of an illusive, ever thinner, fit, fat-free body. Human value, economic worth, and self-discipline are equated with attainment of this bodystandard, especially for women. This emphasis translates for many into a willingness to try anything tobe thin. We use pills, fasts, formulas, bizarre diets, even surgery to shed those hated pounds. And weagonize over what we put into our mouths by buying fat-free, caffeine-free, cholesterol-free, high-fiber,vitamin-rich, synthetic foods in our quest to be thin and fit.Teens are particularly vulnerable to societal body consciousness since their bodies are changing almostdaily. The boys who mature late and the girls who mature early are at particular risk for low self-esteem.Most teens want desperately to be just like everyone else. Boys can hardly eat enough to keep up withrapid growth in muscle and bone, girls are typically restricting intake in the effort to stay slim. At thevery moment when female hormones circulate to transform the boyish preadolescent figure from 13percent body fat to a rounded, curvy 20 percent body fat, the fashion industry flaunts waifish models asthe standard of beauty.Television, movies, and other mass media create an almost inescapable presence in teenagers' lives.Further, the media sets standards for physical appearance that are simply unattainable for most, particu-larly for a person genetically different from the dominant culture. Current fashion models represent onetenth of one percent of the population in physical appearance.As models become thinner, people arc more dissatisfied with their appearance, particularly their weight,than ever. The magazine Psychology Today published the results of surveys of their readers' feelings 1')166 Relating Psychological and Social Needsto Food Choices (CONTENTMODULE -7about appearance and weight in 1972, and again in 1987. The most striking finding was the increase indissatisfaction of men for their bodies. Both sexes were more concerned with their looks and especiallywith their weight in the later survey, (40 percent of men and 55 percent of women). In 1987, only 12percent were content with their appearance (Rodin, 1992). A survey of body image perceptions of 33,000women published by Glamour magazine in 1984 found that 75 percent of the respondents felt they were\"too fat\" (Wooley, 1984).The most common \"solution\" to the problem of overweight has been dieting. \"Eat less and exercisemore,\" we are told. The food industry has responded by flooding the market with fat-free, cholesterol-free, low sodium, lite products. The message seems to be getting through to many consumers. On aver-age, Americans have dropped the percentage of calories from fat from 36 percent to 34 percent (Lenfant,1991)Dieting has become a way of life for most of us. Polivy and Herman state, \"The shift in societal prefer-ence toward a thin physique has led to an increasing prevalence of dieting such that 'normal' eating forNorth American women is now characterized by dieting\" (Polivy & Herman, 1987). They and otherssuggest that there are many similarities between dieters and individuals with eating disorders. Of equalconcern is the trend for young persons to be involved in dieting attempts. The Center for Disease Controlreported a study of children in grades 8 and 10. Sixty-two percent of girls and nearly 28 percent of boyshad been on a diet in the past year (Berg, 1993). How do teens diet and what are the consequences?A study of high school students in Cleveland found that 77 percent of girls and 42 percent of boys weredieting (Berg, 1993). In this study, fasting was the most frequent method of dieting, with rates rangingfrom 25 percent of black boys to 40 percent of black girls. Other methods used by black girls includedliquid diet (24 percent), diet pills (16 percent), laxatives (18 percent), and diuretics (11 percent). Nearlyone fourth of white high school girls had resorted to vomiting to control weight, and 23 percent used dietpills. Boys were far less likely to use these methods. Inappropriate dieting behaviors such as these oftenbegin a cycle leading to anorexia nervosa and bulimia. Such practices also precipitate and predisposepeople to be overweight.The average onset for eating disorders occurs during adolescence. It is estimated that one in ten U.S. highschool and college girls has an eating disorder, and one percent suffer from anorexia (Berg, 1993).Bulimia appears to be equally common among the African-American population as among whites, al-though it used to be thought of as a disorder affecting only whites. More girls than boys are affected.By definition, an eating disorder is symptomatic of emotional and social disturbance. It is usually a cryfor help. Yet detecting an eating disorder can be hard, especially if the young person is an athlete. Exces-sive exercise can be masked as an attempt to build endurance. Coaches often encourage gymnasts andwrestlers to drop weight. How can you detect an eating disorder and how do they impact wellness'?All eating disorders, including those who overeat, involve an extreme preoccupation with food and a fearof getting fat. Anorexics rigidly control how much food they eat, some decreasing it to as few as 200calories per day. Weight loss is pronounced and falls to levels below 85 percent of that expected. There 1671 7 3 Relating Psychological and Social Needsto Food ChoicesICCONTENT 2)MODULE *-7is an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat even though the person is underweight. Amenorrheais common in girls. Bulimia is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating with quite large caloricconsumption at times and patterns of purging. Purging includes vomiting. use of diet pills, diuretics orlaxatives, excessive exercise, or fasting. Most of this behavior is so secretive that not even the closestfriends know.All eating disorders have serious health consequences, including limited linear growth, damage to repro-ductive organs, irregular heartbeats, kidney failure, gallbladder damage, and death. The restriction offood intake, for any reason, profoundly distorts developmental needs of children and adolescents. Ado-lescent girls often limit the intake of calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Carbonated beverages arebelieved to be more popular and often substitute for fluid milk. This can limit achievement of peak bonemass and contribute to osteoporosis in later life. Low iron intake is a problem among female adolescents,especially those on vegetarian diets and competitive athletes.Psychological damage is pronounced. On the outside, kids can look happy and well-adjusted. On theinside, they suffer from low self-esteem, body loathing, and depression. Their inner world is isolated.Many set unrealistically high standards for themselves. They want to achieve perfection in every aspectof their lives: grades may be high, appearance is everything. Many are people pleasers. Anorexics andbulimics are typically \"good\" kids who are eager to please parents, teachers, and coaches. They may bethe responsible sibling at home who manages things while mother works or covers for an alcoholic familymember.The larger public health concern may be the link between disordered eating, particularly dieting, and thedevelopment or exacerbation of obesity. Hypo caloric dieting lowers metabolic rate and precedes bingeeating which in turn often results in weight gain. The prevalence of obesity has risen 54 percent in thepast 20 years, one in four children is obese (Mellin, 1992). Increases in obesity have occurred acrosssocial and racial classes. Inactivity, particularly television viewing, has been shown to be a major con-tributor to being overweight in adolescence (Gortmaker, 1990). Another is restrained eating and fear offatness. These characteristics were positively linked with increased weight in a study of middle class highschool girls (Me llin, 1992). It is no coincidence that the prevalence of obesity is high among socialgroups that suffer from poverty. When food resources are unreliable due to poverty, the lack of familymeal times or for other reasons, periodic bingeing becomes ingrained. The obese child suffers fromcontinued social pressures bordering on ostracism.The evolution of eating problems often begins in struggles around feeding in the family of origin. Whenchildren are forced to eat when not hungry or chastised for liking sweets, or stopped from eating beforethey are full, they develop a great deal of conflict and anxiety about eating. That inner conflict interfereswith self-trust and prevents the child from assuming appropriate responsibility for his or her food choices.Ellyn Satter (1987) has written extensively on feeding interactions in the family. She suggests thatfeeding requires a division of responsibility between parent and child: the parent is responsible for whatthe child is offered to eat; the child is responsible for how much. 1681 Relating Psychological and Social Needsto Food Choices9CCONTENT 2MODULE ft\"This advice runs counter to practices in families of many cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Mother maybe saying \"Eat, eat, finish your plate,\" while she also says, \"don't get fat, you'll never find a husband.\"Since adolescence is often a time of rebellion, many teens assert their independence by eating more orless than families want, and by choosing different foods than they did when younger. Peer pressure andmessages from the media exert a strong influence on teens. Television ads push convenience foods andglamorize fast food menus. Often these foods are high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium, the componentsthat are typically high in teen diets. Parents often feel torn as sons and daughters seem to reject familyvalues. Their schedule may not coincide with family eating times and their tastes are geared to fast foodchoices. The wise parent and teacher will affirm the teens' need to make their own food choices whilecontinuing to be involved. Studies show that teens are highly influenced by behavioral modeling of foodchoices from parents. They are also greatly influenced by their perceptions of parents' opinions (Barr,1994). Nagging about food choices, or criticism of body shape, may result in increasing isolation,initiation of an eating disorder, and/or preoccupation with weight.The success rate for maintenance of weight lost through dieting is generally agreed to be between five andten percent. In other words, 90 to 95 percent of persons who lose weight through dieting regain thatweight within five years (Berg, 1993). This seems to be true regardless of the method used. Dietingbefore adolescence can stunt children's growth. It also sets up a \"good food,\" \"bad food\" mentality.Because of widespread dissatisfaction with diets that don't work, and in response to the alarming rise ineating disorders, a new movement is on the rise in America. It is called the non-diet movement, and it isvigorously opposed to dieting. The proponents of this movement suggest that people throw out thescales, formulas, diet pills, and rules, and learn to eat all over again from an internal sense of :what theirbodies need and want. It focuses on feeling good about oneself, eating in a relaxed, nurturing way andmoving your body for fun. It has the audacity to suggest that our bodies have an internal wisdom and canactually tell us to eat when hungry, and that we can learn to stop when we are satisfied. It suggests thatwhen people give themselves permission to eat what they really want, it may take less to be satisfied. Itencourages people to accept their bodies as they are, not as the fashion industry and mass media portraythem. Supporters of this philosophy suggest that we eat for good reasons. Eating too much or too littlemay be a way of taking care of ourselves. When we address the psychological and social needs that areinfluencing food choices, we support change from the inside out, we respect the right of each person to beautonomous, and to become their own unique individual.

Once she reaches her goal, people notice she looks slimmer. Boyswho've never noticed her before begin to compliment her on her appearance. \"If I losemore weight,\" Sherry thinks, \"I'll become even more popular.\" Obsessed with beingthin, Sherq gradually starves herself until she must be hospitalized.Jim is a model student. He's a high achiever and eager to please his parents, who have recentlydivorced. But lately, Jim binges on popcorn, candy, pizza, and ice cream when he's alone.Afterward, trying to undo the damage, he purges by vomiting or using laxatives so that hedoesn't gain weight.These young people are the victims of two serious eating disorders: anorexia nervosaandbulimia.Both involvean extreme preoccupation with food and a fear of getting fat. But each disorder has unique characteristics.Differences in the disordersAnorexics control how much food they eat, eventually decreasing it to as few as200 calories a day or, in some cases, totally fasting. YoU can imagine how harmful that can he to a young person'sbody when you consider this: The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences reports thata moderately active teenage girl needs about 2,200 calories a day to maintain her weight. Moderately activeteenage boys need about 2.800 calories a day.Unlike anorexics, who restrict their food intake, bulimics consume as much as 50,000 calories or more at a time.Bulimics fear getting fat, so once they've consumed too much food, they eliminate it through forced vomitingor laxative use.Both anorexia and bulimia have serious consequences. including damage to reproductive organs, irregularheartbeats, and kidney failure. Sometimes, as in the case of Karen Carpenter. eating disorders can prove fatal.So what makes apparently normal people, like Sherry and Jim, damage their body like this?The control connectionAlthough every case is different, experts generally agree that the development of aneating disorder is often a reaction to changing circumstances. Perhaps parents are divoHng or remarrying, thefamily is moving, a relative is dying, or a romantic relationship is on the rocks.\"The trigger mechanism can he anything that involves taking an emotional risk,\" says Ira M. Sacker. M.D..director of the Eating Disorders Program at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in New York.The reaction to changing circumstances often translates into a need for controlcontrol over some aspect of aperson's life when it seems otherwise out of control, Sacker contends. But instead of dealing with the problemthat makes them feel out of control, those who develop eating disorders try to maintain power over the one thingthat seems controllable: their weight.The personality factorThose who develop anorexia or bulimia seem to have three distinctive traits:1.Pattern of perfectionism. Anorexics and bulimics set unrealistically high standards for themselves. Theywant to achieve perfection in every aspect of their lives: their school, work, their relationships with others,and their appearance.2. Low self-esteem. Even though they may he high achievers, those who tend to develop eating disorders areseldom pleased with their accomplishments. Because they try to live up to unrealistic standards, anorexicsand bulimics arc rarely happy. and see themselves as failures.3. People- plcasers. Anon exics and bulimics are typically \"good\" girls and boys who are eager to please parents,teachers, and supervisors. They also try to he too many things to too many people. Says one person with aneating disorder: \"I took care of my younger brother and did all the household chores. My friends came tome with their problems, and I'd offer advice. My parents were divorced, and I'd try to keep peace betweenthem. It just got to he too much.\" Source: J. Bleasdale. Challenges. December 1991. 1184 Nutrition and Weltness Relating Psychological and Social Needs to Food Choices When Food Becomes an Obsession (continued) Page 2 of 2 The gender questionA recent study of 20 high schools in 18 states, conducted by the National Associationof Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, indicates that 11 percent of those teens suffer from either anorexianervosa or bulimia. Projecting the 11 percent of the 16 to 18 age group nationally suggests that 716,000 teens mayhave serious illnesses that need treatment.Although a large percentage of those teens are female, a significant number are male. But to enhance theirappearance, boys usually exercise to gain muscle hulk, not necessarily to lose weight.Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to diet and exercise to become or remain thin. They see idealized modelswith flat stomachs and slender legs. The message is clear: It's glamorous to he thin.The family factorIs there any link between the family and those predisposed to eating disorders? Recentresearch indicates that there is. Salvador Minuchin, M.D., an expert in family therapy, points out that the familiesof anorexics and bulimics tend to contribute to the development of the disorder. The parents, he says, \"place atremendous importance on family loyalty and lack of conflict.\" They also tend to be overprotective andoverhearing.But because bulimics and anorexics feel an extraordinary need to please their parents, they don't rebel outwardlyby being disobedient or argumentative. Instead, they exhibit their resentment over their lack of independence bymanipulating their eating habits. It's a way to \"passively\" rebel.Getting beyond the disorderIf youor someone you knowhas an eating disorder, remember twowords: Get help! Talk to a teacher, counselor, or other adult. Contact one of these organizations:American Anorexia/Bulimia Association418 former anorexic: \"If you have a friend whom you suspect is suffering from an eating disorder, confronthim or her with concern. Don't say, \"You're not eating enough' or `I know you make yourself vomit after you eat.\"she warns. \"Instead say, 'You've been spending a lot of time alone. I miss talking to you.

Developed by Katy Kram, M.P.H., R.N., R.D. 187 Nutrition and Wellness Relating Psychological and Social Needs to Food Choices What is Normal Eating? Normal eating is being able to eat when you are hungryand continue eating until you are satisfied. It is beingable to choose food you like and eat it and. truly getenough of itnot just stop eating because you think youshould. Normal eating is being able to use some mod-erate constraint in your food selection to get the rightfood, but not being so restrictive that you miss out onpleasurable foods. Normal eating is giving yourselfpermission to eat sometimes because you are happy,sad, or bored, or just because it feels good. Normaleating is three meals a day, most of the time, but it canalso be choosing to munch along. It is leaving somecookies on the plate because you know you can havesome again tomorrow, or it is eating more now becausethey taste so wonderful when they are fresh. Normaleating is overeating at times: feeling stuffed and un-comfortable. It is also undereating at times and wishingyou had more. Normal eating is trusting your body tomake up for your mistakes in eating. Normal eatingtakes up some of your time and attention, but keeps itsplace as only one important area of your life.In short, normal eating is flexible. It varies in responseto your emotions, your schedule, your hunger, and yourproximity to food. Source: Ellyn Satter.HOW To Get Your Kid To Eat . ..

Strategies for involving family members and resolving conflicts about foodchoices Teacher Background Information Extensive research in the area of nutrition supports the important link between food choices and goodhealth. Making wise food choices can help prevent disease and enhance health. According to the 1988Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, other than choosing to drink alcohol or smoke, eatinghabits probably shape long-term health more than any other personal choice.Changes in lifestyle, employment of women outside the home, increased accessibility to commercial foodestablishments, and increased availability of highly processed foods have influenced food consumptionpatterns in the United States in recent years. Unfortunately, teenage eating habits such as skipping meals,frequent snacking, and bizarre weight-reduction strategies have resulted in teen diets that are characteristi-cally high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium, and low in calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C. Adolescentscan benefit from opportunities to study nutrition standards for planning nutritious food choices both athome and when eating away from home. Practical nutrition education can provide adolescents and theirpresent and future family members with the knowledge, values, and skills needed to improve eatinghabits. 189193 Planning Food Choices CONTENT AMODULE 'wBackgroundWhen planning nutritious meals to be prepared at home, there are three major factors to consider: nutri-tional needs; resources available including time, food preparation skills, and money; and the appeal of thefood as established by family tradition and culture, taste, texture, temperature, color, flavor, shape, andsize. When developing menu plans that have nutritional value, two food-guidance systems are recom-mended to select and evaluate food choices: the Dietary Guidelines fnr Americans and the Food GuidePyramid. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, developed jointly by the United States Department ofAgriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services, include seven dietary guidelinesto help Americans enjoy better health and reduce their chances of getting certain diseases (USDA, 1988).The American Dietetic Association summarizes these guidelines with three healthy food choice prin-ciples: balance, variety, and moderation. The seven guidelines are as follows:I. Eat a variety of foods to get the energy, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber needed for good health.2. Maintain healthy weight to reduce chances of having high blood pressure, heart disease, a stroke,certain cancers, and the most common kind of diabetes.3. Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart attack, and certaintypes of cancer. Because fat contains over twice the calories (9 calories per gram) of an equal amountof carbohydrates or protein (4 calories per gram), a diet low in fat can help maintain a healthy weight.4. Choose a diet with plenty of vegetables, fruit, and grain products to help lower fat intake and provideneeded vitamins, minerals, fiber, and complex carbohydrates.5. Use sugars only in moderation to help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and to feel good.6. Use salt and sodium only in moderation to help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and to feel good.7. If alcoholic beverages are used, do so in moderation. Drinking alcohol causes many health problemsand accidents, and can lead to addiction (USDA, 1992).A balanced and varied diet can be achieved through the implementation of the Food Guide Pyramidrecommendations. The Food Guide Pyramid, developed by the United States Department of Agriculture,was designed not only to help people choose a variety of foods from each of the five food groups in thepyramid, but to show the proportion each group should have in relation to one's total diet. Historically,the concepts of food groups has been used to help people choose a variety of foods, but the food groupsdid not guide food choices according to the proportion of foods to be selected for good health. Hence, theidea of a pyramid was used to show the composition of a healthful diet. The large base of the first tier isthe place for foods like whole grains and pasta that can be used freely as the foundation of a meal andoverall diet. As one moves up to the higher tiers, one finds foods like poultry and cheese that should beused in smaller and smaller amounts as the tiers narrow toward the top of the pyramid (Spiller, 1993).The Food Guide Pyramid conveys the USDA's latest recommendations to eat less fat and sugar and tobuild one's diet on a base of complex carbohydrates by eating more grains, fruits, and vegetables. Onlymoderate quantities of meats and diary products are needed for a healthy diet. Though the pyramid is astep in the right direction, there has been some criticism. One criticism is that tier three does not distin-guish between plant and animal sources of protein, nor high and low-fat sources of protein or dairy prod-ucts. All are lumped together in the same tier, despite the fact that these different foods have different 190 Planning Food Choices CONTENT A )MODULE \"vnutritional impacts in the diet. Therefore, nutrition education programs will need to help people under-stand how to differentiate between high-fat and low-fat choices on the same tier. The Food Guide Pyra-mid, including the recommended number of servings from each food group, is represented on a studenthandout in this module.Deciding whether or not to include certain foods in menu planning should also be based on the resourcesavailable for preparing that food. Money and time for preparation are perhaps the biggest considerations;both are likely to be limited. Fortunately, the cost of food is not determined by its nutrient value. Byplanning menus that use foods in season and less expensive forms of food, and that take advantage ofspecial prices at food stores, consumers can control food costs. The time and energy spent in preparationof the food is influenced by the foods themselves, the forms of food purchased, equipment and cookingfacilities available, and the cooking method. With many choices available to consumers, menus can beplanned considering the level of resources. Interest and skill also have an impact on time and energyspent in food preparation.Foods selected for family menus should also be appealing. Family traditions, culture, and the food likesand dislikes are all considerations. In addition, most people \"eat with their eyes,\" and pleasing combina-tions of food attractively served can stimulate the appetite and enhance family meals and the appeal ofnutritious foods. Variety in appeal can be added by considering color, size and shape, texture, flavor,temperature, and methods of cooking. These considerations add enjoyment and attractiveness to meals.The number of families eating away from home has dramatically increased in recent years. The NationalRestaurant Association estimates that on the average, each person eats out about 192 times a year. In1993, an average day found about $500 million being spent at the restaurant industry's nearly 500,000outlets nationwide. On an average day, about 50 percent of U.S. adults are food-service patrons (Stan-dard & Poor's Industry Survey, 1993). The Helming Group, a Kansas City-based agriculture and foodindustry consulting firm, predicts that in 1995, consumers willfor the first timespend more of theirfood dollar for away-from-home meals than for meals prepared at home (Dorsch, 1990). This trend hasbeen influenced by easy access to restaurants that provide take-out, drive-through, or delivery service andto changing lifestyles and demographics. An increase in the number of women in the work force hasresulted in less time at home and an increased need for convenient and time-saving food preparation.Two-income households have also increased and generally mean less time for food preparation at home,but more money for food. Adolescents contribute greatly to this trend; with visits to fast-food restaurantsincreasing 25 percent for children aged 6 to 17 between 1982 and 1986. Quick-service restaurants captureeight out of ten restaurant visits by children under 18 years of age (Gonzales, 1988).Fortunately, consumers who are aware of how to make wise food choices are having an effect on foodsoffered at restaurants. More and more restaurants are changing their menus to satisfy an increasinglynutrition-conscious clientele. A growing number of restaurants are actively promoting nutritious or low-calorie foods by highlighting nutritious items on the menu or having separate menus for health-consciousdiners. Almost three out of four restaurants will alter the way they prepare food at a diner's request,including serving sauce or salad dressing on the side, cooking without salt, and broiling or baking food (CONTENT A )MODULE .1PPlanning Food Choices instead of frying (FDA Consumer, 1987). Items such as diet beverages, sugar substitutes, whole-grainbread, fresh fruit, reduced-calorie dressings, and lean meats are now included in most restaurant menus. With these options available, it is possible to eat nutritiously away from home by keeping a few of thefollowing guidelines in mind: 1.Choose restaurants and other food establishments that provide a variety of food choices, includingfresh fruits and vegetables, and low-fat entree choices.2.At the fast food restaurants, order small sandwiches with low-fat condiments and a salad with low-fattoppings.3.Order low-fat milk, fruit juices, or water instead of soda.With the increasing complexity of family life, time for planning menus and food choices to be eaten athome is limited. One of the biggest challenges is to involve family members in the process of choosingfoods. Conflicts can occur between family members regarding food chosen. Constructive conflictresolution can bring families closer together. The key to constructive conflict resolution is to build up,not tear down, each other's self-esteem (Lamanna & Riedmann, 1991). Guidelines for constructiveconflict resolution focus on developing empathy and altruism:(1)Listen for thoughts, wants, fears, and feelings without interrupting and criticizing;(2)Level with each other authentically and explicitly about feelings;.(3)Use I-statements to avoid attacks;(4)Give feedback and check your interpretation out with the other person;(5) Choose the time and place carefully;(6)Focus anger only on specific issues happening now;(7) Know what the fight is about;(8) Ask for specific changes, but be open to compromise;(9) Be willing to change yourself; and(10) Seek solutions agreeable to all rather than trying to win at the expense of others. Though individuals and families have different styles of conflict resolution, the practical problem solvingprocess can help families choose a good strategy for dealing with conflict about food choices. Involvingfamily members in decisions about food choices not only models eating nutritiously, but enhances thequality of family life with effective communication.

Directions: 1.Develop a three-day written menu plan for your family that reflects the Dietary Guidelines forAmericans and the recommendations of the Food Guide Pyramid. Provide information aboutapproximate serving size. Use descriptive words in your plan such as: baked chicken, friedpotatoes, or tossed salad with reduced fat Italian dressing.Use the following critical questions to develop the meal plan:(a) Does the meal plan enhance the nutritional well-being of myself and my family members?(b ) Are the foods I've included appealing to family members?(c) Is the menu plan workable, considering my family's resources? 2.Use the Lab Planning Form (p. 25-26) to plan and prepare the meals in your menu plan. 3.Complete the Lab Product Evaluation Form (p. 54) to determine if the foods you served metyour criteria with regard to quality, nutritional value, and cost. Use the Lab Process Evalua-tion Form (p. 52-53) to assess your management, preparation, and cooperation with otherfamily members. Try to complete the evaluation form before preparing the next meal, so thatyou will have feedback on your performance in order to improve. 4.Keep a record of the time you spend planning your meals, finding the recipes, preparing thefood, serving the meal, and cleaning up. 5.Record your thoughts throughout the project in a journal. Your entries might contain yourfeelings concerning your successes and a discussion of the areas for improvement and difficul-ties you have with the project. 6.Write a summary of the project and evaluate your successes and areas for continued improve-ment. 7.Organize a project folder with all the above materials and submit it at the end of the project. 206 Nutrition and Wellness Planning Food Choices A Profile of Restaurant-Goers The National Restaurant Association con-ducted a behavior and attitude survey toprobe how consumers' health and nutritionconcerns affect what they order when diningout. Although most Americans are aware ofhealth and nutrition issues, not all of thembehave alike when ordering in restaurants.Four distinct groups were identified: Traditional ConsumersThese consumers tend to eat what they likeregardless of nutritional value. They frequentfast food places, do not diet, and exercisemoderately. They do not restrict their use ofsalt, sugar, fat or cholesterol, and don't eatfoods high in fiber, complex carbohydrates,or calcium. When eating out, they like steakor roast beef, regular (not diet) soft drinks,fried chicken, fried fish, and other seafood,and rich, gooey chocolate desserts. To thesepeople, taste is definitely the most importantthing when eating out. Weight Conscious ConsumersKey words for this group are \"diet,\" \"reducedcalories,\" and \"substitute.\" These restaurant-goers diet, limit their use of salt, sugar, fat,and cholesterol, and they eat more foods highin fiber and calcium. They patronize moder-ately priced or\"fine dining\" restaurants wherethey order low-fat,low-calorie desserts. They would \"eat if it was not so fattening.\"Health Conscious ConsumersThese consumers exercise often, limit theirsalt, sugar, fat, and cholesterol, and preferfoods high in fiber, calcium, and complexcarbohydrates. They seldom eat at fast-foodoutlets, preferring midscale and upscale res-taurants, where they tend to order vegetablesseasoned with herbs or lemon juice, broiledor baked fish, whole-wheat bread, skinlesspoultry, and fresh fruit. This group believesthat good diet and nutrition play a key role inthe prevention of serious illness and is un-likely to forsake their commitment to nutri-tion even when dining out fora special occa-sion.Uncommitted ConsumersThese busy, on-the-go consumers don't diet.They frequent fast food and midscale restau-rants. They are moderate in their attempts tolimit salt, sugar, fat, and cholesterol. Theydon't eat foods high in fiber, calcium orcomplex carbohydrates. What they like whendining out is whole-wheat bread, skinlesspoultry, diet sodas, and broiled or baked fishand other seafood. They are not likely tomake a point about eating nutritious foodswhen eating out. 2072.1 3 Nutrition and Wellrpss Planning Food Choices .%-Comparing Restaurant Meals toDietary Recommendations I.Write the meal you have selected from a restaurant menu.

Food budgeting *This competency builder is addressed in Content Module 6: Preparing and Serving Food. Content Module 6 explores food preparation skills, and Content Module 7 focuses on the selectionand use of equipment.Teacher Note: This module is the first in a series of three that focus on the practical problem\"What should I do regarding preparing food?\" This module examines obtaining and storing food, 2112 1 ),Obtaining and Storing Food (CONTENT/MODULE 0Teacher Background InformationRationaleThe goal of obtaining and storing food involves obtaining food in sufficient quantities to feed all membersof the household, as well as choosing food of sufficient quality to nurture growth and development andmaintain good health (Morris, et al., 1992). The food distribution system seeks to provide access to foodthat is logistically reasonable, affordable, and socially acceptable to all individuals acquiring the food.Life situations often influence food selection as well as which family member makes that selection. Adultwomen no longer exclusively purchase and plan the household meals. Today, that role is often sharedwith the men and children in the home.Seventy percent of teens indicate that they shop for food for themselves and/or their families.Eighty-five percent of the men shopping for food are shopping for their family. Of the total numberof people shopping, 44 percent are men.Adequate economic resources do not guarantee appropriate selection of food items to ensure nutritionalquality. Since only 30 percent of people surveyed like to shop for food, it is no wonder that half of allgrocery store purchases are impulse selections. The challenge to educators is to provide American citi-zens, especially the children and teens who are now sharing food acquisition responsibilities, with theknowledge necessary to select, store, and utilize nutritionally adequate foods. Marketers understand thatfood acquisition methods differ for different socioeconomic groups, age groups, and genders, and use thisinformation to their advantage.BackgroundSomeone pays for all the food consumed in America (Manchester, 1991). Of the total amount of foodused in this country in 1989, most (81 percent) was paid for out of the pockets of families and individuals.The government paid for 4.8 percent through the school lunch, food stamp, and donated foods programs,and through feeding the armed forces and prisoners in Federal institutions. Businesses paid for an all timehigh of 12.5 percent of food consumed by their employees in restaurants or on-premise food service, orthrough business meal reimbursements. Seeds, fuel, and feeds for food produced at home accounted for19 percent of food expenditures in 1929, but only 1.6 percent in 1989, indicating that we have becomeless self-reliant for our food requirements.The number of dollars spent on food increases as income rises, but as a percentage of total family income,food expenditures require a lower proportion of income. In 1986, individuals in the lowest incomebracket (under $5,000 per year, $2,343 average income) spent far more than their income (486.9 percent)on all goods and services, and 76.6 percent of income on food. Of this 29.4 percent was spent on foodeaten away from home. Those with incomes $50,000 or more spent $6,358 on food, but this accountedfor only 8.7 percent of their total income. Individuals in this income category spent only 4.4 percent ofincome on food eaten away from home, but the actual amount exceeded expenditures of those in all otherincome categories. 9 1c:2121 Obtaining and Storing Food (CONTENT gMODULE.7As economic resources and the proportion of income that can be devoted to food acquisition increases,the options available for food acquisition also increase (Food Marketing Review, 1990).Sales throughthe food marketing system in 1989were estimated to be $694billion, and included $272 billion in retailfood sales and $235 billion in sales by restaurants and institutions. Non-food purchases accounted for 16percent of total food market sales. Neighborhood grocery stores have given way to supermarkets (combi-nation food and drug stores, hypermarkets, superstores, and warehouse stores), and convenience stores.Specialized food stores that sell single food categories such as meat, seafood, dairy, candy, or bakeryitems have become increasingly available.Greater competency in food purchasing and planning is needed to make appropriate food selections intoday's complex retail food system. Food selection competency requires nutritional knowledge to selectfoods that meet growth and development and health maintenance needs of the family. Yet, the food mustbe affordable, and many nutritionally-altered foods carry premium prices. The ability to decide thebenefits versus the disadvantages of purchasing a particular food is learned and not instinctive.The choice of food purchases has far-reaching consequences not only for the consumer, but for society aswell. Today, the U.S. consumes approximately 660pounds of packaging per person each year, almost 90percent of which becomes solid waste (Central Ohio Solid Waste Authority). Though some packaging isnecessary for containing, carrying, and dispensing products, companies mostly design packaging to beappealing and sell products. Reducing the amount of packaging manufacturers and retailers use andreducing the amount of packaging consumers purchase could greatly extend the capacity of our wastedisposal systems. At the same time, source reduction (decreasing the amount of waste generated at eachstep of development or use) can conserve resources and energy and reduce pollution created during themanufacturing and disposal of packaging. Though some manufacturers and retailers have taken steps todeal with the problem of packaging waste, consumers can help by purchasing recyclable or reasonablypackaged products and by stimulating the packaging practices of manufacturers and retailers.A person's values will also influence their purchasing decisions. If low-fat, organically grown, or all-natural characteristics are valued by a shopper, this may influence the choice between two products,regardless of price. Sociopsychological satisfaction gained from food can be a strong factor influencingfood purchasing. Market trends had been moving to capture the health-conscience niche in the 1980's,but the 1990's seem to have started with a movement back to \"comfort foods,\" such as those foods thatappeal to sociopsychological needs. This appears to be happening at the expense of the health-consciencemovement. To satisfy various marketing niches, food companies have introduced over 60,000 newgrocery items since 1982, with over 12,000 items in one year alone. The failure rate of new food productsis estimated to be between 90 and 99 percent (Food Marketing Review, 1990). Some foods simply do notsucceed with the public, but this large failure rate also means that companies are responding to changingmarket demographics and tastes.To capture the attention of a particular market niche, food advertisers use color, shape, and other elementsof design to attract a customer. Placement of the product in the supermarket can determine if the shoppersees the product. Phrases printed on the front of packages can be designed to appeal to the shopper'sneeds and values. For example, in past years food companies used nutrition and health claims to appeal 2132I (CONTENT z)MODULE.Obtaining and Storing Food A food product that isTable 1Health Claims Allowed on Labels of Packaged Foods Can be related to the decreased risk ofHigh in calciumHigh in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetablesHigh in fruits or vegetables (high in dietary fiber or vitamins A or C)High in fiber from fruits, vegetables, and grain productsLow in fatLow in saturated fat and cholesterolLow in sodiumOsteoporosis of Packaged FoodsDefinition*Less than 5 calories40 calories or less**1/3 fewer calories of 50% less fat; if more than half the calories are from fat, fat contentmust he reduced by 50% or more50% less sodiumLess than 1/2 gram fat3 grams or less fat**Less than 2 milligrams cholesterol and 2 grams or less of saturated fat**20 milligrams or less cholesterol and 2 grams or less saturated fat**Less than 5 milligrams sodium**140 milligrams of less sodium**5 grams or more fiber *Per Reference Amount (standard serving size).

The claims were often based on weak evidence that a true con-nection could be made between consumption of that food and human health. Marketers were takingadvantage of people's concerns in order to sell the product.Food labeling authority in the United States is shared by two federal agencies, the Food Safety andInspection Service (FSIS), part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Adminis-tration (FDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The FSIS regulates thelabeling of meat and poultry p.roducts, while the FDA regulates the labeling of virtually all other foodproducts and the ingredients that are added to food. The food labeling regulations enacted in January1993 provide consumers with the information they need to make informed food choices at the point ofpurchase. The new regulations accomplish the following:(I) Expand mandatory nutrition labeling to virtually all food products.(2) Require a uniform list of nutrients for all products.(3) Define standard serving sizes for many food product categories.(4) Define health claims that describe the relationship between a food or food component and a disease orhealth-related condition, such as fat and cancer, calcium and osteoporosis, sodium and high bloodpressure.(5) Define label words and phrases like \"calorie free,\" \"low-fat,\" and \"light.\"(6) Establish new label reference values for nutrients and food components.(7) Provide a revised nutrition label format.Recent changes in the nutritional labeling of foods do not prohibit health claims on foods, but do controlwhat claims are being made to ensure a sound research base for the claim and how the information ispresented on the package (Browne, 1993). The allowed claims are shown in Table 1. Definitions ofwords used to describe nutrition content are also controlled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Someof these definitions are shown in Table 2.Food purchasing requires knowledge of nutrition, food safety, and marketing techniques to maximizeavailable economic resources. A variety of retail food outlets are available, but not necessarily availableto all because of economic limitations or physical impairments. In America, food is a right, not a privi-lege. Yet, inability or unwillingness to make wise food purchasing choices can seriously limit the benefitgained from that right. ReferencesBrowne, M. B.

Gone are the days of the 1920swhen the typical family would sit at the table and eat food that was truly farm fresh. It included milk fromthe farm's cows, fruit from the family orchard, meat from the smokehouse, eggs from the hen house, andmaybe a pot roast prepared with carrots, onions, and potatoes from the garden. For the sweet tooth, honeyfrom the orchard beehive and berries from the thicket might have been provided.Today's family may still have a garden but quite typically the majority of the food consumed in the home todayis purchased in a supermarket. Today's food system relies heavily on the middleman to get agriculturalproducts to consumers. By the year 1987, 2.1 million workers were engaged in producing food, but more that13 million were employed in marketing it, and 8 million people worked in the food industry. Just as it did70 years ago, the food still goes from the field to the table, but now it has many more stops along the way.A winter meal 7() years ago likely consisted of preserved fruits, vegetables, a:id meat, whereas today's mealcould include such items as fresh grapes from Chile, lettuce and tomatoes from Mexico, and pineapples fromHawaii. Fast shipping and controlled atmosphere warehousing has contributed greatly to the quality andvariety of foods we have available to us.Another change in the food industry has been where food consumption takes place. In the 1920s most foodconsumption took place in the home. Most farmers' wives' full-time job was to produce, process, and preparemeals for their families. It has been estimated that as late as the World War II era, it took six hours to preparedaily meals. Conversely, the time for food preparation in today's society has dropped to approximately 90minutes. Frozen and processed foods have played a large role in this decline. By the year 2000, it is estimatedthat 7 out of 10 women will work outside of the home. This decreased time in the home coupled with increasedfamily income will continue to decrease the time on food preparation in the home. A survey by the RandCorporation in 1987 revealed that most women would prefer to spend no more than 30 minutes on mealpreparation and most men would prefer this time for preparation be reduced to 15 minutes.This change to convenience is evident in today's society. It is estimated that 45 percent of all food dollarsis spent on food eaten outside of the home. This increase of food eaten outside of the home can he noticedin the rapid expansion of food industry workers. Nearly 600,000 food service outlets, employing more thaneight million people gross 207 billion dollars per year. This number of food service workers is expected toexpand to over 10.5 billion workers by the year 2000. More than 78 billion meals and snacks are preparedand eaten away from the home each year. The Washington Post conducted a survey recently that indicatedthat this trend will continue as our population continues to age. Only 25 percent of those 65 years and older,compared to nearly 60 percent of those between 18 and 34, cat fast food at least once a week.Take-home and delivery food items have also increased rapidly during the past decade. From 1983 to 1987,home delivery of meals increased over 280 percent. Needless to say, home food delivery is now the fastestgrowing segment of the food industry. Additionally, the Restaurant Business magazine reports that 44 percentof restaurant traffic is now carry out. Supermarkets have not been left behind in this trend either, as theaddition of delis and salad bars have allowed these businesses to capture more than 25 percent of the take-out ready-to-cat market.Indeed the make-up of our food system has changed greatly during the past 70 years. Few American families,rural or urban, depend on a garden to feed their families, let alone worry about preserving meats, fruits, andvegetables. Long hours spent over hot stoves have essentially been replaced by a few minutes spent in frontof a microwave or at a fast-food restaurant or deli.With these changes. food safety and preservation concerns have been raised.

Mr. Jonespicks up the plastic jug of milk and heads for the checkout. In the meantime, Eric has been eyeingthe candy, and asks if he can have some. Mr. Jones says \"Yes,\" and Eric places his choice(individually wrapped jaw-breakers) on the counter. The clerk rings up the purchase and puts themilk jug in a paper bag. Eric demands his own bag for his candy, and the clerk looks questioninglyat Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones nods to the clerk, who gives Eric his own bag. Once out of the store, Erictakes his candy out of the bag and throws the bag away. Mr. Jones does the same with his bag whenhe gets home. Case Study 2Jenny is packing a lunch to eat at school. She gets out a disposable brown paper bag and puts ina paper napkin. She chooses a cheese, cracker, and lunch meat single-serving package from therefrigerator and adds it to the bag. She also puts in a juice box. After adding a peeled orangewrapped in aluminum foil and an individually packaged granola bar, she heads for school. Atlunch time, she eats the food, drinks the juice, and throws all the waste paper in the giant trash binin the school cafeteria. Case Study 3Mark and Jill are on their way home from school and are starving. They stop at the fast-foodrestaurant for a burger, fries, and soda. They pay, pick up the bag with their order, and go to thenearby park to eat. Mark opens the bag and takes out the sodas and paper napkins. He puts a plasticstraw through the plastic spill proof lid on his paper cup, then grabs for the cardboard containerholding the fries. \"You like ketchup?\" he asks Jill, as he opens the plastic ketchup packet.Meanwhile, Jill is eating her burger, having stuffed the Styrofoam box, designed to keep the burgerwarm, back into the bag. She adds some pepper from the little paper packet, but decides shedoesn't need the salt she got, so she leaves it in the bag. When they're finished eating, Mark andJill put the garbage (from two burgers, two sodas and one order of French fries) in the trash canand head home. 2342.41 Criteria for Comparing Food Aol2re.i zu:.:,....z.,is.,,44/1,Complete the chart below using a display of food products and packaging. \u00b00Form/Brand ,Preparation Time :Nutritional Value CostTasteEase of 3 I..1 1 2422 .4 Obtaining and Storing Food Ten Steps to Supermarket Savvy 1.

Teacher Background InformationRationaleNutritious food is readily available in this country. Consumers need economic resources, time, and theknowledge to select and acquire the foods that are available. Two thirds of Americans surveyed purchaseconvenience foods, and most of these people were willing to pay more for food products that would also 239 (CONTENTMODULE \"Preparing and Serving Food save them time. At the same time, 12.7 million children eat reduced price or free lunches in school and10 percent of all Americans must rely on food stamps to purchase food (Dairy & Nutrition Council MidEast, 1992). Scarce economic resources are often squandered or wasted on foods of limited nutritionalquality, resulting in achievement of satiety but eventually a deterioration of health.Teens and children are assuming a greater role in food preparation for families, especially in single parentfamilies or dual-career families. Knowing this, food companies are marketing products to this youngermarket by promoting foods that appeal to younger taste and using advertisements that use colors andimages that children like. Taste, rather than health and nutrition, is often the criteria used to select itemsin this youth-oriented niche market. Learning to prepare food beyond the use of the microwave oven isessential to help young people develop a skill needed throughout life. Failure of society to help youngpeople learn these essential skills, could result in a population that is unhealthymore obesity, morediabetes, more heart disease, more of some types of cancer, and more general malnutrition (DietaryGuidelines Advisory Committee, 1990). Teaching a teen to select, prepare, and serve nutritious foods canpotentially have a greater economic impact than the cost of teaching young people these skills. BackgroundAmerican food habits have evolved since the 40s and 50s when many mothers prepared the meal and thefamily members sat at the table together to eat and share the day. Income has increased, but more time isspent earning that money and more women are active in the workplace to add to the family income. Astime for food preparation decreases and income increases, more money is spent on food that is eaten athome or away from home (Food Marketing Institute, 1990). There has been an upward trend in theamount of money spent on food eaten away from home, reflecting the reduction in time available forhome preparation of meals. Sales of restaurants flattened in 1989, even as personal income rose, appar-ently because of price wars among fast-food chains that resulted in slower price increases than for foodpurchased for home use (Food Marketing Review, 1990). Even though overall sales were flat, fast-foodsales were up slightly compared to full-service restaurant sales. Drive-through service increased at afaster rate than all other styles of service, but phone delivery, phone pick-up, and counter service allincreased while table service declined. Apparently not only is less time being devoted to home-preparation of food, but time spent in acquisition of prepared foods is also declining. Increased relianceon this source of food can be problematic. Limited and fixed variety of foods available in food serviceestablishments provides a challenge when selecting foods based on dietary guideline recommendations.Variety and quantity of foods available in the United States are limitless, but knowledge to maximize thenutritional potential of that food is not. A diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol can help maintain adesirable level of serum cholesterol, but foods high in fat are often selected for meals and snacks. Percapita consumption of butter and, to a lesser extent, margarine, has decreased somewhat over the lasttwenty years, but per capita consumption of shortening and vegetable oils has doubled during the sametime period (Putnam & Allshouse, 1991). Per capita consumption data includes all of the foods that usethese items as ingredients, such as potato chips, pastry and other baked goods, as well as spreads and 240) A Preparing and Serving Food CCONTENTMODULE 13toppings. Although some improvement has been made in educating people to select less of some types ofhigh-fat foods such as butter, the fat is still being used in other forms. Teens are participating in foodpreparation in the household more, especially in single-family households and dual-career households(Dairy & Nutrition Council Mid East, 1993). These teens are in need of nutritional information that willhelp them spot potentially unhealthy foods. When using recipes and combining food ingredients, theyneed knowledge of food science principles so that they can select and successfully substitute healthieringredients in the food products they are making.Nutrition knowledge is important for young people responsible for meal planning and preparation, butother information is needed for that teen to be truly knowledgeable of meal management. Teens are busyas are the adults in the household, so time management in meal preparation is a skill needed by theseyouth. If sensory appeal of the food is lacking, disposal of the food without consumption is a waste of thepotential nutrition and the economic resources used to acquire that food. Preparation and service ofnutritious and safe food does not occur unless the preparer is knowledgeable of techniques to maximizethe sensory and economic value of food. It he challenge of educators to ensure that all citizens haveattained this knowledge as part of their life skills -ducation (Kinder, Green, & Harris, 1984).Once acquired, food must be stored and prepared in a manner that maintains safety before it can meet thenutritional needs of family members. In spite of our technology, foodborne illness continues to be amajor problem in this country. The situation is especially dangerous for vulnerable populations, whichinclude youth, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The confirmed link between relativerisk and probability of death from foodborne illness has made this aspect of the food safety issue thenumber one concern of scientists and other health professionals (Food Marketing Institute,1990). Eventhough foodborne illness can arise from a multitude of causes, as few as seven types of bacteria have beenidentified as the cause of one quarter of the foodbome illness outbreaks reported between 1973 and 1984.These bacteria caused 43 percent of reported cases and 75 percent of the deaths attributed to foodborneillness (USDA, 1989). Viruses, parasites, and chemical contaminants are also responsible for causingfoodbome illness. Only a small portion of actual cases of food poisoning are reported as such each yearsince it has been estimated that millions of people confuse their symptoms with non-specific conditionslike \"the flu\" (USDA, 1988). Whether reported or unreported, foodborne illness is costly to the economy.Diarrheal foodborne illnesses alone may cost this country $3.5 to $17 billion dollars a year consideringmedical care, lost wages, public health investigations, lost business, and possible legal action (USDA,1989).Maintenance of health is clearly the most obvious goal of food preparation and consumption. Ability toselect nutritious food items should accompany knowledge of time management, budgeting, food science,and enhancement of food palatability to complete the meal management process. Because of the increas-ing participation of teens and children in the process of food preparation, knowledge of food is not anexclusive need of adults. Because food demands such a large proportion of a family's economic re-sources, the time and effort to teach youth food preparation skills will have an economic impact beyondthe cost of teaching these skills. 2412 9 CONTENT 4)MODULE \"ReferencesPreparing and Serving Food AHEA.

Or use stir-fry techniques with a smallamount of vegetable oil.2. Season foods with herbs and spices rather than butter, margarine, or heavy sauces. When some typeof fat must he used, substitute oils from corn, cottonseed, soy, or safflower for hydrogenated fats orbutter.3. When greasing a pan, use nonstick spray or paper liners.4. Use limited amounts of oil-based dressings. Try low-fat or no-fat dressings.5. Try whole-grain flours to enhance the flavor of baked goods made with less fat and less cholesterol-containing ingredients.6. Replace whole milk with skim or low-fat milk in puddings, soups, and baked products.7. Substitute plain low-fat yogurt, blender-whipped low-fat cottage cheese, or buttermilk in recipes thatcall for sour cream or mayonnaise.8. Choose lean cuts of meat. Trim fat from meat before and/or after cooking. Remove skin frompoultry.9. Cook meat and poultry on a rack so that fat will drain off.10. Chill broth from meat until fat becomes solid. Spoon off fat before using broth.1 1. Substitute egg whites in recipes calling for whole eggs. Use two egg whites in place of each wholeegg in muffins, cookies, and puddings. To reduce sodium in recipes:1. Decrease the amount of salt added to the recipe. Omit or substitute ingredients high in salt, such assoup mixes, bullion cubes, or condiments.2. Substitute spices and herbs instead of salt.3. Reduce salt used in cooking pasta, rice, noodles, and hot cereals. 'To reduce sugar in recipes:1. Reduce sugar in recipes gradually until decreased by one third or more.2. Experiment with spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger to enhance flavor.3. Use home-prepared foods or ingredients instead of commercially prepared foods higher in sugar. 254 Nutrition and WellnossPreparing and Serving Food Kitchen Safety Tips To avoid burns:Use pot holders to grab hot pan handles and remove food from the oven.Turn handles of pots and pans inward but not directly over other burners.When stirring, steady the pan by holding the handle with a pot holder. Avoid stirring with ametal spoon that gets very hot when left in a pan on the range.Tilt and lift covers of hot pans away from you to prevent burns from steam.Put out a grease fire on your range by putting a lid on the pan, pouring salt or baking soda onthe fire and turning off the range. Don't throw water on a grease fire.Keep matches in a closed container in a safe place. To avoid cuts and falls:When cutting food, always cut away from yourself.Dry hands before handling equipment.Use a step stool or sturdy chair for reaching high shelves.Store heavy items (such as mixing bowls or casserole dishes) where they can be easily reached.On high shelves they can be easily dropped as you stretch to reach them.Wipe up spills on the floor right away.Close cupboard doors or drawers to avoid painful bumps. To avoid electric shock:Plug in and unplug electric appliances with dry hands.Keep electrical cords away from the sink. General guidelines:Keep drawers and cupboard doors locked or tied shut if you have small children. They caneasily be injured by knives and other dangerous items in the kitchen.Do not store cleaning products under the sink if you have small children in your home. Keepthem out of children's reach in a securely fastened cabinet. 2552i Nutrition and Wellness Preparing and Serving Food Bacteria Are Found Everywhere This experiment will help you determine where bacteria are found and where they can grow.Supplies needed:Petri plates with sterile nutrient agarScotch tape swabsInoculation sources (as chosen below)Marking pens 1.In food laboratory groups, choose one or more of the contamination sources listed below.Using a petri plate (don't take the lids off before you are ready to contaminate them),inoculate your plate in the manner described for your chosen contamination.(a) Hands: Gently touch fingers to the agar, or gently lay your hand on the agar andremove it, or lightly trace an \"S\" pattern on the agar with your finger tip. Try severaldishes with different conditions, such as: before hand washing, after washing in coldwater with no soap, after washing with warm water and soap, after 20 seconds of hotwater, or after touching hair.(b) Lips: Touch your lips lightly to the agar, which is non toxic.(c) Hair: Remove a piece of hair from your head and gently lay it on the agar. Try toavoid touching the agar with your fingers.(d) Cough: Hold the plate two to three inches from your mouth and cough directly ontothe agar.(e) Coin: Place a coin (a dime, nickel, or quarter works best) on top of the agar in themiddle of the plate. Or gently rub or roll the coin over the surface of the agar (try notto dig a hole in the agar). 2.Use scotch tape to seal your plate, wrapping the tape around the edges of the plate. 3.On the bottom of each plate, write your group's name and the source of bacteria. 4.Use an incubator to keep the plates at 85 degrees. Turn the plates upside down so that themoisture droplets that form will not fall on the agar. You can incubate them at roomtemperature, but it will take longer for the microorganisms to grow. Keep the plates awayfrom windows since UV light kills bacteria. 5.Wash your hands after handling the plates. Some of the microorganisms on the plates canmake you sick. 6.Without removing the lids, examine the plates at least twice: after 24 hours and 48 hours.Record the growth of organisms that you see, including their shape and any other character-istics.

However, the unappetizing truth is that what weeat can be the vehicle for foodborne illnesses that can cause a variety of unpleasant symptomsand may be life-threatening. Tens of millions of cases of foodborne diarrhea disease occur in theUnited States every year, at a cost to the economy of an estimated $1 billion to $10 billion.The Food and Drug Administration has given high priority to combating microbial contamina-tion of the food supply. But the agency can't do the job alone. Part of the responsibility forpreventing foodborne illness lies with consumers. Thirty percent of all such illness results fromunsafe handling of food at home.The prime causes of foodborne illness are a collection of bacteria with tongue-twisting names:Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, and hepatitis A virus round out the list.These organisms can become unwelcome guests at the dinner table. They are present in a widerange of foods, including meat, milk and other dairy products, coconut, fresh pasta, spices,chocolate, seafood, and even water. Egg products, tuna, potato and macaroni salads, and cream-filled pastries harboring these pathogens also are implicated in foodborne illnesses, as arevegetables grown in soil fertilized with contaminated manure. Poultry is the food most oftencontaminated with disease-causing organisms. It has been estimated that 60 percent or more ofraw poultry sold at retail probably carries some disease-causing bacteria.Bacteria as Licteria monocytogenes, Vibrio found se tfood. Oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, and cockles may be carriers of thehepatitis A virus.Careless food handling sets the stage for the growth of disease-causing \"bugs.\" For example, hotor cold foods left standing too long at room temperature provide an ideal climate for the rowthof bacteria. Improper cooking also plays a role in foodborne illness.Foods may be cross-contaminated when cutting boards and kitchen tools that have been used toprepare a contaminated food, such as raw chicken, are not properly cleaned before being usedfor another food such as vegetables. 11111MrSource: National Council for Agricultural Education.

However, symptoms will vary according to the type ofbacteria and the amount of contaminants eaten.Symptoms may appear as early as half an hour after eating the contaminated food or they may not develop forseveral days or weeks. They usually last only a day or two, but in some cases can persist a week to 10 days. Formost healthy people, foodborne illnesses are neither long-lasting nor life-threatening. However, they can besevere in the very young, the very old, and those who are already ill or whose immune systems are suppressed.(See \"Food Safety Crucial for People with Lowered Immunity\" in the July-August 1990 FDA Consumer.)When symptoms are severe, the victim should see a doctor or get emergency help. For mild cases of foodpoisoning, liquid intake should be maintained to replace fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Unlike most foodborne illnesses, the symptoms of botulism are neurological and can be fatal. Emergency careis essential.Shopping for Food Safety The idea that food on the dinner table can make someone sick may he disturbing, but there are many steps youcan take to protect your families and dinner guests. Prevention of food poisoning starts with your trip to the supermarket. Examine packaged and canned foods. Don'tbuy food in cans that are bulged or dented or in jars that are cracked or have loose or bulging lids. Look forexpiration dates on the labels and never buy outdated food. Likewise, check \"use by\" or \"sell by\" dates on dairyproducts such as cottage cheese, cream cheese, yogurt, and sour cream and pick the ones that will stay freshlongest in your refrigerator.If you have a health problem, especially one that may have impaired your immune system, don't eat raw shellfishand use only pasteurized milk and cheese.Choose eggs that are Grade A or better and that are refrigerated in the store. Before putting them in your cart,open the carton and make sure that none are cracked or leaking. Select frozen foods and perishables such as meat, poultry, or fish last. Always put these products in separateplastic bags so that drippings don't contaminate other foods in your shopping cart. Check for cleanliness at the meat or fish counter and the salad bar. For instance, cooked shrimp lying on the samebed or ice as raw fish could become contaminated.When shopping for shellfish, buy from markets that get their supplies from state-approved sources; stay clear ofvendors who sell shellfish from roadside stands or the back of a truck. And if you're planning to harvest your ownshellfish, heed posted warnings about the safety of the water. Take an ice chest along to keep frozen and perishable foods cold if it will take more than an hour to get yourgroceries home.!el 259 Nutrition and WellnessPreparing and Serving Food The Unwelcomed Dinner Guest (continued)Page 3 of 4 Poultry and meat may be stored in the refrigerator as purchased in the plastic wrap for a day or two. Poultryand meat that will not he used in a day or two should he wrapped tightly and put in the freezer. Just make surejuices can't escape to contaminate other foods. Store eggs in their carton in the main part of the refrigerator ratherthan on the door, where the temperature is warmer.Seafood should always he kept in the refrigerator or freezer until preparation time.Don't crowd the refrigerator or freezer so tightly that air can't circulate. Leftovers should he stored in tightcontainers. Check the leftovers in covered dishes and storage bags daily for spoilage. Anything that looks orsmells suspicious should be thrown out. Do not taste food to see if it is spoiled.A sure sign of spoilage is the presence of mold, which can grow even under refrigeration. While not a majorhealth threat, mold can make food unappetizing.Mold is deceptive in that only a small part is visible. The larger part extends below the surface of the food.However, it is possible to save a part of the food by cutting off and discarding the visible blemish along witha large section of the food around it.May items besides fresh meats, vegetables, and dairy products need to he kept cold. For instance, mayonnaiseand ketchup should go in the refrigerator after being opened. Some spices keep best when refrigerated. Alwayscheck the labels on cans or jars to determine how the contents should he stored. If you've neglected to refrigerateitems, it's usually best to throw them out.For foods that can he stored at room temperature, some precautions will help make sure they remain safe.Potatoes and onions should he stored in a cool, dry place, not under the sink, because leakage from the pipescan damage the food. Potatoes do not belong in the refrigerator. Don't store foods near household cleaningproducts and chemicals.When putting canned foods away, move the older ones to the front of the shelf and put the new cans or packagesin the hack rows so the older ones will he used first. Check all cans to see if any are sticky on the outside. Thismay indicate a leak. Newly purchased cans that appear to he leaking should he returned to the store and the FDAshould he notified. Rule #1Keep It Clean The first role of safe food preparation in the home is: Keep everything clean.The cleanliness rule applies to the areas where food is prepared and, most importantly, to the cook. It's commonsense to wash hands thoroughly before starting to prepare a meal and after handling raw meat or poultry. Coverlong hair with a net or scarf, and he sure that any open sores or cuts on the hands are completely covered. Ifthe sore or cut is infected, stay out of the kitchen. 2600 1 ' Nutrition and WellnessPreparing and Serving Food The Unwelcomed Dinner Guest (continued) Rule #2Keep Temperature RightPage 4 of 4 The second rule of home food preparation is: Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Use a thermometer toensure that meats are completely cooked. For instance, beef and lamb should be cooked to at least 140\u00b0 F, porkand poultry to 165\u00b0F. Don't eat poultry that is pink inside. Eggs should he cooked until the white is firm andthe yolk begins to harden.Seafood should he thoroughly cooked. Fish is done when the thickest part becomes opaque and the fishflakes easily when poked with a fork. Shrimp can be simmered three to five minutes or until the shells turnred. Clams and mussels are steamed over boiling water until the shells open (5 to 10 minutes). Oystersshould be sauteed, baked, or boiled until plump, about five minutes.Protect seafood from cross-contamination after cooking, and eat it promptly.Cooked foods should not be left standing on the table or kitchen counter for more than two hours. Disease-causing bacteria grow in temperatures between 40\u00b0F to 140\u00b0F. Cooked foods that have been in thistemperature range for more than two hours should not be eaten.If a dish is to he served hot, get it from the stove to the table as quickly as possible. Reheated foods shouldhe brought to a temperature of at least 165 \u00b0F. Keep cold foods in the refrigerator or on a bed of ice untilserving. This rule is particularly important to remember in the summer months.After the meal, leftovers should be refrigerated as soon as possible. Meats should be cut in slices of threeinches or less and all foods should be stored in small shallow containers to hasten cooling. Be sure toremove all the stuffing from roast turkey or chicken and store it separately. Leftovers should he usedwithin three days.And here are just a few more parting tips to keep your favorite dishes safe. Don't thaw meat and otherfrozen foods at room temperature. Instead, move them from the freezer to the refrigerator for a day or two;or defrost in cold water (changing water every 30 minutes), in the microwave oven, or during the cookingprocess. Never taste any food that looks or smells \"off,\" or comes out of leaking, bulging, or severelydamaged cans or jars with leaky lids.Though all of these do's and don'ts may seem overwhelming, remember, if you want to stay healthy, whenit comes to food safety, the old saying \"rules are made to he broken\" does not apply!

Teacher Background InformationRationaleAn average family invests from $2,000 to $5,000 or more in household appliances. Major kitchenappliances often are a family's largest expenditures after the purchase of a home and car. The invest-ment increases over time as income increases and appliances with new features appear on the market.Knowledge regarding what equipment is available and the criteria to consider when making equipment 269277 \\c.(CONTENT /0MODULESelecting and Using Equipment decisions can be a big help to consumers, particularly those just establishing a home. The variety ofkitchen appliances available and the introduction of new and more technologically enhanced appliancesincrease the need for more and better knowledge about how to develop selection criteria to meet indi-vidual and/or family needs. BackgroundIn recent years, economic conditions have had a significant impact on the purchase of kitchen appliancesby consumers. Appliance sales depend on housing sales, consumer disposable income levels, and de-mand. We have gone through a period of weak consumer confidence due to high unemployment andconcern about job security. Consumers' willingness to spend money on appliances is influenced byfactors such as daily news related to tax increases, health care reform, and interest rates. For instance,when interest rates are lower, families are more likely to borrow on the equity in their homes or build newones. Housing starts create a market for appliances. Refinancing of existing mortgages frees cash forremodeling and the purchase of replacement appliances.The trend of smaller household sizes influences appliance purchases. Single-parent families, as well asyounger and older people living alone, have decreased overall household size as well as householdincome. Single-person households generally own fewer appliances and live in smaller dwellings. Thissingle-person trend will lessen the demand for such appliances as dishwashers, freezers, washers, dryersand similar appliances whose benefits arc most felt by larger households.Another trend impacting the selection of kitchen appliances relates to the employment rate of womenwho now make up over 57.5 percent of the United States paid labor force. The average employed womanspends 26 hours per week doing household jobs in addition to paid employment. These consumers are inthe market for appliances that save time and energy in the performance of household tasks. As familiesbecome increasingly busy, they will continue to seek time-saving appliances. Two-worker familiesgenerate enough income to buy appliances with new features. These consumers want product perfor-mance and reliability with answers to environmental concerns. Basic appliances such as ranges andrefrigerators continue to hold their place in the market. Microwave sales have peaked and leveled off.Inportables, emphasis is also on basicsfad appliances such as juicers and hand blenders peaked and fellsharply in early 1994. These trends in sales are usually driven by the social or lifestyle orientations ofconsumers; for instance specialized coffee makers reflect interest in gourmet coffees or outdoor cookeryappliances reflect the interest in a different taste for food and a change of pace in usual cooking habits. Sophisticated technological improvements in home equipment offer preprogrammed cycles at the touchof a button that complete an operation in a sequence. More flexibility and more accuracy as well ascontinuously monitoring and diagnostic capabilities are just a few of the currently available advances.Because of the high cost of new housing. the forecast that apartments and homes will be smaller in thefuture, and the continued high cost of energy, water, and basic materials, the major appliances availablewill change to meet the needs of smaller families and more compact housing.1 Selecting and Using Equipment (CONTENTMODULE /Another trend worth noting relates to the changing consumer shopping patterns in the selection of appli-ances. Today's consumers have time constraints and tend to be much better informed before they leavehome to shop. They decide what they want from armchair research and then go shopping for the bestprice. This has implications for educators to emphasize the necessity of studying product literature.Manufacturers' toll-free phone numbers are now available to give immediate answers to additionalquestions. Advertising also has significant impact on consumers, especially those consumers respondingto direct advertising. These include the three-minute infomercials and short one-to-two minute commer-cials with an 800 call-in number. Club stores have experienced tremendous growth and are a commonoutlet for both major and portable appliances. The \"super center\" (supermarket or discount store) placesmore emphasis on portable appliances. Rent-to-own stores are another option, and tend to cater to low-income consumers.These trends indicate that consumers need more and better knowledge regarding the large purchases ofappliances to meet individual and family needs. A number of factors should be considered by the con-sumer when selecting kitchen appliances.Cost. A consumer needs to plan the purchase of appliances. Methods of payment include paying in cash.buying on credit, staggering the purchase over a period of time, or renting-to-own options. Interest ratesare stated in different ways.When evaluating the cost of major appliances, it is important to consider the cost of use over the life ofthe appliance. This not only includes initial cost, but the cost of operation, maintenance, and repair aswell. This is essential information in determining the time required to gain back any increased purchaseprice of a more energy-efficient model through reduced energy bills.Major kitchen appliances are designed to perform particular basic functions; for example, a refrigerator isdesigned to preserve food. A manufacturer's line will include a number of models representing a wideprice range. The low-end models are the least expensive and perform the basic function. Mid-linemodels have some convenience features and sometimes different materials. The top-of-the-line modelsare the most expensive, are more automatic, and generally include more convenience features. Featuresshould be evaluated in terms of what will meet the needs of the individual or family using the product. Itis advisable to he aware of initial price. Usually the initial price of appliances does not include the salestax. Installation cost must also be added if additional electrical, plumbing, or installation fees arecharged. Other factors include delivery and repair services, the reliability of the source, and if the pur-chase is on an installment plan. the cost of the credit.Along with the initial cost of a major appliance, the cost of operation and planned repair should beconsidered. A major kitchen appliance uses energy through its lifetime, probably costing more than theinitial cost. Therefore, cost of use of the appliance is the determinant of whether the appliance is trulyeconomical.Most retailers offer service contracts or extended warranties, especially on major kitchen appliances. If .the manufacturer's warranty covers repairs and labor for one year, there is generally little need for a 2712 -; 9 CONTENT Py)MODULESelecting and Using Equipment service contract for the first year. Since service contracts vary it is important to check the contractcarefully if you want to consider a service contract after the warranty has expired.Time Utilization. Some kitchen appliances may save time and energy, or they may do a better job thancould be done without these appliances. There are, however, examples of portable appliances that do atask well, but the time and energy expended overall including assembling, taking apart, and cleaningwould nullify any advantage that might be realized in time saved by using the appliance to do a task.Safety. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the safety of kitchen appliances than in the past. Still,some are more safe to use than others. Several organizations are involved in testing the safety of kitchenappliances. The Underwriters Laboratories tests products for electrical safety and related causes ofaccidental injury. The American Gas Association certifies that gas appliances comply with nationalsafety standards for both construction and performance. Minimum standards of safety and performancehave been set by other trade associations such as the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers(AHAM), the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI), the American National StandardsInstitute (ANSI), and the National Bureau of Standards, Section of Standards Development Services. TheConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has the responsibility for protecting the public fromunreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products.The manufacturer is also responsible for informing the consumer with safety information. Appliancescarry a nameplate specifying conditions under which it has been constructed to operate. Specificationsinclude types of current, frequency of current, voltage, wattage or amperage and sometimes, on motordriven appliances, horsepower rating. In addition, other special instructions might be found, such as \"Donot immerse in water.\"The public is also responsible for kitchen safety. Attention should he focused on the design features ofappliances that are potential hazards. Sturdy step stools should be available if someone needs to climb toreach inaccessible controls or items. Care should be taken that electrical appliances are not located closeto water sources. Children's safety as well as safety for the elderly should be evaluated carefully. It isimportant to he informed about universal design features on appliances that make them accessible andsafe for use by persons of all ages.Storage. Space is a precious commodity in most kitchens. A kitchen may not provide very much flex-ibility in location of the major appliances. Storage of portable appliances often offers more challenges.General efficiency rules imply that items should he easy to see, reach, and grasp, as well as stored nearpoint of first use. Kitchens are generally organized into use centers with supplies, utensils, and appliancesappropriate to the area. Decisions about using countertop space, space below top-mounted cabinets, andinside cabinets offer many challenges, especially in small kitchens.Maintenance. The user has the responsibility of reading use and care manuals that come with theappliance. The appliance should he used only as intended, and cared for in the way suggested by themanufacturer. Following these directions helps to reduce service needed. 2720 A Selecting and Using Equipment1CCONTENTMODULE /When choosing kitchen appliances, servicing should be an important consideration. It is important tocheck warranty information for location of service, what is covered under warranty, and the responsibili-ties of the buyer.Environmental Concerns. Several environmental issues such as the following involve appliances. 1.Global warming. Ozone depletion suggests that more aggressive energy efficiency appliance stan-dards are needed. New energy and water efficiency standards for dishwashers and home laundryrecently went into effect. 2.Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) phase-out. These substances,used in refrigeration appliances, are potentially harmful to the environment. In 1994, refrigeratorsentered the marketplace containing alternatives to these long-proven technologies. Recovery of CFCand HCFC from old appliances is also picking up pace. 3.Electromagnetic fields. These fields surround some small appliances and may be potentially harmfulto health. The impact of electromagnetic fields on health is currently a very hot issue with portableappliances. 4.Solid waste management. Disposal of large appliances in land fills and dumps is hazardous to theenvironment due to the chemicals used in making and operating the appliances. AHAM has a newAppliance Recycling Information Center to encourage responsible disposal.ReferencesPickett, M. S., Arnold, M. G.,& Ketterer, L. E. (1986).

Studentsshould be aware of the impact of nutrition and wellness issues such as hunger, malnutrition, chronicdiseases, pollution, available food supplies, labeling, and legislation reflecting policies concerning theseissues.Of all the food and nutrition issues, hunger is the most basic. Because hunger is difficult to measure, cneuseful indicator of hunger is the poverty level. In America more than one out of every five children is 2812 E? 8 Promoting Wellness Issues Throughout Society CCONTENT Q)MODULE g\"poor. Almost two out of every three poor children are white. Nearly half of all black children in Americaare poor. Nearly two out of every five Hispanic children are poor, and more than half of all children infemale-headed families are poor (Children's Defense Fund, 1986). This reflects the probability of a highincidence of hunger.A little closer to home, studies show that in 1990, a reported 1,629,864 people in Ohio had incomesbelow the poverty level as compared to 1,175,296 in 1980. Also in Ohio 21.1 percent of children agedthree and four were in poverty according to the 1990 census (Council for Economic Indicators, 1992).This data however, does not make adjustment for census poverty undercount, which could make thepercentage much higher.Hunger, therefore, is a problem of epidemic proportions across the United States. While no one knowsthe precise number of hungry Americans, available evidence indicates that up to 20,000,000 citizens maybe hungry at least some period of time each month (Physician's Task Force on Hunger in America, 1985).BackgroundHunger is a growing concern in our society. Each year, 13 to 18 million people die of hunger or hunger-related disease. Three-quarters of them are children under the age of five: Other statistics show that oneperson in five in developing countries is undernourished, whereas one in five in major industrializedcountries is overweight or obese (Sivar, 1986).Each year 15 million children under age five die, which represents one fourth of all the world's deaths.Up to half of the children who survive suffer malnutrition severe enough to leave them with non revers-ible damage (Understanding the Presbyterian Hunger Program). Many Americans today go to bed atnight with only one meal in their stomach. For children, this may be the school lunch, and for adults, itmay be the meal that they receive at the homeless shelter. Hunger is everywhere. We see people on thestreet corner who will work for food, or other people digging through trash cans for meal scraps.Hunger is a debilitating, devastating, intensely painful human experience that hinders an individual'sability to work productively, think clearly, and resist disease. It can destroy culture and family structure,drain the economy, create divisions and antagonisms among people, and destabilize governments (TheHunger Project, 1984). The Hunger Project defines several kinds of hunger:Chronic undernutrition is the consumption, over a long period of time, of fewer calories and less proteinthan are needed by the body. This is the most basic and widespread manifestation of hunger today, andthe least recognized. The effects are particularly severe in children and infants. They often die of dis-eases that would be thrown off quickly by a healthy, well-nourished body.Malnutrition is the lack of specific vitamins or minerals that are vital to health. An example is lack ofvitamin A, which can cause night blindness. Promoting Wellness Issues Throughout Society CONTENT QMODULE 43Malabsorptive hunger occurs when a person actually takes in enough food, but parasites take up much ofthe nutritional value of the food or cause it to be passed out of the system instead of being used by thebody. The parasite can only occur where water is contaminated and medical care is almost completelyabsent.Seasonal undernutrition occurs annually before each harvest, when food from the last harvest runs out.Until the new crop comes in, people may be hungry for weeks of even months at a time.Famine is a widespread lack of access to food caused when drought, flood, or war disrupts the availabil-ity of food in a society of chronically undernourished people. Famine usually occurs in countries that donot have the institutional capacity to compensate for bad weather or political disruption. During a faminethere may be food available in an area of the country affected, but the people who are hungry are isolatedor are too poor to afford it.Measuring hunger between societies helps identify where hunger persists in the world. The most ac-cepted standard to determine the extent of hunger is the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). The IMR is thenumber of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births in a given year. When a countryhas an IMR of 50 or less, it is meeting the basic needs of its people, including adequate nutrition. A lowIMR, however, does not necessarily mean that there are no hungry people in a given country.Another societal issue related to nutrition and wellness is the economic impact of wellness. The firstaspect of this issue is the actual cost to individuals and society of unhealthy practices. From the cost of adoctor's visit to prescription drugs, individuals pay a great deal of money for health care. Society absorbsthe health care costs for those who cannot afford the expense, with the actual costs passed on to taxpayers.The second aspect of wellness as a societal issue is the impact our food choices have on the globaleconomy. It is important to understand the impact of where food is purchased, the types of food pur-chased, and the environmental impact of the packaging and marketing of the food.Environmental issues related to nutrition and wellness are an ever-growing concern to our society. Theseissues involve practical problems that have many opposing viewpoints (Opposing Viewpoints Series,1994). For example, the foods are packaged and products recycled has a direct impact on individuals andsociety. Fast food restaurants were some of the first businesses to change packaging methods to meetconsumer and societal demands for environmentally friendly packaging. Styrofoam has now been largelyreplaced with paper wrappers. Consumers can still make their concerns on food packaging knownthrough direct contact with food manufacturers. The availability of recyclable and refillable containersindicate that companies are slowly beginning to listen to consumers.Many organizations and resources are now available to provide information and help citizens take actionon nutrition and wellness issues. Education, civic, cultural, business, religious, and communicationsorganizations now assist in educating people about global concerns. Local homeless shelters, foodpantries, government-assistance programs, nonprofit organizations, health departments, and businesseshave spent much time and effort assisting with the needs of the community and can be valuable resources. 283290 Promoting Wellness Issues Throughout Society (CONTENT Q)MODULENutrition and Wellness issues are complex and evoke a wide variety of often conflicting opinions andproposed solutions. If society expects to see improvement with regard to these issues, citizens must bewilling to take an active role. What can individuals do to help with nutrition and wellness issues? Thefollowing strategies can influence the outcome of these issues:Communicate facts on the issues to people in the communityWrite letters to the editor of the local newspaperCommunicate with legislators about the issuesParticipate in local projects with regard to these issuesVolunteer time to help provide a service or support an organizationMany health professionals are continuing to make an impact on wellness, hunger, and nutrition. Highschool students interested in professional involvement in these areas should be encouraged to enroll inpostsecondary programs that focus on nutrition. Careers in dietetics include registered dietitians (R.D.),licensed dietitians (L.D.), and dietetic technicians registered (D.T.R.). These individuals work to improvethe wellness of our society by assisting in congregate meals: community nutrition; federal, state, and localhealth programs; hospitality management: and hospital education. Careers in nutrition can really make adifference. ReferencesChildren's Defense Fund (1986). A children's defense budget.

Your day would begin atdawn, before many U.S. teenagers are awake.There would he chores to do before breakfast,such as feeding the animals, carrying waterfrom the well, and lighting the cooking fires.Page 1 of 2 LrK Because most families do not have appliances such as stoves and refrigerators, foods must he made fresh everyday. In some cultures, grain is ground on a stone and made into flat bread such as tortilas (Latin America) andchappattis (India). If rice is the staple food, it is often served as a type of watery rice soup for breakfast. Duringfood shortages, breakfast is often omitted or the family may subsist on scraps and leftovers from the previousday in order to save on fuel for the cooking fire as well as food.If the family makes its living by fanning, both boys and girls spend at least part of their day working in the fields.Often children drop out of school during busy seasons on the farm so that they can help their families. Many,particularly girls, never go beyond primary school because they must help support the family. By the time theyare teenagers, less than half arc still in school. The others spend 10 -12 hours per day working in the fields or doingother jobs for the family. The machines and tools used for farming are simplesmall hand tractors that look likelawn mowers, various types of hoes, and a machete or scythe. At harvest time, animals are often used to powera contraption used to thresh the grain; often the same system that has been used for centuries.The young girls combine agricultural work with caring for the younger children, doing laundry in a pond orstream, making clothes, and preparing food. Some are trained in crafts or occupations such as weaving so thatthey can make extra money. In many cultures, being a good weaver or seamstress is considered one of theprerequisites for marriage.At least once a week many young people take the family's product to a local market where they set up a smalltable or lay their goods out on the ground. In addition to selling, they may also purchase small items at the marketsuch as cloth, kitchen utensils, toilet articles, and spices. Going to market gives the young people a chance tosocialize with others their age as well as contributing to the family income.Because many third World countries arc in hot climates, activity conies to a halt around the middle of the dayand people gather in the shade to eat their lunch, perhaps listen to a transistor radio or taped music, and sharethe local gossip. A typical lunch might he a small portion of beans, a piece of bread, and a cull of tea.Chances are that the village you would live in would have no supply of clean drinking water. All the water usedfor household chores, cooking, and bathing would come from the same stream. well, or pond and must he carriedin pots or other containers, usually by the women and young girls. Many learn to carry the pots of water on theirheads. Especially if the weather were hot, you would miss being able to get a cooling glass of iced water. Warmsoda, a cup of tea, or a glass of boiled water would have to do. If anyone in the family developed a medicalproblem, a doctor or clinic would usually he a day's walk away. Common health problems include malnutrition,intestinal diseases such as dysentery. and infections caused by poor sanitation.

Because of this shorterlife span, teenagers assume adult roles and responsibilities sooner. Many will be married and starting theirfamilies before most American teenagers have graduated from high school. They will he grandparents in their30s and become the elders of the society when we consider ourselves middle-aged. This is changing as healthstandards improve, and in some countries, such as China, the government has discouraged marriage before themid-20s in order to cut down on population growth.As you walked into a house in the village, it might seem quite hare and dark compared to what you were usedto. Furnishings would probably include one table, some mats or cots for sleeping as well as sitting during theday, and perhaps a chair or two. Instead of colored paint or wallpaper, most walls would he whitewashed orunpainted. If the cooking fire were inside the house, the air would he smoky and the walls blackened. Windowswould he small and probably have bars across them instead of glass. The floor, packed dirt or cement, wouldneed to he swept every day. You would not have your own room, in most cases, you would sleep on a mat ina room with the other children. During the day the mats would be rolled up and the room would become acombination living room/dining room. You would wash in a basin in the courtyard or in a nearby stream, sincethere would probably he no indoor plumbing. The outhouse might he in the courtyard or near the fields. Becausethe inside of the house was dark and there was not much space, the family would spend most of the day outsidein the courtyard. For the women, the courtyard becomes the center of their social lifea place where they cangather to do chores and chat with family and neighbors.You would not need a big closet because you would probably have only 2 or 3 sets of clothing. Although someof your clothes would he homemade, others might come from the local market, including T-shirts, rubber orplastic sandals, and straw ha.;. If you were attending a high school, you would wear a uniform, usually a whiteshirt and dark pants or skirt.In the evening, the family would come together for a dinner of rice or other staple food flavored with a fewvegetables, spices, and occasionally fish. Meat would he reserved for special occasions only. Your day wr.--,;!,-end early because you probably would not have electric lights. The family might spend some quiet time in thecourtyard enjoying the cool air and reflecting on the events of the day. For most, it would he a day much likeany other, with less variety than you are used to. Life in villages such as this has a very regular pattern centeredon the main events of the farming year. For many young people this regular pattern provides securityfor othersit seems boring, and they long for the excitement of moving to the city.Twenty years ago, people in a remote third world village knew little about what happened in their country, tosay nothing of the world. Now, because many of the people from the village have moved to the city and bringhack stories of their life there, villagers are much less isolated. When men walked on the moon, when the priceof an important product such as coffee or cacao fell on the world market, when there was a change of governmentin the capital, the word traveled quickly. A tribal hunter in Indonesia can pause in his pursuit of game to marvelat the new satellite \"star\" crossing the sky. He may not know what it is, but it is now a part of his world. Manywho are still illiterate listen to radio and perhaps watch a community TV in the evenings. Even Sesame Streetis broadcast in China these days, and reruns of old U.S. TV series such Kojak find a ready market in Third Worldcountries. Cassette tapes have become popular with a mix of music from folk culture as well as Western popmusic. However, even though a teenager in a Third World country might wear a Coca-Cola T-shirt, listen toWestern music such as \"We are the World,\" and sec pictures of life in the U.S., he or she gets a very incompleteidca of what our life is like. To some, it is difficult to understand why we have such large lawns when that landcould be used to grow food, why American Teenagers seem to have so much free time, and in general what itwould he like to live in your shoes for a day. As our independence with Third World countries increases, theneed for each side to understand the perspective of the other will he very important in solving our mutualproblems. 2933f) 0 "}
