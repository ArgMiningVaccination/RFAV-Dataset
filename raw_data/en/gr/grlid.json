Our fast-paced and busy culture doesn't always leave time for refreshment. And though energy drinks and coffee have become the norm, there are plenty of herbs out there that can naturally boost your energy levels. Caffeine isn't necessarily bad for you, but drinking too much of it (think lots of coffee) will give you an energy spike that ends in a bad crash hours later. You also have to keep consuming it in order to keep feeling energized. Herbs are a good alternative to surviving on caffeine or synthetic energy products. They work naturally with your body and can have long-lasting effects. Here's more about how they work and a list of the top herbs you can use for energy. How Herbs Can Give You Energy Before getting into the list of herbs, let's take a closer look at the ways they can interact with your body to improve energy. Also, keep in mind that some will provide more of a mental boost, while others help with physical vitality. Many do both. Stimulants- You're most likely already familiar with stimulants because this is the category caffeine falls into. A stimulant has a specific and immediate action on your body, regardless of what state you're in. It provides a feeling of energy and can also increase heart rate, blood pressure, etc. Stimulants, including caffeine, can be helpful at certain times. The main problem is that they have short-term effects, don't restore or balance your body, and can have negative side effects. Tonics- In many ways, tonics are the opposite of stimulants. They don't give you a burst of energy but rather work to restore balance and health to your body so that your natural energy levels return. The downside is that you need to take to take tonic herbs for a while to notice a difference. However, they have long-lasting effects and will actually restore energy rather than just stimulating your body. Adaptogens- Most adaptogens are also tonic herbs (meaning they work over a period of time), but they differ in how each one works. Adaptogens have a non-specific action, meaning they work with the needs of your body at the present moment. They improve your resistance to stress, bring you back into balance, and naturally increase energy. Top Herbs for Energy Ginseng Ginseng is probably one of the most well-known herbs for energy. There are two main types that you can use: Korean or Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius). Both have adaptogenic properties and can lessen fatigue and stress. Most herbalists recommend ginseng as a tonic, although it can have a mildly stimulating effect as well. Many of its benefits are thought to come from compounds called ginsenosides. (1) American ginseng may particularly help with adrenal fatigue. Eleuthero Root Also known as Siberian ginseng, eleuthero root (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is another adaptogen that has long been used in Chinese medicine for energy and stamina. It can relieve both physical and mental fatigue, improve energy, and even boost athletic performance. (2)(3) Eleuthero is especially beneficial after long-term sickness or stress. If you're dealing with daily stress, try it in this Adrenal Love tea to keep your nervous system supported. Maca Maca is an adaptogenic tonic herb that has grown a lot in popularity lately. It's a root that grows high up in the Andes mountain range and has a history of use for boosting energy, stamina, and overall vitality. Maca root is a food, which means it can be consumed regularly, even in large amounts. You can easily find it in powdered form and mix it into smoothies, shakes, or oatmeal. It has a nutty taste on its own, and some suppliers combine it with cocoa powder for better flavor. Peppermint Peppermint is in a category all of its own.
