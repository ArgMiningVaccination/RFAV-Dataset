Gene Therapy [Phase I/IIa Gene Therapy Trial Principal Investigator: [Zarife Sahenk, MD, PhD](/find-a-doctor/profiles/zarife-sahenk) NIH, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Enrollment Status: Not Recruiting Time Commitment: 2 years Background: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) hereditary neuropathy is a group of disorders characterized by a chronic motor and sensory polyneuropathy, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN). These disorders are caused by gene mutations whose protein products are expressed in myelin and/or axons of peripheral nerves. Different mutations within the same gene, which express various clinical phenotypes is a common finding in this group of neuropathies. The most common initial presentation of CMT is distal weakness and atrophy. Hence patients present with foot drop and pes cavus. Sensory symptoms are often present but tend to be less prominent. Later in the course, foot deformities such as hammertoes, along with hand weakness and atrophy become challenges in treating CMT. Traditionally, CMT classification was based on peripheral neuropathy (determined by nerve conduction velocity) and mode of inheritance. For example, CMT1, CMT2, DI-CMT (Dominant Intermediate). But recent evolving genetics has pushed for new CMT naming system based on gene involvement, which already been proposed. CMT1A, most common form of CMT is associated with a 1.5 Mb duplication or, less commonly, a point mutation of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene on chromosome 17p11.2-p1; duplication causes overexpression of PMP22, on the other hand, point mutations alter distribution of the protein. Patients with point mutations have more prominent symptoms. Patients with CMT1A may have associated with sleep apnea. Diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiencies, and immune-mediated neuropathies may further exacerbate CMT condition. Currently there is no treatment for this condition. Ascorbic acid supplements have been highly touted to help, but multiple studies have shown no benefit [.](#_ENREF_5) A human trial of NT-3 provided by Regeneron showed clinical efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment accompanied by increased numbers of myelinated nerve fibers in post-treatment sural nerve biopsies.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with the most severe clinical symptoms among all. Histologic and laboratory evidence of a myopathy may be observed from birth, but clinical onset occurs between two and three years of age. Proximal muscle weakness before the distal, and the lower before the upper extremities are present almost every patient with DMD. The affected child therefore has difficulty running, jumping, and walking up steps. When arising from the floor, affected boys may also use hand support to push themselves to an upright position, an action termed Gower's sign. An unusual waddling gait, lumbar lordosis, and calf enlargement are usually observed. Leg pain and cramps are common complain among DMD patients. Other motor signs and symptoms that may be present include toe walking, decreased endurance, decreased head control when pulled to sit, flat feet, frequent falls, clumsiness, gross motor delay, inability to keep up with peers, and loss of motor skills. Other associated problems with DMD are elevated creatinine kinase (CK) and transaminases, growth delay, cardiomyopathy, orthopedic complications, and cognitive and behavioral disorders. Most patients become wheelchair bound by the age of twelve and die in their late teens or twenties from respiratory insufficiency or cardiomyopathy; only a few DMD patients survive beyond the third decade. Two most common form of genetic impairments in Duchenne are deletions/ duplication, and point mutation. Currently available mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for DMD is Glucocorticoids. Purpose: This study will try to find out if it is safe to deliver microdystrophin gene through the blood stream. Inclusion Criteria: - Age of enrollment: Cohort A (n=6) is between 3 months to 3 years of age, inclusive; Cohort B (n=6) is between 4 to7 years of age, inclusive. - Molecular characterization of the DMD gene with frameshift (deletion or duplication), or premature stop codon mutation between exons 18 to 58. - Indication of symptomatic muscular dystrophy - CK elevation >1000 U/L and - Cohort A: below average on the Bayley-III motor assessment for gross motor defined as a scaled score of 9.

Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. A non-working gene that results in the failure to make a properly functioning protein called dystrophin causes DMD. Dystrophin protects the integrity of muscles, however, there are other genes present in our genome that can also serve the same function in muscle and can substitute (or be a surrogate) for dystrophin. One of these genes, called GALGT2 is a promising surrogate to treat DMD because it has been shown to improve muscle function and strength in animal models with muscular dystrophy. Also it is a naturally occurring protein that DMD patients encounter in their body and because of this, there is lower risk of a patient developing an immune response to the new protein. Purpose: This study is designed to test the safety of delivering a dystrophin substitute (or \"surrogate\") gene called GALGT2 to functionally take the place of the non-working dystrophin gene. Doctors will use a method called \"gene transfer\" to express more GALGT2 than normal in the patient's leg muscles. The GALGT2 gene is transported into muscle using a vehicle. The vehicle is a harmless virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV). The Study Doctor is investigating the safety of this drug thought to help make GALGT2 which may be very helpful in protecting the muscle tissue in people with DMD. Inclusion Criteria: - Patients able to walk of age 4 years or older - Confirmed mutations in the DMD gene using a clinically accepted technique that completely defines the mutation - Measurably impaired muscle function (defined as less than 80% of the predicted value for age on 100 MWT), but with sufficient muscle preservation to ensure assessment of muscle transfection based on clinical evaluation by the PI and expert colleagues. This degree of preservation will include: - Ability to extend the knee fully against gravity - Preserved ambulation with ability to walk 350 meters during the 6MWT. - A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the quadriceps showing preservation of sufficient muscle mass to permit transfection. - Males of any ethnic or racial group will be eligible. - Ability to cooperate with muscle testing - Stable dose of corticosteroid therapy (including prednisone, prednisolone, or deflazacort and their generic forms) for at least 12 weeks prior to gene transfer. Exclusion Criteria: - Active viral infection based on clinical observations. - The presence of a DMD mutation without weakness or loss of function - Subject is amenable to or is currently being treated with eteplirsen. - Symptoms or signs of cardiomyopathy, including: - Dyspnea on exertion, pedal edema, shortness of breath upon lying flat, or rales at the base of the lungs - Echocardiogram with ejection fraction below 40% - Serological evidence of HIV infection, or Hepatitis B or C infection - Diagnosis of (or ongoing treatment for) an autoimmune disease - Persistent leukopenia or leukocytosis (WBC 3.5 K/\u00b5L or 20.0 K/\u00b5L) or an absolute neutrophil count < 1.5K/\u00b5L - Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer - AAVrh74 binding antibody titers 1:50 as determined by ELISA immunoassay - Presence of circulating anti-Sda antibodies as determined by study approved laboratory. - Abnormal laboratory values in the clinically significant range in the Table 1 below, based upon normal values in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Laboratory.

Background: LGMD2E is one of the variants of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMD). LGMD2E is caused by a non-working -sarcoglycan gene that results in the body not making a properly functioning protein that is also called beta-sarcoglycan. When -sarcoglycan protein is absent or changed, the muscle membrane can be damaged. Proteins are the building blocks of all tissues. They are produced by genes that are found in our body. If a gene is not working, it will not make the correct protein or enough of it. This can include proteins needed by muscles which can cause a disease like muscular dystrophy. LGMD2E typically presents with difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs within the first decade of life. Cardiac involvement is commonly seen in this disease. There is currently no established treatment for LGMD2E. Purpose: We will evaluate safety and sustainability of efficacy benefits throughout the study after the gene transfer. Inclusion Criteria: - Subjects ages 4 through age 15, inclusive - Males or females of any ethnic group - SGCB DNA gene mutations at both alleles - Weakness demonstrated based on history of difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs - 100m timed test: 40% of predicted for age, height, and weight matched healthy controls at the screening visit - Ability to cooperate with muscle testing - Willingness of sexually active subjects with reproductive capacity to practice reliable method of contraception (if appropriate), during the first six months after gene therapy Exclusion Criteria: - Active viral infection based on clinical observations - Cardiac MRI determined left ventricular ejection fraction <40% - Serological evidence of HIV infection, or Hepatitis B or C infection - Diagnosis of (or ongoing treatment for) an autoimmune disease - Abnormal laboratory values considered clinically significant (GGT > 3XULN, bilirubin 3.0 mg/dL, creatinine > 18 g/Dl; WBC > 15,000 per cmm), see Table 2 below - Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer - Pregnancy - Subjects with AAVrh74 binding antibody titers > 1:400 as determined by ELISA immunoassay.

Background: SMA is an autosomal recessive, neurogenetic disorder caused by a loss or mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) on chromosome 5q13, which leads to reduced SMN protein levels and a selective dysfunction of motor neurons. Therefore, degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord occurs. The same pathology is also noticed in the motor nuclei of the lower brainstem, which results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is the leading cause of infant mortality due to genetic diseases. Disease severity and clinical prognosis depends on the number of copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene (SMN2). In its most common and severe form (Type 1), hypotonia and progressive weakness are recognized in the first few months of life, leading to diagnosis before 6 months of age and early death due to respiratory failure before 2 years of age. motor neuron loss in SMA Type 2 and Type 3 patients is less profound and a greater population of neurons is able to survive. Until now, widely approved treatment for SMA has been mainly supportive and directed at providing nutrition and respiratory assistance as needed, and treating or preventing complications of weakness.

Therefore, degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord occurs. The same pathology is also noticed in the motor nuclei of the lower brainstem, which results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. SMA is the leading cause of infant mortality due to genetic diseases. Disease severity and clinical prognosis depends on the number of copies of survival motor neuron 2 gene (SMN2). In its most common and severe form (Type 1), hypotonia and progressive weakness are recognized in the first few months of life, leading to diagnosis before 6 months of age and early death due to respiratory failure before 2 years of age. motor neuron loss in SMA Type 2 and Type 3 patients is less profound and a greater population of neurons is able to survive. Until now, widely approved treatment for SMA has been mainly supportive and directed at providing nutrition and respiratory assistance as needed, and treating or preventing complications of weakness. Disease-modifying therapy with [Nusinersen](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nusinersen-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link) is approved in the United States and several other regions, which is mainly given to a selected age group (2 years to 12 years). Limited data is available on Nusinersen in treating older children, adult, and patients with advanced disease. Purpose: - To assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal (IT) administration of AVXS-101 by the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) - To determine the optimal dose of AVXS-101 that demonstrates acceptable safety with maximum preliminary efficacy administered by intrathecal injection Inclusion Criteria: - Patients > 6 months and up to 60 months (1800 days) of age at time of dosing following diagnostic confirmation during screening period by genotype who demonstrate the ability to sit unassisted for 10 or more seconds but cannot stand or walk Diagnostic confirmation by genotype includes lab documentation of homozygous absence of SMN1 exon 7; with exactly three copies of SMN2 - Negative gene testing for SMN2 gene modifier mutation (c.859G>C) - Onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) at < 12 months of age - Able to sit independently and not standing or walking independently.

Background: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is among the most common types of muscular dystrophy. Although the disease was named for the muscle groups most affected, there is no universal pattern of muscle involvement and patients can show wide variability in symptoms. FSHD is caused by aberrant expression of the double homeobox protein 4 (DUX4) gene which leads to unusual translation of the DUX4 protein. The DUX4 protein is toxic to muscle, cultured myocytes, and other non-muscle cells. DUX4 has historically been difficult to impossible to detect in patient samples, but we have developed a new method of detecting DUX4 expression in muscle biopsies. We hope to use this new method to correlate the expression of DUX4 in muscle with overall function and disease severity. Purpose: This study will help investigators to understand the relationship between DUX4 expression in muscle from FSHD patients, and to understand how the molecular changes that result from DUX4 expression relate to the clinical symptoms of FSHD. In order to do this, we need to study muscle strength and function, MRI changes in muscle, and changes of gene expression in biopsy tissue. This information may help us find new ways to treat FSHD. Inclusion Criteria: - 18 years or older - Genetically proven FSHD1 - Ability to participate in functional testing at the determination of the principal investigator. - Sufficient muscle mass for muscle biopsy, as determined by examination and by MRI of limb muscles. Exclusion Criteria: - History of bleeding disorder - Abnormalities of platelet levels, prothrombin time (PT)/INR, or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that in the opinion of the PI would render the subject unsuitable for biopsy. This may be determined on screening blood test; subjects with abnormal results will be excluded from the study and referred to the hematology clinic for clinical follow-up. - Inability to complete an MRI scan. - Other medical or cognitive issues that, in the opinion of the examiner, preclude accurate functional assessment.

The study is looking at the benefits and side effects of the three most widely prescribed corticosteroid treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): daily prednisone, daily deflazacort, and intermittent prednisone. Corticosteroids are currently the only medicine that is known to delay the loss of ambulation in boys with DMD over a limited period of time, although how well these treatments work can be different for each patient. Purpose: To determine what steroid treatment regimen is best tolerated and most beneficial for boys with DMD. Inclusion Criteria: Study participants must be: - Diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - male - 4-7 years old - Not have previously been treated with oral steroids - Ability to rise independently from floor, from supine to standing - Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan and study procedures - Ability to maintain reproducible FVC measurements. Exclusion Criteria: - History of major renal or hepatic impairment, immunosuppression or other contraindications to corticosteroid therapy. - History of chronic systemic fungal or viral infections. Acute bacterial infection (including TB) would exclude from enrolment until the infection had been appropriately treated and resolved. - Diabetes mellitus. - Idiopathic hypercalcuria. - Lack of chicken pox immunity and refusal to undergo immunization. - Evidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy at screening assessment (one to three months prior to the baseline visit). Asymptomatic cardiac abnormality on investigation would not be an exclusion. - Current or previous treatment (greater than four consecutive weeks of oral therapy) with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatments for DMD or other recurrent indications (e.g., asthma), unless approved by FOR-DMD Team (i.e., concurrent participation in another allowed DMD trial). - Inability to take tablets, as assessed by the site investigator by the end of the screening period (the screening period ranges from one to three months prior to the baseline visit). - Allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations including lactose and/or sucrose intolerance. - Severe behavioral problems, including severe autism. - Previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings or laboratory abnormalities that could affect safety, make it unlikely that treatment and follow up will be correctly completed or impair the assessment of study results, in the judgment of the site investigator. - Weight of less than 13 kilograms. - Exposure to any investigational drug currently or within 3 months prior to start of study treatment.

[Your Baby Could Help Doctors Diagnose Infants With Movement Problems Earlier] Principal Investigator: [Dr. Linda Lowes](/find-a-doctor/profiles/linda-lowes) What's the purpose of the study? Researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital want to see if watching how a baby moves can identify whether he/she is likely to grow up to have movement problems. This could help doctors find these babies and get them treatment at a very young age. Who can take part in the study? Infants from birth to 6 months of age. What will happen during the study? You will: - Be asked a few questions about your infant and his/her medical history - Lay your infant under a camera so we can take a 4-minute recording The study takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Researchers will also review your child's medical history over the first five years of their life. You may be contacted by phone, email or mail throughout this time if your child is no longer a patient at Nationwide Children's. For more information or to enroll your child, email [NMDtrialinfo@NationwideChildrens.org](mailto:NMDtrialinfo@NationwideChildrens.org) or call [(614) 722-6881](tel:614-722-6881). [A Randomized Recruiting Time Commitment: Up to 3 clinic visits and 5 local blood draws over 6 months Background: Steroids are the current treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). One of the steroids used for treatment is prednisolone. Prednisolone prolongs the ability to walk, improves muscle strength and delays heart damage, but it does not cure DMD. Prednisolone also has significant side effects including excessive weight gain, redness of the skin, excessive hair growth and decreased bone length and strength. This study will try to find out if it is safe to use a different medicine than prednisolone called spironolactone. This drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the use in treating patients with heart failure but not for the use that we will be looking at in this study. Spironolactone has been widely used in children with minimal side effects. In studies with mice that have a muscle disease, spironolactone reduces muscle damage and improves muscle function. This study will not cure DMD but may slow the breakdown of muscles. Purpose: The main goal of this study is to determine if spironolactone is safe to use in boys with DMD. This study is \"open label\", which means that the Study Doctor, their staff, and patients and parents may know if they are receiving prednisolone or spironolactone. This is because prednisolone and spironolactone do not look or taste the same. Inclusion Criteria: - Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients ages 4 through 7 years - Clinical features of DMD that include proximal predominant weakness and/or trouble walking - Presence of a truncating mutation of the DMD gene, or a muscle biopsy that demonstrates <5% dystrophin in the patient or an affected relative - Normal left ventricular ejection fraction by screening echocardiogram - Ability to cooperate for testing - No prior glucocorticoid treatment - No concomitant experimental therapies Exclusion Criteria: - Subject amenable to or currently being treated with eteplirsen - Hyperkalemia at screening - History of or ongoing renal failure (elevated creatinine, oliguria, anuria) - Hypersensitivity to spironolactone (rash, respiratory distress, arrhythmia, numbness or tingling of extremities) - Current treatment with an ACEi - Severe peptic ulcer Research [Development of Normative Data for the 100 and 60 Meter Test in Individuals with Muscle Disease and Controls] Principal Investigator: [Linda Lowes, PhD](/find-a-doctor/profiles/linda-lowes) Enrollment Status: Recruiting Time Commitment: 10 minutes Background: Timed walking tests are often used as primary outcome measures in clinical trials in individuals with neuromuscular disease. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is the most commonly used walking test but results of experimental treatments are difficult to interpret due to the large variability in 6MWT data. In addition, recent data suggest that treatments may be more beneficial when started at a young age. Collecting consistent results from a test that requires attention and best performance for 6-minutes is likely to cause problems in a younger cohort. Thus, the need for a reliable walking test that encourages consistent results across a broad age range is critical. The 100 meter walk/run test has been proposed as an outcome for neuromuscular disease, as it is a fixed distance and allows individuals to perform to the best of their ability. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to collect 100 meter data in a cohort of individuals with motor difficulties and age matched controls in order to develop normative data in these populations. Inclusion Criteria: - Ages 4 to 99 - Ability to follow directions and willingness to participate in study procedures Exclusion Criteria: - Lower limb injury or other medical condition that could affect performance of study procedures Contact Information: Neuromuscular Physical Therapy [NMDtrialinfo@nationwidechildrens.org](mailto:NMDtrialinfo@nationwidechildrens.org) 3 Enrollment Status: Recruiting Time Commitment: between 2 and 5 visits, depending on type of LGMD (the first is a two-day visit) Purpose: The goal of this natural history study measure how hard it is for individuals with LGMD to do a variety of tasks.

Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked neuromuscular disease that presents with muscle degeneration, impaired pulmonary status, and decreased cardiac function. Currently, there is no cure for this disease, however, experimental treatments are being tested in clinical trials. Purpose: The primary purposes of this study is to better understand the experiences of patients with DMD. The researchers will conduct interviews with parent and patient dyads and ask these same participants to answer several questionnaires that are normally used to assess functioning of patients with DMD. By comparing the information from the interviews with the answers to the questionnaires, the researchers hope to learn more about current measurements of function and how better to capture information about the changes and benefits that might result from future treatments. Inclusion Criteria: Parents - Primary caregiver of a patient with a genetically confirmed DMD diagnosis - Willing and able to participate in a single 60-minute dyadic interview held via videoconference - Willing and able to complete a series of short questionnaires about the patient's health - Can speak, read, write and understand English Patients - At least 4 years old with a genetically confirmed DMD diagnosis - Willing and able to participate in a single 60-minute dyadic interview held via videoconference Exclusion Criteria: - Any patient or parent currently participating in a clinical trial - Any patient currently receiving or who has previously received Exondys 51 or Vyondys 53.

However, when a child is significantly delayed, the traditional assessments document an extremely low score that will never change because the progression of these sick infants is small and slow. ACTIVE-mini (Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation) is a motor assessment tool that uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor and color tracking technology to record a child's movements. Latex free, colored wraps are placed on the hands and feet of the child while they lie on a mat and are motivated to move their extremities. ACTIVE-mini can be used in a research or clinical setting as a functional assessment that is able to determine small, meaningful changes in movement that would otherwise be undetected by traditional assessments. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the validity and reliability of the ACTIVE-mini assessment as a motor function tool in a cohort of infants with motor deficits and age-matched controls. Inclusion Criteria: - Ability to tolerate lying on back for a minimum of two minutes Exclusion Criteria: - Ability to roll Contact Information: Neuromuscular Physical Therapy [NMDtrialinfo@nationwidechildrens.org](mailto:NMDtrialinfo@nationwidechildrens.org) (614) 722-6881 [Utility Enrollment Status: Recruiting Time Commitment: 10 minutes Background: Experimental trials typically use timed walking tests as a functional outcome measure due to ease of administration and a body of literature investigating the reliability and validity of these outcomes. However, this means that children who cannot walk are not eligible for participation in these trials. In addition, outcome measures that address function in the upper extremity often fail to be sensitive enough to capture changes over time. This leaves a large unmet need for populations with neuromuscular disease because upper body movement is essential for most activities that impact an individual's quality of life. ACTIVE-Seated (Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation) is a video game that utilizes the Microsoft Kinect sensor to measure functional reaching volume while the patient is motivated to squish spiders or collect gems. ACTIVE measures the ability for an individual to perform activities of daily living that greatly improve quality of life, such as the ability to perform self-care tasks. Therefore, it can be utilized in a clinical or research setting as a sensitive outcome measure that can be used in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory populations. Purpose: The objective of this study is to investigate the validity and reliability of the ACTIVE-Seated system to evaluate the upper extremity and trunk mobility of children and adults with motor deficits and typically developing peers. Inclusion Criteria: - Ability to follow directions and understand the video game - Ability to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: - Unable to be positioned in sitting with less than 30 degrees recline - Inability to move at least one portion of the upper extremity ( arm, wrist, or fingers) - Health condition that would interfere with the subject's ability to participate Contact Information: Neuromuscular Physical Therapy Enrollment Status: Active, Recruiting Time Commitment: 1 visit per blood draw Background: We are interested in learning more about neuromuscular diseases. To do this, we are working to establish a bank of blood samples from patients with neuromuscular and neurological diseases. We will also collect samples from people without neuromuscular diseases for a healthy control comparison. This collection of samples will be used for a variety of research projects primarily in the laboratories of investigators here at NCH, but if applicable will be shared with other institutes. These studies could help researchers identify biomarkers, which are genes that change when a disease is present. Biomarkers can also be used to predict if a treatment will work or not. Another goal of this study is to continue to learn more about the body's immune response in the context of gene therapies. We hope these projects will give us more information about the pathways and progression of neuromuscular diseases. Purpose: The primary objective is to establish a bank of collected blood (serum, plasma, whole blood, and RNA) from patients with neuromuscular or neurological diseases, to be used to discover new biomarkers and/or validate them as well as continue to learn about the body's immune response to gene therapy. Inclusion Criteria: Study Participants must meet one or more of the following: - Patients diagnosed with a neuromuscular or neurological disease - Suspected to have a neuromuscular or neurological disease - Any healthy volunteer to serve as a control Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects cannot participate if taking medications that suppress the immune system - Subjects cannot participate if enrolled in a treatment clinical trial Contact Information: Roxane Alles, Clinical Research Program Parent Dystrophy Enrollment Status: Recruiting Time Commitment: Active follow-up over 2 years Background: It is not surprising that DMD/BMD carriers are at risk for muscular dystrophy manifestations. The risks fall into three clinical categories: cardiac, skeletal and cognitive. The molecular mechanism for carrier manifestations has always been assumed to be nonrandom X chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI cannot explain the majority of symptoms in DMD/BMD carriers. In addition, XCI does not fully explain the spectrum of clinical phenotype (asymptomatic, mild or severe disability), nor the predominance in mutation type. Most DMD/BMD carrier studies have focused on cardiac manifestations because they can be life threatening. In this study, newer technology will now help us better define the abnormalities in the heart and let us prioritize those that would be the most predictive of future clinical manifestations. Skeletal muscle involvement ranges from fully manifesting carriers with significant muscle weakness to those with asymptomatic involvement. Unfortunately, as with cardiac manifestations, XCI will not predict the degree of muscle weakness in DMD carriers. The exact incidence of cognitive impairment in carriers is not well defined. However, symptomatic DMD carriers who have cognitive impairment are known to have a predilection for mutations in the distal part of the DMD gene. Purpose: To understand and characterize cardiac, skeletal, and cognitive risks of DMD/BMD carriers. Inclusion Criteria: - Age >18 years - Cohort A requires a genetically confirmed mutation in the DMD gene with an affected child - Cohort B includes DMD/BMD mothers with NO somatic mutation in the DMD gene - Cohort C age-matched healthy controls with a normal CK level - Cohort D requires a genetically confirmed mutation in the DMD gene without having an affected child - Able to complete testing in English - Able to consent Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects with a contraindication to cardiac MRI - Subjects on steroid treatment - Presence of an inherited neurologic disease or comorbidity that may affect their ability to complete this study - Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with the protocol required testing or procedures or compromise the subject's wellbeing, safety, or clinical interpretability. - Pregnancy any time during the study; a female subject judged by the investigator to be of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy due to the possible risks. Pregnant subjects will be excluded from this study due to the potential risks the treadmill and MRI contrast studies may pose on the fetus.

Currently, there is no cure for this disease, however, experimental treatments are being tested in clinical trials. Timed walking tests are typically used as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials within the DMD population. In recent clinical trials, parents and subjects have reported positive effects of the treatment, including increased physical activity, that were not detected by the outcome measures. Therefore, there is a need to detect small, meaningful changes in daily function in order to serve as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials. Physical activity tracers are designed to assess physical activity levels during daily activities and many models are now commercially available. They have been validated as a measure of activity in children with motor deficits such as cerebral palsy and could potentially be used to measure activity levels of boys with DMD. Purpose: The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and utility of a commercially available physical activity tracker to determine physical activity levels in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and compare these results to performance on standard functional tests. In addition, this study would compare the activity of children with DMD to the activity levels of age-matched peers. Inclusion Criteria: - Ages 4-25 years - Confirmed diagnosis of DMD or other motor deficit - Ability to follow directions and willingness to participate in study procedures Exclusion Criteria: - Evidence of current or previous lower limb injury that could affect performance of study procedures - Medical condition or developmental history (i.e. concomitant illness, behavioral disorder, prematurity) that make it unsafe for the subject to participate or could impair study results.

To do this, DNA is isolated from a participant's blood and/or saliva. This DNA is then used to find out what gene is responsible for that patient's disease. A gene is a coded piece of information that is present in every cell in your body. It contains information that is required for some portion of your body to do its job. When a gene contains an error in its code, it is said to have a mutation. Mutations may be passed along from one generation to the next in the same family. This work will help us understand the cause of neuromuscular disorders and may lead to the development of treatments. Purpose: To collect blood/saliva that will be stored, preserved and used to better understand inherited neurologic disease, for teaching purposes, and for approved future research studies. In this study, we will examine your blood/saliva samples to determine the gene mutation responsible for the condition that runs in a participating family. This will allow us to better understand how the disease develops and might help us develop therapies.

Historically, the approach of treatment is aimed at limiting decline through management of clinical symptoms. This approach is quickly changing as recent therapeutic advancements are making their way through the clinical trial pipeline and achievement of gross motor milestones beyond what would be expected are reported. These reported successes are also changing the aims of physical therapy interventions to be geared toward motor milestone and gross motor development. Typically developing children build strength and motor skills by exploring their environment but children with SMA have motor deficits that limit their ability to explore their environment. By unweighting a portion of their body weight, children with SMA can begin to use muscles in their legs and trunk, which they would otherwise be unable to do. Daily in-home use of a body weight support harness system may assist these children in building strength and developing new skills. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a home-based functional exercise program using a body weight support harness system on motor milestone development in children with SMA.

LGMD2E is caused by a non-working -sarcoglycan gene that results in the body not making a properly functioning protein that is also called beta-sarcoglycan. When -sarcoglycan protein is absent or changed, the muscle membrane can be damaged. Proteins are the building blocks of all tissues. They are produced by genes that are found in your body. If a gene is not working, it will not make the correct protein or enough of it. This can include proteins needed by muscles which can cause a disease like muscular dystrophy. LGMD2E typically presents with difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs within the first decade of life. Cardiac involvement is commonly seen in this disease. There is currently no established treatment for LGMD2E. Purpose: This recruitment study will try to find out how the disease changes over time and the effects of the disease. The association between functional impairment and long-term outcomes, such as loss of mobility, falls, and quality of life, will be examined. Consecutive measurements will be obtained. These measurements can show whether or not a patient will be eligible for the LGMD2E gene therapy trial. Inclusion Criteria: - Age 3-15 inclusive - Males or females of any ethnic group - SGCB DNA gene mutations at both alleles or suspected to have LGMD2E based on family and medical history. If suspected, genetic testing will be performed to confirm diagnosis. - Weakness demonstrated based on history of difficulty running, jumping and climbing stairs - Ability to complete 100MW timed test within 30-90% predicted - Perform assessments to the best of their ability with reliable results as deemed by the evaluator. - Ability to attend scheduled appointments - Ability to provide informed consent (or assent for ages 9-15) Exclusion Criteria: - Confirmed diagnosis of neuromuscular disorder other than LGMD2E - Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with the protocol required testing or procedures or compromise the subject's wellbeing, safety, or clinical interpretability - Subjects with AAVrh74 binding antibody titers > 1:400 as determined by ELISA immunoassay. If endpoint titer is positive at screening, testing may be repeated in 1 month. Antibody testing will be performed on a separate study - Diagnosis of (or ongoing treatment for) an autoimmune disease Contact Information: Stephanie Diemer, MS Clinical Research Coordinator II [Stephanie.Diemer@nationwidechildrens.org](mailto:Stephanie.Diemer@nationwidechildrens.org) (614) 355-2679 [Evaluation of Muscle and Skin for the of Neurologic Diseases] Principal Investigator: [Kevin Flanigan, MD](/find-a-doctor/profiles/kevin-m-flanigan) Time Commitment: 1 visit for biopsy procedure or no visits for participants allowing an archived sample to be shared with NCH or allowing for a muscle sample to be taken during a clinical procedure. Background: A neurologic or neuromuscular disorder is caused by an abnormality in a gene in your body that produces either a faulty protein or no protein at all. Frequently, a small piece of tissue is needed from a patient to fully characterize a diagnosis. The procedure to obtain this tissue is called a biopsy. Two tissues\u2014muscle and skin\u2014are routinely and safely biopsied for these purposes. In addition, muscle and skin biopsies provide a good way for researchers to learn more about these disorders. To do this, DNA, RNA (the building blocks of genes) and proteins from the muscle and skin samples are extracted for study. Also, the skin and muscle specimens can be used to establish cell cultures that can be used over long periods of time for studies. Muscle and skin specimens can also be examined under a microscope to better understand differences between normal tissue and tissue from an individual affected with muscle disease. Purpose: Collect muscle and/or skin to store, preserve and use to better understand neurologic diseases, for teaching purposes, and for approved future research studies. Inclusion Criteria: Study Participants must meet one or more of the following: - Patients diagnosed with a neuromuscular or neurological disease - Suspected to have a neuromuscular or neurological disease - Any healthy adult volunteer can serve as a control Exclusion Criteria: - Subjects cannot participate if their blood does not clot normally.

These neuromuscular disorders can be rare, and therefore difficult to establish a natural progression of each disease. The natural history of each neuromuscular disorder provides valuable information that can guide in understanding which outcome measure to use in order to show change for clinical trials. Therefore, the need to detect small, meaningful changes in daily activities in order to show efficacy in clinical trials is of great importance. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to better understand how neuromuscular diseases change over time and how they affect the ability for an individual to perform daily tasks. Participants will be asked to complete several functional tests that look at walking ability, strength, and movement. The results from this study will help to define the natural history of disease and help to identify potential candidates for future trials. This is an observational study, no drug (marketed or investigational) will be provided for treatment. Inclusion Criteria: - Ages 0-99 years - Suspected neuromuscular disorder by symptoms and/or having a family member diagnosed with a neuromuscular disorder, or have genetic confirmation of a neuromuscular disorder - Perform assessments to the best of their ability with reliable results as deemed by the evaluator - Ability to attend scheduled appointments Exclusion Criteria: - Confirmed diagnosis of another disorder other than a neuromuscular disorder - Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that might compromise the subject's ability to comply with the required testing, procedures, or compromise the subject's well being or safety.

SMA is an early childhood disease and is the leading cause of infant mortality due to genetic disease. Until now, treatment of these patients has focused on supportive care and treatments that improved disease symptoms were unavailable. However, recent advances in treatments including gene replacement and ways to protect nerve and muscle function may lead to significant change in the care of these patients and their disease symptoms. Purpose: The purpose of this registry is to follow SMA patients over 15 years to study if the treatments that are now available are changing how SMA affects children with this disease. Specifically, doctors want to measure if the treatments available are safe over long periods of time and if they help patients live longer. Inclusion Criteria: - Patients with a genetic confirmation of SMA Exclusion Criteria: - There are no exclusion criteria for this registry Contact Information: Jessica Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) are caused by changes in the dystrophin gene. Changes in the gene, called mutations, can cause the dystrophin protein to be only partially made or completely missing in patients with DMD and BMD. This leads to muscle weakness. Different dystrophin mutations can cause patients with DMD and BMD to have different levels of muscle weakness when comparing one patient to the next. In addition to dystrophin mutations, mutations in other genes can contribute to the severity and progression of the disease. We have not identified all of the genes that could contribute to or modify the symptoms in each DMD or BMD patient. It is not fully understood how these mutations in dystrophin and other genes affect the severity and progression of the disease. Purpose: This study's goal is to identify modifying genes and understand how different mutations in the dystrophin gene and in other genes determine the symptoms and degree of muscle weakness. This in turn can improve our ability to predict a patient's disease progression over time and tailor each patient's treatment accordingly. To do this, we are establishing a database of patients with dystrophinopathies (including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, as well as female carriers of DMD mutations). This database will include information about the dystrophin gene mutation of the patient, disease symptoms and how these symptoms change over time. This information will be gathered through a questionnaire that will be updated during normal doctor's visits. Additionally, participants can choose to share a blood sample that was previously taken or give a new saliva sample that we can use to extract the DNA from in order to study their genes. We will use this DNA sample to test for variations in genes that might influence the severity of their muscular dystrophy. Inclusion Criteria: Study Participants must meet one or more of the following: - Diagnosed with a dystrophinopathy - Suspected to have a dystrophinopathy - A female carrier of a dystrophin mutation Exclusion Criteria: There are no exclusion criteria.
