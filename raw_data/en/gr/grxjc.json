Not a place for discussion of illicit and illegal compounds. Heya folks! I was just wondering if anyone else has any experience or anecdote's for dosing high amounts of MSM? It isn't a toxic substance and seems to be tolerated well up to 20g for most people. I've been on about 30g a day - 4g an hour, for the past week and the energy and wellbeing is insane! I'm just wondering how long I can keep this up... I'm even wondering about increasing the amount, as I don't have any side effects (I had headaches occasionally for the first week or 2 at lower doses, which is apparently detoxification symptoms, but I do not experience these anymore. Has anyone tried these kinds of doses long term? EDIT: So I've stopped mega dosing after 1-2 months. The noticeable and somewhat euphoric effects subsided, and testing between 12g-30g... I didn't really notice any more benefit after 12g for whatever reason. I don't see any reason why I should take any more at this point. I will say that since I started mega dosing this stuff, I do generally feel much better! certainly has had a positive all rounder effect on my body and mind :) EDIT: Someone asked me for a good overview article on MSM and I think this one is good: [https://www.americancancercenternigeria.com/shop/item.aspx?itemid=2](https://www.americancancercenternigeria.com/shop/item.aspx?itemid=2)^Yes this does link to a product (which seems incredibly overpriced to me!) but it does have a great description of MSM... handy if one doesn't have the time to sift through the studies.
