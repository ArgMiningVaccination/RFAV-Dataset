EVALUATION OF SPECIFIC IGE TESTING TO CHLORHEXIDINE IN CASES OF PERIOPERATIVEANAPHYLAXIS Janet Anderson1, Richard B Fulton1, Rose2, Sarah Green2, Suran L Fernando1 1 PaLMS Immunorheumatology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia 2 Department of Anaesthesia, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia E-mail: JManders@nsccahs.health.nsw.gov.au Background: A number of different agents have been implicated as causes of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia. Chlorhexidine is awidely used antiseptic found in creams, wound dressings,lubricant gels and surgical skin preparation solutions. As such it isa significant possible causal agent in cases of perioperativeanaphylaxis. Aim: To assess the usefulness of measuring specific IgE to chlorhexidine as part of a testing regimen in cases of anaestheticrelated anaphylaxis. Method: Thirty-three patients referred to the Anaesthesia Allergy and Adverse Events clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital wereincluded in this study on the basis of clinical suspicion of allergy tochlorhexidine. Standardized skin tests were performed with allsuspected agents to which patients had been exposed, includingchlorhexidine. Testing for specific IgE to chlorhexidine in patientserum was performed via the Phadia ImmunoCAP system. Results: Using the recommended cut-off value of 0.35 kUA/L, specific IgE to chlorhexidine showed a sensitivity of 86% and aspecificity of 96% with reference to skin test results. Positive andnegative predictive values were also 86% and 96%. Analternative positive cut-off value of 0.21 kUA/L was determinedby ROC analysis resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and aspecificity of 96%. Positive and negative predictive values were88% and 100%. Conclusion: Evaluation of specific IgE testing to chlorhexidine shows this to be a reliable adjunct to skin testing in determiningdiagnosis of allergy to chlorhexidine. Additionally, adjustment ofthe cut-off threshold for determination of positive results was ableto increase test sensitivity without adversely affecting specificity inthis patient group. Studies to date have all involved relatively smallsample sizes. Further studies involving larger sample sizes wouldbe helpful in elucidating accurate cut-off levels for determination ofpositive samples.POSTER 2. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ONSET AND PERSISTENCE OF ECZEMA AND THE RISK OFOTHER ALLERGIC DISEASES Bianca Angelica1, Shyamali Dharmage1, Adrian Lowe1&3 1 The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia 2 Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia 3 Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia 4John Hunter Children's Hospital, Newcastle, Australia 5 Department of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia E-mail: b.angelica@student.unimelb.edu.au Background: Few eczema studies have simultaneously addressed the importance of both age of onset and duration of eczemasymptoms in early life for the subsequent persistence of eczemaand development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Objective: To examine the importance of age of eczema onset combined with eczema duration as predictors for later childhoodeczema, childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis. Methods: A prospective birth cohort of 620 infants with a family history of allergic diseases was recruited. Telephone interviewswere conducted 18 times in the first two years of life, and thenannually from age 3 to 7 years to document any episodes ofeczema. Current asthma and allergic rhinitis were assessed atage 6 and 7. Logistic regression models were fitted to adjust forpotential confounders. Results: Early-onset eczema, especially <6 months, was associated with greater risk of persistence at ages 6 and 7(adjusted OR=11.06; 95%CI=5.91-20.69). Early-onset eczemawhich commenced <6 months and was persistent (still presentbetween age 2 and 7), was also related to current asthma (aOR=3.85; 95%CI=1.90-7.79) and allergic rhinitis (aOR=2.22;95%CI=1.09-4.53) at ages 6 and 7. There was no evidence thatearly-onset remitting eczema (only present < 2 years) or late-onseteczema (onset >2 years) were associated with current allergicdiseases at ages 6 and 7. Conclusion: Eczema which commences early in life and persists into toddler years is strongly associated with current asthma andallergic rhinitis at ages 6 and 7. However, remitting and late-onseteczema do not appear to be related to these outcomes. Witheffective early intervention, the risk of allergic diseases associatedwith early-onset eczema might be reduced. ASCIA201 1 26POSTER 3. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE PULMONARY HAEMORRHAGE IN A PATIENT WITH ANCAPOSITIVE VASCULITIS Sara Barnes1, Matthew Naughton1, Jo Douglass1, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Email: barnes.sara@hotmail.com A 50 year lady with a long history of asthma presented with a two week history of worsening dyspnoea and cough with small volumehaemoptysis on a background of chronic sinus congestion and jointpains. Her initial chest x-ray (CXR) and CT (computed tomography)scan showed right upper lobe consolidation with a repeat CTshowing progression. Following admission to a rural hospital forintravenous antibiotics, she rapidly deteriorated necessitatingintubation and retrieval to a tertiary hospital with venous-venousextra corpulmonary oxygenation (vv-ECMO). On arrival to a tertiaryhospital on a public holiday, she was haemodynamically unstablerequiring inotropic support and six unit blood transfusion.Bronchoscopy revealed haemoptysis. Urinary red cell morphologyrevealed glomerular red cells despite normal serum creatinine (65umol/L) and urine output. Her renal function subsequentlydeteriorated and she was supported on continuous veno-venohaemodiofiltration via an ECMO circuit for a 36 hour period. Atentative diagnosis of vasculitis was made. Plasmapheresis wascommenced with initiation of methyl prednisolone andcyclophosphamide. Due to the public holiday there were difficultiesin obtaining immunological pathology results and co ordination ofplasmapheresis and nerve conduction services. In summary the use of v-v ECMO in acute respiratory failure with profound pulmonary haemorrhage requiring intensive multifacetedimmunosuppression is rarely described particularly combined withplasmapheresis. V-v ECMO should be considered in patients withlife threatening pulmonary haemorrhage due to vasculitis andplasmapheresis can be run concurrently whilst systemicimmunosuppressants take effect. Finally access barriers topathology services and technician dependant services are anissue for tertiary hospitals on public holidays and after hours. POSTER 4. LOWER LIMB WEAKNESS AND ATAXIA IN A 59 YEAR OLD WOMAN POST PERTUSSISVACCINATION WITH SEROLOGICAL FEATURESOF SLE Craig Barnett , Anthony Smith. Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia Email: barnetthealth@gmail.com Background: Neurological symptoms inpatients with anAutoimmune disease present a diagnostic challenge. This is particularly so when the choice of immunomodulatory treatmentsmay be modified in light of specific autoantibody tests. Case report: A 59 year old previously well health worker presented with lower limb weakness and ataxia 5 weeks after abooster immunisation with DTP vaccine. Further questioningrevealed a longstanding photosensitive rash and a clinical historysuggestive of Raynauds phenomenon. Eye examination wasnormal. Autoantibody screening revealed ANAand DsDNA, and antibodies to aquaporin-4 (NMOIgG) werealso MRI displayed changes consistent with alongitudinally extensive transverse myelitis extending from C2 toT10. The patients presentation raised an interesting differentialdiagnosis. She was treated with immunosuppressive therapycomprising prednisolone, azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine,with considerable clinical improvement. Conclusion: This case highlights the complex nature of autoimmune diseases that fall under the neuro-immunologyclassification. The presence of specific antibodies can influencetreatment of such disabling illnesses. The specificity of theaquaporin-4 antibodies, and their particular usefulness in this casesupports the need for such assays to be performed in specializedcentres. POSTER 5. CLINICAL LESSONS FROM AN ANAPHYLAXIS MANAGEMENT GUIDELINE AUDIT Melanie Batchelor1 1Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia Email: Melanie.batchelor@health.sa.gov.au Background: Anaphylaxis Management Guidelines for Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) were endorsed in 2009 to improve acuteclinical assessment, treatment and discharge management forpatients presenting with Anaphylaxis. Allergy Specialists regularlypromote the practical application of these guidelines to ED staff. Aim: The purpose of the audit was to evaluate guideline adherence in clinical practice. Method: The case notes of 30 adult patients who presented to ED with Grade2 or 3 anaphylaxis (Simon Brown criteria) in 2010were audited retrospectively. Documentation of: adrenalineadministration, monitoring in ED, adrenaline autoinjectorprescription, ASCIA Anaphylaxis Action Plan completion,complementary education and Allergy Clinic referral, was audited. Results: 22 of 30 patients received adrenaline as treatment for Anaphylaxis (14 in ED, 3 by self, 7 in other settings). Those 6patients not given adrenaline had an unidentified trigger or a timedelay before medical assessment. 3 patients were treated by theincorrect route.27Abstracts 2/30 patients met the guideline's monitoring criteria. 20 patients were observed for 4-6 hours after adrenaline injection, with noevidence of this observation occurring following symptomresolution. 21 patients were discharged with an adrenaline autoinjector. Documentation of Anaphylaxis Action Plan provision, autoinjectortraining or allergen avoidance education was not recorded forhalf of these patients. 5 patients received all components of thispractice guideline. 18 patients were referred to Specialist Allergy services.Conclusion: Evidence of compliance with the Anaphylaxis Management Guidelines for FMC is lacking. This audit could notidentify cases where appropriate care was given but notdocumented. The core components of the guidelines (timelyadrenaline administration, appropriate observation, patienteducation and specialist referral) are essential for patient safety.Guidelines need clarification to clearly state these expectations.Closer liaison with ED staff and innovative tools to promoteadherence to the guidelines are suggested. POSTER 6. WHEAT- DEPENDENT EXERCISE- INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS: CLINICAL AND LABORATORYFINDINGS Andrew Broadfoot1 , Sheryl van Nunen1,2 1Department of Allergy, Royal North anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a unique form of allergy in which ingestion of a certainfood, followed by exercise several hours later, can precipitateanaphylaxis. Wheat is the most widely reported food associatedwith this condition. Wheat- dependent exercise-inducedanaphylaxis (WDEIA) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) gluteninsubunits. We reviewed patients with this syndrome and correlatedtheir clinical and laboratory findings. Methods: Patients with WDEIA were identified for review and the clinical details,results of their skin prick tests and serology specificIgE were correlated. Specific IgE was measured by Immunocap(Phadia\u00ae). Results: Seven patients, all with specific IgE to omega-5 gliadin were identified. Four of these individuals were male. The averageage was 43 years (20-66). Four patients had suffered exercise-induced anaphylaxis (Mueller grade 4), the remainder hadsuffered urticaria after exercise, usually generalised. Length of timeto diagnosis ranged between 3 months to 9 years. All but one ofthe patients had suffered urticaria following wheat ingestion, priorto suffering an anaphylaxis. There was no correlation between the severity of the reaction and the levels of omega-5 gliadin specificIgE. Three of our seven patients were negative for wheat (asmeasured by Immunocap) and positive to omega 5 gliadin alone(one patient tested neative to wheat-specific igE in two differentlaboratories). 6/7 patients had positive wheat skin prick tests. Conclusions: If WDEIA is suspected, then serology specific IgE to omega-5 gliadin should be performed on all patients, and not justfor wheat alone as (43% (3/7) of our patients were negative forwheat and as generalized urticaria may occur prior to moresevere allergic reactions to wheat, a positive omega-5 gliadinalone, in patients presenting with generalised urticaria afterwheat, may prevent morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis. POSTER 7. IgG BUT NOT IgM OR IgA ANTI-BETA 2 GLYCOPROTEIN I ANTIBODY LEVELS AREASSOCIATED WITH HIGHEST RISK THROMBOTICEVENTS AMONG PATIENTS AT A TERTIARYHOSPITAL Dr Anna Brusch1, Dr Chris Bundell2, Dr Peter Hollingsworth2 1 Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia 2 Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia Email: anna.brusch@health.wa.gov.au The purpose of this study was to assess the significance of anti- beta 2 glycoprotein I (anti-B2GPI) isotypes among hospitalpatients by phenotyping patients with positive anti-B2GPI profiles. Methods: A search of the WA tertiary hospital database for anti- B2GPI tests was performed. This identified 4647 patients whohad undergone testing between August 2004 and August 2007for whom a hospital number could be identified. 682 of thesepatients had International Classification of Diseases (ICD) datalinked to our hospital site. Among this group, 46 patients had atleast one positive anti-B2GPI isotype >99th percentile for ourlaboratory's reference control population. This cut-off was used asper the revised Sapporo guidelines relating to the laboratorycriteria for the diagnosis of antiphopholipid syndrome (APS).Clinical records were reviewed and events categorized.Thrombotic events were further subdivided into provoked orunprovoked depending on the stated aetiology as a way ofstratifying patients' risk of an underlying thrombophilic tendencysuch as APS. Results: Of the 46 patients, 30 had a positive IgG anti-B2GPI result, 15 were positive for IgM and 23 for IgA. Unprovokedthrombotic events occurred with significantly higher frequencyamong patients with an anti-B2GPI profile containing IgGcompared with IgM (20/30 vs 4/15, p=0.025). A positive IgAresult was not seen in isolation in any patient with an unprovokedthrombosis. Of the 12 patients with a positive IgA result andASCIA201 1 28unprovoked thromboses, 11 also had a positive IgG result. The median IgG anti-B2GPI antibody level (but not IgM or IgA) wassignificantly higher for patients with unprovoked compared withprovoked thromboses (100 SGU vs 8 show that IgG anti-B2GPI associates more strongly with unprovoked thromboses and is ofgreater value than IgM or IgA isotypes in the assessment ofthrombotic events among hospital patients. POSTER 8. SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY ADULT ONSET STILL'S DISEASE WITH ANAKINRA Dr Anna Brusch1, Dr Peter Hollingsworth2, Dr Andrew Mclean- Tooke2 1Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia 2Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia Email: anna.brusch@health.wa.gov.au Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder of uncertain aetiology and pathogenesis. Approximately one third ofcases develop chronic, persistent disease which often requires long-term treatment with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. Wereport the case of a man AOSD treated successfullywith the IL-1 receptor antagonist, Anakinra. The patient was diagnosed with AOSD in his early thirties after presenting with an acute febrile illness associated withpharyngitis, myalgias and skin rash. His disease followed arelapsing and remitting course over the next 20 years andrequired multiple courses of prednisolone and treatment with otherimmunosuppressants including methotrexate and leflunomide. Helater developed continuous symptoms treated with increasingdoses of prednisolone. His symptoms were associated with feversand elevatations in C-reactive protein and neutrophil count.Anakinra was initiated at a dose of 100mg per day bysubcutaneous injection. This led to immediate resolution of hissymptoms and normalization of his inflammatory markers andneutrophilia. His symptoms recurred transiently when the supply ofAnakinra became temporarily unavailable and was mirrored by arise in inflammatory markers. Otherwise he has remainedsymptom free for over six months. The patient experienced mildinjection site reactions at the initiation of Anakinra therapy whichresolved after the first few weeks of treatment. To date, no otherside-effects have been encountered. This case demonstrates that Anakinra is a well-tolerated, rapidly effective treatment for refractory AOSD and that IL-1 may beimplicated in the pathogenesis symptomatology of this rare,inflammatory condition.POSTER 9. ANTI TISSUE TRANSGLUTAMINASE IGA TESTING - A COMPARISON OF FOUR AVAILABLEASSAYS Christine Bundell1,2, Monica PathWest Laboratory Medicine, QEII Medical Centre, Western Australia 2 School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia 3Immunology Department, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Western Australia Email: chris.bundell@health.wa.gov.au Background: IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (Ttg IgA) has become a first line test for coeliac disease (CD). In our laboratory,Ttg IgA requests have increased by more than 20%/year for thelast 2 years. Aim: To evaluate the Phadia 250 Celikey IgA automated FEIA as an alternative to Ttg IgA ELISA. Method: Seventy samples were selected to represent high, medium and low values, established by Aesku or Genesis ELISAassays. Ten samples were selected because of a normal biopsyand a high Ttg IgA result by Aesku; and 10 because of anabnormal biopsy and a high Ttg IgA Aesku. These samples weretested on each of the Aesku and Genesis ELISA methods, thePhadia FEIA and the indirect immunofluorescence endomysialantibody assay Aesku ELISA was the least correlated (Pearson's) with the others, and the highest correlation was between Phadia and EMA . Of the 10 samples with a normal biopsy and positive Ttg IgA Aesku, none was positive by any of the other assays. Of the 10samples with an abnormal biopsy and positive Ttg IgA Aesku, 9were positive or equivocal by each of the other methods. Discussion: The high correlation between Phadia FEIA and the EMA results and between Phadia and the biopsy result support achange from a manual ELISA method to the automated PhadiaFEIA method which allows random access and high samplethroughput. 29Abstracts POSTER 10. F-ACTIN ANTIBODY TESTING - WHICH METHOD TO IMPLEMENT? Nada Townsi2, Jen Pugh2, Amber Louw2, Christine Bundell1,2 and Peter Hollingsworth1,2 1 Clinical Immunology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Western Australia 2School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia Email: chris.bundell@health.wa.gov.au Aim: To evaluate the utility of various detection methods for antibodies against F-Actin. Background: Anti smooth muscle antibodies are detected in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (>80%) however they are alsodetected in individuals with other liver diseases and in the normalpopulation (~12%). Anti smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) directedagainst the filamentous actin (F-actin) are considered specific forAIH type 1. Various methods are available for diagnostic testingof F actin antibodies including: indirect immunofluorescence usingrodent stomach and kidney tissue (LKS), F actin expressingvascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) and rat intestinal epithelialcells (RIE), and solid phase ELISA and immunoblot. Method: Anti F actin antibody testing was performed on a total of eighty three serum samples comprising 42 consecutive samplestesting positive for SMA (early 2010), 10 samples testingnegative for SMA, 11 samples from known autoimmune hepatitispatients and 20 samples from the Australian Red Cross BloodService and serums made available by the Royal College ofPathologists of Australia (used as normal controls). Samples weretested on each of the methods outlined above. Results: The table compares F-actin testing for AIH disease patients compared to all other groups using measures ofdiagnostic test validity and predictive value. Conclusion: IIF on rodent LKS tissue sections remains the first-level test for anti F-actin SMA detection as it is sensitive and the mostspecific available method. If a second test is required due toconfounding factors, IIF on a VSM or RIE cell substrate provide aconvenient and practical alternative approach. Method Detection Ig Mark PathWest Laboratory Medicine, QEII Medical Centre, Nedlands, WA 3School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA Email: chris.bundell@health.wa.gov.au Background: Collection delay and method, and condition of the cadaver will affect the state of blood collected post mortem (PM).Phadia recommends PM samples should be collected within 48hrsof death. Published data suggests strong haemolysis may affectMCT levels. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of haemolysis on mast-cell tryptase (MCT) levels in samples from PMcases collected under the local condition. Method: Post-mortem blood samples were collected with the approval of the Coronial Ethics committee from 187 cases receivedat the Western Australian State Mortuary. The delay between deathand subclavian collection time was 1.0 \u00b1 1.8 days (mean \u00b1StDev). Blood was collected from the subclavian artery on arrival atthe mortuary and from the aorta (mg/L) using a Phadia250. The haemolysis index (HI) was measured on an Architect(Abbott) and grouped into intervals (Group 0, 0-<0.3 AU; Group1, Group4 AU). Data was analysed using IBM SPSS 19. Results: Scatter plots below show HI and MCT levels in samples from each collection site. Comparison of MCT levels in HI groupsdoes not show an association between HI group and MCT whenHI is <2 AU. This represents 77%, 82% and 54% of subclavian,femoral and aortic samples respectively. However, there is acorrelation between MCT and HI in samples with an HI 2 AU. In vitro interference testing using a fixed concentration of MCTmixed with artificially variably haemolysed serum did not interferewith Discussion: MCT appears to be independent of haemolysis if the HI is <2. However, MCT results in grossly haemolysed samplesmay need to be interpreted with caution. ASCIA201 1 30POSTER 12. POST-MORTEM MAST CELL TRYPTASE IN 1 Clinical Immunology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA 2 School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Western Australia, WA Email: chris.bundell@health.wa.gov.au Aim: To investigate the influence of cause of death on post mortem (PM) mast cell tryptase (MCT) levels. Background: MCT is released following mast cell (MC) activation. MCT measurement in serum is used to infer MCactivation in cases of suspect anaphylaxis. MCT measurement hasalso been used to investigate the possibility of death due toanaphylaxis. However, MCT levels in PM samples may beaffected by the cause of death (COD). Method: Blood samples were collected from the subclavian artery (on admission to mortuary) and from each of the aortic arch andfemoral artery (at necropsy) in 89 and 98 consecutive permissiblecoronial PM cases in September 2009 and January 2010respectively. COD category was determined by a forensicpathologist after necropsy. Anaphylaxis was not recorded as aCOD in any of the cases received. Serum MCT levels weremeasured using the Phadia Immunocap 250. In samples with anMCT >200ug/L the value of 200 has been assigned. Results: Figure 1 is a scatterplot showing MCT levels (including the mean) in the subclavian sample for each COD with a samplessize of >2. The highest mean level of MCT (\u00b5g/L) is seen in theHospital Death category (Subclavian = 32, Aortic = 54 andFemoral = 38) . The MCT levels are higher in the aortic sample inall categories, however, the difference in mean MCT levelsbetween groups at each site does not reach statistical significanceat p< 0.05. Discussion: The range of MCT results across the COD groups suggest that while the MCT assay is sensitive it will have arelatively poor specificity for anaphylaxis in post mortem samples. POSTER 13. ANAPHYLAXIS TO CITRUS FRUIT AND APPLE SEED Paul J. Turner1 ,Paul E.A. Department of Allergy and Immunology, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia 2 Department of Immunology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia Email: diannec3@chw.edu.au Summary: Childhood fruit allergy is relatively common; however, there are very few reports of children reacting to fruit seeds in theabsence of clinical reactivity to fruit pulp and no previous reportsof apple seed allergy. Methods: We present a case series of four children and evidence of serum specific IgE to apple seed in the child with anaphylaxisto apple seed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis and immunoblot. Results: Three children presented with anaphylaxis (one at in- hospital challenge) after consuming orange (2 cases) or mandarin(1 case). Two of these children had known allergy to peanut andone to cashew. A fourth child, an 18 month old infant, hadanaphylaxis following 2 teaspoons of baby apple food. All fourchildren were skin test prick positive to the fruit seed in questionand negative to the fruit pulp, and had previously tolerated thepulp of the fruits on many previous occasions. They were alsosensitized to peanut, cashew and pistachio suggesting anassociation between nut and fruit seed allergy. There are no previous reports of allergy to apple seed in the literature. We proceeded to demonstrate binding of IgE from thepatient's serum to proteins from the apple seed extract, withparticularly strong binding at 49kDa and ~70kDa on immunoblot.Binding was also observed to known allergens peanut andsesame, but not to the apple pulp, consistent with the SPT results. Conclusion: We suggest that allergy to fruit seeds is far more common than currently appreciated but is probably under-recognized. Clinicians might not consider the role of seeds duringthe work-up for presumed fruit allergy, and confusion may arise ifindeed symptoms only develop if the seed is cut or crushed. It isimportant to consider fruit seeds as a potential cause of fruit-associated allergic reactions.31Abstracts POSTER 14. SAFETY OF FOOD CHALLENGES IN A TERTIARY REFERRAL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Karla Villafana-Soto, Sam Mehr, Preeti Joshi, Melanie Kakakios, observed food challenges (OFC) are increasingly used in the diagnosis and management of childrenwith IgE and non IgE mediated food allergies. They play aparticularly useful role in determining whether tolerance has beenachieved in children with a past history of food allergy and inidentifying clinical sensitivity in those children avoiding foods onthe basis of IgE sensitisation alone. Safety of OFC has been animportant consideration when centres consider setting up foodchallenge facilities. Methods: All inpatient OFC performed during the period Jan 2010- May 2011 were reviewed for outcome of challenge,nature of reaction and whether adrenaline was administered.Symptoms of anaphylaxis were recorded as one or more of thefollowing: tongue swelling, throat tightness, hoarse voice, stridor,wheeze, persistent cough, loss of consciousness or collapse. Results: A total of 455 children underwent in hospital supervised OFC during the study period. 88 (19%) children reacted to theindex food on challenge. The most common foods associatedwith a positive OFC were egg (34) and peanut (16) Of thosepositive challenges, 15 had signs and/or symptoms ofanaphylaxis constituting 3% of the total challenge population. Thefoods associated with anaphylaxis on OFC were peanut (5), egg(including baked egg in muffin) (6), cow milk (1), tree nuts (2) andwheat (1). Only 7 children received adrenaline. Two childrenwere given more than one dose of adrenaline, no cases requiredadrenaline infusion or admission to intensive care unit. There wereno deaths or long term morbidity associated with any OFC duringthe study period. Conclusion: OFC in the setting of a tertiary referral Children's Hospital appears safe. A low rate of children undergoing OFCrequired administration of adrenaline in our study. Provision ofappropriate emergency equipment and ability to provide highdependency care should be ensured.

Eliwa1 1 Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Egypt Email: aardaoud@yahoo.com The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of immunosuppression on course of infection, the extraintestinalpathological changes and immune complexes deposits in kidneysand brain tissues with Heterophyes heterophyes infection in mice.Seventy Swiss-albino mice were divided G(I) 30immunocompetent mice, G(II) 30 immunosuppressed bycyclophosphamide, infected mice and G(III) 5 non-infectedimmunocompetent control mice, G (IV) 5 immunosuppresed non-infected. Groups I & II were infected with 300metacercariae/mouse orally. Two weeks post infection (p.i.) 5animals from each group were sacrificed at 14, 16, 18, 21, 25and 28 days p.i., and the kidneys and brain were processed fortissue digestion with KOH & histopathological andimmunofluorescence examination. Adult worms were counted bymucosal scraping of the intestines. Result showed the adult wormcount was higher in G(II) and G(1). Kidneys of G(I) mice showedmild congestion of the glomeruli with lymphoid aggregates. InG(II) mice, glomeruli showed size variation with mild thickening oftheir walls and the blood vessels showed moderate congestionwith mild thickening of their walls. Brains in G (I) mice showedcapillary haemorrhage with focal accumulation of endotheliocytesand histiocytes in a frame work of connective tissue. In G(II) mice,the brain showed congestion, oedema and hypercellularity.Gliosis accompanied with increased vascularity and endothelialhyperplasia was observed. Mild immune complex deposits were detected from the 3rd week p.i. in G(I). The immunoflourescence reaction become moderateat the 4th week p.i. While in G(II) the immunoflourescencereaction was mild two weeks p.i. and became moderate at the3rd week p.i. These results proved that the H. Heterophyesantigen or immune complex deposits were detected in the kidneysand brain of infected mice. These deposits play an important rolein the histopathological changes in the kidneys and brain ofinfected animals.ASCIA201 1 32POSTER 16. BUDESONIDE AND FORMOTEROL REDUCE EARLY INNATE ANTI-VIRAL IMMUNE RESPONSES IN VITRO Janet M. Davies1, Melanie L. Carroll1, Hongzhuo Li1, Alisa M. Poh1, Darren Kirkegard1, Michelle Towers1,2, John W. Upham1,2 1 The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia 2 Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia Email: j.davies2@uq.edu.au Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disease in which respiratory viral infections frequently trigger exacerbations. Currenttreatment of asthma with combinations of inhaled corticosteroidsand long acting beta2 agonists improves asthma control andreduces exacerbations but what impact this might have on innateanti-viral immunity is unclear. We investigated the in vitro effects of asthma drugs on innate anti- viral immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) fromhealthy and asthmatic donors were cultured for 24 hours with theToll-like receptor 7 agonist, imiquimod, or rhinovirus Production ofproinflammatory cytokines and expression of anti-viral intracellularsignalling molecules were measured by ELISA and RT-PCRrespectively. In PBMC from healthy donors, budesonide alone inhibited IP-10 and IL-6 production induced by imiquimod in a concentration-dependent manner and the degree of inhibition was amplifiedwhen budesonide and formoterol were used in combination.Formoterol alone had little effect on these parameters, except athigh concentrations (10-6 M) when IL-6 production increased. InRV16 stimulated the combination of budesonide andformoterol inhibited IFNalpha and IP-10 production in asthmaticas well as healthy donors. Combination of budesonide andformoterol also inhibited RV16-stimulated expression of the type IIFN induced genes myxovirus protein A and 2', 5' oligoadenylatesynthetise. These in vitro studies demonstrate that combinations of drugs commonly used in asthma therapy inhibit both early pro-inflammatory cytokines and key aspects of the type I IFN pathway.These findings suggest that budesonide and formoterol curtailexcessive inflammation induced by rhinovirus infections in patientswith asthma, but whether this inhibits viral clearance in vivoremains to be determined.POSTER 17. B CELL RESPONSES TO AREOALLLERGENS IN PATIENT WITH ALLERGIC DISEASE Julie Burel1, Hongzhuo Li1, Kelly Wong1, Michelle Towers1, John Upham1,2,Janet Davies1 1 The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia 2 Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia Email: j.davies2@uq.edu.au Grass pollen allergy is a major cause of allergic rhinitis and exacerbations of allergic asthma. IgE is the specific trigger forallergic reactions and clinical use of anti-IgE treatment amelioratesallergic diseases but surprisingly little is understood about thequalities of allergen-specific B cells. Our previous study of variableregion repertoires of IgE transcripts from grass pollen allergicsubjects indicated that IgE antibodies are typical of oligoclonallyexpanded, antigen-driven adaptive B cell responses but thesubject number was small and allergen specificity was notdetermined. It remains controversial as to whether IgE+ B cells inallergy develop via the traditional pathway of activation ofadaptive B cells in germinal centers. We investigated B cell responses from blood of patients with grass pollen allergy and non-allergic healthy donors. Peripheralblood mononuclear cells were isolated and stained with acytoplasmic dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidylester(CFSE) and cultured for 5 pollen allergenextract, FluVax 2009 (CSL), phytohaemagglutinin or withoutstimulus. Proliferation of cells was measured by dilution of CFSEand surface phenotype was monitored by flow cytometry. B cells from grass pollen allergic donors showed higher proliferation to grass pollen allergen than healthy donors whereasresponses to a viral antigen (FluVax) did not differ betweenpatients and controls. Allergen-driven B cells that entered higher staining for the plasmablastmarker CD38 compared with undivided or CD19+ CFSEmidCD27lo cells. These data are consistent with rapid in vitro expansion of circulating grass pollen allergen-specific memory B cells. Ongoingstudies are focused on allergen specificity, B cell maturation andimmunogenetic qualities of expressed immunoglobulin transcripts soas to investigate activation pathways of B cells in allergic disease.33Abstracts POSTER 18. A NEW TYPE OF HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA Georg Dewald1 1 Institute for Molecular and Preventive Medicine, Koenigswinter, Germany Email: Georg.Dewald@t-online.de Background: The classic types of hereditary angioedema (HAE), HAE types I and II, are caused by a quantitative or qualitative deficiency ofcomplement C1-inhibitor, due to mutations in the C1-inhibitor(SERPING1) gene. Mutations in the coagulation factor XII (F12) genehave been identified as one so-called 'HAE type III' (HAEwith normal C1 inhibitor), a measurements [Biochem. Biophys. Res.Comm. dominantly inherited angioedema disease which segregatesindependently of the C1-inhibitor and the factor XII gene. Method: Seventeen family members were personally interviewed; medical histories, pedigree information and venous blood sampleswere obtained. Polymorphic DNA markers representing theSERPING1 and F12 locus were genotyped using PCR-basedmethods. Results: Recurrent angioedema attacks occurred in four female and two male family members, from four subsequent generations.Tongue swellings, attacks involving the face, particularly the lips,and gastrointestinal symptoms dominated the clinical picture. Segregation analysis of SERPING1 and F12 haplotypes indicated that the disease phenotype in this family segregates independentlyof the C1-inhibitor and the factor XII gene. Conclusion: The dominantly inherited angioedema disease described here is neither caused by a complement C1-inhibitormutation nor by a coagulation factor XII mutation. It, thus,represents a novel type of hereditary angioedema. POSTER 19. ALTERNARIA AND ALLERGIC DISEASES (ALLERGIC Medical Mycoparasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran 2 Department of Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran 3 Bu Ali Immunology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran 4 Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, IranEmail: Iman.Eftekharzadeh.m@gmail.com Background: Inhalation of Alternaria spores is shown to be important in the induction and severity of allergic rhinitis andasthma. Presence of Alternaria in the nasal mucous might be atrigger for the allergic process in these common diseases. Objectives: To evaluate the relation between detection of Alternaria in the nasal mucous and allergic rhinitis and asthma. Methods: In this case-control study, 58 patients with allergic rhinitis and 58 with allergic asthma were selected randomly in theallergy clinic according to the inclusion criteria - positive symptomsand signs, indicative pulmonary function test for asthma, andpresence of atopy documented by skin prick test. They werecompared with a randomly-selected well-matched control group(50 volunteers with none of the above criteria) for detection ofAlternaria in their nasal mucous by culture. Within the casegroups, severity was defined and its association with the detectionof Alternaria was assessed. Results: There was a significant association between both diseases and the presence of Alternaria in the nasal mucous. However,neither the severity of asthma nor rhinitis had a meaningfulassociation with detection of Alternaria in the nasal mucous.Furthermore, relation between detection of Alternaria in the nasalmucous and some features of severity of asthma such as FEV1/FVC,number of admissions in the hospital was not significant. Conclusion: This study verifies previous investigations showing relation between allergic diseases (asthma and rhinitis) andairborne concentration of Alternaria. Therefore, it seems advisablefor the allergic patients to avoid exposure to Alternaria. POSTER 20. EVOGAM, THE FIRST LOCALLY PRODUCED SCIG; A STUDY OF EFFICACY, SAFETY, ANDACCEPTABILITY IN PID Marianne Empson1, Mimi LK Tang2, Leon Rozen3, Lisa Pearce3 1 Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand (since resigned) 2 Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3 CSL Ltd, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Email: mbempson@ihug.co.nz Introduction: Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin therapy is an internationally accepted option for self-administered replacement-therapy in PID. Australia and New Zealand utilise a selfsufficiency model for plasma-derived products. Off-label IMIgadministered SC is currently the only option under this model, withno locally produced SCIg. Evogam, a new chromatographicallyfractionated 16% SCIg, has been developed domestically-produced plasma. The efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, andASCIA201 1 34quality of life impact of this product were investigated in a phase III, open-label, multi-centre study, using a 1:1 dose conversionfrom IVIg to SCIg. Methods: Thirty-five PID patients (30 adults, children) previously treated with IVIg (n=34) or SCIg (n=1) were recruited from ninemajor hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Evogam wasadministered weekly for 36 weeks at a dose equivalent to theirprevious cumulative monthly dose A syringe infusion pump wasused; the first four infusions involved training and supervision atthe hospital but subsequent infusions were self or guardianadministered at home. Primary endpoints were serious bacterial infections steady-state serum immunoglobulin (IgG) trough concentrations.Secondary infection episodes,antibiotic use, days off work/school, hospitalisation,pharmacokinetics and quality of life. Results: No SBIs were reported during the study. The mean trough IgG concentration with SCIg was significantly higher than withprevious Ig treatment (8.94 versus 8.27 g/L, p = 0.0063).Evogam was well tolerated with no withdrawals due to adverseevents. Eighty three percent of subjects preferred SCIg therapy. Conclusion: Evogam was efficacious in prevention of infections and maintenance of trough levels using a 1:1 dose conversion. Itwas safe and well tolerated, and was preferred to IVIg by themajority of patients. As an alternative to IVIg, Evogam offers a major advance in immunoglobulin replacement therapy for Australian and NewZealand patients. POSTER 21. IDENTIFICATION OF BIOMARKERS TO DISTINGUISH VARIOUS LEVELS OF COW'S MILKTOLERANCE Sinai School of Medicine, New York, USA 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA Email: lford@med.usyd.edu.au Background: About 80% of cow's milk allergic (CMA) children tolerate varying degrees of baked milk, improving prognosis andquality of life. We analysed basophil activation, milk- and casein-specific IgE and IgG4 and milk prick skin test (PST) to identifybiomarkers that could distinguish varying degrees of clinicaltolerance among a cohort of CMA children. Methods: 132 subjects were classified as baked-milk-reactive, baked-milk-tolerant (muffin, pizza or rice pudding), or \"outgrown milkallergy\" based on oral food challenges. Serum samples wereanalysed for allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 levels, basophilreactivity was assessed in whole blood stimulated with serial 10-fold dilutions of milk, and PST was performed to commercial milk extract.Activated basophils the Jonckheere-Terpstra test (for ordered groups). Results: Significant decreases across the five clinical groups, from baked-milk-reactive to \"outgrown milk allergy\", were significantly greater among milk-allergic patients whoreact to baked milk than those who tolerate it. Conclusions: Most milk-allergic patients can tolerate some forms of baked milk in their diets. Different phenotypes of CMA childrencan be distinguished by casein- milk PST diameter.Spontaneous basophil activation is greater among patients withmore severe clinical milk reactivity. POSTER 22. WHICH CHILDREN WARRANT A GLUTEN- FREE DIET? Rodney Ford Children's Clinic and Allergy Centre, Christchurch, New Zealand Email: rodney@rodneyford.co.nz Background: The diagnosis of gluten-sensitivity is contentious. Clinical response to gluten-free diet in children with high anti-gliadin-antibodies, but without coeliac disease, was examined. Methods: A clinical audit of sequential children referred to the Clinic, investigated for coeliac disease. Inclusion criteria: eatinggluten prior to endoscopy; had had tissuetransglutaminase endomesial antibody (EMA). All childrenwere offered a gluten-free diet, whatever the small bowelhistology appearance, and reviewed after 3-6 months. Results: 190 children were enrolled, (mean age 5.3 years, sd 3.8) and catergorised into three groups: 31 (16%) \"possible coeliac\" because of elevated tTG or EMA antibodies (but normal small bowel histology);35Abstracts 128 (67%) with no evidence of coeliac disease (normal small bowel histology and no elevation of tTG or EMA) - assigned \"not-coeliac\". Clinical and demographic features were similar across the three groups. Intention to treat outcome: 81 of 128 (64%) \"not-coeliac\" reported substantial clinical improvement on the gluten-free diet.Of the remaining 47: 31 did not try gluten-free, and 8 reportedno benefit. When gluten-free benefit was measured for only thosewho tried a gluten-free diet, then 81/97 (84%) of these \"not-coeliacs\" reported improvement. Conclusion: Many children have symptoms consistent with coeliac disease, but have normal small bowel histology andnormal tTG/EMA results. However, they frequently have high IgG-gliadin antibody levels. Such children can also respond to agluten-free diet - they are gluten-sensitive. IgG-gliadin antibody isa test that can detect these children. Many more children, otherthan definite-coeliacs, warrant a gluten-free trial. Patient group Intention to treat: Clinical improvement on RNSH, Sydney, Australia 2 Rheumatology Department Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia 3 University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia Email: richardfulton@optusnet.com.au Background: Systemic sclerosis is a disease of unknown aetiology that can affect multiple organ systems. It can be in adiffuse or limited form, the latter includes CREST Syndrome.Diagnosis is based on clinical findings but may be assisted byautoimmune serology. The routine diagnostic antibodies include anti Scl70 and anti centromere antibodies however a wide range of antibodies maybe detected with diagnostic and prognostic value. TheEuroimmune Euroline Systemic Sclerosis blot detects 12 antibodiesassociated with systemic sclerosis. We assessed the utility of theassay in the clinical laboratory.Method: Serum samples were collected from consecutive patients attending the RNSH scleroderma clinic. This group included patientswith limited scleroderma and diffuse scleroderma. Disease controlsamples were obtained from patients with various autoimmunediseases including SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, MCTD, Rheumatoidarthritis, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Medical records were reviewed. Samples were assayed using the Euroimmune systemic sclerosis (nucleoli) profile euroline (IgG) line blot as per the manufacturer'sinstructions. Additionally samples assayed for ANA(Immunoconcepts Hep2000) and ENA (in-house CIEP). Results: The blot yielded a low specificity for scleroderma with antibodies to Ro 52, NOR90, PMScl75, PMScl100, Ku and CENPB being detected in the disease control population. Sensitivity forscleroderma was also low however antibodies to RP11 and RP155were detected in otherwise seronegative samples. Conclusion: The scleroderma blot is valuable both diagnostically and prognostically due to its ability to detect the less commonautoantibodies such as RNA polymerase III, Th/To, NOR90which are not reliably identified by routine laboratory tests. It isimportant however that clinicians be aware of the relativespecificities of these antibodies. POSTER 24. CHILDHOOD ONSET AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT ORBITAL MYOSITIS IN ANAUSTRALIAN FAMILY Paul Gray1, Brynn Wainstein1, Annie Bye2 1 Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Sydney Children's Hospital, Australia 2 Neurology Department, Sydney Children's Hospital, Australia Email: paul.gray@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au Abstract: Idiopathic orbital myositis is a rare sporadic eye disease associated with extraocular eye muscle inflammation. Wereport 3 new Australian cases of familial orbital myositis(FOM).The children extend one of only two reported families with FOM,and confirm autosomal dominant inheritance. Cases: A girl aged 14, presented with ptosis, proptosis and diplopia in all positions of gaze except primary position. CT scanof orbits demonstrated swelling of her right medial and superiorrectus muscles, consistent with orbital myositis. She was initiallytreated with oral prednisolone but has followed a refractorycourse with multiple relapses and bilateral involvement, requiringmethotrexate as a steroid sparing agent. Her brother presentedaged 11 with diplopia and a lateral gaze palsy of his right eye,with CT confirming lateral rectus involvement. He responded tocorticosteroids and has remained in remission for several years. Asecond cousin of the children, a boy, also presented with orbitalmyositis in childhood and has demonstrated a refractory course,ASCIA201 1 36again requiring initiation of a steroid sparing agent. Four cases of FOM in this family were originally reported in 1999, includingthe children's mothers who both presented with orbital myositis intheir teens. Both women have gone into remission in adult life. Conclusion: The family presented here is informative regarding severity, age of onset and prognosis of FOM. The idiopathic formof orbital myositis rarely presents before adulthood, whereas all 7cases of FOM in this family presented in childhood. This indicatesan earlier onset of disease in FOM. The sporadic form of orbitalmyositis usually follows a benign course, particularly in children,whereas two of these patients have required a steroid sparingagent, suggesting that FOM may be more aggressive than thesporadic form. Finally, the history of remission for their mothersmay indicate a relatively benign long-term prognosis. POSTER 25. A CASE OF RECURRENT FEVERS Anthony Griffiths , Karuna Keat 2560 University of Western Sydney Email: zzagriff@hotmail.com Introduction: We present the case of a 2 year 8 month old girl who presented to the paediatric clinical immunology clinic withmultiple presentations of recurrent fever, pharyngitis, andlymphadenopathy. Case Presentation: MR was 2 years old at first presentation. She was born full term, in an uncomplicated pregnancy and wasbreast fed for 6 months. From 6 months, she had multiplepresentations to the Emergency Department and her GP withfevers up to 39^C, typically lasting 5 days, sometimes withaccompanying tonsillitis, and bilateral axillary and cervicallymphadenopathy. The fevers usually responded to paracetamolor ibuprofen. She was well between episodes. She had normaldevelopmental milestones. Both her parents were from Australiaand of Caucasian ancestry. There was no symptoms ofautoimmune disease. Inflammatory markers were elevated during a few of these episodes. Blood, urine, and throat cultures and nasopharyngealaspirates were repeatedly sterile. She was investigated forunderlying autoinflammatory, autoimmune and immune deficiency. Conclusion: This is a case of a young girl with recurrent fevers. Her results and differential diagnosis will be discussed. POSTER 26. A REVIEW OF THE EXPANDED SPECIALIST TRAINING PROGRAM IN ITS FIRST YEAR OFIMPLEMENTATION IN ADELAIDE Rory Hannah1, Tahir Chaudry 2, Smith1,5, Frank Kette1,5,Robert Heddle1,4 1 Clinical Immunology Unit, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia 2 Wesley private hospital, Brisbane 3 Respiratory, Allergy and Sleep Services, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia 4 Human Immunology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia 5 Private Rooms Email: rcshannah@hotmail.com In 2010 Adelaide put their first advanced trainee through the Expanded Specialist Training Program (ESTP). This is a federallyfunded program with the stated aim enabling medical specialisttrainees to undertake training rotations in an expanded range ofsettings outside traditional public teaching hospitals. This involvesfunding a trainee to attend clinics in areas including private rooms. The process of implementation was arduous but not insurmountable and the result was a federally funded advanced training position anaddition to the traditional places available in Adelaide. This position is suitable for a trainee in their last year of training and provided a different experience and different patient mix tothe Royal Adelaide Hospital job while still providing adequatebreadth of patients and supervision for training. We illustrate our experience both in the implementation of the program and the experience of the supervisors and trainees with aview to aiding other centres whom may be considering the program. POSTER 27. A CONTROLLED STUDY OF DELTA-INULIN ADJUVANT IN HONEY BEE VENOMIMMUNOTHERAPY Rory Hannah1, Nikolai Petrovsky2, Anthony Smith3, Robert Heddle1,4,5 1 Clinical Immunology Unit, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia 2 Endocrinology and Vaxxine Pty Ltd, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia 3 Respiratory, Allergy and Sleep Services, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, Australia 4 Human Immunology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia 5 Immunology, Flinders University, Adelaide, (HBV) immunotherapy37Abstracts the frequency of immediate generalised allergic reactions (IGR) to subsequent sting by only about 80% andinduces same in many subjects. Inulin has been used safely andextensively by intra-venous injection to study renal clearance andin studies involving influenza and hepatitis B vaccines has shownantigen sparing properties without evidence of activation ofdanger signal responses. In an ongoing, clinically double-blinded,study we have followed serological responses to HBVIT with andwithout inulin adjuvant. Methods: 23 subjects with a history of IGR to HB sting and specific IgE to HB venom have been randomized 2:1 to receive HBVIT bysemi-rush regime with (group A) or without (group B) GMP inulinmixed with venom. Assays for HBV specific IgE (sIgE) (sIgG and sIgG4), ELISA assay. Results: Clinicians remain blinded. 2 subjects have withdrawn for personal reasons. There has been one IGR and one late systemicreaction to immunotherapy, both mild. The striking difference has been in sIgG4 responses to HBV. Both groups showed peak responses at 14 weeks (early maintenanceHBVIT), group A at mean 33 units (SEM 6.2), group B at 13 units(SEM 4.9) and these levels were well maintained in both. Theresponse was far earlier in group A with mean 19 units (SEM6.1) at 5 weeks following maximum dose 25 mcg HBV vs 3.5(SEM 1.8) Group B. Similar but less pronounced trends were seenwith sIgG responses. sIgE responses show a wide scatter butpeak rise from baseline was less in group A (144% vs 231%) andreturn to baseline earlier (month 3 vs month 9). Conclusions: With the caveat that only surrogate markers have yet been analysed, inulin appears to enhance wanted responsesto HBVIT. POSTER 28. REVIEWING THE EXPERIENCE OF ULTRA- RUSH BEE VENOM DESENSITIZATION AT ROYALADELAIDE HOSPITAL. THREE YEARSRETROSPECTIVE AND ONE YEAR PROSPECTIVELY. Rory Hannah1, Robert Heddle1,2 1 Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia 2 Human Immunology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia Email: rcshannah@hotmail.com Introduction: Honey bee (HB) venom frequency of immediate generalised allergicreactions to subsequent sting by only about 80%. HBVIT isrelatively safe compared to environmental stings but reactionsduring therapy can be severe and disruptive to the desensitizationprocedure. Royal Adelaide Hospital has been performingbetween twenty and thirty ultra-rush HBVIT's a year with the sameprotocol (last revised in 2006). This gives a wealth of data onsafety and reactions during immunotherapy. We reviewed, retrospectively for three years and prospectively for one year. Methods: Retrospectively we looked at a number of factors including time since last sting, Sting reaction severity, IgE to HBV, the ratio ofIgE to HBV vs total IgE, tryptase, medications and past medicalhistory. These were than correlated with reactions during therapy. Prospectively included rApi m1 and more details of effects of the immunotherapy including delayed symptoms and non-specificsymptoms. Results: Full analysis remains but there is a trend to increased frequency of reactions in the subsets with a high HBV IgE overTotal IgE ratio. We also demonstrated safety of out protocol in thelocal population including patients with a high baseline tryptase. POSTER 29. TREAT THE SYNDROME. FORGET THE DIAGNOSIS. Rory Hannah1, Pravin Hissaria1,2 1 Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia 2Human Immunology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia Email: rcshannah@hotmail.com We present a case of a 58 year old man who presented with a sudden onset illness with many non-specific systemic symptomsincluding fever, arthralgias, myalgias and effusions. After an initialimprovement he relapsed at 5 months with a similar but notidentical clinical picture. He now had a falling albumin and signs of capillary leak but intensive and exhaustive investigations yielded no diagnosis. Trialof methylprednisolone failed to alter his clinical state. When he slipped into renal failure a renal biopsy yielded our first evidence of the pathological process allowing us to create asyndromic diagnosis that worked allowing targeted and effectiveempirical treatment. POSTER 30. LYMPHOPAENIA IN NON-HIV PATIENTS Quin1 Email: alexheadley@yahoo.com Introduction: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) well described complication of an immunocomprised state, usuallyassociated with HIV. Malignancy, malnutrition andimmunosuppressant use are known risk factors for PCP in the HIV-negative population, presumably through affecting T helperASCIA201 1 38lymphocyte number and/or function. Indeed, low CD4 lymphocyte counts are associated with PCP inimmunocompromised patients without HIV. Here we describe lymphocyte count in HIV-negative patientswith Pneumocystis jiroveci i positive respiratory specimens in one metropolitan Sydney hospital over the last 4 years. Method: We retrospectively identified all Pneumocystis jirovecii diagnoses at Liverpool Hospital in Sydney between February 2007 and June 2011, and excluded those with known HIVinfection. Total lymphocyte and absolute CD4 counts closest to thetime of Pneumocystis diagnosis were recorded. Results: 12 non-HIV infected patients with positive Pneumocystis jirovecii respiratory specimens were included in the final analysis. Diagnoses included chronic renal failure, transplant recipients,solid organ and haematological malignancies. Total lymphocytecount was available on all 12 patients and absolute CD4 countwas available in 5 of those. There was an average of 4 daysbetween Pneumocystis jirovecii diagnosis and total lymphocyte count, and an average of 8.7 days between diagnosis ofPneumocystis jirovecii and CD4 count. Mean total lymphocytecount was below normal at 0.69 x 10 9/L (range 0.1-1.8 x 109/L, normal range 1.0-3.0 x 109/L). Mean CD4 count was low in 2 of 5 patients at 50 and 210 x 106/L respectively.Average CD4 count for all 5 patients was 340 x 10 6/L (range 50-550 x 106/L, normal range age dependent). Conclusions: Serum CD4 count can be normal in PCP diagnosed immunocompromised hosts. Acquired impaired lymphocytefunction, rather than number, may be the underlying risk factor forPCP acquisition in this group. POSTER 31. INTRAGAM 10 NF IN PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY Robert Heddle1, Robert Stirling4, Lisa 1Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia, Australia 2Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia, Australia 4Alfred Hospital, Victoria, Australia 5CSL Limited, Victoria, Australia E-mail: lisa.pearce@csl.com.au This open label, crossoverstudy in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) wasdesigned to evaluate whether Intragam 10 NF differed in itspharmacokinetics (PK) compared to Intragam P, and to assessIntragam 10 NF safety and tolerability.Methods: Nineteen PID patients were administered one cycle of their existing Intragam P dose (0.2-0.8 g/kg 3-4 weekly),followed by administered at thesame dosing schedule as Intragam The immunoglobulin G variables, safety and tolerability. Results: There was no significant within patient difference in the average trough IgG concentration (C min) between Intragam P and Intragam products were similar, with all 95% CIencompassing 1.0, except for time to maximum concentration(T max). Tmaxoccurred earlier with Intragam 10 NF compared to Intragam P due principally to a shorter infusion time (mean 1.75hrs versus 2.52 hrs respectively; p<0.05). Headache was themost frequent treatment-related event following both products.There were no study withdrawals, deaths or notable changes inlaboratory values or vital signs. Conclusion: Intragam 10 NF was well tolerated and exhibited similar pharmacokinetics to Intragam P, with the advantage of a45 minute shorter infusion time. POSTER 32. EVALUATION OF ANGIOGENIC AND FIBROGENIC CYTOKINES AS BIOMARKERS Hospital, 2Discipline of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Adelaide University, 3Department of Rheumatology, Royal Adelaide hospital, Adelaide SA 5000 Email: pravin.hissaria@health.sa.gov.au Background: The role of various angiogenic and the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) iscontroversial. Aim: To investigate the levels of various angiogenic and fibrogenic cytokines in patients with SSc with different clinicalphenotypes. Methods: Fifty six patients with SSc were included in this pilot study. They were further stratified into three main diseasephenotypes: 1) SSc patients with PAH (n=14), 2) DLCO (<65%) with no evidence of PAH on 2D echocardiography and/orright heart catheter studies (n=17) and 3) SSc patients withoutknown lung disease (n=25). Twenty two normal healthy controlsubjects with no evidence of tissue FGF2, FGF-2 and NT-Pro-BNP levels were increased in SSc patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). PDGFAB/BB levels were significantly reduced in SSc patientscompared with healthy subjects (p<0.05). There was nodifference in VEGF and GM-CSF levels between SSc patients andhealthy subjects. Among the SSc patients, NT-Pro-BNP levels weresignificantly different in all the three sub-groups (group 1 > group2 > group 3) with the highest levels seen in patients with PAH(p<0.001). PDGF AB/BB levels showed the opposite trend withdecreasing levels in the three subgroups (group 1 < group 2 <group 3) (p<0.05). The levels of fractalkine and FGF-2 did notdiffer among the SSc patient subgroups. Conclusion: In addition to elevated levels of NT-Pro-BNP, reduced PDGF AB/BB identifies SSc patients at risk of developing PAH.Further studies are required to validate these initial observationsand to evaluate the usefulness of serial measurements of thesecytokines to predict patients at risk of developing PAH. POSTER 33. BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTIC USE BY PATIENTS AFTER NEGATIVE SKIN TESTING ANDCHALLENGE Ramanamma Kalluru , Karen Lindsay, Janice Capstick, Brian Broom, Penny Fitzharris Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand Email: kalluru73@hotmail.com Introduction: Patients with a history of possible IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins are typically investigated by skin testing andsubsequent oral challenge in skin test negative individuals. Thereis little information on the willingness of these patients tosubsequently use the challenged antibiotic. This study questionedwhether such patients had taken or were willing to take thechallenged drug, if prescribed. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained for data collection and patient follow-up. We identified 83 patients who had negativeincremental challenges with penicillins, typically 1/100th,1/10th and full dose, at Auckland City Hospital, from April2007 to November 2009. Previous skin testing, using major andminor penicillin determinants, benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin and/orAugmentin and/or flucloxacillin had been in all patients.These patients were phoned (RK or KL), and a standardquestionnaire used to determine whether the challenged antibiotichad subsequently been prescribed, had actually been taken bythe patient and if any adverse reaction had occurred.Results: Of the 83 challenge-negative patients (61% were andwilling to participate. The interval after challenge was typically>12 months. Forty-five of the 62 (73%) had either already taken(n=14) or were willing to take (n=31) the relevant antibiotic whilemore than a quarter (27%, 17/62, 82% female) were unwilling totake the antibiotic. Two patients had experienced adverse effectsafter taking the antibiotic: skin rash (n=1) and diarrhoea (n=1). Conclusion: More than a quarter of these patients were reluctant to use the relevant penicillin despite negative skin tests andchallenge. The resource utilisation of skin testing and supervisedchallenge is considerable and has been only partly effective. Weplan a follow up study to further examine the reasons for drugrefusal, aiming to improve communication/education with patientsand family practitioners. POSTER 34. CEREBROSPINAL FLUID FREE IMMUNOGLOBULIN LIGHT CHAIN ANALYSIS ISA MORE SENSITIVE MARKER OF INTRATHECALIMMUNOGLOBULIN PRODUCTION THANOLIGOCLONAL BANDS IN A PEDIATRICPOPULATION WITH INFLAMMATORY CENTRALNERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Alisa Kane1, Russell Dale2, Stephen Adelstein1, Louise Weinholt1 1 Department of Immunology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia 2 Institute for Neuroscience and Muscle Research and T.Y. Nelson Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Email: alisa.y.kane@gmail.com Background: Inflammatory and autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) are a diverse group of disorders forwhich there are no definitive diagnostic tests. Detection ofintrathecal immunoglobulin production can assist with the diagnosisin the appropriate clinical context. Current tests for this includedetection of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anddemonstration of an elevated CSF index. Both are limited by poorsensitivity and/or specificity. Recent studies show an associationwith Multiple Sclerosis of detection of free immunoglobulin lightchains, in an adult population. We present the results of aninvestigation of the utility of CSF free light chain analysis in apediatric population with inflammatory CNS conditions. Materials and methods: Consecutive paired samples of serum and CSF samples from children <18 years old collected at theWestmead Children's Hospital and sent to the Royal Prince AlfredHospital Immunology Laboratory for analysis between March2009 and February 2011 were included. Samples were testedfor 1) CSF free light chains, 2) oligoclonal bands and 3) IgG andASCIA201 1 40free light chain index. The clinical diagnosis was determined by retrospective review of clinical notes by a paediatric neurologist. Results: 55 patients with a diagnosis of CNS inflammation and 97 control patients with non-inflammatory disorders were includedfor analysis. Detectable free kappa and/or lambda light chains inCSF have a specificity of 40.0% and sensitivity of 87.60% fordiagnosis of a CSF inflammatory disorder. Using a higher cut offlevel to achieve a specificity of 100%, the sensitivity was 29%. Incomparison, CSF oligoclonal bands had a sensitivity of 10% andspecificity100%. Conclusion: In a novel study investigating the utility of CSF free light chain analysis in a pediatric population, we demonstrate thattheir detection in CSF is a more sensitivity assay for demonstrationof intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis than oligoclonal bandtesting for diagnosis of CNS inflammatory disorders. POSTER 35. COMPARIS0N OF THREE METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF IgG ANTIBODIES TO ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS IN THE Wienholt1,2, Stephen Adelstein1,2 1 Department of Immunology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia. 2University of Sydney, Australia Email: katina.katakouzinos@sswahs.nsw.gov.au The diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is based on characteristic clinical features including a history of specificantigen exposure and demonstration of an antigen-specific IgGresponse. One of the most widely used methods to detect specificIgG is immunoprecipitation, although this method has manydisadvantages including: poor reproducibility, subjective analysis,expense of commercial kits, long time and nonquantitative results. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)have been found to have increased sensitivity and betterreproducibly than precipitin techniques but suboptimal specificitywhich may lead to false-positive results. We compared results for the detection and quantitation of specific IgG antibodies to Aspergillus Fumigatus (M3) on the Immulite 2000 (Siemens Heathcare Diagnostics, Angeles, CA, USA) aliquid phase automated according manufacturers' instructions. Using an internally established cut-off of 80mg/L on both automated platforms the following highlights the method specific variability in detection of antibodies to Aspergillus Fumigatu s. This may be related to antigen specificity or differences in the avidity of antibodydetected. Automated methods of testing reduced subjectivity,increased reproducibility and were more economical than thecommercial immunoprecipitation method. Further study is requiredto ascertain optimal cut-off values for automated methods. POSTER 36. SYSTEMIC TACROLIMUS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE GENERALISED ATOPICECZEMA IN ADULTS: A CASE SERIES Frederick J. Lee1,3, Brad S. Frankum1,2, Constance H. Katelaris1,2 1 Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Campbelltown Hospital, Sydney, Australia 2The University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia 3 Present address: Centre for Applied Medical Research, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia Email: fjy.kim@gmail.com Severe atopic eczema (AE) is frequently refractory to conventional topical therapies. Whilst systemic corticosteroids, such asprednisolone can aid remission, side-effects limit their long-termuse. Of the available immunosuppressant agents, the calcineurininhibitor cyclosporine in particular has demonstrated effectivenessin severe eczema. Little data exists however, for the systemic use ofanother calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus, which is effective as atopical preparation. We report a small, novel case series of adultswith severe, corticosteroid-dependent AE, not responsive to multipleother immunosuppressants, that were trialled on oral tacrolimus. Patients with severe AE from the authors' clinical service were offered treatment with oral tacrolimus (5 mg twice-daily) fromAugust 2008. The selected patients were reviewed clinically,underwent regular blood testing and changes in theirprednisolone doses were monitored. All patients were previouslyassessed for sensitisation to aeroallergens. Four adults with severe AE refractory to multiple medical treatments underwent treatment with oral tacrolimus. One patient failed to showany response. Three patients showed an initial clinical response,allowing reductions in their concomitant doses of prednisolone. Ofthese, one patient remains on tacrolimus as monotherapy, but theother two relapsed into severe disease, requiring an increase inprednisolone dose whilst still taking tacrolimus, which was ultimately41Abstracts ceased. Oral tacrolimus was well-tolerated in this small group of adults, and there were no serious adverse events, although allpatients reported a reversible mild tremor. This is the first reported case series using systemic tacrolimus for atopic eczema. Despite its poor efficacy with only one responder,tacrolimus may yet have a potential role in eczema of lesserseverity. However, larger prospective studies are required to qualifyits place amongst existing immunosuppressive options in severe AE. POSTER 37. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAEDIATRIC ATOPIC DERMATITIS AND PARENT QUALITY OFLIFE IS COMPLEX Fay Keat1,2, Pamela Connie H Katelaris1,2. 1University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia 2 South Western Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, Australia Email: 16362169@student.uws.edu.au This study examines the impact of the severity of paediatric illness on the quality of life (QOL) of the patient's parent, in the setting ofatopic dermatitis (AD). Methods: Children between the ages of 2 and 17 years that present to the Paediatric Immunology Clinic at CampbelltownHospital, Sydney, Australia, with AD have their disease severityassessed using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) tool. Theiraccompanying parent ofLife in Atopic Dermatitis (PIQol-AD) questionnaire which is diseasespecific and scores the impact of the child's AD on the parent andfamily. Demographic information and atopic history is alsocollected. Children are reassessed at subsequent visits andtracked longitudinally. This study is an audit of this data. Results: Preliminary results of 46 patients and their parents show a negative correlation between severity of illness and parent QOL,r=0.414 (p=0.004). Mothers (n=36) had QOL scores with astronger severity of illness (r=0.453, p=0.006)than fathers (n=4) (r=-0.168, not statistically significant).Stratification by severity suggests a much stronger relationshipbetween the parent's QOL and the child's 50 (n=36), r=0.444 (p=0.007), as opposedto children higher disease severity (SCORAD 50, n=10), r=0.060 (p=0.868). The strongest correlation between QOL andSCORAD exists in the parents of the 2-4 year old age group(n=12), r=0.587 (p=0.045). This is much stronger than forchildren aged over 4 years old, r=0.358 (p=0.038). Conclusion: This preliminary data indicates a complex relationship between disease severity and the effects it has onparental QOL, in the setting of atopic dermatitis. This relationship,and the factors which influence it, may become more evident aswe examine a larger sample size.POSTER 38. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL OBESITY AND CHILDHOOD ASTHMA - ANANALYSIS BASED ON SWEDISH SIB-PAIRS Adrian Lowe1, 2 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden 2 Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. 3 University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. 4 V\u00e4sternorrland County Council, Sundsvall, Sweden 5 Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden 6 National Board of Health and Welfare, Stockholm, Sweden Email: lowe.adrian@gmail.com Background: The prevalence of both asthma and obesity have increased in westernised countries over recent decades. It hasbeen proposed that maternal obesity during pregnancy mayinduce a pro-inflammatory intrauterine environment, which mayincrease the child's risk of asthma and allergic disease. Sib-pairanalysis is a powerful technique for assessing the possibility thatan exposure is causal for an outcome. Methods: The study population comprised all children born between 1998 and 2005 in Stockholm (n=99,830 born to43,103 separate mothers) registered on the Swedish MedicalBirth Registry. Maternal BMI was typically measured typically at 8-10 weeks post conception. Use of asthma medications (eitherinhaled corticosteroids or montelukast) was recorded in theSwedish Prescription Registry between July 2005 and February2011. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assessthe effect of changing maternal BMI on asthma medication usewithin sibling pairs matched for age. Adjustment was made formaternal smoking during pregnancy, pregnancy complications,the child's gender and other potential confounders. Results: There were 4,311 children with siblings with discordant asthma medication use between 5 and 9 years of age. Therewas a trend for children born to obese mothers (30-34.9 kg/m2)to have an elevated risk (aOR=1.53, 95%CI=0.88-2.65) ofasthma medication use when compared to their matched sibs.Children born to very obese mothers (BMI>35 kg/m2) had amuch greater risk of asthma than their siblings (aOR=4.45,95%CI=1.79-11.05) Conclusion: Maternal early pregnancy obesity is associated with increased risk of asthma in the child. These associations are unlikelyto be due to shared genetic or other familial risk factors for obesityand asthma, as the reported associations are based on a sib-pairanalysis. Maternal obesity, or changes in lifestyle factors that leadto it, appear to cause an increase risk of childhood asthma.ASCIA201 1 42POSTER 39. NMDA RECEPTOR ANTIBODY POSITIVE NEUROLOGICAL SYNDROMES - THE WESTERNAUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE Ben McGettigan1, Christine Bundell1, Peter Introduction: The receptor (NMDA-R) is a post synaptic neurotransmitter receptor expressed on muscle,postganglionic and central nervous system neurons. Antibodiesagainst the NR1 subunit of NMDA-R are non-paraneoplastic forms of limbic encephalitis. Method: Since 2008, 11 patients in Western Australia have tested positive for NMDA-R antibodies. NMDA-R antibody testingwas performed either at PathWest QEII and confirmed at theOxford Radcliffe Laboratory (4 cases), at the Oxford RadcliffeLaboratory alone (6 cases) or at the University of PennsylvaniaSchool of Medicine (1 case). IgG anti-NMDA-R antibodies weredetected rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Serial samplessubmitted for testing to monitor antibody levels were testedconcurrently in dilution on the Euroimmun transfected cell slides. Results: 8 female and 3 males patients were identified. The average age of NMDA-R antibody positive patients was 38 years(male 53, female 32), with a range between 1 year and 71years. We have been unable to find a younger patient describedin the literature. 10 patients presented with clinical featuressuggestive of limbic encephalitis. 1 patient presented withweakness and bulbar palsy and was thought to have motorneurone disease. Teratomas were identified and removed in threeof the females. Follow up testing was performed for the infant andtwo female adults. One patient had a clinical relapse withdetectable antibodies at a 1:100 dilution. Apart from the patientwho was thought to have motor neurone disease (whosubsequently died), all patients clinically improved using variousimmunosuppressive treatments. Conclusion: Detection and monitoring of anti NMDA R antibodies is essential for the prompt identification of NMDA-R associatedlimbic encephalitis and may be useful evaluating the effectivenessof therapy.POSTER 40. THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PATIENT INFORMATION RESOURCE FOR ALLERGICRHINITIS Kathryn Mulligan RN Norwest Allergy Clinic, Bella Vista, Australia Email: allergy@norwestent.com Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a chronic allergic condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The non life-threatening, chronicnature of AR has meant it has often been trivialised by bothsufferers and health-care professionals. Consequently, AR is oftenunder-treated, ineffectively treated or not treated at all (Hu et al.2008). Self-management of AR requires effective evidence-basedverbal and written information. There is a dearth ofunderstandable, written information about diagnosis andmanagement of AR for patients to source. The aim of this project was to produce a written, evidence-based patient information resource about Allergic Rhinitis to addressissues which lead to it being ineffectively treated. A pre-production questionnaire was distributed to sufferers of AR to determine what information would satisfy their needs. An EarNose & Throat (ENT) specialist provided input of required clinicalinformation. This information was collated and a pamphletproduced using design criteria which accommodated differingliteracy levels and learning styles of patients. The resource, together with a post-production questionnaire was distributed, to the same respondents as the previous questionnaireand to the ENT specialist to gain feedback on the pamphlet'scontents and presentation. Changes were then made based onthis feedback to produce the final draft of the pamphlet which willbe presented at the ASCIA conference. The pamphlet satisfied the information and learning needs of AR sufferers and the clinical requirements of the ENT specialist. Whilethere are limitations to the pamphlet, such as its availability only inEnglish, there is potential for it to be further developed to meet theneeds of a wider audience. Hu, W, Katelaris, C.

HCMV DNApolymerase chain reaction is the standard assay for guidingantiviral treatment. However, its poor specificity can lead totreatment with potentially toxic medications in many patients whowould not progress to disease. Measurement of HCMV-specific T-cells can potentially be applied to help stratify risk of CMVdisease and guide early treatment. Methods: Our prospective, multicentre study evaluated the performance of the QuantiFERON-CMV assay 4colour Staining (ICS) assay for CD8 and CD4responses respectively, 25 children at defined time-points post-HSCT. ICS for Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-2 was performedin CD8 T-cells stimulated by the same HCMV peptides and in CD4 byHCMV lysate. All assays were compared against HCMVserostatus in a cohort of healthy adults. Results: Table 1: A. Performance of assays using HCMV serostatus in healthy adults B. Performance of QFN-CMV and WB 4/25/134 in patients post-HSCT using ICS as the \"gold standard\" for CD8 and respectively. Conclusion: Performance of QuantiFERON-CMV and WB 4/25/134 assays appear promising and CD4 T-cell responsesrespectively, in children post-HSCT. Our study is the first to report theperformance of these assays exclusively in paediatric patients following HSCT. Further evaluation is required in this clinical setting. A.

E-mail: j.upham@uq.edu.au Background: Clinical guidelines recommend influenza vaccination in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),though this is largely based on observational studies and adetailed examination of the immune response to vaccination inCOPD has not been undertaken. Aims: To assess the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in COPD and the clinical and laboratory factors associated withvaccine responses. Methods: Blood was collected prior to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination and one month after vaccination from twentyone COPD patients, of whom 9 were current smokers and 14used inhaled steroids. Fourteen healthy subjects of similar ageserved as controls. H1N1-specific antibody titres were measuredby assessed using blood mononuclear cellsstimulated in vitro with vaccine and then analyzed by flowcytometry and ELISA. Results: Seroconversion, defined as a four-fold rise in Ab titre, occurred in 90% of healthy controls but in only 43% of COPDpatients. Post vaccination Ab titres were significantly lower inCOPD patients than in healthy controls (p=0.02), and this wasassociated with lower serum IL-21, a cytokine that is important forB cell development and Ab synthesis (COPD 50 \u00b1 130 pg/ml;healthy controls 75 \u00b1 84 pg/ml; p<0.01). In vitro functionalASCIA201 1 44differences were also observed between COPD patients and healthy controls, with fewer proliferating B cells expressing CD27(COPD 38.1 \u00b1 18.5%; healthy Multivariate vaccination Ab titres varied in association withhaving COPD and with previous influenza vaccination, but notwith age. Conclusion: COPD is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza vaccination. POSTER 43. A SPECIFIC MIXTURE OF NON-DIGESTIBLE OLIGOSACCHARIDES ENHANCES THE TOLERIZINGCAPACITY OF A PARTIAL WHEY HYDROLYSATE IN AMOUSE MODEL FOR COW'S MILK ALLERGY Betty C. A.

Dietary intervention studies with HAcombined with a specific mixture of non-digestibleoligosaccharides, have been shown to reduce allergic symptomsin these children. However, the mechanisms by which theseoligosaccharides exert their effect are yet to be explored. In thisstudy, the contribution of this specific oligosaccharides mixture onthe tolerizing capacity of a partial whey hydrolysate (WH) wasinvestigated in a mice model of cow's milk allergy. Mice were sensitized orally with whey using cholera toxin as adjuvant. Prior to sensitization mice were pre-treated orally withpartial WH, PBS, with or supplementation short chain-galacto-,long chain-fructo- and acidic-oligosaccharides (9:1:1). Afterchallenge, the acute allergic skin response, the mast cell mediatormMCP-1 and whey-specific antibodies were measured. Thepresence of Foxp3 +regulatory T-cells and CD103+DC were determined in mesenteric lymph nodes. Oral pre-treatment of mice fed the partial WH induced tolerance as reflected by a reduced acute allergic skin response and asuppressed mMCP-1 release without affecting whey-specific IgElevels. This effect coincided with increased CD103 +DC and Foxp3+ regulatory T-cell numbers. Interestingly, a combination ofthe partial WH and oligosaccharide diet completely abolished the acute allergic skin response and mMCP-1 release. In addition,a tendency towards decreased IgE levels and a further increase inintestinal CD103 +DC numbers was observed. A specific mixture of non-digestible oligosaccharides enhanced the capacity of a partial WH to induce oral tolerance. This effectwas associated with increased numbers of CD103+ DC in themesenteric lymph nodes, suggesting a role of these cells in theobserved tolerance inducing capacity of this specificoligosaccharide mixture combined with partial WH.

In this study, immunemodulation and epithelial expression of galectin-9 (Gal9),induced by a specific oligosaccharide mixture of short chaingalacto- and long chain fructooligosaccharide (scGOS/lcFOS)and TLR9 ligand and its relevance for the suppression of allergicdisease were determined both in vitro and in vivo. Human IEC were exposed to scGOS/lcFOS together with TLR ligands, co-cultured with PBMC and cytokines immune measured. In vivo, mice were sensitized orally towhey, scGOS/lcFOS (GF/Bb). Gal9 expression was determined by ELISA. In addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial, Gal9 levels weremeasured atopic dermatitis that receivedhydrolyzed formulae with or without GF/Bb for 12 weeks. Apical exposure of IEC to scGOS/lcFOS and TLR9 by co-45Abstracts cultured PBMC and resulted in increased percentages of Th1 and Treg cells. The expression and secretion of IEC-derived Gal9increased after combined addition of scGOS/lcFOS and TLR9ligand. Furthermore, development of Th1 and Treg cells treated IL-17. In vivo, the GF/Bb diet resulted inreduced acute ear swelling response upon dermal challenge withallergen serum immunohistochemistry revealed specificbasolateral Gal9 expression on IEC. In addition, infants atopic dermatitis receiving the GF/Bb diet also showedenhanced Gal-9 levels in serum, which coincided with less severeallergic symptoms. These data indicate that dietary supplementation with scGOS/lcFOS has significant implications for the prevention ofallergy through TLR9-induced Gal9 secretion by IEC. POSTER 45.

Our work aimed toevaluate the cost-effectiveness of this specific infant formula for theprimary prevention of AD. Methods: We developed a model to estimate the health economic impact of prebiotic preventive disease management ofAD. Data sources used include published literature, clinical trials,official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. Themodel takes into account a cohort of children at risk for allergy, inline with the population of the clinical studies mentioned above.Cost-effectiveness was calculated using a Markov model reflecting treatment patterns and outcomes in the management of AD. Theanalysis is conducted from the perspective of the health insurancein The Netherlands in 2009. Results: The results show that the use of an infant formula with 8g/L scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) leads to an increase in QualityAdjusted Life Years (QALY) of 0.108, when compared with thesame infant formula without this prebiotic mixture. Consequently,the use of infant formula with a specific mixture of prebiotics resultsin an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of \u20ac 472. Sensitivity analyses show that the ICER remains in all cases farbelow the Dutch threshold of \u20ac 20,000/QALY. Conclusion: This assessment shows that, in addition to the health benefits and the improved quality of life during childhood, the useof an infant formula containing 8g/L scGOS/lcFOS (9:1) alsoresults in positive nutrition economic outcomes in a cohort ofchildren at risk for allergy. Furthermore the study demonstrates thatthe use of this infant formula is a highly cost-effective way ofpreventing AD in The Netherlands. On the long term this maylead to substantial cost savings for the health care budget. POSTER 46. URTICARIA DUE TO CLONORCHIS SINENSIS IN VIETNAM: IMPLICATIONS Dinh Nguyen 1, Hieu Chu Chi 2, Sheryl van Nunen3 1Allergy Dept., Hanoi Medical University; Center Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Bachmai Hospital, Vietnam 2 Center Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Bachmai Hospital, Vietnam 3 Department of Allergy, Royal North Shore Hospital, North medicine School, University of Sydney, Australia. Email: chu_linh_chi_dung_cam_1607@yahoo.com Background: Clonorchis sinensis (Cl. to the Opisthorchidae family. Clonorchiasis isendemic in many Asian countries, such as China (including HongKong and Taiwan), Japan, Korea and northern Vietnam (Rim,2005). In 2004, the WHO estimated that over 600 millionindividuals are at risk of being infected with Cl.sinensis . Infestation with Cl.sinensis occurs mainly in the Red River delta in northern Vietnam and the increased prevalence in this region is attributedto the ingestion of raw or partly cooked fish (De et al., 2003).The major burden of disease from clonorchiasis is due to itsexerting a WHO Group 1 carcinogen effect, causingcholangiocarcinoma. Rarely, Cl.sinensis has been reported to cause urticaria (Coskey, 1977). Recently, Choi et al, May 2011,have shown an association between Clonorchiasis and atopy,without this atopy being manifest as allergic disease. We report acase of urticaria, where the profile of the positive skin prick testssuggest the explanation for the findings of Choi et al., could wellASCIA201 1 46be cross-reactivity, analogous to that seen due to tropomyosin, between house dust mite and shellfish (Fernandes et al. 2003). Case Report: A 26-years-old male, who often ingested raw fish, and had no history of atopic diseases, presented to the Center ofAllergology and Clinical Immunology1 with chronic urticaria. sinensis-specific ELISA strongly positive at1:3,200 dilution. Clinical Course: Treatment with 25mg/Kg/day of praziquantel for three days resulted in remission of the urticaria, and over theensuing two months, total serum IgE fell to 600 U/mL andtransaminases returned to normal. Conclusion: It is likely that in our patient, Cl.sinensis infestation both caused the urticaria and resulted in the atopy, which, giventhe skin prick test profile, suggests tropomyosin cross-reactivity as amechanism. In addition, our patient demonstrates the importanceof searching for Cl.sinensis , where urticaria and an elevated total serum IgE, occur in non-allergic individuals. References:1. Rim HJ.

Email: chu_linh_chi_dung_cam_1607@yahoo.com Background: The incidence of aspirin (ASA) hypersensitivity in the general Western population ranges from 0,6-2.5%, and in adultswith asthma from 4.3-11% (Hedman 1999 and Szczeklik 2004).The prevalence of ASA hypersensitivity in the Asia-Pacific region known. ASA hyper-sensitivity five (Cox-1 regimens have provenuseful in patients with ASA/NSAID hypersensitivity who have co-existing coronary artery disease and require percutaneouscoronary artery stenting (Page, 2007). We report a patient withprobable IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to ASA, successfullydesensitized to ASA. Case history: A 43 years-old male, with asthma since childhood, had previously suffered episodes of angioedema following theingestion of minor analgesics (precise constituents unknown). Hewas clopidogrel and ASA 300mg prior to insertionof within 30 minutes haddeveloped sneezing, periobital angioederma and pharyngealdiscomfort, which settled after antihistamine was administered. Investigations: His spirometry was normal. Skin prick testing with ASA 1mg/mL was positive. Total serum IgE was 106 U/L (NR <100U/L). ENT examination sinus Clinical course: ASA desensitization began with 0.0001mg of ASA. Initially, doses were doubled each 30 minutes, provided thepeak expiratory flow (PEF) was not reduced. Breakthroughsymptoms, which settled with fexofenadine 180mg, occurred 10minutes after a single dose of 50mg and the protocol was modified,decreasing the rate of dosage increase. By day 10, the patienttolerated 100mg daily in a single dose and continues to do so. Conclusions: Our report documents a safe and successful desensitization protocol in an individual with probable IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to ASA. This patient is the first patientdesensitized to ASA in Vietnam. With thanks to the Hoc maiFoundation, University of Sydney, for making this possible.

Emily O'Connor1, Jan Belcher2, Dr Rani Bhatia3 1 John Hunter Children's Hospital, Newcastle, Australia 2John Hunter Children's Hospital, Newcastle, Australia 3John Hunter Children's Hospital, Newcastle, Australia Email: Jan.Belcher@hnehealth.nsw.gov.au A pre challenge clinic was established to assist in preparing families for the food challenge process. It is recognized that priorto a food challenge anxiety levels are high, especially in childrenwith previous reactions to foods (Zijlstra et.al, 2010). Historicallyat the John Hunter Children's Hospital, the children were bookedin for the food challenge in their outpatient consultation with theirPaediatric Allergist. They then attended for the food challenge atthe Paediatric Day Stay unit often over a year later. This delayappeared to have contributed to increased parental anxiety and alimited understanding of the food challenge process. Once the pre challenge clinic process was established, a patient satisfaction survey was developed to ensure that the pre challengeclinic was advantageous. At the commencement of the foodchallenge a Patient Satisfaction Survey is provide to the parents toobtain feedback on the usefulness of the pre challenge clinic. The pre challenge clinic consists of: a full medical review (by the Paediatric Registar), a skin prick test, a review by the Paediatricallergy dietitian and a discussion regarding the process ofchallenge day and answer any questions that the child or familyhas about the challenge. Anxiety levels are generally high and thepre challenge clinic provides an opportunity for these concerns tobe raised and addressed. It allows for families to make a moreinformed decision about proceeding with the food challenge. Results indicated: 95% felt more prepared for the food challenge and had their concerns addressed. 97% indicated that they knewwhat to expect from the food challenge, 94% found the prechallenge clinic useful. The pre challenge clinic has many benefits for all involved. Families are making a more informed decision and are moreprepared. The team is able to play a more supportive role.

We sought to determinewhether peanut component sIgE testing is superior to existing invitro and in vivo diagnostic tests in predicting outcome of oralpeanut challenge in a tertiary paediatric immunology service. Methods: Children who underwent supervised peanut challenges at Princess Margaret Hospital and had serum stored within 12 monthsbefore the day of challenge were included in the study. Specific IgEto whole peanut extract and peanut components was measuredusing the ImmunoCAP assay. The diagnostic utility of each sIgEassay and SPT on day of challenge was assessed and comparedusing receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: One hundred and ninety-three children were included in the study (69 who failed peanut challenge, and 124 who passed).Serum specific IgE to Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and whole peanut extract,and mean SPT wheal, were significantly higher in patients withpeanut allergy than those who were peanut tolerant, however therewas no significant difference between sIgE to Ara 3, 8 or 9. Areaunder ROC analysis identified sIgE to Ara h 2 as the best performingserological test assessed in this study, however mean SPT wheal onday of challenge had similar diagnostic accuracy to Ara h 2 sIgE.Sensitivity of Ara h 2 sIgE for diagnosis of peanut allergy at a cutoffof >0.35 kU/L was 69.6%, with specificity of 93.2%. Conclusion: The additional benefit offered by peanut component sIgE, particularly Ara h 2, over existing diagnostic tests must becarefully evaluated before its introduction to routine practice. Atpresent these assays are inadequate to consider replacing oralchallenge as the gold standard diagnostic test for the majority ofpatients.ASCIA201 1 48POSTER 50. CO-SENSITISATION TO CASHEW AND ORANGE SEED Michael David O'Sullivan1, Colin Somerville2 1 Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Australia 264 Road, Leeming, Australia Email: mdosullivan@gmail.com Introduction: Co-sensitisation to botanically related foods has been widely described. Citrus fruit and cashew nut are related asmembers of the Sapindales order, but to our knowledge no dataexists regarding co-sensitisation to these foods. We present theresults of skin prick testing from 100 patients showing high ratesof co-sensitisation to cashew and orange seed. Methods: One hundred children with nut allergy or sensitisation were included in this study. Half of the children had positive SPTto cashew, and half had negative cashew SPT but were sensitisedto another tree nut or peanut. All patients had SPT to a panel offood allergens, with histamine and saline controls. The Pearsoncorrelation coefficient (r) was used to determine the strength of therelationship between mean SPT wheal diameters to each allergen. Results: The strongest correlations found between pecan and walnut (r=0.77) and seed (r=0.73). There were statistically significant butweak correlations between orange seed and sevearl otherallergens, however there was no correlation between orangejuice and orange seed SPT. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated significant co- sensitisation to orange seed and cashew, however the prevalenceof clinically relevant co-sensitisation has not been established andrequires further research. Based on these findings, patients withcashew allergy may reasonably be counselled to avoid chewingcitrus seeds and to be aware that seeds may be crushed duringthe preparation of freshly squeezed juice.

SKIN PRICK TEST PREDICTS CASHEW NUT CHALLENGE OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITHLOW SPECIFIC IgE Terri Corderoy1, Michael O'Sullivan1, Richard Nolan1 1Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia Email: mdosullivan@gmail.com Background: Cashew nut allergy is common and carries a high risk of severe reactions including anaphylaxis. Although major advanceshave been made to guide clinical decision making regardingpeanut allergy, to date limited data has been available to helpclinicians predict the likely outcome of a cashew nut challenge.Methods: A retrospective patient chart review of cashew nut challenges performed between 1 January 2005 and 31December 2010 was carried out at Princess Margaret Hospital(PMH). Mean skin prick test (SPT) wheal diameter, cashewspecific IgE (sIgE), age at challenge and previous clinical historywere evaluated to determine whether any of these variablespredicted the risk of a subsequent reaction during oral foodchallenge (OFC) to cashew. Statistical analysis was performedusing the Mann-Whitney test and comparison of receiver operatorcharacteristic (ROC) curves. Results : Sixty-two OFC to cashew were performed. 36% 51% (n=32) were negative challenges,6.4% did not complete the challenge, 5% (n=3) of thechallenges were cancelled due to large SPT size on the day ofchallenge and 1.6% (n=1) reported a delayed reaction. Onlythose children with an unequivocal challenge outcome (positive ornegative) were included in the analysis. Median Positive Negative Significance (p) Results challenges challenge (Mann-Whitney (n=22) (n= 32) Test) Age (years) 7.4 6.6 ns (p=0.23) SPT (mm) 7.5 1 ** p =<0.001 sIgE (kU/L) <0.35 <0.35 ns (p=0.25) ** Statistically significant. Conclusion : In this study population there was no significant difference between median cashew sIgE for patients with positiveand negative challenges, with most children from both groupshaving cashew sIgE <0.35 kU/L. Conversely median SPT wassignificantly higher in the positive challenge group and thereforefound to be superior to sIgE in predicting outcome of challenge. POSTER 52. MANAGEMENT OF PERIPARTUM RISK OF EXERCISE-INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS Mittal Patel1, 1Respiratory, Allergy Services, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia Email: anthony.smith2@health.sa.gov.au Case ReportBackground: A 31 year old primiparous lady with a documented history of at least eight episodes of exercise-induced anaphylaxis(EIA) was referred by an Anaesthetist at 35 weeks gestation withconcerns about the risk of anaphylaxis at or around labour. History: The patient had a history of childhood allergic rhinitis and asthma which stabilized in adulthood. She described foodallergies including oral allergy syndrome to apples, urticaria after49Abstracts eating celery and abdominal cramps with mushrooms. There had been abdominal bloating and weight gain with ingestion ofwheat for which she self-prescribed a gluten-free diet. Threepresentations to the emergency department with anaphylaxis postmeals have been recorded, each treated with adrenaline. Allepisodes were precipitated by minimal effort such as walking andusually began with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea andvomiting or diarrhoea), progressing to periorbital and lip swelling,generalized pruritus with flushing, and followed by dyspnoea anddizziness. In addition, there have been 5 episodes of mildanaphylaxis after meals that were managed at home withantihistamines alone. Results: Allergen skin testing showed positive results for bakers yeast, celery, walnut and apples. Apart from a mildly elevatedtotal IgE level, blood tests were unremarkable with normal serumtryptase and specific-IgE to seafood, peanuts, omega-5-gliadinand mushroom. Discussion: There is a single case report (Smith et al, 1985) of a patient who developed an episode of anaphylaxis from the effortof childbirth. Due to the unpredictability of the length of labour ina first pregnancy, there is considerable risk of an adverse outcometo the mother and/or foetus should anaphylaxis occur in thissituation. Guidelines for managing such patients have not beenestablished, but the empirical approach taken in this case, in lightof only one reported previous case, is discussed.

GUTS Price1, Leigh Ackland1, Cenk Suphioglu1 1 Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University, Burwood, Australia Email: dbp@deakin.edu.au The food allergy epidemic has continued to rise over the past few decades, and has almost tripled in many westernized countries.Peanuts are the highest contributors of anaphylactic deaths afteringestion of a food allergen. The increasing occurrence ofsensitivity to certain food remains to be identified, and, theallergen-epithelial relationship in particular remains elusive.Normally immune sampling of macromolecules and antigens inthe intestine occurs via uptake by differentiated epithelial cellscalled M-cells, but little is known about the potential directpassage through normal epithelia. This ability to directly cross theintestinal epithelium, unaided by M-cells, may increase immune cell exposure. This therefore, may possibly explain why peanutallergy is typically more severe and often continues through toadulthood. The aim of this project was to determine if peanutallergens are able to cross the gut epithelial barrier, using an invitro model of the intestinal epithelium. We investigated theintestinal epithelial transport of peanut extract using the humanCaco-2 cell culture model, exposed to varying concentrations ofcrude peanut extract. Western and immunofluorescence analysiswere used to identify the cellular and molecular changes ofpeanut extract on the intestinal epithelium. The ability of peanutproteins to cross the intestinal epithelium, and their effect on trans-epithelial resistance, viability and tight junction modification willbe presented. This work will provide novel insight into why peanutproteins are potent allergens. Consequently, permitting thedevelopment of innovative therapeutic and preventative measuresfor peanut allergy.

We used theweb-tool to complete a prospective audit of patient risk assessmentwithin the Departments of Immunology and Neurology to helpidentify gaps in our practice. Methods: The project was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Concord Hospital. The web-tool was accessat www.immunosuppressionscreen.net.au Inpatients andoutpatients qualified for inclusion in the audit by current use of animmunosuppression regimen. Results: Immunosuppressed patients in Immunology and Neurology have diverse diagnosis and treatment regimens. Immunosuppression Screen filtered and organised information into six risk categories and two patient tailored lists of value in theongoing care of the patient. As an audit tool, it identified uniqueproblem lists and highlighted numerous tasks to be completedotherwise overlooked in routine care. Common tasks requiringASCIA201 1 50implementation included vaccination status and education, VZV, HIV and Hepatitis serologies, The tool was easy to use withminimal training. The study identified some data export issues withthe web tool which has since been rectified.

Currentlyabout 1 million people suffering from kidney disease in the finalESRD stage and under dialysis condition exists in the world.Disorders related to immune system especially in uremia patientscause to high distribution of many infectious micro organisms inthese patients. Toxoplasma is an intra cellular parasite which infects people with weakened immune system. Method: This study was established in a cross-sectional pattern on 180 serum samples including 90 of homodialysis people and 90of healthy people. Serum samples were evaluated for IgG andIgM against toxoplasma gondii using ELISA method. IgM antibodies toxoplasma gondii in homodialysis 55 (60/43%), 3(3.3%) and were 36(38%), 0(0%). Results the differencebetween toxoplasmosis prevalence in homodialysis patients wasstatistically significant in comparison to control group (P<0.05). Discussion: Activation of immune system against the invasion of toxoplasma parasite lead to increase of IFN- and eventually theproduction of nitrite oxide followed with removal of toxoplasmosistachyzoites. In homodialysis patients, uremia induces the increaseof Th 2responses rather than Th1 responses. Reduction in IFN- production weakens the cellular immune system in functioningagainst intra cellular infections like toxoplasma gondii. Accordingto what discussed above, drug prophylaxis and interleukin therapyconsidering the high prevalence in patients, strongly recommend.POSTER 56. DOES VITAMIN D INTAKE DURING PREGNANCY INFLUENCE ALLERGIC OUTCOMESIN CHILDREN AT ONE YEAR OF AGE? Kristina Rueter1,2, Anderson Jones1, Debra Palmer1,2, Susan L. Prescott1,2 1 School of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Western Australia, Perth 2 Department of Immunology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia Email: k.rueter@berlin.de Objectives: Based on the immunological effects and epidemiological associations, rising rates of Vitamin Dinsufficiency have been implicated in the dramatic increase ofallergic disease, raising questions over the need for routinevitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Our study aim was toinvestigate maternal Vitamin D intake from supplements and diet inpregnancy in relation to infant allergic disease. Methods: Vitamin D intake from multivitamins, supplements and dietary sources was determined in 670 women using validatedsemi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in the thirdtrimester of pregnancy. Infant allergic outcomes at one year ofage (n= 484) were determined by allergy skin prick testing anddiagnosis of eczema, food allergy or asthma. Results: Total maternal Vitamin D intake in pregnancy was higher in infants who subsequently developed any allergic disease (p=.022) in particular those who developed eczema (p=.01). VitaminD intake above the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI= 5 \u00b5g/day)was associated with a significant increased risk of eczema (p=.006), and any allergic disease (p= .003). This effect was largelydue to the amount of vitamin D derived from supplements. Conclusion: Interestingly these results do not support the hypothesis that boosting vitamin D intake during pregnancy withsupplements protects against infant allergic disease. Rather,maternal vitamin D intake above the RDI appears to increase therisk of allergic disease in particular eczema at one year of age.Further studies are under way to assess the role of vitamin D onimmunomodulation of early immune function.

THE PREVALENCE OF TRUE PENICILLIN ALLERGY FROM A STUDY OF CASES AT CAMPBELLTOWNHOSPITAL IMMUNOLOGY CLINIC Pryanka S Sagar1, Constance H Katelaris2 1 Medical Student University of Western Sydney 2 Professor, Immunology &Head of Unit University of Western Sydney & Campbelltown Hospital 51Abstracts Email: 16589126@student.uws.edu.au Background: Current statistics show that 10% of patients claim to be allergic to penicillin yet only 10% of these have demonstrableallergy. The most appropriate, cost-effective antibiotics aresometimes withheld on the basis of patient history. This study aimsto investigate the demonstration of IgE hypersensitivity in patientspresenting with a history of penicillin allergy to a teaching hospitalallergy clinic. Methods: Patients underwent skin prick and intradermal tests with major and minor penicillin determinants. Those with negative skintests were administered a 3 -day oral challenge. Demographicand clinical details about the reactions were noted. Results: 136 patients were tested and 18 had positive skin tests +/- oral challenge results. This corresponds to 13% of patientswith self-reported allergy having true allergy. Analysis of clinicalhistories showed that patients with a well-defined history of allergyand a history of anaphylaxis were more likely to have a positivetest compared to patients with vague histories. Skin testing provedto be less sensitive that oral challenge (Chart1). Conclusions: A minority of patients presenting with a history of penicillin allergy have evidence of IgE mediated hypersensitivity(18/136, 13%) patients in this study. Our study demonstrates theusefulness and discriminating power of objective testing whichmust include oral challenge. Discriminating factors of true allergy within the patient history were the presence of a clear description of reaction and a history ofanaphylaxis Negative testing enables the use of penicillin as first-line treatment and this can significantly reduce the cost of antibiotics.

THE EXPERIENCE OF ASSESSING BETA- LACTAM ANTIBIOTIC ALLERGY WITH THE DIATERPENICILLIN Fernando1,2, Andrew Broadfoot1,2 1 Allergy Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia 2 Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia Email: drannikasmith@gmail.com Introduction: Allergic reactions to Beta-lactam antibiotics are the most common cause of adverse drug reactions however manypatients who describe a history of penicillin allergy do not proveto have true Immunoglobulin E (Ig E) mediated allergy. Exclusion ofpenicillin allergy is challenging. Skin testing to major and minordeterminants of penicillin has the potential to improve diagnosis.The Diater reagent kit is the only commercially available kit nowutilized for the diagnosis of beta lactam allergy. We report ourexperience with the use of the Diater reagent kit with major andminor determinants of penicillin. Methods: Patients referred to a tertiary hospital allergy clinic for assessment of reported allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics wereincluded in the study. Drug hypersensitivity reactions were assessedby a standardised questionnaire completed by patients. Patientswith a history or examination consistent with an immune mediatedreaction to beta-lactam antibiotics with a recorded serum specificIg E to penicillin proceeded to skin prick (SPT) and intradermal tests(IDT) based on the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Patients withnegative SPT and IDT proceeded to oral challenge. Results: 65 patients underwent testing for penicillin allergy. The median age was 55 years (range 3-84 years), 28 were men.Positive SPT and IDT were seen in 7 patients; 4 of which were toamoxicillin, 3 to cephalosporins.1 patient had a positive oralchallenge in the presence of negative skin tests. In patients withcephalosporin allergy none had cross-reactivity to penicillin onskin testing. No adverse reactions occurred during testing. Conclusion: Our experience with the Diater reagent kit shows it to be a useful and safe mode for diagnosis of beta-lactam allergy.However, oral challenge should still be performed in those withnegative skin test results. We did not find any cross- reactionsbetween cephalosporins and penicillin in this group.ASCIA201 1 52POSTER GIANT CELL ARTERITIS PRESENTING AS CARDIAC Vinod Aiyappan1, Ju Ann Tan1, Tony Thomas3,4, Anthony Smith1 1 Respiratory, Allergy and Sleep Services, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia 2 Rheumatology Unit, Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, South Australia 3 Surgical Pathology, SA Pathology, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South Australia 4 Flinders Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia Email: anthony.smith2@health.sa.gov.au Introduction: There has been increasing recognition of aortic involvement in giant cell arteritis. We provide the first report of apatient who presented with pericardial tamponade as acomplication of giant cell aortitis. Case report: A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 3 day history of worsening of dyspnoea. This was on a backgroundof lethargy and dyspnoea for 3 months. A myocardial perfusionscan performed 6 weeks before presentation was unremarkable.Examination revealed no fever, elevated JVP with Kussmaul sign,hypotension, decreased heart sounds and pulsus sterile, pericardial and Aortic and valve replacement surgery wasundertaken. Histology of the aorta showed inflammatory infiltratewith giant cell formation. The patient recovered well, after thesurgery and an interval PET scan was normal. Discussion: Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitic syndrome affecting medium and large arteries. PET scans suggest aorticinvolvement in up to 50% of cases. Aortic dissection complicatinggiant cell arteritis is rare and usually fatal. This case reports the firstknown presentation of GCA with localized proximal aorticaneurysm and pericardial effusion, successfully treated with surgery. Conclusion: Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with pericardialtamponade secondary to aortic dissection and a thoroughhistopathological examination, as conducted in this case, isessential.

AEROALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY REDUCES DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE Vinod Aiyappan, Di Edwards, Anthony Smith Department of Respiratory, Allergy and Sleep,Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, SA, Australia Email: anthony.smith2@health.sa.gov.au Introduction: Sleep disruption and daytime AR symptoms, but any subsequent effect on sleepiness isunknown. This prospective study determined the effect ofaeroallergen IMT on daytime somnolence. Methods: 18 adult patients attending the hospital for aeroallergen IMT completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) before startingIMT and on achieving maintenance doses. Body-mass index (BMI)was determined from weight and height measurements. Results: The mean BMI of the cohort was 28. The mean ESS pre- immunotherapy was 5.9 compared to an ESS of 4.8post-immunotherapy. Obese patients (BMI>25) had mean pre-immunotherapy ESS of 6 compared to post-immunotherapy ESS of4.5. In patients with moderate-severe obesity (BMI>30), the meanESS pre-immunotherapy was 8.25 and 5.75 post-immunotherapy.In the subgroup of patients with severe obesity (BMI>35), theaverage ESS pre-immunotherapy was 10 compared to post-immunotherapy ESS of 7.5. BMI Average improvement in ESS post-immunotherapy More than 25 1.5 More than 30 2.5 More than 35 2.5 Conclusions: Immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis in adult patients reduced daytime somnolence scores. These preliminary resultsshowed a greater benefit for obese patients. Sinceimmunotherapy is a 3 year treatment, this cohort requires ongoingassessment. The use of other ambulatory tools to assess sleepquality, somnolence and upper airway patency may add to ourunderstanding of a persisting benefit. Longer term observation isrequired to determine whether immunotherapy improves nocturnalsleep, and can improve other unrelated patient outcomes such ascardiovascular events, similar to OSA.53Abstracts POSTER 61. GENETICS OF FOOD ALLERGY Pete Smith 1 Griffiths and Bond Universities, Gold Coast, Australia Email: mervyn.garrett@bigpond.com Introduction: There is an increasing body of evidence of several gene deletion syndromes and association of multiple geneticpolymorphisms with food sensitisation, allergy and anaphylaxis. Methods: Literature review of food sensitization, food allergy and/or anaphylaxis and the association with genetic syndromes,polymorphisms or specific genotypes. These associations have beenarranged into a structure a plausible mechanistic inter-relationships Discussion: The patterns of genetic dysfunction appear to be able to be subdivided into those involved with epithelial integrity, anti-proteases, innate and adaptive immunity as well as genesaffecting immune regulatory pathways. There is clearly interplaybetween these components of dysfunction. The complexity of geneinteractions and the contribution of multiple genes have made itdifficult to interpret the pattern of dysfunction that might cause anallergic response to foods. Conclusions: Food allergy susceptibility appears to be attributed to multiple genetic mechanisms. The genetic basis of food allergydoes not explain the overwhelming increase in food allergy in thelast 2 decades. Understanding the mechanisms that causes foodallergy is critical to prevention and understanding the causes aswell as environmental and immunological intervention strategies. POSTER 62.

PREDICTING SUCCESSFUL SUBCUTANEOUS IMMUNOTHERAPY IN CHILDREN: SERIAL EXHALEDNITRIC OXIDE OR COMBINED SERIAL PRICK TEST RESPONSES? Ong, Sue Hui1; Stanley, Thorsten Villiers2 1 University of Otago Wellington, Medical Student, Wellington, New Zealand; 2 University of Otago Wellington, Paediatrics, Wellington, New Zealand Email: thorsten.stanley@otago.ac.nz Background: Subcutaneous immunotherapy (IT) is widely used in children with difficult asthma and rhinitis, and shown to reducedevelopment of new allergic disease. Continuing or stopping acourse of IT is judged on clinical response. A better predictor ofwhich children might respond prior to the full 2-3 years of therapywould be valuable. None of the standard immunologicalmeasures (specific IgE, Skin Prick Tests (SPT), specific IgG4 etc.)reliably predicts successful IT. Serial exhaled nitric-oxide (eNO)levels have not been studied in IT. Sum specific IgE has beenshown to reflect asthma severity, but serial sum SPT has not beenreported in IT. Methods: All children who had undergone IT for asthma or rhinitis in the Wellington (NZ) region since 2004 and completed ordiscontinued IT were reviewed. Those who had eNO (NIOXMINO) and SPT measured prior to starting and at the end of ITwere selected. We collected demographics, IT history andoutcomes. eNO and sum SPT diameters were measured at ~6monthly intervals. Results: Of 37 children, 20 met the entry criteria, 7-16 (median 10) yr., 14 males, 15 European, 3 European/Polynesian, 1Filipino, 1 Chinese/European.17 had rhinitis, 16 asthma and 12eczema. IT vs. house dust mite 17, grass pollen 14, cat 8, treepollen 3, dog 1 and horse 1. IT was continued for 1-5 years(median 3). At completion 14 derived clear benefit, 4 possibleand 2 no benefit. eNO varied from 10-201 (median 54) ppbprior, and from 15-111 (median 45) ppb at the end of treatment. There was no significant change in eNO. Sum SPT diameters significantly dropped in responders (15-45 (median 31)) pre-therapy, 5-32(median 15)) post-therapy but notin the other groups. (p<0.005) Conclusion: Sum SPT but not eNO appears to be of value in assessing response to IT. POSTER 65. AN OPEN-LABEL STUDY OF SUBCUTANEOUS EVOGAM IN PATIENTS WITH Empson1, Penny Fitzharris1, Leon Rozen2, Lisa Pearce2 1 Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand 2 CSL Ltd, Victoria, Australia Email: sstephens@adhb.govt.nz; lisa.pearce@csl.com.au Introduction: This open-label study was a continuation of the registration study for a new subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG),Evogam, with allowance for new patient recruitment. It wasdesigned to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long term use inPID. We present here an interim analysis of this ongoing study. Methods: Patients were enrolled either from the Phase III efficacy study or were newly recruited from routine care, IVIG oralternative SCIG therapy. Evogam was administered by thepatient or guardian weekly or twice weekly. Primary end pointswere rate, severity and relatedness of reported adverse events(AEs), with IgG trough levels a secondary endpoint. Details ofinfusions and AEs were diarised, in addition to being elicitedduring 3 monthly reviews. Results: Thirty adults and seven children were enrolled between April 2008 and April 2010. Twenty-seven patients (73%) wereenrolled from the registration study and ten were IVIG (n=9) or other SCIG therapy (n=1). Six patientswithdrew from the study with 31 patients still enrolled at the timeof interim analysis. The majority of patients (26/32, 81%)experienced mild to moderate infusion site reactions. Adverseevents were reported in 30/37 (81%) patients with six (16%)considered related to therapy. Serious adverse events occurred ineight adults and two children, seven of which were infection-related. Exacerbation of respiratory tract infection in one was feltto be related to the study drug, resulting in discontinuation.Median serum IgG trough levels remained in the therapeuticrange, (>baseline Conclusion: Evogam was well tolerated in adult and paediatric patients and maintained stable IgG trough levels. Local infusion sitereactions were common but not severe. Most other AEs wereconsistent with the underlying diagnosis of PID. No new safetyconcerns were identified.55Abstracts POSTER 66.

The aetiologyof humoral immunodeficiency isfrequently recognised. less commondisease association with bronchiectasis where the aetio-pathological mechanism remains unclear. Methods: We sought to evaluate the expression of common autoantibodies in non-CF subjects presenting to the AlfredHospital, Melbourne between 2007-2011. Subjects had CTconfirmed bronchiectasis without evidence of CF. Autoantibodyassays including ANA, ENA, RF and ANCA were measured in allbronchiectasis patients. Results: n =101, f = 66, age 59.4 (14.7) years, FEV1 78.1 (27.6), BMI 26(7.5), 38 ex smokers (mean SD 23.5 (19.2) packyears). 29 subjects were colonised with pseudomonas, 33 withhaemophilus. ANA was positive in 30 subjects and ENA negativein all subjects. cANCA was identified in 16 subjects (8 weakpositive, 8 positive) and pANCA positive in 1 subject. RF wasfound in a titre > 10 in 29 expression frequently described idiopathic yet autoantibody expression is well recognized in thiscondition. The identification of these antibodies raises questionsabout autoantibodies as pathogenic contributors to airwaydamage in bronchiectasis. The presence of autoantibodies in thesetting of conditions characterised by chronic colonisation andinfection is of uncertain significance and potential concerns ininterpretation of these results is discussed.

Multiplex technologieshave the potential to significantly improve the efficiency ofmeasuring these antibodies by allowing simultaneous quantitationof serotype-specific IgG. However there has been limitedvalidation of multiplex assays against the gold-standard WHOELISA and more importantly, there has been no assessment ofassay performance in the clinical setting where evaluation ofhumoral immune function involves an assessment of fold rise in titreof pre and post pneumococcal immunization. Methods: We compared measurement standard' WHO ELISA method. Serum fromchildren and adults taken pre- and post- PCV7 and post-23vPPVimmunization were analyzed. An adequate response to immunization was determined using the APIIEG (2009) and AAAAI expert guidelines: post titre The xMAP multiplex correlated poorly with the ELISA. The GMC for the majority of serotypes was higher when samples wereassayed by xMAP as compared to ELISA. In post PCV7immunization samples, high titres of serotype-specific IgG toserotypes not contained in PCV7 were detected by xMAP but notELISA. Using the guidelines for an adequate response topneumococcal immunization, seven of 25 (28%) infants wereidentified as having an inadequate response by ELISA and anadequate response by Luminex. There was agreement between themethods for 21 of 26 (81%) adult and 18 of 25 (72%) infant pairs. Conclusion: Using APIIEG (2009) and AAAAI guidelines, the xMAP assay does not provide reliable evaluation of functionalantibody responses to polysaccharide antigens for the assessmentof immune competence.

Email: jktansy@hotmail.com Background: Maternal stress in pregnancy is associated with an elevated cord-blood IgE as well as a higher cord-bloodlymphoproliferative and stimulated cytokine response to allergens.It has been hypothesised that prenatal stress affects fetal growthand development via activation of the physiological stressresponse or via effects on the normal Th2-predominant immuneresponse in pregnancy. Method: In our cohort of 230 maternal-infant pairs the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) and Perceived StressScale (PSS) were collected at 37 weeks gestation. At 6 months ofage T-cell responses to house dust mite antigen (HDM) and eggovalbumin antigen (OVA) were assessed in a subset (n=42). At12 months of age data on infant allergic disease was collectedand skin prick testing (SPT) performed. Results: Ten percent of our cohort was stressed and 5% were depressed. At 1 year the prevalence of allergic disease in theinfants was 40.5%, and 22.5% had a positive SPT. At 6 monthsthere was an inverse relationship between prenatal maternal stressand stimulated T-cell IL-13 production to HDM and OVA significant association between prenatalmaternal DASS or PSS score and the prevalence of infant allergicdisease or positive SPT at 1 year. Conclusion: In our cohort we did not demonstrate a significant association between maternal DASS scores or PSS scores at 37weeks gestation and infant allergic disease or positive SPT at 12months of age. However, there was a trend towards significancebetween stress scores and stimulated 6 month T-cell Th2 cytokineproduction to allergens supporting the hypothesis the normal Th2 predominance INTERFERONS DENDRITIC CELLS SELECTIVELY CONSTRAIN TH2CYTOKINE RESPONSES TO RHINOVIRUSES Antonia L. Pritchard1, Melanie L. Carroll1, Julie Burel1, John W. Upham1,2 1The University of Queensland (School of Medicine), Brisbane, Australia. 2 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia Email: j.upham@uq.edu.au Background: Human rhinoviruses (RV) are frequent triggers for asthma exacerbations. An increasing body of evidence points toa dysregulated anti-viral immune response in asthma with reducedsynthesis of innate interferons and relative Th2 skewing of theadaptive immune response. The mechanisms underlying theseobservations are not well understood. Aim: Examine the regulation of adaptive immune responses to RV in healthy people. Methods: Blood mononuclear cells from 27 healthy subjects were cultured with RV16. In some experiments, plasmacytoid DC (pDC)were depleted with secreted large amounts of IFN alpha/beta in the first 24 hours which was largely dependent onpDC. At later time points the adaptive immune response wasdominated by IFN-gamma secretion by CD45RO+ antigenexperienced memory T-cells, modest secretion of Th2cytokines. Either depletion of pDC or neutralization of IFNalpha/beta led to a significant increase in expression and secretionof IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, but had no effect on IFN-gamma secretion. Conclusion: In healthy individuals, pDC and the type I IFNs they secrete selectively constrain Th2 cytokine synthesis following RVstimulation in vitro. These important regulatory mechanisms maybe lost in allergic diseases such as asthma thereby worsening theinflammatory response to viral infection. 57Abstracts POSTER 70. CLINICAL UTILITY OF ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC IgE MEASUREMENT IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF MAMMALIANMEAT-INDUCED ANAPHYLAXIS ASSOCIATED WITHPRIOR TICK Fernando2,3and Tony Basten5 1Department of Allergy, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia, 2Sydney Medical School- Northern, Sydney, Australia, 3 Department of Clinical Immunology, PaLMS, Sydney, Australia, 4 Immunorheumatology Laboratory, PaLMS, Sydney, Australia and 5 Garvan Institute, Sydney, Australia Email: vannunen@med.usyd.edu.au Background: In 2007, van Nunen et al. first described the association between red meat-induced anaphylaxis and prior tickbites (van Nunen et al 2007). Given the distribution of Ixodes holocyclus (along the entire Eastern seaboard of Australia) and that ticks occur overall in a wide distribution within Australia, thiscomplaint is likely to prove more common in the future,particularly considering predicted climate change effects onhosts' habitat. Accordingly, we have examined whethercommercially available mammalian meat RAST results correlatewith a clearcut clinical diagnosis. Methods: The mammalian meat RAST results were reviewed in twenty patients whose clinical histories of mammalian meatanaphylaxis associated with tick bites satisfied a strict algorithmfor diagnosis- prior large local reactions to tick bites, ingestion ofmammalian meat 5-7 hours pre-anaphylaxis and total remissionfollowing strict mammalian meat exclusion. Results: In this selected patient group, all individuals had positive mammalian meat RASTs (20/20). Conclusions: A strong correlation appears likely then between positivity of the mammalian meat RASTs and typical mammalianmeat anaphylaxis associated with prior tick bites, when thepatient's history satisfies a strict clinical algorithm for the diagnosisof this condition. The clinical utility of this observation lies in theability of mammalian meat RAST results to provide confirmatoryevidence for the diagnosis in sufferers in a timely manner, withtesting easily available to primary medical practitioners, whichmay thereby reduce the morbidity associated with delayeddiagnoses of this cause of anaphylaxis, a diagnosis with uniqueclinical features lending itself to such an approach.

New protocolswere initiated in April 2009 and their use and effectiveness havebeen retrospectively audited here. Methods: The records of all adult immunology patients undergoing penicillin skin tests at Auckland Hospital from April2009 to February 2011 were examined and relevant details ofhistory, test and challenge results recorded. Skin tests withbenzylpenicillin, major(PPL) and minor(MDM) determinants,amoxicillin, Augmentin and/or flucloxacillin were a three or five-step protocol, dependant on physician-assessed risk of systemic reaction. If skin tests were negative anappointment was immediately made for subsequent oralchallenge. Results: The mean age of the 178 patients was 45y (15-86y), 72% female. Immediate positive skin tests (STpos) occurred in21(12%); 3 to MDM and/or PPL only; 3 toamoxicillin/Augmentin only, with 8 positive only to the highestflucloxacillin concentration. Skin tests were positive in 36% (95%CI 17.2-54.8) of those with a history of anaphylaxis comparedwith 7.8% (3.6-12.1) of those without. Difference in ST positivitywas not significant with respect to reaction history of <1y (17.0%;7.4-26.5) or >1y (9.2%; 23% STneg Nopatient experienced anaphylaxis related to skin testing; two hadmild reactions. Ten of 100 (10%) skin test negative (STneg)patients gave positive responses to incremental oral challenge. Conclusion: Immediate positive skin tests occurred in 12% of referred patients; with challenge further identifying 10% of theSTneg patients as reactive. Challenge is an important part of theinvestigation process. It remains difficult to assess risk and allergystatus based on clinical history alone.ASCIA201 1 58POSTER 72. PERCEPTIONS OF PAEDIATRIC ANAESTHETISTS Dianne Campbell1,2, and Immunology, Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, NSW 2 University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia 3 soy oil. Hypersensitivity to egg, soy, and peanut are listed as contra-indications for propofol use. However guidelines and recent evidencesuggest propofol is generally safe in most sensitized patients. Thisstudy aimed to evaluate the practices of paediatric anaesthetists withrespect to propofol use in egg/soy/peanut allergy children. Methods: An online survey was sent to members of the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Irelandand Society for Paediatric Anaesthesia in New Zealand andAustralia. Membership to these societies is not restricted to theanaesthetist's country of practice. Results: 349 responses were collated over 3 months. Most paediatric anaesthetists were consultants (88%), had > 10 years'experience (80%), and practiced in England different countries. 55%, 69% and 72% of anaesthetists reported they would not use propofol in patients with a history of urticaria, wheeze orhypotension to egg/soy respectively. Most would administerpropofol in children with only peanut allergy (91%). Trainees and anaesthetists with < 10 years' experience were more likely to request a skin prick /intradermal test to propofol inpatients with a history of urticaria to egg/soy prior toadministration (p < 0.05). Australian/New Zealand anaesthetists were more likely to administer propofol in patients with a history of urticaria toegg/soy (p=0.0031 vs other countries). Anaesthetists who statedthey would use propofol in those with prior urticarial reactions toegg/soy, were also more likely to use propofol in patients with ahistory of wheeze or hypotension to egg/soy (p < 0.05 ). Conclusion: Contrary to published guidelines most paediatric anaesthetists would not administer propofol to patients with ahistory of mild-moderate egg/soy allergy. Approximately 1/10thof anaesthetists would not administer propofol to children withpeanut allergy alone.POSTER 73. A COMPARISON OF SINGLE-HEADED SKIN TEST DEVICES: VARIABILITY OF RESULTS WHENPERFORMED BY MULTIPLE OPERATORS Rebecca L Werther1, Sharon Choo1, Katherine J Lee2,3, Katrina J Allen1,2,3, Debra Poole1, Mimi Tang1,2,3 1 Allergy and Immunology Department, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia 2 Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia 3 Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Australia Email: becwerther@gmail.com Background: Previous studies have compared the intra-user variability between skin prick test (SPT) devices used to aid in thediagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy, however no study to date hasassessed the variability in performance of devices when used bydifferent operators. We assessed the variability of four commonlyused SPT devices when used by multiple operators, and whenperformed on arms compared to backs. Methods: Eight adult volunteer 'testers' with no prior experience in performing SPT were trained equally in the use of four devices:Greer Pick, Quintip, Stallergenes Lancet and Feather Lancet. Eachtester performed SPT with histamine (1mg/ml) using each of thedevices on the backs and forearms of 5 volunteer 'receivers'.Wheal sizes were measured at 10 minutes, with variability in themean perpendicular diameters assessed using a multi-level(random effects) regression model. Results: From the raw data, the SPT measurements for Greer Pick were the most variable (standard deviation [SD] = 2.1), followedby the Feather Lancet (SD = 1.3) and the Quintip (SD = 1.1), withthe least variability observed with Stallergenes Lancet (SD = 0.9).Using multi-level modelling, the measurement error was thesmallest with the Stallergenes Lancet, closely followed by theQuintip and the Feather Lancet, and then the Greer Pick. Therewas no evidence that the variability between testers or receiverswas different across the devices. Comparison of SPT performanceby location revealed greater variability in measurements from thearm compared to the back. Conclusion: When multiple operators were equally trained in all four SPT devices, the devices using the 'puncture' method (i.e.Stallergenes Lancet and Quintip) provided less variability in SPTresults than those using a 'prick' method (i.e. Greer Pick andFeather Lancet). There was overall less variability when SPT wasperformed on the back compared to the arm.59Abstracts POSTER 74. CHARACTERISTICS OF CHURG-STRAUSS SYNDROME IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA Andrew F. Whyte1,2, Swati Sinkar3, Frank Kette2, William Smith2, Pravin Hissaria1,2 1 Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science/SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia 2 Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia 3 Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia Email: afwhyte@gmail.com Background: Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a necrotising systemic vasculitis which affects small- to medium-sized bloodvessels. To our knowledge, this is the first study specifically onCSS in Australia. We aimed to determine the clinical andlaboratory features and prognosis of CSS in South Australia. Methods: This was a retrospective review of records of all patients with CSS managed through the Immunology Departmentat the Royal Adelaide Hospital between 2002 and 2008. Theclinical and laboratory features, management and outcome ofthese patients were analysed. Results: Nineteen patients had a diagnosis of CSS, of whom 10 were male. Mean age of onset was 54 years. Eighteen patientshad asthma and 16 had sinonasal disease. Fourteen patients hadrash, 14 had neuritis, 11 had myositis, 7 had gastrointestinalinvolvement, 2 had renal disease, and 1 had coronary vasculitis.Two patients had received leukotriene antagonists previously.Mean eosinophil count at Patients experienced a mean 1.84 relapses, and5 patients survived a mean 106 months and died at a mean ageof 75.8 years. Complications included venous thromboembolism(VTE) (5 patients, associated with CSS activity in 4 patients),osteoporosis (5 patients), infection (3 patients), and persistentneuropathy (3 patients). Nine patients were p-ANCA/MPO+, 2patients were c-ANCA/PR3+, and 8 patients were ANCAnegative. There were no significant differences between ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative patients. Conclusion: CSS is an eosinophil-dependent ANCA-associated vasculitis. Many cases can be managed with corticosteroidsalone. In some cases cardiac, renal or neurological complicationscan be serious and immunosuppressive medications may berequired for induction and maintenance. Thromboembolism is amajor complication and should be addressed in the managementof these patients.POSTER 75. RATES OF INCREASES FOR IVIG USE IN NSW AND AUSTRALIA James Wood1, Anita Heywood1, Andrew Lloyd1, Peta Dennington2, John Ziegler3 1 University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia 2 Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Sydney, Australia 3 Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia Email: James.Wood@unsw.edu.au Background: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used as replacement therapy for antibody deficiency for several decades,and is also now an important immunomodulatory therapy for agrowing list of autoimmune diseases, leading to burgeoningdemand. Attempts to address this demand have includedcontrolling supply (via clinical use criteria), increasing localproduction, and importing supplies. An understanding of thedrivers of this growth and future trends is important to ensureappropriate plans are made for managing supply of an expensiveand limited resource. Methods: Time trends in monthly data on patient episodes and IVIg distribution from 07/2003 to 02/2011 in NSW wereanalysed for common indications, as well as annualised trends byprescribing discipline at a national level over the period 2004/5to 2009/10. All analyses were conducted in R software. Results: Nationally IVIg usage has been growing at an annual rate of 11.6%, while per 1000 population this is slightly lower at9.9%, suggesting a small effect of population growth. Use inneurology and haematology have been growing above theoverall trend, while the rate of increase in use in immunology hasslowed in recent years. In NSW, IVIg use has been growing morerapidly (13.2% pa) than the national rate with patient episodesalso increasing by 12.4% per year. Common indications whichare growing above trend in NSW, include acquiredhypogammaglobulinaemia, chronic inflammatory demyelinatingpolyneuropathy and myasthenia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura isgrowing below trend. Conclusion: Despite recent efforts to control supply of IVIg, the rate of use in Australia continues to grow rapidly. Most of this increaseis due to the rise in patient episodes. In NSW, this appears to bebeing driven by neurological and haematological indications. Thisanalysis will now be extended to project future trends.ASCIA201 1 60CLINICAL GRAND ROUNDS - ORAL PRESENTATION 1. A CASE OF GRAVES' DERMOPATHY AFFECTING THE BREAST Alan Baker, Matthew Cook Department of Immunology, The Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australia Email: alan.baker@act.gov.au Infiltrative thyroid dermopathy is a known yet infrequent feature of Graves' disease. The most common location is the pretibial regionor the dorsum of the foot case of likely infiltrative dermopathy affecting thebreast in a 53 year old woman with concurrent PTM and thyroidstimulating hormone receptor antibodies. The patient was referred with a two year history of recurrent episodes of mastitis of increasing frequency. Each episode wasmarked by a prodrome of malaise with myalgia and arthralgiafollowed by the development of localised inflammation to the rightbreast with tender erythema and the appearance of peau d'orange.While initial episodes were treated as infection, the course of laterepisodes appeared independent of antibiotic therapy. Her medical history is significant for autoimmune thyroid disease. She recalls a presentation ten years ago with fatigue and weightloss and was subsequently commenced on thyroxine. She alsohad an undiagnosed skin lesion on the pretibial of was by erythema, improved withsystemic corticosteroids. The episodes of mastitis were associated with marked elevation of her inflammatory markers with C-reactive protein and erythrocytesedimentation rate upwards of 120 mg/l and 75 mm/hourrespectively. Ultrasound investigation revealed subcutaneousoedema with some poorly defined hypechoic areas. A corebiopsy revealed fibrosis with patchy perilobular later fine demonstrated asmall lymphocytic population and some macrophages. investigation elevated TSH receptorand thyroperoxidase antiboides but normal thyroid function..Magnetic resonance imaging of her orbits revealed no evidenceof Graves' ophthalmopathy. The findings point to a unifying diagnosis of Graves' disease, with pretibital myxoedema and infiltrative dermopathy affecting the breast. CLINICAL GRAND ROUNDS - ORAL PRESENTATION 2. AN UNUSAL PRESENTATION OF X LINKED VARIANT CHRONIC GRANULMATOUS DISEASE PREVIOUSLYDIAGNOSED WITH MUNCHAUSEN SYNDROME Sara Barnes1, Sharon Choo2, Jo Douglass1, Paul Cameron1 1 The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne Australia 2 The Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne Australia Email: barnes.sara@hotmail.com A 40 year old man presented with new right medial malleolus discharging ulcer with satellite superficial abscesses and left footcellulitis. His recent past medical history had been complicated forthe proceeding 3 years with bilateral recurrent Staphylococcus Aueru s bacteraemia, osteomyelitis and abscesses following a traumatic left calcaneal fracture. In the year prior the patient hadrequired sequential right toe and forefoot amputations. During hishospital admissions it was noted that whilst intravenous accesswas present he would develop recurrent septicaemia aspergillus, enterobacter, acinterobacter and staphylococcus auerus . Treating clinicians at this point in time felt that the bacteraemia may in part be contributed by the patienttampering with his venous access. His family medical history was remarkable for his mother suffering for previous miscarriages and systemic lupus. He had onedaughter who was well and no siblings. During his admission his abscesses grew methicillin sensitive staphylococcus auerus . These were treated with surgical drainage and intravenous antibiotics. Examination wasremarkable for hepatosplenomegaly and superficial granulomaspost cannulation. He was noted to have mild neutropenia,polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemai. His T cells were withinnormal limits. There was no clinical evidence of vasculitis withnegative autoantibody and vasculitis serology. Neutrophil function tests which showed reduction in a granulocyte deducing DHR response proteinsshowed a decreased in gp91phox with genetic studies pending.As a result a diagnosis of variant X-linked chronic granulomatous(CGD) disease was made. He was maintained on prophylacticbactrim with no recurrence of sepsis or abscesses for 5 months.This is an unusual case of X-CGD presenting in late age. Adiagnosis of deliberate tampering or Munchausen's should onlybe made when other possibilities have been excluded.61Abstracts CLINICAL GRAND ROUNDS - ORAL PRESENTATION 3. EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS: A DIAGNOSTIC DILEMMA Katie Frith1 1The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia Email: frith.katie@gmail.com A 14 month old girl presented to emergency department with a two week prodrome of fever, irritability and vomiting. Onexamination she was noted to have a bulging anterior fontanelle. MRI revealed multiple punctate lesions and a lumbar puncture demonstrated low CSF glucose and high protein. CSF microscopyshowed a high percentage of eosinophils (45%) consistent with adiagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis. Empirical antibiotics (penicillin, cefotaxime and vancomycin) withacyclovir and dexamethasone. She was transferred to the Children'sHospital at Westmead for ongoing management. Repeat lumbar punctures confirmed eosinophilic meningitis. Her antibiotics were stopped and she was commenced on an anti-helminthic with continued high dose steroids. Further investigationsrevealed a positive ANCA, mildly elevated LDH and a normalvitamin B12. A chest x-ray showed increased markings.Subsequent MRIs demonstrated disease progression with multiplenew haemorrhagic foci. Despite treatment her admission was complicated by raised intracranial pressure requiring an external ventricular drain, persistentfevers and cough with raised inflammatory markers and peripheraleosinophilia (1.2x10 9/L), and the onset of left leg weakness. In our presentation we highlight the differential diagnoses and diagnostic challenges of this intriguing case. CLINICAL GRAND ROUNDS - ORAL PRESENTATION 4.

Here, we present the case of a 33 year old Aboriginal male who presented to his GP with exfoliative dermatitis approximately 3weeks after starting phenytoin. He later developed severeepigastric pain and was admitted to hospital. Eosinophils wereraised (5.5 X 109/L) and liver function was deranged (GGT1500 U/L, ALT 700 U/L). Phenyotin associated DRESSsyndrome was suspected, therefore Phenytoin was ceased and thepatient was started on steroids. Gastroscopy revealed severecircumferential ulceration of distal stomach HHV-6 DNA wasdetected by blood PCR. Peripheral blood flow cytometryrevealed a CD8 lymphocytosis with increased activation markerson with His skin, epigastric pain, eosinophilia liverfunction tests gradually improved after ceasing the phenytoin andhe was discharged on a tapering regime of steroids. This case highlights the link between drug hypersensitivity and human herpesviruses such as CMV and HHV-6. Further studiesare needed to investigate this association and the role of theseviruses in both the immunopathogenesis of DRESS and the immunedysregulation associated with this disease.

He had a 4 day history ofvomiting, lethargy and one episode of diarrhea. He was treatedlocally for probable gastroenteritis with nasogastric fluidrehydration. On day 3 of admission he deteriorated with lethargy,poor perfusion, fever and cytopenia. He was given a dose of ivceftriaxone. On arrival of the RCH retrieval team he was periarrestwith tachycardia, unrecordable blood pressure but palpablebrachial pulses. Abdominal exam revealed hepatosplenomegaly.He was intubated and ventilated and transferred. Initialinvestigations at RCH showed anemia, thrombocytopenia,hypofibrinogenaemia and high ferritin. Management consisted oftransfusions of red cells, platelets, FFP and cryoprecipitate,inotropic support, IV corticosteroid and antibiotics, and 2 doses ofIVIG. On day 6 a bone marrow aspirate (BMA) was performed,which showed a normocellular bone marrow with toxic changesand megaloblastic features. Haemophagocytosis wasdemonstrated in some mature histiocytes. There was an increasein juvenile histiocytes. The patient was extubated and transferredto the ward on day 11 with a weaning dose of hydrocortisone.On Day 13 he developed lip smacking and jitteriness suggestingseizures. Repeat BMA on day 15 expression was normal, and NK cell degranulation (CD107aexpression) was reduced. Genetic analysis showed compoundheterozygous mutations in STXBP2 (Familial HLH type 5). Thefamily were tissue typed with the view of proceeding to HSCT. Conclusion: HLH is a severe disease that requires prompt diagnosis and management, and may present as sepsis.

CASE PRESENTATION: A LIFE-SAVING EPISODE Wainstein1 1 Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia 2 University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia Email: mahila.namasirayam@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au Introduction: Marasmic-kwashiorkor is the most severe of the childhood malnutrition syndromes resulting from marked proteinand caloric insufficiency. It carries a high rate of morbidity andmortality. Although commonly associated with extreme poverty indeveloping countries, rare reports in the developed world haveoutlined protein-energy malnutrition in the context of chronicmalabsorptive conditions, food faddism, nutritional ignorance andfood allergen avoidance without appropriate medical advice. Case: An eleven-month old girl of Asian immigrant parents living in suburban Sydney presented to the Emergency Department witha history of anaphylaxis after her first known ingestion of soy,sesame and uncooked egg (in mayonnaise) for which shereceived appropriate acute treatment. Background history ofgeneralised eczema had been treated briefly with topical mildcorticosteroids. Following an internet search for eczemamanagement, her diet was severely restricted and breastfeedingweaned. Examination revealed a lethargic infant with dependentoedema, erythroderma, sparse hair, conjunctival pallor, globaldevelopmental delay and poor stores of muscle bulk and fat.Significant laboratory abnormalities included severehyponatraemia, hypoalbuminaemia with proteinuria, metabolicalkalosis, anaemia, and deficiencies of zinc, vitamin D, and iron.Workup for underlying causes including for metabolic andgastrointestinal disease revealed highly elevated anti-gliadin IgGantibody. She will undergo further evaluation to exclude coeliacdisease, although she had inadvertently been on a gluten-free dietmonths before presentation. Following initial resuscitation,nutritional rehabilitation was commenced according to WHOguidelines with reversal of clinical and biochemical abnormalitiesincluding resolving proteinuria. Conclusion: Presentation to hospital with anaphylaxis essentially saved this infant's life as it led to prompt diagnosis and treatmentof the previously unrecognised severe protein and caloriemalnutrition. This case also illustrates the perils of seeking healthadvice from non-reputable internet sites and implementing foodelimination diets without appropriate medical supervision.

BLIND, DEAF AND DUMBFOUDNED; UNRAVELLING SOME OF THE MYSTERIES OFSUSAC'S John Parrat 2, 3 1Department of Clinical Immunology Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia 2 Neurology Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia 3 Sydney University, NSW, Australia Email: drannikasmith@gmail.com Introduction: Susac's syndrome is a rare but devastating condition characterized by retinal branch artery occlusion, sensorineuraldeafness and encephalopathy mostly in young people. Thepathogenesis and treatment are not well defined although thedisease is attributed to a microangiopathy involving the arteriolesof the brain, retina and cochlea. Prompt diagnosis is essential asearly therapy may reduce sequelae and improve recovery.63Abstracts Case: A 30 year old male was diagnosed with Susac's syndrome in February 2010, manifesting as right sided sensorineuralhearing loss, encephalopathy and ataxia accompanied by typicalMRI brain lesions (T2 hyperintensities in the corpus callosum andperiventricular white matter) and right retinal branch arteryocclusion on fundal photography. A brain biopsy of the meningesand cortex revealed diffuse pial by CD8T-lymphocytes macrophages. Micro-infarctions were seen territory of small pial arteries. No classical vasculitic changeswere seen although some vessels showed complement C3d in thewall and were swollen. The patient was commenced onimmunosuppression comprising 3 days of pulsedmethylprednisolone and subsequent reduction of oral prednisone,and 6 cycles of monthly cyclophosphamide (1 g) and IVIg2g/kg. Remission was achieved although there was minimalreversibility of his right sided sensorineural deafness. His conditionrelapsed 6 months later following commencement of were and thepatient was maintained on MMF 1.5g BD and tapering course ofprednisone. However, he subsequently suffered another diseaserelapse (7 months later) for which pulsed methyl prednisolone andinfliximab was commenced (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6 and thenevery 8 weeks) and MMF continued. His disease has been inremission for 3 months although it is likely he will require acochlear implant for deafness. Discussion: Susac's syndrome is a rare condition that results in significant sequelae with varying functional outcomes and residualdisability. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear but it is most likelyto be an immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects themicrovasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. This issupported by recent pathological and serological studies. Thebest approach to treating refractory or relapsing disease remainsto be established. This is the first report of infliximab used in theinduction and maintenance of relapsing disease. Furthermulticentre trials may elucidate the role of biologic agents ininducing and maintaining remission. An early diagnosis andsubsequent treatment may halt progression of disease and reducethe extent of permanent disability.CLINICAL GRAND ROUNDS - ORAL PRESENTATION 8. A CASE OF CIQ DEFICIENCY, LUPUS AND MOYA MOYA John Wei-Liang Tan1,2 1 Children's Hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, Sydney, Australia 2 University of Sydney, NSW, Australia Email: johnt3@chw.edu.au We describe a 4 year old girl with C1q deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosis and moya moya disease. She presented at 19 months of age with pyrexia of unknown origin on a background of microcephaly, developmental delay,recurrent urinary tract Infections and chronic diarrhoea. Clinically,a malar rash, microcephaly and a 6th nerve palsy was evident.Biochemically, elevated liver functions, inflammatory markers,triglycerides, and ferritin, were suggestive of haemophagocyticlymphohistocytosis. Pulse steroids resulted in elimination of herfebrile episodes. CH50 was abnormal and further investigationsreveal C1q deficiency. Unfortunately, her symptoms persisted, with worsening of her rash, ongoing issues with UTIs persistent 6th nerve palsy, and thedevelopment of pancreatitis. She developed spasticity andregressed developmentally. ANA, ds DNA was elevated, C3 andC4 were low and a diagnosis of SLE was made.. She was commenced on steroids and azathioprine. Brain imaging showed changes consistent with cerebral lupus. With ongoingoral prednisolone and mycophenolate, her condition improvedclinically and with titers of ANA, dsDNAand normalization of C3 and C4. In April 2011, she presented to ED with bloody diarrhoea, fevers ,lethargy and seizures. Salmonella was isolated in stool. Cerebralimaging revealed infarcts and an suggestive of moya moya disease.Due to the severity of her cerebral disease, she underwent abypass procedure (encephaloduromyoangiosis) in an attempt toincrease blood flow to the brain. The grand round presentation will focus on the unusual and severe complications of C1q deficiency and SLE.

Case Report: A previously well six year old female presented with dyspnoea and cyanosis on a four week history of increasinglethargy. She was afebrile with an unremarkable chestexamination. There were no specific extrapulmonary symptoms orsigns. A CT chest revealed bilateral lower lobe consolidation. Investigations revealed normal immunoglobulin levels, lymphocytesubsets analysis, lymphocyte function and neutrophil was not detected. Bone marrow examination was normal. A diagnosis ofsevere \"idiopathic\" interstitial pneumonitis was made. There wasan improvement with high dose corticosteroids but rapid clinicalrelapses followed attempts to wean steroid therapy. Anotherreferral to immunology was made 14 months later withdevelopment hypogammaglobulinaemia and mild NK cells, CD3+/CD56+ cells NK cytolytic analysisrevealed compound heterozygous mutations of the PRF1 gene,K285del (amino acid deletion on exon 3) and A91V (amino acidsubstitution on exon 2). Sequencing confirmed that each of thepatient's parents carries one of the mutations. Conclusion: This case highlights an atypical phenotypic presentation of perforin gene mutation. Such defects should beconsidered in cases of steroid dependent inflammatory lung diseasewhere tissue histology reveals a predominance of histiocytes.Further studies of perforin gene regulation are needed to betterunderstand the clinical spectrum of perforin gene mutations.65NotesASCIA201 1 66Location Map PYRMONT BRIDGE ST HAY STGOULBURN STMARKET ST GEORGE ST STPITT ST MONORAILMONORAILOPERA HOUSEHARBOUR PMaritime MuseumSheratonFour Points Parkroyal Sydney Convention & Rocks Hall THOMAS ST Entertainment CentreDarling HarbourMONORAILCIRCULAR QUAY1990 1st ASCIA ASM - Melbourne VIC (Hilton on the Park, April 29 - May 1) 1991 2nd ASCIA ASM - Perth, WA (Burswood Hotel, December 1-3)1992 3rd ASCIA ASM - Cairns, QLD (Hilton Hotel, September 13-15)1993 4th ASCIA ASM - Sydney, NSW (Darling Harbour, April 29 - May 1)1994 5th ASCIA ASM - Canberra, ACT (Lakeside Hotel, December 2-5) 1995 6th ASCIA ASM - Sydney, NSW (Regent Hotel, October 30-November 3) with TPAIS 1996 7th ASCIA ASM - Adelaide, SA (Hyatt Hotel, December 5-7)1997 8th ASCIA ASM - Wellington, NZ (Convention Centre, April 5-8) held with TSANZ1998 9th ASCIA ASM - Brisbane, QLD (Sheraton Hotel, August 28-30)1999 10th ASCIA ASM - Uluru, NT (Ayers Rock Resort, September 24-27)2000 11th ASCIA ASM - Sydney, NSW (Convention Centre, October 15-20) (held as part of the 17th World Allergy Congress) 2001 12th ASCIA ASM - Perth, WA (Sheraton Hotel, September 28-30) 2002 13th ASCIA ASM - Adelaide, SA (Hilton Hotel, September 27-29) 2003 14th ASCIA ASM - Melbourne, VIC (Sheraton Southgate Hotel, September 10-12) 2004 15th ASCIA ASM - Gold Coast, QLD (Marriott Hotel, September 8-10)2005 16th ASCIA ASM - Queenstown, NZ (Millennium Hotel, August 31 - September 2) 2006 17th ASCIA ASM - Sydney, NSW (Manly Pacific Hotel, September 7-9)2007 18th ASCIA ASM - Fremantle, WA (Esplanade Hotel, November 14-16)2008 19th ASCIA ASM - Melbourne (Park Hyatt Hotel, November 12-14)2009 20th ASCIA ASM - Adelaide, SA (Adelaide Convention Centre, September 16-18)2010 21st ASCIA ASM - Broadbeach, QLD (Gold Coast Convention & Exhibition Centre, September 1-4) 2011 22nd ASCIA ASM - Sydney, NSW (Sydney Convention & Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour, September 6-10)22 years of ASCIA Annual Scientific Meetings "}
