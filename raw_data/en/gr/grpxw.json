How To Find The Best Natural Skin Care Ingredients Natural ingredients in the context of [ beauty products](https://thegoodnessproject.co.uk/shop/category/organic-vegan-beauty-bath-body-products) are those derived from the land or sea. (Botanical refers to the fact that they are derived from plants.) However, not all natural products are organic because the soil from which natural ingredients are sourced is not necessarily herbicide, pesticide, or fertiliser-free. It is important to note that a 'natural' or 'botanical' label does not necessarily imply that all of the ingredients found in the product are sourced from land and sea, but rather that some are. Chemical additives may be present in 'natural' products. A [ certification label](https://www.ecocert.com/en/certification-detail/natural-and-organic-cosmetics-cosmos) is the only guarantee that a product is natural or organic. That indicates it has had its ingredients and production standards evaluated. (However, just because a product lacks a certification logo does not signify that it is not natural or organic.) 6 natural and organic skincare ingredients 1. Aloe vera Even if the [product is not entirely natural](https://www.schoolofnaturalskincare.com/benefits-of-using-aloe-vera-in-your-natural-skincare-products/), aloe is one of the most widely utilised natural skin care product ingredients, especially for those with sensitive skin.

It effectively hydrates dry skin and protects it from the elements. It's frequently used in the best organic face moisturisers and skincare products such as the [ Lavera Basis Sensitive Organic All-Round Cream](https://thegoodnessproject.co.uk/shop/lavera-basis-sensitive-organic-all-round-cream-150ml).

Jojoba oil The chemical structure of jojoba oil is quite similar to that of human sebum (i.e. the oil or lubrication that our skin produces). It absorbs quickly and effectively as a moisturising and balancing agent for the skin's natural oils without blocking pores. It is also [anti-inflammatory, has antioxidant properties, and is antibacterial.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8102234_Anti-inflammatory_effects_of_jojoba_liquid_wax_in_experimental_models) It is regarded as one of the greatest natural skin care ingredients since it is not only an effective moisturiser for dry and chapped skin, but it is also useful for [healing burns, ulcers, scars, dermatitis, treating acne, psoriasis, and sunburn.](https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(08)03527-6/fulltext) Keep a look out for this one if you wish to revitalise and improve the suppleness of your skin.
