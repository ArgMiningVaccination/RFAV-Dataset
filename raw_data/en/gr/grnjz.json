And All Be Made Well A Healing Blessing by Jan Richardson We bless each other with this healing blessing: That each ill be released from you And each sorrow be shed from you And each pain be made comfort for you And each wound be made whole in you. That joy will arise in you And strength will take hold of you And hope will take wing for you And all be made well. Be not afraid by Bob Dufford, SJ You shall cross the barren desert, but you shall not die of thirst. You shall wander far in safety though you do not know the way. You shall speak your words in foreign lands and all will understand. You shall see the face of God and live. [Refrain] Be not afraid. I go before you always. Come, follow me, and I will give you rest. If you pass through raging waters in the sea, you shall not drown. If you walk amid the burning flames, you shall not be harmed. If you stand before the pow'r of hell and death is at your side, know that I am with you through it all. Blessed are your poor, for the kingdom shall be theirs. Blest are you that weep and mourn, for one day you shall laugh. And if wicked tongues insult and hate you all because of me, blessed, blessed are you! Healing Ceremony Resources O'Connor, M. F.
