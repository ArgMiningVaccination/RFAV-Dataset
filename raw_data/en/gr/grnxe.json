The organization helps entrepreneurs start new companies, works as part of the states economic development team to attract companies to Georgia, helps Georgia communities plan for growth, provides a broad range of assistance to Georgia business and industry in such areas as lean enterprise solutions and energy and environmental management, assists Georgia Tech faculty in commercializing technological innovations and helps industrial companies gain access to innovations developed in the Geor gia Tech research program. There are five major units with the Office of Economic Development and Technology Ventures: Business and Industry Services helps Georgia companies with technology-driven solutions in such areas as energy and environmental management, lean enterprise, and new product development. Commercialization Services focuses on moving technology out of Georgia Tech laboratories and into the mar - ketplace. Entrepreneur Services meets the need of Georgias entrepreneur-based companies, especially technology firms, through business incubation and assistance services. Community Policy and Research Services helps Georgia communities with technology-based research and policy assistance. Strategic Partners connects key local, state and national companies to resources at Geor gia Tech. The Office of Economic Development and Technology Ventures recently implemented a sweeping restructuring of its programs as part of a new initiative designed to address global challenges af fecting state, regional and national econo - mies. The restructuring represents the first major reorganization of Georgia Techs economic development and business assistance programs since the Economic Development Institute (EDI) was formed in 1993. Supporting Georgia Techs goal of defining the technological university of the 21st century, the reorganization will ex - pand the Institutes focus on identifying and transferring key innovations likely to have a dramatic impact on the state, regional and national economies. Plans for the restructuring grew out of consultations with key Geor gia Tech stakehold - ers, findings of the 2005 Georgia Manufacturing Survey - and recommendations from the National Innovation Initiative co-chaired by Georgia Tech President Wayne Clough. Business and Industry Services Business and Industry Services focuses on industrial customers throughout the state of Geor gia. This unit includes the Georgia Tech Regional Office Network, Atlanta-based centers that focus on such productivity improvements such as lean enterprise, energy and environmental management, quality and international standards; and federally-supported programs such as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Georgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center. The Georgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center (GTPAC), which helps Georgia companies win contracts with federal, state and local agencies, reported another record year for fiscal 2005. GTPAC clients won government contracts worth nearly $650 million, a return on the programs investment of more than $1,400 to $1. GTPACs sponsor, the U.S. De - fense Logistics Agency, estimates that the contracts won by Georgia companies either created or saved more than 15,000 Georgia jobs. Working with the U.S. Environmental Protection agency, Georgia Tech environmental specialists collaborated with other state entities to help Bartow County launch a unique unified countywide effort to reduce the environmental impact of both government and industry. The Bartow County Environmental Management System (EMS) is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States, and has been cited by the EPA as \"a model for the nation.\" During FY 2005, Business and Industry Services helped 2,028 companies with productivity and other improvements that brought about operating cost reductions of more than $15.5 million. The assistance helped create or save more than 13,000 jobs. Commercialization Services Commercialization Services focuses on moving technology out of Geor gia Tech laboratories and into the marketplace. Commercialization Services identifies Georgia Tech innovations with potential commercial value and works with faculty to determine the best path to commercializing the technology. GENERAL INFORMATION2005 Georgia Tech Fact Book 26During FY 2005, Commercialization Services graduated its 10th company from Georgia Tech VentureLab, an initiative designed to expand the number of start-up companies based on Geor gia Tech intellectual property. Early-stage compa - nies in VentureLab can receive commercialization grants from the Georgia Research Alliance to support development of prototypes necessary to prove the feasibility of a project. Since its creation in 2001, VentureLab has evaluated more than 300 Georgia Tech innovations, launched 18 companies, and helped those companies attract more than $38 million in equity funding. It works closely with Georgia Techs Office of Technology Licensing. Stephen Fleming, a successful Atlanta investor and entrepreneur has been tapped to head the newly-created Commercial - ization Services group. A Georgia Tech graduate, Fleming has been a partner in two Atlanta based venture capital firms and has managed investments in more than 20 start-up companies. He also holds the title of Chief Commercialization Officer for Georgia Tech. Entrepreneur Services Entrepreneur Services focuses on meeting the needs of entrepreneur -based technology companies around the state. The group includes the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), the Georgia Minority Business Development Center (GMBDC), the Centers of Innovation program operated for the Geor gia Department of Economic Development and the new Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Assistance Program for the State of Georgia, which helps eli - gible companies win federal R&D grants. During FY 2005, Entrepreneur Services celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Advanced Technology Development Cen - ter (ATDC), Georgia Techs science and technology incubator. ATDC, which helps Georgia entrepreneurs launch and build successful companies, graduated its 100th company during an Open House ceremony held in May. The 2005 ATDC graduate companies included CardioMEMS, a biomedical device company that developed an implantable pressure sen - sor based on technology licensed from Georgia Tech. Also during FY 2005, the SBIR Assistance Program for the State of Georgia was created to increase the number of Geor - gia companies winning federal Small Business Innovation Research grants. SBIR grants support research in areas of government need, and technology developed with SBIR funding can be used by companies to create new products. Community Policy and Research Services Community Policy and Research Services brings innovation to local and state government entities while conduct - ing technology-based research and policy projects that help communities plan for the future. The groups best-known services are WebFIT, which helps communities anticipate the results of land-use decisions, and LOCI, which assess the economic impact of development. As Georgia continues to grow, communities must make good decisions regarding land use to ensure that tax revenues can support increased demand for services. A software planning tool known as WebFIT was developed by Georgia Tech to help communities assess the long-term impact of the land-use decisions they are making. The tool has been used in a half-dozen Georgia communities, including the city of Alpharetta and Gwinnett County. During FY 2005, courses offered by Community Policy and Research Services assisted 321 Georgia residents during FY 2005 and attracted 231 attendees from out-of-state. Strategic Partners The newest component of the Office of Economic Development and Technology Ventures, Strategic Partners will work with the other groups to involve industrial partners more closely in the work of Geor gia Tech.

Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective, the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in academic and leadership per - formance and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers four levels of awards. For the students who entered Georgia Tech as freshmen in fall of 2005, the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: and $24,000. To apply for the President's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by October 31 of their senior year. The most qualified applicants in terms of high school grades, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is sent a supplemental application in December and interviewed by a Regional Committee in January. Approximately 100 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.Table 4.8 President's Book 662005 Georgia Tech Fact Book 671. Harvard Univ. 287 2. Univ. of Texas-Austin* 262 3. Yale Univ. 232 4.

This new unit offers the traditional Cooperative Plan of education as well as Undergraduate Professional Internships, and recently was assigned responsibility for the Graduate Co-op Program. The Co-op option has been offered to undergraduates since 1912, and is the fourth oldest program of its kind in the world. It is a five- year, totally optional plan for undergraduates who wish to combine career-related experience with classroom studies. Students who enroll in this program alternate between industrial assignments and classroom studies on a semester basis, taking the same course work on the campus that is completed by regular students. Graduates of the program are awarded a degree in their field with the designation \"Cooperative Plan.\" By completing work assignments abroad and exhibiting proficiency in a foreign language, students may earn the \"International Plan\" designation. The Co-op Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education, and for four consecutive years has been listed as one of the top 10 \"Programs that Work\" by U.S. News & World Report . Students who participate in Co-op have the opportunity to develop career interests, become more confident in their career choices, and develop human relation skills through their work experiences. Since all Co-op positions are paid, students are able to save a portion of their salaries to apply toward educational expenses. Approximately 600 employers participate throughout the U.S. and internationally. With average starting salaries over $13 per hour for students, the aggregate amount earned last year by all co-ops was about $18 million. The Undergraduate Professional Internship (UPI) program had its first students participating in the Spring Semester 2003. This program is geared toward those students who, for some reason could not or did not participate in Co-op, but desire some career-related experience before graduation.

Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. David Braine, the current director of athletics, oversees teams in 17 sports, and also the following departments: the Total Person Pro - gram, compliance, business, development, finance, accounting, ticketing, marketing, sports information, sports medicine and strength and conditioning. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletic program at Tech. The Athletic Association is overseen by the Georgia Tech Athletic Board, chaired by the president of the Institute, Dr. G. Wayne Clough, and composed of eight faculty members, three alumni members, and four student members. Braine follows in the footsteps of four of the most honored men in college athletics: John Heisman, for whom football's Heisman Trophy is named, William Alexander, Bobby Dodd, and Dr. Homer Rice. Since 1904, Tech has had only 11 head football coaches: John Heisman, Bill Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodgers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O'Leary, and the present coach, Chan Gailey. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990, and the Yellow Jackets have the nation's best record in bowl games at 22-11. Other major athletic highlights include NCAA Final Four appearances by the Tech men's basketball team in 2004 and 1990, a NWIT women's basketball title in 1992, two College World Series berths in baseball and 11 top 10 national finishes by the Tech golf program. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history are Grand Slam winner Bobby Jones, Masters champion Larry Mize, British Open champion David Duval as well as Stewart Cink, Matt Kuchar and Bryce Molder Morris, Robert Lavette, Maxie Baughan, Marco Coleman, Shawn Jones and 1999 Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton in football. Tech boasts four recent Olympic gold medal winners in track: Derrick Adkins, Antonio McKay, Derek Mills, and Angelo Taylor. Junior high jumper Chaunte Howard represented the U.S. at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Several current Major League Base - ball stars including Nomar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek, Mark Teixeira and Kevin Brown, standouts, as Kaiser, Rich Yunkus, Mark Stephon Marbury and Matt Harpring in men's basketball. Tech's facilities rank among the finest in college athletics. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, one of America's oldest and most recognized football venues, has undergone an expansion and renovation project that has raised its capacity to 55,000. Tech boasts the new Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium, which seats 4,000 and is one of the nation's finest baseball facilities, as well as the famed Alexander Memorial Coliseum at McDonald's Center, home to the men's and women's basketball programs. Construction is completed on the enclosure and expansion of the on-campus swimming and diving facility that hosted the aquatic events for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games, and will host the 2006 NCAA Mens Swimming and Diving Championships. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Athletic Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, training and weight facilities, and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. The Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance is the home of the Total Person program, the best of its kind in the United States. The Center is comprised of seven sports performance and wellness clinics. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, regarded as one of the finest collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a good citizen.

In partnership with the Office of the President, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) and its subsidiary, Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTARC), the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) provides program development assistance as well as overall contract management for the sponsored research program at Georgia Tech. Organizationally, OSP reports to the Associate Vice Provost for Research who also serves as the General Manager for GTRC and GTARC. The Associate Vice Provost for Research is responsible, in cooperation with Grants and Contracts Accounting, for negotiating facilities and administrative (indirect) cost rates. Also, the Office of the Associate Vice Provost is responsible for the design and maintenance of an interactive automated database which integrates all contract administration functions and is used for management control and reporting. The database is used to produce and distribute a variety of periodic management reports including: a) a monthly listing of all deliverables due the following month, b) a quarterly overdue deliverables report, c) a monthly report of all sponsored activity, and d) a monthly report of cost-sharing commitments. In addition, specialized (ad hoc) reports are prepared on request. Prior to funding, OSP provides assistance that leads to the submission of formal proposals. OSP is responsible for submitting all proposal and grant applications for sponsored research and instruction from GTRC, GTARC and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Contracting officers review proposals and cost estimates for compliance with sponsor requirements and Institute policies, and prepare the business portion of proposals. Contracting officers serve as the sponsor's point of contact for business matters during the evaluation process, negotiate the final terms of the contract or grant, and sign, in conjunction with an officer of GTRC or GTARC, the resulting agreement. After sponsored research projects are funded, OSP has the responsibility for monitoring active grants and contracts. Upon receipt of a signed agreement, an initial in-depth review of the award documents takes place and relevant initiation forms are prepared and distributed. Complete project files are established and maintained for the duration of the program. All post-award project modifications to existing programs are processed by OSP. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and monitoring of subcontracts and consulting agreements issued by Georgia Tech under sponsored programs. Liaison with project sponsors is maintained by OSP Contracting Officers through responses to contractual situations or requests on day-to-day administrative matters. Responsibilities include monitoring programs to see that potential problems in meeting contractual obligations (i.e., assurance of satisfactory performance, submission of all deliverables, etc.) are called to the attention of Georgia Tech management in a timely manner. OSP is responsible for all contractual closeout actions, i.e., submission of final billing and research property and patent reports, accounting for the disposition of classified documents, and verification that deliverable requirements have been satisfied. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and administration of Small Business Administration (SBA) subcontracting plans. Research Administration, Communications, Training, and Technologies (ReACTT) within OSP provides a multitude of services internally to OSP as well as to the entire Institute. ReACTT furnishes specialized educational, informational, and technological support to research administrators and faculty. Workshops are offered on a variety of topics of interest to research faculty and administrators. ReACTT is the focal point for electronic research administration at Georgia Tech. ReACTT researches the literature and electronic sources and publicizes announcements of funding opportunities, orders and/or electronically downloads Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and other solicitations, and distributes them to the campus. ReACTT also assists individual researchers in program development activities through database searches, and obtaining guidelines, application forms, etc. A newsletter, Research News , is published monthly by this division; it is also posted to the internet. ReACTT has access to several databases and assists with individualized searches for funding opportunities and sponsor information. These databases have also been made accessible through the OSP Internet homepage at http://www.osp.gatech.edu . ReACTT administers the Community of Science (COS) program at Georgia Tech and assists researchers in maintaining their COS profiles and in using the COS database. ReACTT helps researchers with electronic submission of proposals via FastLane and other systems. ReACTT distributes all proposals and deliverable reports and serves as the filing center for project files and progress reports, pending receipt of final reports, and subsequent submission to the Archives section of the Georgia Tech Library. 2005 Georgia Tech Fact Book 1322005 Georgia Tech Fact Book 133RESEARCH Support Amount Table 8.6 GTRC Sponsored Research Contracting Operations, Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005Revenue 2004 2005 Source: GTRC Associate Vice Provost and General ManagerFounded in 1937, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) is a state chartered not-for-profit corporation serving Georgia Tech as a University System of Georgia approved cooperative organization.
