Our work in student health goes far beyond simply providing clinical services. We are specialists in the health and wellness needs of the college population. We are committed to social justice and ethical practice, including the stewardship of our resources and our daily commitment to provide the best possible care. We seek to apply best practices and the most current knowledge and research in the field, to building safe and supportive learning environments, and to assist students in reaching their highest potential. We remain committed to one goal: student success. This past year has been one of exceptional change and transition. The role of Executive Director is new to SHS and reflects an intentional and strategic shift to better align our work with campus partners, as well as the university's mission. This role enables SHS to be responsive to changes in the external environment, including the rising cost of higher education combined with significant changes in the health care system. We now have a new OSU Board of Trustees, a new Vice Provost for Student Affairs, and new leadership within Counseling and Psychological Services and the Department of Recreational Sports, our key partners in health and wellness. These changes are positive as they open new opportunities for innovation, yet they also illuminate the importance of strategic planning and assessment to ensure accountability. There is much to be excited about for the year ahead. This fall we opened our same-day medical clinic at the new Tebeau Residence Hall, adding a highly convenient option for medical care on campus. We are pursuing even stronger alliances with CAPS, Rec Sports and Healthy Campus Initiatives with the goal of realizing our collective vision of a center for health and well-being at OSU. We are working to expand insurance billing, and we now offer a more affordable insurance plan for domestic students. We remain committed to meeting the needs of international students, and fostering relationships with the broader public health community in the development of infectious disease protocols and disaster planning. We now have mandatory substance abuse and sexual assault programming instituted for all first-year students, and a rapidly growing recovery community. Health Promotion staff and graduate students continue to provide high-quality sexual health education, fitness and nutrition support, health coaching and general wellness promotion and support campus-wide. Recalling the words of our esteemed former Vice Provost, Dr. Larry Roper, I know that our best work is still ahead of us. I look to the future of college health with great optimism, particularly now that we will be moving forward as a dynamic alliance. I wish everyone within the OSU campus community a safe, healthy and productive year ahead. Jenny Haubenreiser, Executive Director Student Health Services 4 OSU Student Health ServicesSuccesses and Contributions to the Mission of OSU MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTSPatient Numbers on the Rise: The number of patient encounters at Student Health (all providers) during 2013-2014 increased from 41,839 in 2012-2013 to 42,684. This follows the trend of the previous two years. To help accommodate more students, planning began for the launch of Student Health Services - Tebeau Hall Same-Day Clinic, to open Fall Term 2014. This minor-care clinic, attached to the newest campus residence hall, will expand access to medical services outside of the main Student Health Center in the Plageman Building. Two additional advanced care practitioners were approved to help accommodate expanded services through the Tebeau clinic. Helping Students with Complex Issues: The ACCESS (Advocates for Continuity of Care for Empowering Successful Students) program provides medical and pharmaceutical support to students with complex medical, mental health, academic, and/or financial issues. This past year SHS nurses cared for 32 students through this program. Student Health Services clinicians recognize that an increasing number of students may be having more complex medical, social and mental health issues. Additional students are dealing with chronic health problems that require more in-depth and consistent care and follow up. Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners: A third nurse was trained as a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE). These medical professionals care for students seeking help at SHS after a sexual assault. The nurses ensure confidentiality, conduct an exam if desired, and provide resources and follow-up for the student. This past year 29 students sought care as a result of sexual assault. SANE nurses also serve as advisors to OSU's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Alliance. Collegiate Recovery Community: The Collegiate Recovery Community provides a supportive community to OSU students in recovery. A permanent home for the CRC Clubhouse has been established in McNary Hall. The space is now used regularly by student members and boasts two computers, a printer, a pool table and an entertainment system. All CRC members have 24/7 access to this space. More than 16 students have participated in the CRC since the start of Fall Term 2013, and the CRC is actively recruiting and providing outreach to community colleges to support students in recovery. In addition to providing safe, substance-free living and meeting areas for students in recovery, the CRC has provided a community of support for more than 44 members of the OSU community through weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings. Expanded Laboratory Services: The SHS lab acquired new equipment this past year that has enabled more in-house testing, thereby lowering costs to students and shortening the time to receive results. This also benefits the OSU Athletic Department by providing space after hours for athletics physicals and lab work for NCAA-required tests. Outreach to Veterans: Student Health's military/veterans workgroup continued to work with the campus veteran coordinator to ensure the success of students who are military veterans, including active duty, National Guard, reservist and/or family members of these groups. In the spring of 2014, this group met with Veterans Administration personnel from Portland to explore ways to improve OSU military and veterans' access to health care through the VA. TB Screening: The SHS immunizations team continued immunization and tuberculosis screening for international and INTO OSU students. The TB screening is conducted monthly in combination with immunization clinics at the International Living Learning Center (ILLC). SHS staff provides direct access to required immunizations at the ILLC, thus removing any barriers to institutional compliance. A total of 684 required measles/mumps/rubella immunizations were provided for incoming students, and 1,264 T-Spots were administered. 5 Annual Report 2013-2014Successes and Contributions to the Mission of OSU Flu Shot Clinics: Student Health Services staff strives to keep OSU free from illness. During Fall Term 2013, the SHS team conducted influenza vaccine clinics at the Memorial Union, Kelley Engineering Center, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the Valley Library. Flu shots and nasal-spray vaccine were also available at the health center with no appointment needed. Throughout the flu season, SHS nurses and medical assistants administered a total of 2,485 flu vaccinations to students, faculty and staff. IMPACT: Nearly 440 students were served through the IMPACT substance abuse early intervention program (adjudicated). More than 4,500 students received education and outreach for alcohol and drug prevention, including Greek organizations and athletic teams. Tobacco Cessation: While this year's usage was lower than last year (227 appointments in 2013- 2014, compared to 394 appointments in 2012-2013), the tobacco cessation program continues to be an essential and highly utilized program for OSU students, contributing to live-long disease prevention. In total, $8,000 was provided by a PacificSource grant to supply free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products for students, as an incentive and to help them quit. COLLABORATION Executive Director Hired: Student Health Services hired Jenny Haubenreiser as the new executive director, to replace the outgoing medical director. This position will function to enhance campus and community collaboration and the integration of health services among other units within Student Affairs. The executive director began regular working sessions with the directors of Counseling and Psychological Services, the Department of Recreational Sports, and Healthy Campus Initiatives, with the collective goal of reinvigorating the Health and Wellness Alignment. This has set the stage for strengthened collaboration in the coming year. Campus Committee Leadership: The SHS associate directors of medical services and clinical services provide leadership on the Student Care Team and the Infection Control Committee, respectively. ADHD/ADD Services: SHS clinicians, in collaboration with colleagues from Counseling and Psychological Services, Disability Access Services, and the Academic Success Center, teamed with community psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to provide guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD/ADD. An extensive section was added to the SHS website that explains the processes and provides education for students and families. COMMUNICATION AND MARKETINGWebsite Moves to Responsive Design: During Winter Term 2014, the SHS website migrated to the newest OSU Drupal theme, Doug Fir. Built with a responsive layout, this theme displays well on smartphones and tablets, as well as laptops and desktops without the expense of building a separate custom mobile site. This upgrade allows students to access online health and wellness services and information via any mobile device. Improving Communication with International Students: To improve communication with OSU international students, two new handouts were created for this audience, taking into consideration lower levels of English proficiency. Handouts entitled \"About Health Insurance\" and \"Travel Tips for International Students\" were mirrored on the SHS website. Related to this work, the language levels were modified on SHS web pages that are directed toward incoming and enrolled international students.6 OSU Student Health ServicesSuccesses and Contributions to the Mission of OSU RECOGNITION \u00bb AAAHC Accreditation: The SHS clinic was given a three-year accreditation in October 2013; the next accreditation review is scheduled for 2016. \u00bb COLA Accreditation: The SHS laboratory received a two-year accreditation in August 2013. \u00bb Emilie Goodling, Medical Assistant, was recognized with an \"Outstanding Service Award\" by OSU's Division of Student Affairs. \u00bb Colleen Schlonga, Marketing Coordinator, was honored with fellow members of the Student Affairs Communications Group with the \"Collaborative Group Award\" by OSU's Division of Student Affairs. \u00bb Pat Ketcham, PhD, CHES, Associate Director of Health Promotion, served as President of the American College Health Association (ACHA) for 2013-2014. \u00bb Linda Reid, RN, Associate Director of Nursing Services, served as Chair of the Nursing Section of ACHA for 2013-2014. \u00bb Jenny Haubenreiser, Executive Director, was Immediate Past President for ACHA. \u00bb Chip Colby, Associate Director of Information Services, acted as a key reviewer for the 2014 Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) industry conference.
