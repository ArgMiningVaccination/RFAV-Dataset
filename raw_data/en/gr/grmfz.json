Watch Ivy explain why she chose to get vaccinated. Common Myths MYTH: The vaccine was developed so fast, it probably isn't safe. Studies found that the two initial vaccines are both about 95% effective \u2014 and reported no serious or life-threatening side effects. A vaccine being developed in less than 1 year is an amazing feat. The speed might make some nervous, but these vaccines went through the same tests as similar vaccines. The global medical and research communities as well as governments worked together to develop and get the vaccine into production and to the people in record time due to the health risks that COVID-19 presents to the global population. MYTH: The side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine are dangerous. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines can have side effects, but the vast majority are very short term \u2014 not serious or dangerous. The vaccine developers report that some people experience pain where they were injected; body aches; headaches or fever, lasting for a day or two. These are signs that the vaccine is working to stimulate your immune system. If symptoms persist beyond two days, you should call your doctor. If you have allergies \u2014 especially severe ones that require you to carry an EpiPen \u2014 discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with your doctor, who can assess your risk and provide more information about if and how you can get vaccinated safely.
