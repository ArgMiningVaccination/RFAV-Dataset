Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters thebody through cuts or wounds. DIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leadsto death in up to 2 out of 10 cases. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink,or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), brain damage, and death. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will beprotected throughout childhood. Many more childrenwould get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating. DTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longer used in the United States. Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderatelyor severely ill should usually wait until they recoverbefore getting DTaP vaccine. Any child who had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not getanother dose. Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP shouldnot get another dose. Talk with your doctor if your child: - had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP, - had a fever over 105 oF after a dose of DTaP. Ask your health care provider for more information. Some of these children should not get another doseof pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine withoutpertussis, called DT. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages: 33333 2 months 3 3 3 3 3 4 months 33333 6 months 3 3 3 3 3 15-18 months 3 3 3 3 3 4-6 years DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines.W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or shouldwait3 Who should get DTaPvaccine and when?21 Why get vaccinated? 4 Older children and adults DTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, orchildren 7 years of age and older. But older people still need protection. A vaccine called Tdap is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It isrecommended every 10 years. There are separateVaccine Information Statements for these vaccines. Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis 5/17/2007In the rare event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine, a federal program has been createdto help pay for the care of those who have been harmed. For details about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1-800-338-2382 or visit the program's website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. Ask your health care provider. They can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources ofinformation. Call your local or state health department's immunization program. Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO) - Visit the National Immunization Program's website at www.cdc.gov/nip U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and PreventionGetting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease ismuch riskier than getting DTaP vaccine. However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergicreactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small. Mild Problems (Common) Fever (up to about 1 child in 4) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5thdoses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses.Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine isfollowed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in whichthe shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1child in 30).Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot. Moderate Problems (Uncommon) Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, over 105 oF (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include:- Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage.These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are causedby the vaccine. Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is alsoimportant if another family member has had seizures.You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child anaspirin-free pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the packageinstructions.What should I look for? Any unusual conditions, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever or unusual behavior. Serious allergic reactionsare extremely rare with any vaccine. If one were to occur,it would most likely be within a few minutes to a fewhours after the shot. Signs can include difficulty breathing,hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fastheart beat or dizziness. If a high fever or seizure were tooccur, it would usually be within a week after the shot. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967 .
