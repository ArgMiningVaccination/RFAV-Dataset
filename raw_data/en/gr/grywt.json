UC IRVINE - 1990-1991INTRODUCTION TO UCI The University of California David Pierpont Gardner President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influenced by leading edu\u00ad cators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medicine, as well as professional schools of business administration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States; the collections of the more than 100 University of California libraries on the nine campuses are surpassed in size on the American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. The University is one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements. On its nine cam\u00ad puses, the University has a total of 19 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Science membership on all campuses numbers 238, greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 loca\u00ad tions throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban populations, and a broad program of continuing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, the Univer\u00ad sity operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Law\u00ad rence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of Califor\u00ad nia campuses during the academic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 359. University Administration. Under the State Constitution, gover\u00ad nance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the Uni\u00ad versity as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 20 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an advisory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. The chair and vice chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the Board and participate fully in all discus\u00ad sions. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organization and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and busi\u00ad ness affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 358. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain adminis\u00ad trative officers, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, authorizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the University administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policy making at both the campus and Universitywide levels. The Irvine Campus Jack W. Peltason Chancellor The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and I ,600 students. In its first quarter-century, UCI has attained national and international distinction in its programs and faculty. The campus challenges its students both academi\u00ad cally and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of its faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. UCI is committed to the pursuit and transmission of knowledge. It makes available to its 16,150 students (13,150 undergraduate, 1,870 graduate, and 1,130 medical students and residents) oppor\u00ad tunities for gaining knowledge, training, skills, and credentials which in turn can provide the basis for enhanced social and eco\u00ad nomic opportunities. With regard to making these opportunities available to all students, UCI takes very seriously its responsibil\u00ad ity to establish and implement programs that go beyond legal minimums to ensure that all qualified segments of the public have access and equal opportunity to participate in its academic programs. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Irvine Campus 5 Chancellor The 1990-91 academic year marks UCI's Twenty-Fifth Anniversary. Twenty-five years is not such a long time. At the age of 25, many young people have just begun their profes\u00ad sional lives. If they have chosen to pursue graduate degrees, they may still be involved in the class\u00ad room education that will serve them in their later careers. When I think of the first 25 years in the life of an individ\u00ad ual or institution-those early years of inquiry and growth- I marvel at what our campus has been able to accomplish. Our classrooms and laboratories opened to our first 1,589 students on October 4, 1965. That year, private and federal support for research and scholarships totaled $1.3 million. Now, more than 16,000 students attend UCI, provided with a vast array of opportunities for educational, cultural, and social development. The extramural support for research, scholarships, and the many other programs that make a campus a community has reached more than $100 million. The tremendous achievements and growth of this campus have been the result of the individual efforts of every stu\u00ad dent, professor, and staff member. And these extraor\u00ad dinary efforts in turn were made possible through the vision of founding UCI Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich, Jr. Together with founding architect William Pereira, Dan did not just build a campus, he gave it its spirit of innovation and excellence. Our Twenty-Fifth Anniversary is an occasion for us to take pride in what we have accomplished and to set our agenda for the future. Our mission is quite simple, really, and it is the same one that Dan set for us 25 years ago: to build a center of learning to serve all people. This is a noble charge, and one that is a privilege to serve. UC IRVINE - 1990-19916 The Irvine Campus UCI's education and research missions are fulfilled in its schools, departments, programs, and formal research units. Schools and professional and interdisciplinary units are described briefly below. Formal research unit descriptions are found in the Research and Graduate Studies section. The School of Biological Sciences is the campus' second largest academic unit, with 3,270 students (3,120 undergraduate and 150 graduate). Faculty research areas include neural plasticity and behavior (which in part encompasses the development of the ner\u00ad vous system, memory, response to injury, and degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's); the nature of cell-cell interactions; pattern formation; the elucidation of ecological conditions and evolutionary histories that have been the driving forces in organism design and functional diversity; the organization and \"expression of genes; biomolecular structure; molecular patho\u00ad genesis; and cell biology. The School of Engineering focuses on biochemical engineering, earthquake engineering, structural analysis and mechanics, struc\u00ad tural reliability, parallel and distributed computer systems, opto\u00ad electronics devices and materials, intelligent systems and neural networks, high-speed image/signal processing, combustion and jet propulsion, transportation, geotechnical engineering, water resources and environmental engineering, dynamic systems, and heat transfer. The School has I ,290 students, of which 990 are undergraduate and 300 are graduate students. The School of Fine Arts teaches the creative as well as the aca\u00ad demic and critical sides of the arts. It is concerned with the vital\u00ad ity of the arts in society. Faculty energies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of students' artistic and creative talents and toward the development of the students' understanding of related theory and history. The School offers \u00b7programs which emphasize extensive studio and workshop expe\u00ad riences, essential theoretical and historical background studies, and exercises in criticism. There are 760 students in the School of Fine Arts, 640 undergraduate and 120 graduate. Faculty in the Graduate School of Management are involved in studies of organizational behavior, management information sys\u00ad tems, finance, marketing, real estate, managerial economics, accounting, decision sciences, operations management, strategy, public policy, and health care management. The School has 360 students in its graduate program leading to the M.B.A. and Ph.D. degrees, and 200 students in its program leading to an undergraduate minor in Management. In addition, the School's Executive M.B.A. Program, established in 1985, has 120 students. The School of Humanities includes special areas such as literary theory, Southern history, the philosophy of science, gender stu\u00ad dies, and American literature. It houses the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, the unique computerized databank of all exist\u00ad ing Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to A.D. 1453. The School has I ,630 students, including I ,300 undergraduate and 330 graduate. The Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) is dedicated to research and education in the rapidly expanding fields of information management and use, and the technologies that support those fields. A major focus of ICS is the field of computer science, which covers computer system architecture and design, mathematical aspects of computation, software design .and development, and artificial intelligence. ICS is building new programs in the applications of information technology, including computing and communications systems, to many aspects of modern life. ICS is a national leader in research into the social and economic aspects of the emerging global information society. The Department has 680 students (570 undergraduate and 110 graduate). The School of Physical Sciences has a student body of I, 160 (890 undergraduate and 270 graduate). Researchers in the School are conducting investigations in atmospheric chemistry (including the discovery of the adverse impact of manmade chlorofluorocarbon compounds on the earth's ozone layer), biogeochemistry and climate, synthetic chemistry, laser spectroscopy, elementary parti\u00ad cle physics (including the discoveries of a new subatomic par\u00ad ticle-the neutrino-and a rare subatomic event-the double beta decay), plasma physics, and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The Program in Social Ecology, which was established in 1970, is unique to UCI. It is a multidisciplinary unit that focuses on environmental and societal influences on human behavior and health. The Program's central objectives are the application of scientific methods to the analysis and resolution of societal prob\u00ad lems and the development of theory and knowledge pertinent to environmental and social phenomena. Research and teaching span the fields of urban planning, urban sociology, ergonomics, public health, human development, environmental and health psychology, demography, criminology, and law. There are 1,120 students participating in the Program (including 1,030 under\u00ad graduate and 90 graduate). The School of Social Sciences, with 3,250 undergraduate students and 160 graduate students, is the largest academic unit at UCI. The faculty's expertise covers a wide range of specific social sci\u00ad ence topics, several of which are nationally recognized: the mathematical modeling of perception and cognitive processes; the economic analysis of transportation; the examination of the impact of society's political system on its economy and vice versa; the study of social structure and values in different cultures through a formal-scientifi~ methodology; and the exploration of authority structures and inequality in society. UCI's Office of Teacher Education, with 190 students, offers nine credential programs for teachers and administrators in Califor\u00ad nia's public elementary and secondary schools. It focuses on teachers' use of computers in high school classrooms, the teach\u00ad ing of writing, and the preveption of abuse of alcohol and other drugs among school children. It has the largest credential pro\u00ad gram within the University of California system, and it is recog\u00ad nized throughout California for its leadership in the development of innovative programs to improve education. in grades K.-!2. The UCI College of Medicine has I ,130 students (380 medical, 610 resident-physicians and fellows, and 140 graduate). It offers one of the country's largest residency training programs in prim\u00ad ary care and internal medicine and houses some of the most advanced equipment in medical imaging and laser medicine available in the world (including a positron emission tomography scanner and an ultrasound microscope, which is one of only two such machines in the U.S. and the only one used in biomedical research). The College's faculty conduct innovative research in the following areas of emphasis: bioethics, biomolecular struc\u00ad ture, oncology, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, geriatric medicine, immunology, molecular and human genetics, the neurosciences, and perinatology. Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a founda\u00ad tion on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellectual identity and lifelong learning. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is .the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involve\u00ad ment in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts produc\u00ad tions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UCI provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of humanity, and to the development of new knowl\u00ad edge through basic and applied research. Along with these objec\u00ad tives, UCI has a serious commitment to public service. The cam\u00ad pus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic understanding of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on fundamental areas of knowledge, and at the same time provide for interdisci\u00ad plinaTy and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and professional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The UCI College of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Athletics and Physical Education. The Office of Academic Affairs has responsibility for all pro\u00ad grams of instruction and research. It, as well as the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and the Office of Undergraduate Studies, report directly to the Executive Vice Chancellor. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the University of California. The Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Affairs provides stu- . dents with a range of services and programs designed to create an environment which is supportive of an educational endeavor of the highest quality. Student Affairs programs and services offer students the opportunity to supplement their formal educational experience by becoming involved in diverse aspects of the Univer\u00ad sity including social, cultural, recreational, and leadership oppor\u00ad tunities. Such programs and services can broaden the student's University experience by providing opportunities for personal development in addition to intellectual growth. The Office also is responsible for developing a comprehensive community services program that provides opportunities for students to devote time to community services projects. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies provides leadership in developing policies and programs which serve the academic needs of the undergraduate student population and affect the retention of students, including underrepresented and culturally diverse student populations. Undergraduate Studies provides administra\u00ad tive oversight for undergraduate academically related concerns which require campus-level attention and coordination and which do not come under the direct authority of the heads of academic units or the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The following programs and services are administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies: (I) the Program of The Irvine Campus 7 Academic Support Services (PASS), which coordinates the Learn\u00ad ing Skills Center, Student Academic Advancement Services, the Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office, and the Tutorial Assistance Program; (2) the Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program; (3) General Programs, which includes responsibility for the coordination of general assignment classrooms, the enhancement of campus advising with special responsibility for the advising of unaffiliated students (undeclared majors), the Peer Academic Advising Program, and the Student Recommended Faculty .Program; (4) the Campuswide Honors Program; and (5) Instructional Development Services, which supports the improvement of teaching and innovation in learning within the UCI community. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has general administrative responsibility for graduate education and research. In the area of research, the Vice Chancellor is responsible for research policy development, implementation, and oversight. In graduate education, the Dean of Graduate Studies serves as the academic dean for all graduate students and is responsible for admissions, enrolled student services, graduate student support, and the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minorities (includ\u00ad ing women in designated fields) traditionally underrepresented in graduate education. Accreditation UCI is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Col\u00ad leges (WASC). The campus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in accord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemis\u00ad try is accredited by the American Chemical Society; the under\u00ad graduate programs offered by the Civil, Electrical, and Mechani\u00ad cal Engineering Departments are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engi\u00ad neering and Technology; the M.D. program of the UCI College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Asso\u00ad ciation of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association; the Department of Drama is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre; the Graduate School of Management is accredited by the American Assembly of Col\u00ad legiate Schools of Business; arid the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Education are approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, maintains a chapter at UCI. Phi Beta Kappa is the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor society; it recognizes outstanding scholastic achievement in the liberal arts and sciences. Upper-division students whose under\u00ad graduate records fulfill certain requirements are eligible for elec\u00ad tion to membership. Further information can be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, 256 Adminis\u00ad tration Building. UC IRVINE - 1990-19918 The Irvine Campus Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity The UCI Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity develops and supports programs which promote affirmative action and equal opportunity in University employment, services, and education for qualified minorities, women, handicapped per\u00ad sons, and Vietnam Era U.S. veterans. Additionally, the Office implements systems and procedures designed to facilitate com\u00ad pliance with Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Educational Amendments to the Act. The Office is responsible for assuring fair and equal treatment in University admissions policies, educational programs and activi\u00ad ties, and in both undergraduate and graduate student affirmative action programs. The Office also assists in the coordination of student affirmative action plans. The Office is located in 524 Administration Building; telephone (714) 856-5594. Office of the Assistant Vice Chancellor\u00ad University Ombudsman The Assistant Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman is avail\u00ad able to assist students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the University with problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI. Problems related to student conduct and discipline however, are under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Dean of Students (see page 360). The Assistant Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman responds to concerns presented by campus individuals and group members by clarifying issues or concerns; making appropriate on\u00ad and off-campus referrals for student, faculty, and staff members; and providing a confidential, impartial, and informal setting for grievance and problem resolution. The Office of the Assistant Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman is located in 255 Admin\u00ad istration Building; telephone (714) 856-7256. The Campus Setting UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in I ,482 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multi\u00ad national business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, the campus remains an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adjacent to the campus lies the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, part of the University's land preserve system and home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 33- acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the UCI College of Medicine. UCI is adjacent to University Town Center, a commercial center which is linked to the campus by a pedestrian bridge. Town Cen\u00ad ter facilities include a movie theatre complex, restaurants, apart\u00ad ments, a post office, a video/record store, a stereo store, a one\u00ad hour photographic service, a copy service, clothing stores, an art gallery, a dispensing optician, gift shops, various types of eating places, and a comedy nightclub. In addition, the Town Center is anchored by a 10-story office building which houses private busi\u00ad ness enterprises as well as several University administrative offices. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of world-renowned boutiques; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering cuisines from a variety of other coun\u00ad tries; and major hotels. Cultural opportunities include repertory theatres, orchestras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional charac\u00ad ter as a beach resort. The Portuguese dory fishing fleet at New\u00ad port, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morning and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and artisan crowd at Laguna Beach during the summer and winter festivals. The temperate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water-oriented activities such as windsurfing, sailing, and tide\u00ad pooling. The spring, summer, fall, and winter find students, many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Balboa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach-enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boating enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-or 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, available from the UCI Sailing Club. Access to large, offshore racing boats also is occasionally available from the Sailing Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Coop\u00ad erative Outdoor Program provides low-cost rental equipment for hiking and skiing, and instruction for other recreational pursuits.

Office of Academic Computing Computing at UCI is distinguished by the campus' commitment since its founding to make computing an integral part of the undergraduate- and graduate-level academic programs. Almost half of UCI's students are involved with some form of instruc\u00ad tional computing every year. The campus data communications network currently supports more than 2,000 campus connections on an optical fiber backbone and provides access to national and international networks, including BITNET, the Internet, and NSF net. UCI is a founding member of the California Education and Research Federation Network (CERFnet). These\" networks connect over 40 of the leading research centers in California to computing resources across the United States. The Office of Academic Computing (OAC) has a twofold mis\u00ad sion. First, OAC supports academic departments who run their own instructional and research computing laboratories by provid\u00ad ing consulting and operational services. Second, OAC provides central campus resources for computing by operating the campus data communications network, running instructional laboratories which may be used by all departments, and providing computing time on a variety of computers. OAC consists of three departments: Advanced Scientific Com\u00ad puting, Network and Telecommunications Services, and Aca\u00ad demic Computing Services. OAC is a central campus resource for students, faculty, and staff that provides access to a wide range of computer systems and software and a variety of educational, con\u00ad sulting, and technical services. The campuswide data communica\u00ad tions network is used to access campus computing systems and connections with external networks which provide campus access to off-campus computing systems, including those at national supercomputer centers. \u00b7 To help meet campus needs for advanced scientific computing capabilities, OAC operates a Convex C240 with one gigabyte of memory and over 10 gigabytes of disk. The FORTRAN and C compilers on this system take full advantage of the special vector processing capabilities of each of its four processors. The numeri\u00ad cal libraries and application packages available on this system have been chosen to help faculty fully exploit its capabilities in a wide range of disciplines. Complementing the CONVEX system, OAC operates and supports smaller systems and workstations for scientific computation and visualization. Most notable of these are \"graphics supercomputer workstations\" from Stardent. Other computing services are provided on a multiprocessor Sequent Symmetry running the UNIX operating system, a Digital VAX Cluster consisting of a VAX 11/785, a 6310, and an 8350 running VMS, Sun Microsystems workstations, and personal computers from IBM, AT&T, and Apple. Software offerings include a wide variety of applications packages used in statistics, graphics, text formatting, test scoring, financial modeling, com\u00ad puter assisted design (CAD/CAM), and data base management. An electronic mail system also is available, as are packages for micro-to-host communications.

Among the day's events are the Wayzgoose Medieval Fair, UCI Medical Plaza and College of Medicine Health Fair, and a variety of special programs for prospective students and their parents. Other features of the day include music, food and game booths, jugglers, and mimes, as well as tours, lectures, and pre\u00ad sentations. Information on admissions, housing, and financial aid, guided tram tours of the campus, and natural history tours of the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh also are available. For additional information, dates, and times, telephone the Student Activities Office, (714) 856-5181. University Program for High School Scholars The University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) is a special opportunity offered to highly prepared and gifted students. by UCI. High school seniors, and occasionally, juniors, have the opportunity to expand their education by enrolling concurrently at UCI in order to pursue academic interests beyond those avail\u00ad able at their high schools. UPHSS enables participants to sample How to Use the Catalogue 15 UCI's nationally acknowledged academic resources, to partici\u00ad pate in University life, and to interact with outstanding UCI faculty and students without disrupting high school academic and social involvements. UPHSS is particularly valuable for talented young people who are intellectually ready for university-level work, who have eagerly and successfully completed the \"college\u00ad prep\" courses offered by their high school, and who are looking for new academic challenges. UCI makes every effort to encour\u00ad age and facilitate the participation of qualified students from all ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Additional information is available on page 40 and from the UPHSS coordinator, tele\u00ad phone (714) 856-4543. How to Use the Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, descriptions of schools and departments and their curricula, and descriptions of student activities and services. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a publication avail\u00ad able from the Registrar's Office shortly before registration begins each quarter, provides more current information on classes to be offered, instructors, how to enroll, enrollment restrictions (for example, open to majors only, or consent of instructor required), class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. Admission to UCI does not gua\u00ad rantee enrollment in any particular course. Please refer to Major Campus Publications, page 61. Presentation of information in the UCI General Catalogue is divided into five main concepts (details are found in the Table of Contents): 1. Introduction to UCI 2. Preadmission Matters 3. I~formation for Admitted Students 4. Information on the Office of Research and Graduate Studies 5. Schools and Programs: Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on five fundamental areas of knowledge, while at the same time providing for interdisciplinary and professional study. In the Catalogue, the five basic Schools are presented first: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdiscipli\u00ad nary and professional studies are presented next: Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engineering, Man\u00ad agement, Medicine, and Teacher Education. The program in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics is presented last. Included in the academic unit descriptions are the following kinds of information: a. Brief descriptions of the areas that are covered in each school or program and a brief statement of the educational philosophy and orientation of the unit. b. Lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their areas of academic interest. c. Requirements for undergraduate and graduate degrees, including those for majors and minors. UC IRVINE - 1990-199116 Preparing for University Work d. Additional areas of study (referred to as concentrations, specializations, emphases, tracks, modules, or options). e. Advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each school or program. f. Courses offered, divided into undergraduate and graduate course listings; those units that are departmentalized present their courses according to the department. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and \"upper refers to cour~es numbered 100-199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate or professional courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior-senior courses. However, jun\u00ad ior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a prerequisite and when any academic or other prerequisites have been met. Prereq\u00ad uisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no pre\u00ad requisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) nor\u00ad mally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. The letter H preceding a course number usually desig\u00ad nates an honors course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indi\u00ad cates the unit credits toward the minimum of 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each \"4\" represents four quarter units. Some courses give other than four units of credit; for example, two, five, or a range of from one to 12 units can be granted. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indicate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word \"Summer\" appears if the course is offered in Summer Session of the academic year covered by this issue of the UCI General Catalogue. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation \"(4) F, W, S\" indicates a single course offered that can be taken only once for credit; a \"(4-4-4) F, W, S\" designation indicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the course description (see pages 55-57). Courses which have been approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement are not designated in this Catalogue. How\u00ad ever, they are designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes with a W following the course number. Students should refer to the Schedule of Classes for a complete listing of approved upper\u00ad division courses. Preparing for University Work A carefully planned program of high school courses provides students with the best preparation for University work, as it establishes a solid basis for undergraduate studies, gives more options for later study, and provides opportunities for more spe\u00ad cialized preparation for a chosen field of study. Students need to master certain basic subjects and skills before entering the Uni\u00ad versity so as to increase the likelihood of doing well in University courses. Students may also wish to consider gaining additional preparation at a community college and applying to enter the University as a transfer applicant. Students who lack basic high school subjects in English composition and mathematics must complete these courses prior to transfer (see page 48). Students planning to enter the University must complete the high school courses required for admission (the \"a through r\u00b7 require\u00ad ments, see page 38). Careful thought should be given to adequate preparation in the basic skills of reading, writing, and mathe\u00ad matics described in detail below. In addition, consideration should be given to deciding on a general field of study that might be pursued at the University, so that related college-preparatory elective courses can be taken in high school. A high--school coun\u00ad selor or teacher can help select the appropriate courses. The \"a through f' requirements for admission to the University of California are minimum entrance standards. Completing the required high school courses with satisfactory grades will not by itself prepare students for freshman work in every subject, much less in a major or program of study. Many entering students dis\u00ad cover that they are not adequately prepared for basic University courses, such as English composition or calculus, which they are expected to take in their freshman year. Also, many undergradu\u00ad ate majors, particularly those in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics, require more high school preparation than that necessary for admission to the University. A lack of preparation can cause problems for students who do not choose a major until after they enter the University, or for those who prepare for one major but later decide to change to another. For these reasons, students should take courses that will prepare them beyond minimum levels of competence both in subject mat\u00ad ter content and in general academic skills. This often means selecting the most challenging courses in the basic subjects that are offered in high school. Such courses may be part of an honors. program or may be regular courses taught at a challenging level. A good preparation for University work includes English every semester in high school; three to four years of mathematics, including a course in the senior year; three to four years of for\u00ad eign language; two to three years of laboratory science with con\u00ad tent from biology, chemistry, and physics; two or more years of history and social studies; and one or more courses in fine arts (visual or performing). It is important to appreciate that good study skills and study hab\u00ad its are essential for doing well at the University. These are deve\u00ad loped in the more advanced courses in high school that encour\u00ad age independent, out-of-class work using library and other resources. University courses often assume that background material is fresh in the student's mind and thoroughly mastered. It is expected that students know how to read a textbook effec\u00ad tively, how to seek help from other books, how to take notes from books or lectures, how to edit and revise a paper, and how to plan a realistic study schedule. It is especially important to take a full academic load during the senior year to be ready for the challenge of University work. Advanced honors-level or advanced placement courses for which students have prerequisites are strongly recommended. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Preparing for University Work 17 Informal performances at favorite campus gathering spots encourage students to hone their skills in front of an audience. Reading Many students are not prepared for either the kinds or amounts of reading demanded of freshmen at the University. Each student should become proficient in reading and understanding technical materials and scholarly works and should Jearn to read analyti\u00ad cally and critically, actively questioning the author's intentions, viewpoint, arguments, and conclusions. Students also should become familiar and comfortable with the conventions\u00b7 of stan\u00ad dard written English and with various writing strategies and techniques. Reading experience should include original works in their entirety, not just textbooks and anthologies, and should encompass a wide variety of forms and topics. Writing Effective critical thinking and proficiency with the written lan\u00ad guage are closely related, and both are skills which every Univer\u00ad sity student must master. By University standards, a student who is proficient in English composition is able to (a) understand the assigned topic; (b) select and develop a theme by argument and example; (c) choose words which aptly and precisely convey the intended meaning; (d) construct effective sentences, i.e., sentences that economically and successfully convey the writer's ideas and display a variety of structures; (e) demonstrate an awareness of the conventions of standard written English, avoiding such errors as sentence fragments, run-together sentences, faulty agreements, and improper pronoun references; and (f) punctuate; spell, and edit one's work correctly. A student planning to attend the University must take English courses in high school that require the development and practice of these skills. University entrance requirements include at least four years of English co~position and literature that stress expos\u00ad itory writin'g: the development of persuasive critical thinking on the written page. Mathematics Many students are unaware of the large number of fields of study that require preparation in mathematics beyond the minimum three-year requirement for admission to the University. Courses in calculus are included in the requirements for all majors in information and computer science; engineering; the physical, mathematical, and biological sciences; as well as programs lead\u00ad ing to professional degrees in fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, or pharmacy. Majors in the social sciences require one year of statistics or calculus, or both. Students should prepare for these courses while in high school so that the appropriate mathematics courses can be taken in the freshman\u00b7 year at the University. Thus the high school program should include a year of precalculus mathematics. This year should provide additional practice in the use of second-year alge\u00ad bra and should include experience with trigonometry, logarithmic and exponential functions with applications and word problems. Students who are not proficient in understanding basic and advanced (second-year) algebra and solving problems using these concepts will be at an enormous disadvantage in a number of majors at the University. One or more precalculus courses will have to be completed before beginning calculus, and preparatory courses may be needed before taking statistics. The necessity to take these preparatory courses can seriously delay progress in undergraduate studies ..

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Undergraduate Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Associated Areas of Study Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, concen\u00ad trations, and/or associated areas of study. Special restrictions apply to some majors and minors; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students. Other minors may be completed without such formalities. Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree programs are referred to as\u00b7 majors in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors and formal concen\u00ad trations. Some concentrations are available in more than one academic unit. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or discipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. U CI offers three interdis\u00ad ciplinary minors. The minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is focused in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, and the Program in Social Ecology. The minors in Latin American/Chicano Studies and in Women's Studies are focused in the School of Humanities. All minors, including interdiscipli\u00ad nary minors, are available to all students regardless of their major, with the exception that students may not minor in their major. Minors are listed on a student's transcript but are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study consisting of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. Concen\u00ad trations are similiar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of concentration pursued by a student appears on the transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentrations are usually taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. A specialization is a program of study which enables students to focus on courses in a particular field within a major. The area of specialization pursued by a student appears on the transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. In addition to the formal minors, concentrations, and specializa\u00ad tions, other associated areas of study are available. These include emphases, tracks, modules, or options.

Administrative Services Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis Multiple Subject Instruction (elementary) Single Subject Instruction (secondary) Special Education (learning handicapped; severely handicapped; and the resource specialist certificate) Majors and Careers Choosing a Major Many students select their University major, the field of study which represents their principal academic interest, at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Appli\u00ad cation. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its academic pro\u00ad grams. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is Majors and Careers 21 influenced by broad interactions among disciplines. As a com\u00ad plement to classroom study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing work\u00ad shops, computing, and fine arts productions. Such experiences can help students identify additional areas of interest. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific information about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. (Some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. The impacted majors are Economics; Engineering; Information and Computer Science, for incoming transfer students only; and, effective fall 1991, Psy\u00ad chology.) While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be help\u00ad ful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Courses and workshops designed to assist students in choosing a major are offered by the Career Planning and Placement Center and by the Office of the Dean of Undergradu\u00ad ate Studies, as well as by some of the academic units. All students are expected to choose a major by the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sopho\u00ad more years. When considering possible majors, students should keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentra- \u00b7 tion could reduce a student's options and could cause the student to need more than four years to obtain the baccalaureate degree. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be con\u00ad sidered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Certain restrictions may apply; students interested in pursuing a double major should check with their academic advisor. Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, as indicated above. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisite and pro\u00ad gram planning. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Unaffiliated (Undeclared) Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students participate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The goal of GSAP \u00b7 is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are expected to choose their major by the beginning of their junior year. UC IRVINE - 1990-199122 Majors and Careers To make a good decision about what major to declare, the stu\u00ad dent should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of his or her abili\u00ad ties and interests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of his or her vocational goals and of the academic pro\u00ad grams at UCI that will provide appropriate preparation for them. Students in GSAP receive individualized counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own interests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for possible careers. Preprofessional Preparation Law Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immigra\u00ad tion law), and this requires a wide range of academic back\u00ad grounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evidence of excellence in any academic program. A good record in physics or classics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in history or political science. The major\u00ad ity of law schools give equal preference to students from all aca\u00ad demic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analyti\u00ad cal skills (logic, writing, mathematics, research methods, and statistics courses, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the LSAT, succeeding in law school, and entering the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers courses in logic and the philosophy of law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, international relations, and econom\u00ad ics of law and recommends that students take some political sci\u00ad ence courses as well. The Program in Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmen\u00ad tal and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice and offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to actual problems through its field study program. Students interested in applying to law school after completing the baccalaureate degree should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admit\u00ad ted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergradu\u00ad ate major is alternative career opportunities should one's career goals change or should experience with law school result in a decision not to enter the field of law. Medicine and Other Health-Related Sciences Although leaders in health science education strongly recommend that students obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is the same as the preparation required for medical school admission; how\u00ad ever, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergraduate preparation required by most medical and health-related schools includes one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with laboratory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics. Courses in cell or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, developmental physiology or comparative anatomy, and vertebrate embryology are recommended, as is course work in computer science. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommended courses in, for example, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish language is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at the following seven areas: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately, and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is impor\u00ad tant); results of the new Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), the Dental Admissions Test, and other aptitude exami\u00ad nation scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal inter\u00ad view; in-depth letters of recommendation; practical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, which is regarded favorably as an indication of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extracurricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience, especially in a biological, medical, or behav\u00ad ioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants and competition for entrance is keen, it is important to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to medical, dental, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, or veterinary school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related programs now available. Business/Management The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and participate in the full scope of an enterprise while under\u00ad standing its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral pro\u00ad cesses in organizations. Although UCI does not offer a prebusiness program leading to an undergraduate degree, the Graduate School of Management offers a minor in Management as a supplement to any under\u00ad graduate major. This minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and practice. In addition, it may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or undertake further. study in management at the graduate level. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus, statistics, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and political science courses. Most graduate programs in business administration or manage\u00ad ment do not require prior undergraduate course work in business. For admission purposes, graduate schools of business look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth let\u00ad ters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work experience. The latter is becoming an increasingly important prerequisite for many programs. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Career Opportunities The eight academic units at UCI which offer undergraduate edu\u00ad cation leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests lead-. ing to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow are meant to indicate to students the many and varied career areas pursued by UCI grad\u00ad uates, and to make students aware of some of the vast array of career choices available. Additional discussions of careers are presented in individual academic unit sections. Any major can lead to any nu~ber of careers.\u00b7 Some exa~ples of careers frequently led to by majors available within the academic units at UCI are listed below.

Student AfTmnative Action Student affirmative action involves the provision of equal oppor\u00ad tunities for admission and success at the University, and specifi\u00ad cally for increased enrollment, greater retention, and higher grad\u00ad uation rates of underrepresented students who are regularly admissible to the University. Educational Opportunity Program The goal of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is to encourage representation of low-income and/or underrepresented students by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the Uni\u00ad versity. The Educational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by providing counseling on admissions and financial aid, and referral to the Student Aca\u00ad demic Advancement Services Office for advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. Special assistance on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Program, Learning Skills Services, and the Student Academic Advancement Services Office. Additional information and personal admissions counseling may be obtained from the EOP/Student Affirmative Action staff by telephoning (714) 856-7484. Students from low-income and/or underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admis\u00ad sible to the University, and also those who may not have met all of the regular admissions requirements but who can offer evi\u00ad dence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indians, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. American Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. Admission. Prospective students interested in EOP must complete the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. Applicants should take particular care with the required essay and indicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and com\u00ad munity colleges, the UCI Office of Admissions, or the EOP/SAA-Outreach Office. Applicants who require special admissions consideration are advised to submit two letters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the com\u00ad munity, or employers, which document the student's background, motivation, and academic potential. Financial Assistance. Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend col\u00ad lege. All students admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are UC IRVINE - 1990-199126 Student Affirmative Action/Expenses and Fees eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses.

Additional information about these programs is available by telephoning (714) 856-7482. Medical Student Support Programs Additional information on the four programs listed below is available in the College of Medicine section. The Summer Pre-Entry Program is designed to introduce newly accepted minority and/or disadvantaged medical students to the type and volume of study materials they will encounter during their medical education. The Summer Pr-emedical Program seeks to increase the number of minority and/or disadvantaged students who are accepted into medical school by providing participants with the special skills and prerequisites needed to obtain an M.D. degree. The Postbaccalaureate Program is aimed at increasing the number of minority and/ or disadvantaged students who are accepted into medical school by assisting individuals who have been unsuccess\u00ad ful in earlier attempts to gain admission to medical school. The National Board Review Course is designed to assist minority and/or disadvantaged students who have been unable to pass Part I of the National Board Examination. Student Academic Advancement Services The Office of Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS) provides students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are first-generation college students, and traditionally under\u00ad represented students with support services to help them succeed and earn their University degree. A primary responsibility of SAAS is to monitor the academic progress of its students. To best assist students who are having difficulty with their course work, professional counselors main\u00ad tain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, referrals to other campus support services are provided. In con\u00ad junction with these academic and service units, the Engineering and Computer Science Educational Laboratory (ECSEL) pro-gram, a graduate school preparatory course, and a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by SAAS. SAAS also sponsors and conducts the Summer Bridge Program for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. The Program is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to success\u00ad fully complete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with the Office of Student Academic Advancement Services; telephone (714) 856-6234.

Nonresident Tuition Fee and California Residence Students who have not been residents of California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date are charged, along with other fees, a Nonresident Tuition Fee of $1,972 for each quarter or $5,916 per year for each year of attendance required by the curriculum, whether such year extends over three or four academic quarters. The residence determina\u00ad tion date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the, semester system, the day instruction begins for the semes\u00ad ter. Nonresident undergraduate and graduate students on approved part-time status shall pay one-half the Nonresident Tuition. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence require\u00ad ments for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst Residence Matters (300 Lakeside Drive, 7th Floor, University of California, Oakland, CA 94612-3550) within 90 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes upon admission, an adult student, except an adult alien who is pre\u00ad cluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from establishing domicile in the U.S., must have established residence in Califor\u00ad nia for more than one year immediately preceding the residence determination date for the term for which the student proposes to attend the University and must have relinquished any prior resi\u00ad dence. An adult student must couple physical presence within the State of California for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making Califor\u00ad nia the permanent home. If these steps are delayed, the one-year durational period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Physical pre\u00ad sence within the State solely for educational purposes does not constitute the establishment of California residence under State law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate a stu\u00ad dent's intent to make California the permanent residence include, but are not limited to, the following: registering and voting in California elections; designating California as the student's per\u00ad manent address on all school and employment records, including military records if the student is in the military service; obtaining a California driver's license or, if a nondriver, a California Identi\u00ad fication Card; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including income earned outside the State; establishing an abode where the student's per\u00ad manent belongings are kept within California; residing in Cali\u00ad fornia during summers and other academic breaks; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indi\u00ad cia in other places during any period for which residence in Cali\u00ad fornia is asserted. Documentary evidence may be required. No single factor is controlling or decisive. All relevant indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) lives is the residence of the unmarried minor. When the minor lives with neither parent, the minor's residence is that of the parent with whom the minor last lived. A minor, except a minor alien who is precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from from establishing domicile in the U.S., may establish their residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by the minor's own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. An adult student (over the age of 18) establishes their own resi\u00ad dence. Residence is not derived from a spouse or parents. Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a s\u00b7tatement of Legal Residence. The student's status is determined by the Res\u00ad idence Deputy who is located in the Registrar's Office. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to rec\u00ad lassification to nonresident status and to payment of all nonresi\u00ad dent fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student may be subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991California Residence 29 Students may choose to attend a wide variety of events held on campus during the day, such as concerts and lectures by guest speakers. Exceptions I. If the California resident parent(s) of an eligible minor moves from California, leaving the minor in California, the minor will be entitled to resident classification as long as the minor enrolls in an institution within one year of the date the par\u00ad ent(s) establishes a residence outside of California. This classi\u00ad fication will continue until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time neces\u00ad sary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, the stu\u00ad dent maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. A student who is a U.S. citizen or eligible alien who is a minor or 18 years of age may be eligible for resident status if the stu\u00ad dent can provide evidence of the following: (I) physical pre\u00ad sence for the required one year, (2) self-support for the entire year immediately prior to the residence determination date, and (3) evidence of an intent to make California the perman\u00ad ent home. 3. A student who is a U.S. citizen or eligible alien shall be entitled to resident classification if the student has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years. The adult or adults having such control must have been Cali\u00ad fornia residents during the year immediately prior to the resi\u00ad dence determination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident, so long as continuous attendance is maintained at an institution. 4. A student who has not been an adult resident of California for more than one year may be entitled to resident classification until the student has resided in California for the minimum time necessary to become a resident if (I) the student is the dependent child of a California parent who has established residence in the state and (2) continuous attendance is main\u00ad tained at an institution. 5. Exemption from payment of the Nonresident Tuition Fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such exemption may be maintained until the student has resided in California the min\u00ad imum time necessary to become a resident. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is reti\"red as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain the exemption under conditions set forth above. 6. A student who is a member of the United States military sta\u00ad tioned in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a State\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until the student has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 7. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire suppres\u00ad sion employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties, may be entitled to resident status. 8. To the extent funds are available, the unmarried, dependent child under age 21 or the spouse of a member of the Univer\u00ad sity faculty who is a member of the Academic Senate may be eligible for a waiver of the nonresident tuition. 9. A student who is the dependent of a full-time employee of the University of California who is permanently assigned to work outside of California may be entitled to resident classification. UC IRVINE - 1990-199130 Fee Refunds/Financial Aid Reclassification Continuing and returning students who are classified as nonresi\u00ad dents for tuition purposes and believe that they will be eligible for resident status the next quarter must file a reclassification petition at the Registrar's Office no later than the fee payment deadline for that quarter. The deadline is published in the quarterly Sched\u00ad ule of Classes. Effective fall 1985, the University of California reclassification regulations were amended as indicated below: In determining a student's eligibility for reclassification, financial independence is included among the factors considered in eva\u00ad luating intent to establish residence in California. The California Legislature has defined as financially independent those students who meet the following criteria for the current and three imme\u00ad diately preceding calendar years: That the student has not been claimed as an exemption for state and federal income tax purposes by his or her parents; That the student has not received more than $750 from his or her parents; and That the student has not lived in the home of his or her par\u00ad ents for more than six weeks in any given year. In determining whether a student has objectively manifested intent to establish California residence, financial independence shall weigh in favor of finding California residence for reclassifi\u00ad cation purposes, and financial dependence shall weigh against finding California residence for reclassification purposes. Financial dependence in the current and preceding calendar year shall weigh more heavily against finding California residence for reclassification purposes than shall financial dependence in earlier calendar years. A student who is financially dependent in the current and preced\u00ad ing calendar year shall be found to be a California resident for reclassification purposes only if no factors exist which evidence the student's continuing residence in another state. Students whose parents have been California residents for at least one year immediately prior to the residence determination date are not subject to the financial independence factor when apply\u00ad ing for reclassification. Financial independence is not included as a factor for graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, and teaching asso\u00ad ciates who are employed on a 0.49 or more time basis for the quarter for which reclassification is sought. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation. If additional doc\u00ad umentation is required for either an initial residence classification or a reclassification but is not readily accessible, the student will be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the applica\u00ad ble term to provide such documentation. Inquiries and Appeals. The student is cautioned that this summa\u00ad tion is not a complete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant residence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, and a copy is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office. Fee Refunds Student Fee Refunds Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form, together with their identification card for the current quarter, to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean and, for undergraduate stu\u00ad dents, the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medi\u00ad cine. This form serves two purposes: (I) a refund of fees, if ap\u00ad plicable; and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal used in determining the percen\u00ad tage of fees to be refunded is the date on which the student sub\u00ad mits the Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office, or, in the case of medical students, to the Curricular Affairs Office. It is presumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Registration fees are refunded as follows: New Undergraduate Students. Prior to Orientation Week, fees are refunded in full except for the $100 Statement of Intent to Regis\u00ad ter deposit. During Orientation Week and thereafter, the $100 Statement of Intent to Register deposit and International Student Health Insurance Fee (if applicable) are withheld. The refund of the Registration Fee, Educational Fee, Associated Students Fee, UCI Student Center Fee, Bren Ev.ents Center Fee, and Nonresi\u00ad dent Tuition Fee (if applicable) is prorated according to the schedule below. Continuing and Returning Undergraduate and New, Continuing, and Returning Graduate Students. Prior to Orientation Week, fees are refunded in full, except for a $10 service charge. During Orientation Week and thereafter, the Graduate Student Health Insurance Fee (if applicable) and International Student Health Insurance Fee (if applicable) are withheld. The refund of the Reg\u00ad istration Fee, Educational Fee, Associated Students or Asso\u00ad ciated Graduate Students Fee, UCI Student Center Fee, Bren Events Center Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable) is prorated according to the schedule below. Schedule of Refunds for Registration Fee, Education Fee, Asso\u00ad ciated Students or Associated Graduate Students Fee, UCI Student Center Fee, Bren Events Center Fee, and Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) Calendar days from first day of instruction 1-14 15-21 22-28 29-35 over 35 Refund 80 percent 60 percent 40 percent 20 percent no refund Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year (July I to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are mailed to the student generally four to six weeks after the official notice of withdrawal is initiated. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the University or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have to repay a portion of their aid based on the same schedule as UCI's refund policy. Housing Refunds UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. Financial Aid Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost 40 percent of UCI's enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend may be eligible for financial aid through the UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the neces\u00ad sary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC is available at high schools, local colleges and universities, and at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Information regarding the application process, deadlines, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid Handbook. The Handbook is mailed to entering students in December and is available to continuing students in January in the Financial Aid Office. The priority deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is March 2. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis (!f the SAAC and supporting documents determines the amount a stu\u00ad dent and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's education. For independent stu\u00ad dents, the analysis determines the amount a student and/or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Secur\u00ad ity and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are required to apply for a Pel! Grant, and in addition eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. The appli\u00ad cation deadline for Cal Grants is March 2 for the following aca\u00ad demic year. Special Expenditures Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies asso\u00ad ciated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the possibility of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Examples of such special expenditures include transportation costs for a field study assignment, special shoes for a dance class, or special equipment for disabled students. UCI Policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Educa\u00ad tion Act Amendments of 1986 state that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursu\u00ad ing, according to the standards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May 1982 state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be maintaining satisfactory pro-Financial Aid 31 gress in the course of study he or she is pursuing according to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Financial Aid Office. These requirements are separate and distinct from UCI's policy regard\u00ad ing satisfactory academic progress. 1. Grade Point Average (GPA) All financial aid recipients must be in compliance with the follow\u00ad ing minimum cumulative GPA requirements at the conclusion of the spring quarter of each academic year. Undergraduate students Year 1: 1.85; Year 2: 1.90; Year 3: 1.95; Year 4: 1.975; (Undergraduate and Graduate) and Clock Hours (Medi\u00ad cal Students) All financial aid applicants must comply with the following min\u00ad imum cumulative unit or clock-hour requirements.

NOTE: Students who enroll in more than the minimum number of units required per quarter in the first and second years will have the additional units carried forward for the cumulative total. 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. UC IRVINE - 1990-199132 Financial Aid Undergraduate students: I. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of 15 quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligi\u00ad bility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have up to six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility for a maxi\u00ad mum of 21 quarters of undergraduate attendance. NOTE: Students will not be granted additional quarters of eligi\u00ad bility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pursuing more than one major. Graduate students: I. Limited Status (California educational credential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Limited Status (noncredential) students: four quarters of aca- demic year attendance. 3. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 4. Ph.D. students will be eligible for 21 quarters of need-based financial aid following the completion of their baccalaureate degree.

College of Medicine students who have been approved for Extended Curriculum will be eligible for financial assistance for a total of five years. 3. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine remaining quarter/quintiles of financial aid eligibility. NOTE: Students will not be granted additional quarters of eligi\u00ad bility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pursuing more than one major. Unit Evaluation I. Remedial courses Required remedial courses will count toward the undergradu\u00ad ate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock-hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students F I NP u w NR Repeat courses Failure Incomplete Not Pass Unsatisfactory Withdraw No grade reported Repeat of a D grade or higher; repeat of an advanced standing or high school course Medical students F Failure NR No grade reported Repeat courses Repeat of a D grade or higher 3. Incomplete courses 7medical students Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quarter/quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade ofF, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. 4. Courses in progress-medical students Clock-hours for courses In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quar\u00ad ter/quintile of a course requiring more than two quarters/ quintiles for completion. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the clock\u00ad hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Deficiencies in Satisfactory Academic Progress and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid. The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satis\u00ad factory academic progress stated \u00b7above are monitored each quar\u00ad ter and at the end of each academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. I. Quarterly totals-unit and GPA a. GPA total below the minimum cumulative GPA total: Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress proba\u00ad tion for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the GPA deficiency must be cleared by the erid of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the GPA deficiency. Note: GPA deficiencies must be cleared at a University of California campus. b. Unit deficiencies: i. Enrolled in less than the minimum units required but at least six per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. ii Enrolled in less than six units per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive campus-based financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be depen\u00ad dent upon clearing the unit deficiency. (See \"Quarterly Unit Deficiency and Its Effect on Pell Grant and Cal Grant\" below.) 2. Academic year totals-units and GPA The Financial Aid Office will verify the cumulative totals for units and GPA after the conclusion of spring quarter. Stu\u00ad dents who have unit or GPA deficiencies will be required to UC IRVINE - 1990-1991make up the deficiency prior to receiving any financial aid funds, including funds that would also be used for payment of fees. 3. Quarter limits of eligibiity At the end of the quarter students will be notified by the Financial Aid Office if they are nearing the quarter limit of eligibility for financial aid. The notice will indicate how many quarters of eligibility remain. Students also will be notified when they have completed the maximum number of quarters of eligibility for financial aid. Quarterly Unit Deficiency and Its Effect on Pell Grant and Cal Grant A and B Recipients 1. Pell Grant Students receiving a Pell Grant must be enrolled in a min\u00ad imum of 12 units each quarter. The Financial Aid Office will verify unit totals for all Pell Grant recipients at the conclusion of the third week of the quarter. The Pell Grant unit require\u00ad ment does not provide a probationary period in which the stu\u00ad dent may make up the deficiency. Students who are enrolled for less than 12 units at the conclusion of the third week of the quarter will have their Pell Grant award reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the Pell Grant 8.9-6.0 units will receive one-half of the Pell Grant 5.9-0.0 units will have their Pell Grant canceled If the Pell Grant reduction is made in the fall or winter quar\u00ad ter, the subsequent quarter's award will be reduced. If the Pell Grant reduction is made due to a deficiency in the spring quarter, the student will be billed for the amount of the reduction. 2. Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B Fee Payments Students must be enrolled in a minimum of six units during the quarter in order to remain eligible for the full amount of their Cal Grant Fee Payment Authorization. Students enrolled in less than six units should contact the California Student Aid Commission for a leave of absence from the Cal Grant program; request forms are available at the Financial Aid Office. Graduating seniors with less than six units left to graduate should contact the Financial Aid Office for a possi\u00ad ble exception to the unit requirement. 3. Cal Grant B-subsistence In order to receive full Cal Grant B subsistence students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units each quarter. Subsis\u00ad tence checks are issued based on the number of units in which a student is enrolled through the fifteenth of each month. Units may not be averaged from one quarter to the next. Stu\u00ad dents enrolled in less than 12 units will have their Cal Grant B subsistence awards reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the subsistence payment 8.9-6.0 units will receive one-half of the subsistence payment 5.9-0.0 units will not receive subsistence payment Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a stu\u00ad dent will be considered for financial aid only when one of the fol\u00ad lowing conditions has been met: a. Sufficient units/clock-hours have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative GPA requirement has been satisfied. b. It is established through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating circum\u00ad stances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered aca\u00ad demic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Scholarships 33 Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeals Request Form and a letter to the Financial Aid Office stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit, clock-hour, or GPA progress requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties. Undergraduate and graduate students may seek the assistance of the University Ombudsman in the preparation of appeals. Medical students may seek the assistance of the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean, Medical Student Affairs in the preparation of appeals. They may also be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. Undergraduate Students-All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid professional staff). Once material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept an appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final recommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and forwarded to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Graduate Students-Appeals are reviewed by (I) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced degree program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies, who will make the final recommenda\u00ad tions to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Medical Students-All relevant materials will be presented to the Committee on Promotions and Honors. If the Committee, after consideration of the appeal, determines that the appeal should be approved, its decision will be forwarded to the Director of Finan\u00ad cial Aid and aid will be reinstated. In the event the appeal is denied by the Committee, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Committee. The Committee will for\u00ad ward the final decision to the Director of Financial Aid for implementation. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate financial need. UCI offers students with proven high academic achievement and leadership potential five top honors awards: Regents', University, Chancellor's Club, Alumni Associa\u00ad tion, or UCI Foundation Scholarships. The scholarships have sti\u00ad pends which range from $250 to $1,500, or, in the case of Regents' Scholarships, provide full demonstrated need. Entering Freshman and Transfer Students Students who are entering UCI in the fall must complete the scholarship section of the UC Application Packet and the appli\u00ad cation must be submitted by November 30. The Financial Aid Office automatically collects information about applicants' schol\u00ad arship qualifications. Applications that meet the requirements are reviewed by the Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Scholar\u00ad ships, Honors, and Financial Aid and an Alumni Association Committee. Continuing UCI Students Academic records of all current UCI students also are reviewed. Continuing students who meet the qualification requirements are invited to apply. Applications are reviewed by the Faculty Com\u00ad mittee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Honors, and Financial Aid and an Alumni Association Committee. UC IRVINE - 1990-199134 Grants/Loans Restrictive Endowment Scholarships All UCI students may apply for Restrictive Endowment Scholar\u00ad ships. Entering students should complete the scholarship section of the UC Application Packet. Continuing UCI students should \u00b7complete the application form available in the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility requirements for these scholarships vary greatly and are restricted in terms of such student characteristics as geo\u00ad graphic location, family background, and physical disabilities. For the most part, these scholarship awards are based on the stu\u00ad dent's established financial need. Regents' Scholarships Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The appointments range from four years for stu\u00ad dents entering from high school and first-year medical students, to two years for undergraduate students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $500 honorarium for each year of their appointment. In addition, a stipend is awarded annually to Regents' Scholars who complete the finan\u00ad cial aid application process and demonstrate financial need. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to their demonstrated need. University Scholarships University scholarships are offered to students entering their freshman or junior year who show evidence of high scholastic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These stipends may be renewed by completing the application process and dem\u00ad onstrating financial need. National Merit Scholarships UCI is a sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship. Recipients are selected from a list of finalists who selected UCI as their first college choice on the National Merit Scholarship Application. Annual awards for attendance at UCI are $300. In addition, UCI National Merit Scholars who have demonstrated financial need will be considered for scholarships up to $2,000 per academic year. Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship This federally funded program provides college scholarships to outstanding high school graduates and college students who demonstrate a commitment to pursue teaching careers at the pre\u00ad school, elementary, or secondary level. Scholarships may be awarded for up to four academic years, beginning in the recip\u00ad ient's sophomore year, with maximum scholarships of $5,000 per year. Applicants must be in the top 10 percent of their graduating high school class or have received an equivalent General Educational Development (GED) score. Participants must attend a California postsecondary institution with teacher preparation programs approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credential\u00ad ing and agree to teach two years full-time for each year the schol\u00ad arship is received. Applications are available after January I at participating post\u00ad secondary institutions with teacher preparation programs and at California high schools. Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship This federally funded program provides college scholarships to high school graduates who have demonstrated outstanding aca\u00ad demic achievement in high school and who show promise of con\u00ad tinued academic achievement in college. These $1,500 nonrenew\u00ad able scholarships are awarded for the first year of study at any public or private institution in the United States. Scholarships are awarded, in part, according to the Congressional District in which the applicant resides. Applications are available after January I at all California public and private high schools. Exceptional Financial Need Scholarship and Financial Assistance for Disadvantaged Health Professions Students These federally funded programs are for students of exceptional financial need from a disadvantaged background accepted for en\u00ad rollment at a health profession school. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. They must provide the Financial Aid Director complete financial aid information including infor\u00ad mation on parents' income and assets-{ regardless of their depen\u00ad dency status). All College of Medicine applicants for campus\u00ad based financial aid are automatically considered for these schol\u00ad arships. For additional information on these programs, contact the College of Medicine Financial Aid Office, 125 Medical Surge I; telephone (714) 856-6476. For information on ROTC scholarships, see page 63. Grants Grants are a warded on the basis of financial need. There is no repayment requirement. Pell Grant is the largest federally funded grant program and pro\u00ad vided up to a maximum of $2,300 for the 1989-90 academic year. To be eligible, applicants must be U.S. citizens or eligible nonciti\u00ad zens, be enrolled as undergraduates, have not previously received a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate financial need. Students must use the SAAC or the Application for Federal Student Aid to apply for this grant. Cal Grant A is a State-funded scholarship program which cur\u00ad rently provides awards to be applied to the payment of University fees. In 1989-90 Cal Grant A awards were as much as full fees ($1,692) for the academic year. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents and demonstrate financial need. Students must use the SAAC to apply for Cal Grant A. The filing deadline for new applicants is March 2 for the following year. Cal Grant B is a State-funded grant program which provides awards up to a maximum of$1,410 during the student's first year and $1,410 plus fees during subsequent years. To be eligible, applicants must be California residents, demonstrate financial\u00b7 need, and be entering college or not have completed more than one quarter of college work. Students must use the SAAC to apply for Cal Grant B. The filing deadline for new applicants is March 2 for the following year. NOTE: Students may not receive both Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B. If offered both, the Financial Aid Office recommends taking Cal Grant B over Cal Grant A. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) provides grant aid for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens who are under\u00ad graduate students and have demonstrated financial need. These federal grants range from $100 to $4,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by the University of California and provides grant aid for full-tiipe students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recip\u00ad ients with an opportunity to defer the cost of their education by borrowing when needed and paying later. However, loan recip\u00ad ients must pay interest on the amount borrowed; interest rates vary from 5 to 12 percent per year. The deferment and cancella\u00ad tion provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the UC IRVINE - 1990-1991promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or lender. A student's loan responsibilities, prior to acceptance of the loan, are to understand the terms of the loan and participate in an entrance interview. After accepting the loan, the recipient must repay the loan iri accordance with the repayment schedule, advise the Financial Services Office upon leaving UCI; participate in an exit interview; and provide the Financial Services Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total dis\u00ad ability, outstanding loan obligations may be canceled upon pre\u00ad sentation of official confirming documents. Perkins Loan (formerly National Direct Student Loan) provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but cannot exceed $4,500 for the first two years or $9,000 for the undergraduate years. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of five percent a year begins nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than half time, and repayment must be completed within a 10- year period. Graduate students may rec.eive an aggregate of $18,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate. University Loan, funded by the University of California, provides long-term loans to full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount for an academic year is $3,000. Interest of five percent a year begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time, and repayment must be completed within five years. Two cosigners are required. Stafford Loan (formerly Guaranteed Student Loan), processed through participating banks and\u00b7other lending institutions, is \u00b7available to undergraduate, graduate, and medical students who are U.S. citizens 01: eligible noncitizens, and who demonstrate financial need. In addition to filing a SAAC to determine finan\u00ad cial need, students need to file a separate State Stafford Loan application. They will be notified of their eligibility for a loan on their Award Letter and the Financial Aid Office will mail them a Stafford Loan application. Freshmen and sophomores may be awarded up to $2,625 each academic year; juniors and seniors may be awarded up to $4,000 each academic year; graduate and medical students may be awarded up to $7,500 each academic year. Students must advance a grade level during the academic year or be subject to an 11-month waiting period before becom\u00ad ing eligible to apply for another Stafford Loan.

UC IRVINE - 1990-199136 Work-Study/Undergraduate Admissions Work-Study The work-study program offers eligible students who demon\u00ad strate need an opportunity to pay for their living and educational expenses as they occur. It also helps them to avoid a large debt that will have to be repaid after leaving school. Both undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students are eligible for work-study awards. Medical students must obtain the approval of the Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs prior to obtaining work-study employment. Students awarded work-study have the choice of obtaining a work-study job either on campus or off campus at a nonprofit agency. A variety of work opportunities are available, and such part-time work experience can be a valuable asset when seeking employment after graduation. Information about the terms and conditions of work-study employment will be provided in the UCI Financial Aid Award Guide sent to all UCI students receiving financial aid. Veterans Work-Study Program is available only to U.S. military veterans and their eligible dependents. Separate applications and detailed information are available from the UCI Veterans Student Services Office. Additional Aid for Graduate and Medical Students Most graduate fellowship programs are administered by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Graduate students should contact the Office, 145 Administration Building; telephone (714) 856-6761, for information about application procedures for other forms of aid such as graduate fellowships or teaching and research assistantships. Medical students should contact the College of Medicine Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office, 125 Medical Surge I; telephone (714) 856-6476, for information about other sources of financial assistance. Aid for International Students Students who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States, and have experienced an unanticipated change in their financial situation, may be eligible for assistance from a very limited number of University programs. The financial change must be fully documented. In order to be considered for financial aid, students must have completed at least three years of study at UCI as undergraduates or four years of study as graduate stu\u00ad dents. Financial aid is limited to the expenses for books and fees; tuition will not be considered. International students may contact the Financial Aid Office or the Office of International Services for further information. Aid for Disabled Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible disabled students. Interested students should follow the regular financial aid application procedures and should be sure to specify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a disability. Supporting documentation must be provided. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI students and their spouses in obtaining part-or full-time employment dur\u00ad ing the academic year and summer vacation. Financial aid recip\u00ad ients who have been awarded work-study also may obtain on\u00ad campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Student Services I. Undergraduate Admissions The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on plan-The School of Biological Sciences' greenhouse supplies plant material used in classroom study and houses botanical experiments. ning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available by appointment in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine, CA 92717. General admission information is available by telephoning (714) 856-6703. The information on admission to UCI given below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission as a Freshman Applicant Basic Eligibility Requirements Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Advanced Placement Application Procedures Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the General Educational Development (GED) Certificate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. A transfer applicant is a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular or extension UC IRVINE - 1990-1991session of a college or university other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent resi\u00ad dence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly regis\u00ad tered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See page 60. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bache\u00ad lor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) appli\u00ad cant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school or perhaps an area of interest not offered by the high school in which the student meets the necessary prerequisites. Participants are officially registered UCI students who enroll in the same courses and are evaluated on the same basis as full-time under\u00ad graduates. UPHSS students enroll in one or two UCI courses on a reduced-fee basis concurrently with their high school courses. See page 15 for additional information. Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia is guided by the University's commitment to serve the 'people of California and the needs of the State, within the frame\u00ad work of the California Master Plan for Higher Education. The University's entrance requirements follow the guidelines set forth in the Master Plan, which specify that the top one-eighth of the State's high school graduates be eligible for admission to the University of California. These requirements, described in detail in the Basic Eligibility Requirements section, are designed to ensure that all eligible students are adequately prepared for Uni\u00ad versity work. Since at UCI, as at most University of California campuses, the number of eligible applicants well exceeds the number of spaces available, the campus uses selection criteria which are more demanding than minimum UC eligibility requirements. Academic qualifications are foremost, with 60 percent of successful appli\u00ad cants admitted solely on indices derived from correlations between high school grade point average, all admission test scores, high school academic courses, and the performance of previous UCI freshmen. To attain a student body that meets the University's high academic standards and reflects the cultural, racial, geographic, economic, and social diversity of California, the remaining 40 percent of successful applicants are admitted on criteria which supplement the student's scholarly qualifications and which demonstrate academic backgrounds and motivation not reflected by the indices alone. These selection procedures are described in the Selection Criteria section. At present two undergraduate majors, Economics and Engineer\u00ad ing, employ criteria which are more stringent than those for the campus in general. Effective for fall. 1991 admissions, the Psy\u00ad chology major also will employ more stringent criteria than the campus in general. Admission as a Freshman/Eligibility Requirements 37 Selection Criteria Academic Criteria. Applicants are selected using indices based on each standard measure of academic aptitude and achievement required for admission to the University. These factors are listed below in descending order of emphasis. The weight of each factor is based on its correlation with the cumulative grade point aver\u00ad age earned by recently admitted students during their first two years at UCI. 1. Scores on the three required College Board Achievement Tests; 2. High school grade point average in academic courses, weigh- ted for honors; 3. SAT Verbal and Mathematical scores; 4. The number of high school academic courses. Economics. Applicants selected include those who rank within the highest range using the academic criteria. Engineering. The academic index for the School of Engineering gives additional weight to the Mathematics Achievement Test score and to high school grade point average. Psychology. Effective for fall 1991 admissions, applicants selected will include those who rank within the highest range using the academic criteria with the highest mathematics achievement test scores. Supplemental criteria. Complete application materials for all applicants are carefully scrutinized by the Office of Admissions staff, often with faculty assistance. Such review is carefully doc\u00ad umented, but does not rely on formulas or weightings. Applicants are selected based on a review of factors that evidence a demand\u00ad ing academic orientation, such as exceptionally challenging courses; outstanding accomplishments related to the student's academic aims; superior motivation, diligence, and creativity; a strong match between UCI's programs and the student's aca\u00ad demic and career objectives, preparation, and talents; and poten\u00ad tial contribution to the campus. UCI also is sensitive to hardships beyond the student's control which may have damaged their academic record, such as social, economic, or geographic origins which,have restricted the devel\u00ad opment of potential; constraints on feasible educational alterna\u00ad tives; and health and physical disabilities. Basic Eligibility Requirements The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, or the General Educational Development (GED) examination, and who has not enrolled in\u00b7a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Applicants who do not meet the scholarship requirements for admission or do not qualify by examination at the time of high school graduation may be considered after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see page 40). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid trans\u00ad cript issued by the college or community college which conducted the course. UC IRVINE - 1990-199138 Admission Requirements Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admission by exam-. ination alone, as explained in the section Admission by Examina-.' tion Alone. 1. UC Subject Requirement The UC subject requirement consists of several courses from six core subjects. These required courses are called the \"a through f' subjects. Students are required to complete 15 \"a through f' sub\u00ad jects as described below. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.) Also, at least seven of the 15 units must have been earned in courses taken dur\u00ad ing the last two years of high school. To meet the subject requirement, these courses must appear on a certified course list which is available in the high schools for California applicants. The Office of Admissions will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants graduating from out-of\u00ad State schools. Specific \"A through F' course requirements a. History: 1 year One year of United States history or one-half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or Amer\u00ad ican government b. English: 4 years Four years of college-preparatory English composition and literature (All English courses must require frequent and regular practice in writing expository prose compositions of some length. Only two semesters of a certified English-as-a-second-language [ESL] course will be accepted. Also, not more than two semesters of ninth grade English will be accepted for this requirement.) c. Mathematics: 3 years Three years of mathematics elementary algebra, geometry, and advanced (second-year) algebra (Mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet part of this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) d. Laboratory Science: 1 year A one-year course in one labora\u00ad tory science, taken in the tenth grade or later e. Foreign Language: 2 years Two years of one foreign language in courses that provide instruction in grammar, vocabulary, read\u00ad ing, and composition, and that emphasize the development of aural and oral skills (Foreign language courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses. Students are strongly encouraged to complete three years of one foreign language in preparation for the UCI language other than English breadth requirement which will become effective for freshmen entering college in fall 1992.) f. College-Preparatory Electives: 4 years These units are to be chosen from at least two of the following subject areas: history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, foreign lan\u00ad guage, social science, and visual and performing arts. Students are urged to consult their high school counselor in the selection of course work to fulfill this requirement. The general objective of the elective program is to improve the student's analytical ability, promote their artistic development, and strengthen their oral and writing skills. Electives should involve considerable reading and writing in an amount appro\u00ad priate to the course and the subject matter. The emphasis in elec\u00ad tive courses should be t\u00b7~ prepare for future college-level work. Courses satisfying the \"f' requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political history, or economic history) and should provide an understand\u00ad ing of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate historical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in journalism, speech, debate, or drama is acceptable if it meets the rigor in reading and writing stated above. Advanced Mathematics: Courses in mathematics with second-year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, precalculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calcu\u00ad lus, probability, and statistics are acceptable electives. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elective if it fulfills the following objectives. The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard computer lan\u00ad guage such as Pascal, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBO~. By the end of the course each student should complete substantial pro\u00ad gramming projects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the labora\u00ad tory activities should involve an amount of time equivalent to at least one full class period per week. A science course in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elec\u00ad tive provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory sci\u00ad ence courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamental principles of physical and biological science. Laboratory activities as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet grad\u00ad uation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Foreign Language: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the foreign language \"e\" sub\u00ad -ject requirement. Elective courses in this language must have at least two years of the language as prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychol\u00ad ogy; or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisci\u00ad plinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objectives should include as many of the following as are applicable to the field: (I) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cultures, (2) to examine the historic and contemporary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function, (4) to examine the nature and princi\u00ad ples of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social sci\u00ad ence methodologies. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evalu\u00ad ate ideas arid information, and ability to analyze and synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence in the laboratory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowl\u00ad edge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational character are not acceptable social science electives. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should give specific attention to as many of the funda\u00ad mental arts components as possible, including the perceptual, the creative, the historical, or the critical as are applicable. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artistic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with discrimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to developing creative artistic ability and those devoted to artistic performance should have prerequisites (either course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the introductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for example, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily recreational, athletic, or body condi\u00ad tioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. 2. Scholarship Requirement Applicants who attain a minimum grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A= 4, B = 3, and C = 2) in \"a through f' subjects taken after the ninth grade will be considered eligible for admission to the University regardless of their scores on the standardized tests used for the examination requirement. Appli\u00ad cants whose grade point average is below 3.30 but greater than 2.77 are eligible to be considered for admission if they achieve the composite or total test score specified on the Eligibility Index (see page 40). The grade point average will be based on semester grades, unless a high school gives only year grades. (Grades earned in ninth grade or earlier are not used to calculate the grade point average for admission; however, these courses will be used to meet the subject requirement if they are completed with grades of C or better.) As noted on page 37, freshman applicants may be required to present academic qualifications beyond those described here. Applicants should have earned grades of C or better in meeting the subject requirement. Any \"a through f' course in which a student received a D or F grade must be repeated with a higher grade or, in sequential areas of mathematics, chemistry, and for\u00ad eign language, only validated by completion of advanced course work. (Applicants should consult with their counselors as to how these grades can be remedied and how the University will use them in the evaluation of the high school record.) a. Mathematics Requirement. With regard to the \"c\" subject requirement, grades earned in the third year of mathematics (advanced algebra) will be used only if they improve the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average. b. College-Preparatory Elective Courses. Two of the four units in elective courses used to satisfy the \"f' requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better, and all four units must Admission Requirements 39 be accepted by the high school for graduation. The best grades earned in any two of these units taken in grades 10 through 12 will be used in computing the applicant's grade point average for admission. c. Honors-Level Courses. The University wants to encourage students to take demanding, advanced academic courses in high school. Grades earned in up to four units of work in courses that are (a) certified by the high schooi as offered at an honors level, and (b) taken in the last two years of high school will be given extra weight in computing the grade point average for admission. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in University-approved honors-level courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign lan\u00ad guage. In these fields and additionally in the fields of com\u00ad puter science, social science, and the visual and performing arts, courses designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board are examples of honors-level courses. 3. Test Requirements All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should com\u00ad plete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that students will take either the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American College Test in October or November and will take the Achievement Tests in November or December.) Scores from any earlier dates will be accepted. Applicants must ensure that reports for all scores have been submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admissions. The fol\u00ad lowing tests are required: 1. One Aptitude Test, either: a. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (the verbal and mathe\u00ad matics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or b. The American College Test (ACT) composite score and 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. The Achievement Test in Literature may not be substituted for the English composition test. 3. Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT is 1,100. (If the ACT is presented, the minimum score is 26 if the test was taken prior to October 1989 or 27 if it was taken October 1989 or later.) Also, the student's total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achievement Test. This UC IRVINE - 1990-199140 Admission as a Transfer Student option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The Col\u00ad lege Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. Eligibility Index A\u00b7F ACT* or SAT** A-F ACT* or SAT** GPA Composite Total GPA Composite Total 2.78 35136 1600 3.05 22/23 970 2.79 *ACT is scored in intervals of I point from a minimum of I to a maxi\u00ad mum of 35or 36.

Use the second score if the test was taken October 1989 or later. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 1,600. Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent, usu\u00ad ally, with the senior year of high school is available to certain accelerated students (see page 37). Admission to UPHSS is based upon a combination of criteria including grades, specific prepara\u00ad tion in the field of interest, standardized test scores, recommenda\u00ad tions, and statement of purpose. Through UPHSS, qualified high school students may enroll in UCI courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full\u00ad time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UCI after high school graduation, a UPHSS stu\u00ad dent need only complete a change-of-major petition and enroll as a full-time student. If the UPHSS participant wishes to attend another University of California campus, the student must follow the regular admissions process and must complete an Under\u00ad graduate Application form. The form should be stamped by the UPHSS coordinator. High school students wishing more infor\u00ad mation about the program should contact the Office of Admis\u00ad sions or their high school counselor. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who. has completed high school and who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer appli\u00ad cants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements.) Some majors have additional admissions requirements. For fall 1990 admissions, applicants to Economics, Engineering, and Information and Computer Science were subject to screening beyond the minimum admission requirements for transfer stu\u00ad dents, as noted below and in the section for each major. Appli\u00ad cants to these majors may also be subject to additional screening in 1991-92. For fall 1991 admissions, applicants to the Psychology major will be subject to additional screening, as noted .below and in the section for the major. Economics: Junior-level applicants with highest grades in the fol\u00ad lowing courses received preference: one-year lower-division sequence in English composition, microeconomic and macro\u00ad economic theory, and calculus. Engineering: Applicants must have completed prerequisites.in cal\u00ad culus, physics, chemistry, and computational methods (FOR-\" TRAN for Civil and Mechanical Engineering, PASCAL for Elec\u00ad trical Engineering), and a one-year lower-division sequence in English composition. Selection was by grade point average within each of the Engineering options-Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical. Information and Computer Science: Applicants must have com\u00ad pleted a year of discrete mathematics or calculus, a year of com\u00ad puter science including a programming course in a modern high\u00ad level language (such as ADA, PASCAL), and a one-year lower\u00ad division sequence in English composition. Psychology: Effective for fall 1991 admissions, applicants with the highest grades in the following courses will receive preference: introduction to psychology, two or more other lower-division psychology courses, and a one-year lower-division sequence in English composition. Transfer Student Admission Requirements The requirements for admission as a transfer applicant vary according to the high school record. Transfer applicants who have completed a California Certificate of Proficiency or the equivalent must also meet regular University entrance requirements. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average' of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, except the last one attended, the student must have sufficient additional units and grades to offset the deficit. A transfer applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index and completed all the \"a through f' courses in high school may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or UC IRVINE - 1990-1991semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examination requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be \u00b7admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement for freshmen. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a freshman because the Eligibility Index was not met or who both failed to ineet the Eligibility Index and lacked required subjects may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b, completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed one of the following two options: 1. With a grade of C or better, (I) one transferable course in English composition; (2) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign lan\u00ad guage; (3) courses equivalent to high school elementary algebra, advanced algebra, and geometry; or a course in mathematics, such as trigonometry, or precalculus for which advanced algebra is a prerequisite. The mathematics courses do not have to be transferable. ii. Appropriate college courses, with grades of C or better in the \"a through f' subjects that the student lacked. Up to two units of high school work in \"a through f' subjects will be waived, but transfer applicants must have satisfied ' the freshman. admission requirements of four years of college-preparatory English and three years of mathematics (part of the \"a through r\u00b7 requirements). Transfer applicants are referred to Planning to Transfer, page 48. Zero in on Transferring! Community college students who plan to transfer to UCI can have their admission assured as early as one year prior to the time they enroll through a program entitled Zero in On Transfer\u00ad ring! or \"ZOT!\" (nicknamed after the victory yell of UCI's mas\u00ad cot, the Anteater). This program assists students at selected \u00b7 Southern California community colleges to become eligible for admission and to complete most of the lower-division graduation requirements before they actually transfer. To participate in \"ZOT!\" students must be California residents, must have completed 24 semester units of transferrable course work with a minimum overall grade point average of 2.4, and must be ready to transfer to UCI within 18 months. Participants receive personalized guidance in determining their admission 'The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses completed with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 C)Uarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the University for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as follows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, I point; I and F, no points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. Nonresident Admission Requirements 41 status and in identifying specific courses to complete at their cur\u00ad rent college, along with UCI's written admission agreement. \"ZOT\" is available to all majors except Economics, Engineering, and Information and Computer Science. Effective fall 1991, there is a possibility that \"ZOT!\" will not be available to Psychology majors. Additional information is available from the Transfer Student Services Office, telephone (714) 856-7821, or from the counseling office or transfer center at participating community colleges. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree A student whose educational objective has changed substantially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admission to a program for a second degree. Admission as a can\u00ad didate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admis\u00ad sions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergradu\u00ad ates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and com\u00ad plete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (I) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination (see page 46); (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through r\u00b7 pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) com\u00ad posite score and three College Board Achievement Tests which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, level 1 or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. (The Achievement Test in Literature may not be substituted for the English composition test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to Cali\u00ad fornia residents only. To be considered for admission by examina\u00ad tion alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test if the test was taken prior to October 1989 and 27 if it was taken October 1989 or later. The total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. UC IRVINE - 1990-199142 Admission of International Students Nonresident Transfer Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the Univer\u00ad sity for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon successful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college-preparatory Eng\u00ad lish and three years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f' requirements). A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in those subjects, or, with a grade of Cor better, (1) one transferable course in English; (2) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language; (3) courses equivalent to high school elementary algebra, advanced algebra, and geometry; or a course in mathematics, such as trigonometry or statistics, for which advanced algebra is a prerequisite. The mathematics courses do not have to be transferable. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Califor\u00ad nia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a Univer\u00ad sity of California faculty member; is a spouse of military person\u00ad nel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or the last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California college or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 28 for information regarding residence classifica\u00ad tion for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. Admission of International Students The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. However, it is possible that international applicants to oversubscribed programs may not be offered admis\u00ad sion to either their first-choice campus or to another University of California campus. The application should be submitted to the University of California Undergraduate Application Processing Service early in the appropriate application filing period. Official certificates and detailed transcripts of records should be sub\u00ad mitted directly to the UCI Office of Admissions. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the appli\u00ad cant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than Eng\u00ad lish will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible applicants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Com\u00ad pletion of an acceptable English composition course (as deter\u00ad mined by the Office of Admissions) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for interna\u00ad tional applicants. Prospective students who wish to improve their English profi\u00ad ciency to meet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the inten\u00ad sive Program in English as a Second Language sponsored by University Extension. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in English as a Second Language, Univer\u00ad sity of California Extension, P.O. Box AZ, Irvine, CA 92716. See page 62 for additional information. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all international students must take an English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during the freshman year with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Univer\u00ad sity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. Interna\u00ad tional students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Students must also pay the International Student Health Insurance Fee, or have private insurance. See the Student Health Service section for additional information. Please direct all inquiries regarding .the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions. English Language Proficiency of Permanent Resident, Refugee, and International (F-1 Visa) Students: English as a Second Language Any student (a) whose first or native language is not English, (b) who has not satisfied the Universitywide Subject A require\u00ad ment, and (c) whose score on the verbal portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is 350 or less, or any such student without a verbal SAT score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, take an English as a Second Language Placement Test (ESLPT) prior to the first quar\u00ad ter of enrollment. Also, any student who is identified as an ESL student through the Universitywide Subject A Examination must take the ESLPT. The ESLPT is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Academic Advising and Orientation (\"0\") Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction, and on dates to be announced. Information concerning when and where the test will be given and the test itself can be obtained from the Program of Academic Support Services Office (telephone 714-856-6206) and the Office of English as a Second Language (telephone 714-856-6781 ). UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Admission of International Students 43 Commencement, the highlight of the academic year, is held each June in Aldrich Park. Based upon the results of the ESLPT, students may be required to enroll in ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writing courses. Students required to enroll in ESL courses must begin satisfying their ESL requirements within their first or second quarter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecu\u00ad tive quarters. The ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the ESL requirement by the end of their sixth quarter will be ineligi\u00ad ble to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject A must be sat\u00ad isfied during the quarter following the completion of ESL requirements. If the ESL requirements are completed during the first quarter of enrollment, the Subject A requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the fourth quarter of enrollment. ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. See page 174 for course descriptions. Credit for English-as-a-Second-Language Course Work Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for English-as-a-second~language course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution.

Advanced Placement The University wishes to encourage students to take demanding advanced courses in all academic fields. Information about honors-level courses that can be used to meet the Scholarship requirement is found on page 39. Advanced Placement courses completed during the last two years of high school qualify for honors grade points to a maximum of four units (eight semester courses). The accompanying chart shows Advanced Placement credit in satisfaction of UCI breadth and graduation requirements. Addi\u00ad tional use of Advanced Placement credit often is made on an individual basis. For information on the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment, please consult pages 55-57. Application Procedures Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Univer\u00ad sity are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, or from any University of California Admissions Office. Students applying for admission to UCI should complete the application and submit it according to the instructions provided in the 1990-91 Undergraduate Application Packet. A nonrefund\u00ad able application fee of $40 must accompany the application. This basic fee entitles the applicant to be considered at one campus; for each additional campus selected, an additional $40 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application UC IRVINE - 1990-199146 Application Procedures procedure questions specific to UCI should communicate directly with the Office of Admissions, 245 Administration Building, Uni\u00ad versity of California, Irvine, CA 92717. When to Apply for Admission To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other University campuses) and the student's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be filed during the priority filing period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Early filing is encouraged for students who plan to apply also for financial aid, University housing, or other special programs. Additionally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Completing the examination requirement (SAT or ACT and three Achievement Tests) no later than the December testing date of the senior year of high school is strongly recommended. Quarter to be Admitted at UCI Winter quarter, 1991 Spring quarter, 1991 Fall quarter, 1991 Winter quarter, 1992 Spring quarter, 1992 Priority Application Filing Dates File July 1-30, 1990 File October 1-30, 1990 File November 1-30, 1990 File July 1-30, 1991 File October 1-30, 1991 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. This means that some campuses may still be able to accept addi\u00ad tional applications and others may not. Adding a Campus If the campus or campuses being considered are still accepting applications, students may, after submitting their application, add additional campus choice(s) to that or those initially listed on their application. A $40 fee for each additional campus will be required. Students should contact the Admissions Office on the campus to be added for information on which programs are still open and the procedures for adding campuses. Students should be aware that processing an additional campus choice will take several weeks before the new campus actually receives the application and data. Students should also be aware that special program commitments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Pro\u00ad gram may vary from campus to campus. At UCI, the Office of Admissions notifies the Financial Aid and Housing Office about a student's request for these services after the application is received and processed at UCI. Students can communicate with the Housing or Financial Aid Office directly for information about deadlines, priorities, and availability of these services. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to\u00ad date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another col\u00ad lege or university. Freshman Applicants. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Applicants are also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the SAT or ACT tests and three Achievement Tests to the UCI Office of Admissions. An official final high school transcript-show\u00ad ing a statement of graduation also must be forwarded to the campus at which the student has deCided to register and enroll. Official final transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admissions by Sep\u00ad tember 1, 1990 for those students admitted for fall quarter, 1990. Those students entering in the winter or spring quarters must have their transcripts in the Office of Admissions within one month of the completion of the quarter in which they entered. A California Certificate of Proficiency, the results from a profi\u00ad ciency test from any state, or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Transfer Applicants. UCI admissions counselors evaluate data from the Transfer Self-Reported Academic Record in the applica\u00ad tion; however, transfer students also are advised to send trans\u00ad cripts from each college attended. In particular, a transcript from the student's current college which includes grades from the fall term should be sent to the Office of Admissions. Students also are responsible for notifying the Office of Admissions about any changes in their listing of courses in progress. Attendance at any other school or college after an application to the University has been filed is considered to be part of the student's record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, College Board/ ATP, P.O. Box 23470, Oakland, California 94623-0470, or College Board/ ATP, CN 6200, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6200, for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the test\u00ad ing services, not to the University.) At the same time the test is \u00b7 taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the UCI Office of Admissions. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is important to use precisely the same form of the stu\u00ad dent's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. In 1990-91 SAT and Achievement Tests are offered concurrently on the following Saturday mornings: October 13, 1990 (SAT only in January 26, 1991 California, Florida, Georgia, March 16, 1991 (SAT only) Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, May 4, 1991 South Carolina, and Texas) November 3, 1990 June 1 1991 December 1, 1990 The 1990-91 ACT Tests are offered on the following dates: October 27, 1990 Aprill3, 1991 December 8, 1990 June 8, 1991 February 9, 1991 Details on testing are available from the College Board, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Most fall quarter applicants are notified of their status between February 1 and March 15. Transfer applicants are usually notified by May 1. In many cases for transfer applicants, complete tran\u00ad scri'pts of course work are required before a final decision can be made. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall priority filing period (November 1-30). Those students who apply after the priority period will be notified as soon as possible after March 15. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Application Procedures 47 \" -- . Students are exposed to a broad spectrum of fundamental areas of intellectual experience through UCI's breadth requirement. The requirement's Humanistic Inquiry category addresses th~ arts, humanities, and literature. Statement of Intention to Register Students who are accepted for admission will receive, with their notification of admission, a Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) form. The SIR serves to notify each campus of the stu\u00ad dent's decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before completing and returning the form, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their responses to each cam\u00ad pus. However, it is essential that students allow enough time to meet the deadline for returning their SIR. Once they have decided on which campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonrefundable $100 deposit (if applicable) to the campus Admissions Office. Students should not submit a positive SIR to more than one campus. Additionally, once the positive SIR and fee have been received, the student cannot transfer to another UC campus. Freshman students entering in the fall quarter must return their positive SIR by May 1 or by the date indicated on the SIR. Transfer students entering in a fall quarter must return their posi\u00ad tive SIR by June 1, or, if admitted later, by the date indicated on the SIR. Students entering in a winter or spring quarter must return the SIR within three weeks from the date of their notification of admission. Admission to UC/ is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate appli\u00ad cations are required of applicants desiring financial aid or Univer\u00ad sity housing, and receipt of communications from the Financial Aid Office, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Admissions Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Part-Time Study UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part-time study opportunities are available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. For part-time study, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for graduate students; these limits include physical education units. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In approved part-time status, one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) are assessed. Undergraduate petitions are available from academic counselors or the Registrar's Office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Since there are certain restric\u00ad tions on receiving undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admissions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section. UC IRVINE - 1990-199148 Transfer Students Planning for Transfer to UCI The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the edu\u00ad cational needs of students who transfer from other California col\u00ad legiate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission of Transfer Students, page 40. It is recommended that transfer students complete as much of the lower-division breadth, school, and departmental requirements as soon as possible prior to transferring to UCI. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) California Community Colleges Students may find it advantageous or necessary to complete the first two years of a University of California undergraduate pro\u00ad gram at one of the California Community Colleges, which are an integral part of the State's system of higher education. High school graduates who cannot be accommodated at a University of California campus may choose to attend a community college and transfer to the University at a later time. A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's UC transfer course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the Uni\u00ad versity. Lists for each community college are updated every other year and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Transfer Student Services Office keep current copies of the lists and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While lim\u00ad itations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institutions. However, see page 55 for UCI graduation requirements, including requirements for units earned in resi\u00ad dence at this campus. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in resi\u00ad dence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the U ni\u00ad versity of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the resi\u00ad dence requirements of the University. Grades earned in Univer\u00ad sity Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses takeri in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the Univer\u00ad sity. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. ' The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific appli\u00ad cation of their courses to UCI's University, school, and depart\u00ad mental major requirements may be readily communicated to pro\u00ad spective transfer students. Students are urged to consult commu\u00ad nity college counselors or the Transfer Student Services Office for specific information on planning a program for transfer. The University of California publication entitled Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree Graduation requirements at UCI are in four categories: those for the University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are considered to be electives. See pages 54-57 for a fuller description of these requirements. Students transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, those subsequently passed, or those in effect when the student entered a previous collegiate institution, pro\u00ad vided entry was not more than four years prior to the time of transfer to UCI. 1. University of California Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions A detailed description of how these requirements may be satisfied is available on page 54. 2. UCI Breadth Requirement Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI breadth requirement through one of four ways: (a) completion of the cur\u00ad rent UCI breadth requirement, (b) completion of one of the options listed on page 49, (c) completion of the UC Transfer Core Curriculum, or (d) completion of the UCI breadth requirement in effect when the student entered a previous collegiate institution, provided entry was not more than four years prior to the time of transfer to UCI. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been mutually determined with a community college in accordance with the policies stated on page 55 as being acceptable toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Transfer Student Services Office about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. (A complete description of the breadth requirement may be found on pages 55-57.) With the exception of students who complete the UC Transfer Core Curriculum, transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must be completed prior to matriculating to UCI. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the under\u00ad graduate years, except in the case of the writing requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses to satisfy the lower-division and upper-division writ\u00ad ing requirements. a. Completion of the UCI Breadth Requirement The UCI breadth requirement consists of the following cate\u00ad gories: Writing; Natural Sciences; Social and Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathe\u00ad matics, or Computer Science; and Multicultural and International/ Global Studies. Students transferring to UCI should refer to pages 55-57 for guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth requirement. With the exception of Category I (Writing) and Category VII (Multicultural and International/Global Studies), a transfer stu\u00ad dent may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, JV, or V. I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by taking a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be com\u00ad pleted with a minimum grade of C, or a Pass, or Credit grade equivalent to C. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Any stu\u00ad dent entering UCI with only one semester or one quarter of Eng\u00ad lish composition through which the Subject A requirement is ful\u00ad filled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-and upper-division writ\u00ad ing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by (a) taking a year sequence (with or without a laboratory component) in one of the following areas: general biology, general chemistry, basic physics; or by (b) taking two-semester or three-quarter approved courses in biological sciences or physical sciences with the excep\u00ad tion of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement may be met by taking a year of work in any of the following areas: anthropology, comparative culture, economics, geography, politi\u00ad cal science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take an introductory course fol\u00ad lowed by a second course in the same area or an introductory Transfer Students 49 course from each of any two areas. Students on the quarter sys\u00ad tem may elect to take an introductory course followed by two courses in one area, or an introductory course followed by a second course in the same area plus an introductory course from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth require\u00ad ment, is not considered a social or behavioral science. (See IV, Humanistic Inquiry, below.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by taking a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative literature, women's studies, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. Note for Biological Sciences Majors: In satisfaction of the School of Biological Sciences Humanities requirement, students should fulfill breadth Category IV with one year of approved courses from the humanities or literature areas. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. This requirement may be met by taking a year sequence in one of the following areas: mathematics, logic, linguistics, computer science, or completion of the second year in a foreign language. Effective for freshmen entering college fall 1992 and there\u00ad after, the current breadth Category V will be separated into two categories: Mathematics and Symbolic Systems (Category V), which may be satisfied by a one-year approved sequence which teaches formal reasoning within sym\u00ad bolic systems (e.g., mathematics, logic, computer science, linguistics); and Language Other than English (Category VI), which may be satisfied by successful completion of one year (three quarters) of college-level study in any language other than English; three years of high school study in a single language other than English; a score of 3, 4, or 5 on any Advanced Placement (AP) examination in a language other than English; one year's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) in a non\u00ad English-speaking country; or the equivalent as deter\u00ad mined by appropriate and available means of evalua\u00ad tion. In fall 1993 the requirement will be increased to four quarters of college-level study or the equivalent. VII. Multicultural and International/Global Studies. This requirement may be met by completing: one course in multicul\u00ad tural studies and one course on international/global issues. Courses satisfying the multicultural requirement specifically address the history, society, and/or culture of one or more minor\u00ad ity groups in California and the United States. Courses satisfying the international/global requirement focus on significant cultural, economic, geographical, historical, political, and/or sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. Note for Chemistry. Mathematics, or Physics Majors: In addition to the courses taken to fulfill the UCI breadth requirement, stu\u00ad dents majoring in Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single , foreign language at the first level is acceptable. b. Other Options for Completing the UCI Breadth Requirement Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have UC IRVINE - 1990-199150 Transfer Students completed the general breadth requirements of that college will be considered, upon approval of petition, to have met the total breadth requirement of UCI except for the upper-division writing requirement. All transfer students who have met the general breadth requirements of any campus of the University of Califor\u00ad nia prior to transfer also will be regarded as having met the breadth requirement except for the upper-division writing requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program (plus the upper-division writing requirement), the current UCI breadth requirement, or the UCI breadth requirement in effect when the student entered a previous collegiate institution provided entry was not more than four years prior to transfer to UCI. c. Completion of the UC Transfer Core Curriculum Transfer students may fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing the UC Transfer Core Curriculum. The UC Transfer Core Curriculum consists of a series of subject areas and types of courses which, if completed prior to transfer, will satisfy the breadth and general education requirements at any campus of the University of California. Fulfillment of the UC Transfer Core Curriculum does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. It also may not necessarily satisfy UCI's school, departmental, or major requirements; this will depend upon which courses a transfer student chooses to take in meeting the UC Transfer Core Curriculum. Courses used to fulfill the UC Transfer Core Curriculum must be completed with a grade of Cor better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of Cor better.) Students who do not complete the UC Transfer Core Curriculum prior to transferring to UCI must fulfill the UCI breadth requirement in its entirety. Additional information is available from the Office of Admis\u00ad sions or the Transfer Student Services Office. Terms Units Subject Area Required Required I.

Physical and/ or 2 semesters or 7 semester units Biological Sciences 3 quarters Total 11 semesters or 34 semester 16 quarters units 1. Foreign Language: This requirement may be fulfilled by completion of two years of a foreign language in high school with a grade of Cor better, or equivalent proficiency demon\u00ad strated by college courses or performance tests, such as earn\u00ad ing a minimum score of 550 on an appropriate College Board Achievement Test in a foreign language. 2. English Composition: The English Composition require\u00ad ment must be fulfilled by completion of a one-year lower\u00ad division English composition sequence. Courses designed exclusively for satisfaction of remedial composition cannot be counted toward fulfillment of this requirement. 3. Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning: One-semester or two\u00ad quarter courses in mathematics or mathematical statistics. This requirement may be fulfilled by earning a minimum score of 600 on the Mathematics section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), or 550 on the College Board Achievement Test in Mathematics (Level I or Level II). Courses on the application of statistics to particular disciplines may not be used to fulfill this requirement. Courses taken to fulfill the breadth/general education requirements in the subject areas that follow, Art and Human\u00ad ities, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Physical and/or Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, should provide a broad foundation for understanding and learning to think critically, write, and speak about the biological and physical world and the most important features and accomplishments of civilization. In addition to knowledge and appreciation, courses should stress principles and concepts that unify knowledge as well as the methods of investigation that characterize specific disciplines. The following descriptions are examples of the types of courses that could be used to meet these requirements. 4. Arts and Humanities: Courses in drama, music, dance or the visual arts, history, literature, classical studies, religion, and philosophy may fulfill this requirement. At least one course must be in the arts and one in the humanities. Courses in the arts include performance or studio components; how\u00ad ever, courses that are primarily performance or studio art courses cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. 5. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Courses in anthropology, economics, ethnic studies, political sciences, psychology, soci\u00ad ology, or from an interdisciplinary social science sequence. 6. Physical and/or Biological Sciences: Courses in general biology, general chemistry, basic physics, or physical sciences (with the exception of mathematics). At least one of the courses must include a laboratory. 3. School Requirements Since school requirements occasionally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school requirement or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting specific lower-division requirements for breadth or the major. Although course equivalencies for the breadth require\u00ad ment may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. 4. Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in con\u00ad tent and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (~ee page 57 and departmental sections). Prospective transfer students should address specific inquiries about their programs to the respective schools or departments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Transfer Student Services Office. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Transfer Students 51 Just under 1,600 students attended the first day of classes at UCI on October 4, 1965. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991INFORMATION FOR ADMITTED STUDENTS Planning an Undergraduate Program Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate student is assigned to the school or program that offers the student's selected major. Students who have not declared a major receive assistance from the General Studies Advising Program until they select an academic major. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and aca\u00ad demic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a student is assigned. Each academic unit pro\u00ad vides academic advising for its students and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change majors. Students are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences L. Dennis Smith, Dean George Lauder, Associate Dean Wendell M. Stanley, Jr., Associate Dean- Undergraduate Affairs and Chief Academic Advisor Michael Chennault, Counselor Margaret Doedens, Counselor Cindy Eddleman, Counselor Jessica Henderson, Counselor Marsha Holland, Counselor Leticia Gonzalez-MacDonald, Counselor Marge Smith, Counselor Adelle Park, Counselor Carolyn C.

Pardoen, Associate Dean Undergraduate Student Affairs Allen Stubberud, School Administrator for Research and Graduate Studies Nancy DaSilva, Graduate Faculty Advisor for Biochemical Engineering Terese Olson, Graduate Faculty Advisor for Civil Engineering Leonard Ferrari, Graduate Faculty Advisor for 331 SH 112 ICEF While each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising, these systems differ from unit to unit. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper-division students) assist students in many of the same areas as academic counselors. In addition, they are able to answer questions relating to student life issues, providing a stu\u00ad dent perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; how\u00ad ever, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see separate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief aca\u00ad demic advisor or the dean of the unit. Electrical and Computer Engineering 208A IERF New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an academic counselor shortly after being admitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the requirements for graduation. ' In some schools and programs, consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, stu\u00ad dents are responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic con\u00ad tact with their assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial contact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. Thereafter, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quarter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be deter\u00ad mined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up their Class Verifica\u00ad tion and Identification Card. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes.

The focal point of each of these programs is the development of analytical and research skills through the pursuit of research under faculty supervision. Additional infor\u00ad mation is included in the sections on these majors. Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study Undergraduate students ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their aca\u00ad demic programs, a\u00b7nd they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Furthermore, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language or other special requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended gradu\u00ad ate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the graduate advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of inter\u00ad est. Also; the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. Supplementary Educational Programs There are several supplementary educational opportunities avail\u00ad able to students at UCI: University Extension, Summer Sessions, the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program, the Army ROTC. program, the Naval ROTC program, the Edu\u00ad cation at Home Program, and the Center for International Edu\u00ad cation. The Education at Home Program is a Universitywide activity which enables participants interested in early American history and culture to spend a quarter in Williamsburg, Virginia; Philadelphia; and Washington, D.C. The Center for International Education includes the Education Abroad Program and the International Opportunities Program. The Education Abroad Program is a Universitywide activity which offers students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making pro\u00ad gress toward degree requirements. The International Opportuni\u00ad ties Program is a campuswide activity which helps students explore the wide range of opportunities available for going abroad. For further information on each of these programs, see pages 62-67. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree There are four requirements that must be met to obtain a bacca\u00ad laureate degree from UCI: University, UCI, School, and depart\u00ad mental. Each is described below. University Requirements I. English (\"Subject A\"). Every undergraduate must demonstrate upon entrance to the University an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: a. Achieving a grade 5, 4, or 3 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or b. Achieving a score of 600 or better in the College Board English Composition Achievement Test; or c. Completing the California State University English Equiva\u00ad lency Test with \"Pass for Credit\"; or d. Entering the University with credentials from another col\u00ad lege which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English composition with a grade of C or better. NOTE: High school English courses will not satisfy this option. Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the beginning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the require\u00ad ment by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. Students enrolled in Humanities 20A-B-C-D (Writing for Students for Whom English is a Second Language) must enroll in a Subject A course (English and Comparative Literature WR39A or Humani\u00ad ties lAS/A) immediately after they are authorized to do so. This requirement may be met after admission by one of the fol\u00ad lowing three options: a. Passing the Universitywide Subject A Examination given on May 12 (and on subsequent dates) to all entering freshmen admitted for fall quarter, 1990 (see page 25). Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement should con\u00ad tact the UCI Composition Program Office (220 Humanities Office Building) for evaluation; telephone (714) 856-6717. b. Enrolling in sections of the Humanities Core Course desig\u00ad nated ... S/A.\" (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in aS/A section of the Core Course during their first quarter. Successful com\u00ad pletion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. Students who do not receive a C or better in Humanities lAS/A in fall quarter and who continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Humanities IB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a C or better. Like all courses used to satisfy the Subject A requirement, S/ A sections of the Humanities Core Course must be elected for a letter grade.) c. Taking English and Comparative Literature WR39A and receiving a letter grade of at least a C in that course (the Pass/Not Pass option may not be used to satisfy the Subject A requirement). This option is available only to those students who score below 600 on the College Board English Composi\u00ad tion Achievement Test and who have followed neither option (a) or (b) above. Once a student matriculates at UCI, the student may not offer a transfer course from another institution to satisfy the Sub\u00ad ject A requirement. 2. American History and Institutions. This requirement may be met by one of the following: a. Completion in high school of one year of United States his\u00ad tory with grades of Cor better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better. b. Receiving a score of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. c. Receiving a score of 500 or higher in the College Board Achievement Test in American History and Social Studies. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991d. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the require\u00ad ment at another California institution. e. Completion at another institution of one year of college\u00ad level United States history with grades of Cor better, or one course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of C or better. f. Completion at UCI, with a grade of C or better, of History 10 and either Political Science 23D or 25C. UCI Requirements 3. Credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units, earned by exami\u00ad nation, by other evaluation, or course work. A course nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit. 4. A grade average of at least C (2.0). 5. Candidates for the baccalaureate must attain at least a C (2.0) average in all of the courses required in the major program and at least a C (2.0) average in the upper-division courses required in the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major pro\u00ad gram may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privi\u00ad lege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) 6. Credit for the last 36 units of work immediately preceding graduation must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmen\u00ad tal approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of entrance or those subsequently passed after entrance. Students transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as gradua\u00ad tion requirements those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, those subsequently passed, or those in effect when the student entered a previous collegiate institution, provided entry was not more than four years prior to the time of transfer to UCI. Students who transfer from a four-year insti\u00ad tution and who have completed the general breadth require\u00ad ments of that college, upon approval of petition, will be con\u00ad sidered to have met the total breadth requirement of UCI except for the upper-division writing requirement. Transfer students who have completed the UC Transfer Core Curricu\u00ad lum prior to transfer will be considered to have met the UCI breadth requirement except for the upper-division writing requirement. Transfer students who have met the general breadth requirement of any UC campus prior to transfer also will be regarded as having met the breadth requirement except for the upper-division writing requirement. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than three consecutive quar\u00ad ters after withdrawing from student status q:~ust adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. 8. Breadth Requirement. Candidates for the bachelor's degree must satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. The requirement is \u00b7 designed to ensure that UCI graduates will have been exposed to a broad spectrum of fundamental areas of intellectual expe\u00ad rience. It is a graduation requirement and therefore need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: Writing; Natural Sciences; Social and Behavioral Sciences; Humanistic Inquiry; Language, Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree/Breadth Requirement 55 UC/' s parklike grounds provide a scenic backdrop for the campus' growing sculpture collection. Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science; and Multicultural and International/Global Studies. The specific course combinations and sequences in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses listed are available in more than one academic unit. Students should refer to the actual descriptions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These course combinations were selected to ensure the following: (I) that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an academic area and (2) that in meeting the requirement students be exposed to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. With the exception of Category I (Writing) and Category VII (Multicultural and International/Global Studies), a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, IV, or V. Students fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing courses from the list which follows. The courses in the list are grouped according to which aspect of the breadth requirement they cover. Students can select from among a variety of courses, depending upon their area of interest. Some of the course combinations available consist of multiple-quarter courses (such as Chemistry lA-B-C under the Chemistry sub\u00ad section of \"II. Natural Sciences\"). Multiple-quarter courses UC IRVINE - 1990-199156 Breadth Requirement are referred to as being \"sequential,\" meaning that the course work in the earlier courses is prerequisite to the later course work. Students must take each part of a sequential course in alphabetical order (e.g., students must take Chemistry IA before either 1 B or I C). Sequential courses are separated by hyphens. Other course combinations consist of single-quarter courses (e.g., Social Sciences 2A, 2B, 2C under the Anthro\u00ad pology subsection of \"III. Social and Behavioral Sciences\") which are related to one another but for which no course in the combination is preparatory to any other course in the combination. Single-quarter course combinations may be taken in any order. Single-quarter courses are separated by commas. Semicolons separate complete course combinations. I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to devel\u00ad oping the verbal skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this commitment, but the concern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected of faculty and students in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower\u00ad division requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper\u00ad division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR39B (Expository Writing) and English and Comparative Literature WR39C (Argument and Research). 2. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) beyond satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a section of the Core Course designated S/A during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sec\u00ad tions of this course with a grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. For these students, the lower-division writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course. Students who do not receive a Cor better in Humanities lAS/A in fall quarter and continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Humanities IB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a Cor better. The lower-division writ\u00ad ing requirement will be satisfied in the second and third quar\u00ad ters of the Humanities Core Course for these students.) 3. Students who complete English and Comparative Literature WR39B with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing or nonfiction and journalism: English and Comparative Literature WR30, WR31, WR32, or WR38. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper\u00ad division requirement must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. English and Comparative Literature WRI39W. 2. An upper-division course in nonfiction and journalism or creative writing. Such courses frequently have special prereq\u00ad uisites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the requirement. Note: All courses approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement should have a \"W\" suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper\u00ad division writing requirment course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not satisfy the upper-division writing requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). Juniors and seniors will be exempted from the upper-division course requirement if they successfully complete the-Upper\u00ad Division Exemption Examination in English Composition. This exam may be taken only once. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 70 for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course com\u00ad bination from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from Biological Sciences lA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, IG, 45, 79, 80, 81. Chemistry: Chemistry IA-B-C and ILB-LC or ILAE-LBE. Interdisciplinary: Physics 20C, 200; 17 A-B one course 16, or 20A, 20B, 20C, 200. Social Ecology: Social Ecology E3, E4, E5. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. Students must select three courses from one of the following areas, or two courses from one area plus a third from another area. The first course taken in any area must be an introductory course numbered 1-12, or, in the case of Comparative Culture, 70A, 70B, and 70C. Anthropology: 5B, 5C; 180. Ecology H20A-B-C or Social Sciences (if Political Science 26B has not been taken). Psychology: Ecology Psychology - 1990-1991IV. Humanistic Inquiry. Students must select a three-course series from one of the following three areas: Arts: Art History 35A-B-C; Art History 40A-B-C; Art History Art Philosophy 1, 4, 5; Philosophy 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; History 60, Philosophy 60, and either History 186 or Philosophy 160. Literature: Classics 50A-B-C; East Asian Languages and Litera\u00ad tures 50A-8-C or 60 A-B-C; English and Comparative 50A-B-C; English and Comparative Literature E6, E7, E8; English and Comparative Literature E 28A-B-C; French 50A-B\u00ad C; Russian 20, 30, 40; Spanish 50A-B-C. Note for Biological Sciences Majors: In satisfaction of the School of Biological Sciences Humanities requirement, students should fulfill_ breadth Category IV with one year of approved courses from the humanities or literature areas. V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. Students must select a three-course series from one of the following four areas: Computer Science: ICS 21, 22, 23. Foreign Languages: Chinese 2A-B-C; Classics 2A-B-C; French 2A-B-C; German 2A~8-C; Greek 25, 101, 102; Italian 2A-B-C; Japanese 2A-B-C; Latin 25, 101, 102; Portuguese !A-B-C plus three upper-division Portuguese courses chosen from among 140A-B through 145; Russian 2A-B-C; Spanish 2A-8-C. Linguistics: Linguistics 50 and two courses from Linguistics 1 10, 120, or Psychology 50A. Logic and Mathematics: Mathematics 2A-B and either 2C, 7, or 13; Mathematics 6A, 68, 6C; Philosophy 30A-B and either 31, 32, or l30A; Social Sciences IIA-B-C; Social Sciences IOOA-B-C. Effective for freshmen entering college fall 1992 and there\u00ad after, the current breadth Category V will be separated into two categories: Mathematics and Symbolic Systems (Category V), which may be satisfied by a one-year approved sequence which teaches formal reasoning within sym\u00ad bolic systems (e.g., mathematics, logic, computer science, linguistics); and Language Other than English (Category VI), which may be satisfied by successful completion of one year (three quarters) of college-level study in any language other than English; three years of high school study in a single language other than English; a score of 3, 4, or 5 on any Advanced Placement (AP) examination in a lan\u00ad guage other than English; one year's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) in a non-English\u00ad speaking country; or the equivalent as determined by appropriate and available means of evaluation. In fall 1993 the requirement will be increased to four quarters of college-level study or the equivalent. VII. Multicultural and InternationaVGiobal Studies. Students must select one course in multicultural studies and one course in internationaVglobal studies from the following: German IOOA-B-C, 101, 117, Sociology 61X, 161G. In completing breadth Category VII, students may use courses which are also being used in fulfillment of other breadth categories. Many of the above courses are cross-listed with courses in other units. When a breadth requirement course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. Note for Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics Majors: In addition to the courses taken to fulfill the UCI breadth requirement, stu\u00ad dents majoring in Chemistry, Mathematics, or Physics are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 49 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. School and Departmental Requirements In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Some restrictions exist. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Information on specific degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. Students should have declared a major no later than the begin\u00ad ning of their junior year, having made certain that the back\u00ad ground and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Academic Advising for Planning an Undergraduate Program; transfer stu\u00ad dents should also read the section on Planning for Transfer to UCI. UC IRVINE - 1990-199158 Enrollment and Other Procedures Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no Jess than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing an Application for Graduation are estab\u00ad lished quarterly by each academic unit so that candidates' aca\u00ad demic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Please refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes for these deadlines. Enrollment and Other Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Additional information concerning en\u00ad rollment and academic policies applying only to graduate stu-\u00b7 dents is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other super\u00ad vised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enrollment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's En\u00ad rollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and received by the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. Registration materials are available from the Registrar's Office approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration materials is the En\u00ad rollment in Classes Petition. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instructions in the Schedule of Classes. A quar\u00ad terly calendar of dates for submission of enrollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The Schedule of Classes booklet is distributed to new and contin\u00ad uing students and also may be purchased at the University Book\u00ad store approximately six weeks prior to the beginning of each quarter. The general procedures for enrollment are: I. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. \u00b7 New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orien\u00ad tation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for aca\u00ad demic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines and submit the completed class enrollment and updated student information forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obli\u00ad gations must be satisfied at this time also. NOTE: If either fees or the Enrollment in Classes Petition are not submitted by the deadline, -students are required to enroll in classes using the Add-card procedure. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment materials, a Class Verification and Identification (CV & ID) card is available for each student. The card lists the courses in which a student is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be scheduled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in Group discussion sessions augment formal class lectures and pro\u00ad vide students with the opportunity to exchange ideas in a more casual setting. the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the CV & ID card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grad\u00ad ing Option cards, available from the student's academic counsel\u00ad ing office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students obtain their CV & ID card in their academic counseling offices, where they may also obtain advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instructions on where to secure their cards. The CV & ID card is certification of the student's class enroll\u00ad ment and is evidence that the student is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the card provides iden\u00ad tification for Associated Students functions. If the card is lost, there is a $3 replacement charge. Inquiries regarding the replace\u00ad ment of lost cards should be directed to the Registrar's Office. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Petition to the Registrar's Office during the published period aresubject to a late service fee. The late service fee is graduated. Between the deadline and the end of the second week of classes, the late ser\u00ad vice fee is $25. Thereafter it increases to $50. A signature of the student's dean is required for late enrollment. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for fee payment are subject to a late service fee. This fee is also graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. The student is subject to both late service fees (either $50 or $100) if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the Enrollment in Classes Petition is not returned to the Registrar's Office by the deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, stu\u00ad dents are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Regis\u00ad trar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic counseling office or the Registrar's Office. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change transac\u00ad tions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, pay the service charge (if applicable), carefully complete the Add card, and sub\u00ad mit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. The dated signature of the instructor is always required and is valid for 10 working days. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period Enrollment and Other Procedures 59 must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and sub\u00ad mit the card to the Registrar's Office. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's aca\u00ad demic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's and the dean's sig\u00ad natures of approval, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class they attend. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card m:Ist be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. Students are urged to verify their official enrollment early in the quarter. Students enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with enrollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enrollment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. NOTE: Instructors and deans may have earlier deadlines than those mentioned above. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the stu\u00ad dent's records and the student will be entitled to no further ser\u00ad vices of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records \u00b7 The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the academic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their academic record quarterly. (Student grade reports are available at the UC IRVINE - 1990-199160 Enrollment and Other Procedures Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quarter.) Discre\u00ad pancies in the academic record should be reported to the Regis\u00ad trar immediately. After one year, it is assumed that the student accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. When the degree has been certi\u00ad fied by the student's dean, a student's academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical error on the part of the instructor has occurred. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; tele\u00ad phoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents\u00ad UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 per copy. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose trans\u00ad cript is being sought can be honored only (1) if the request is accompanied by a written authorization signed by the student whose transcript is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Regis\u00ad trar. Such transcripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical College Application Service (AM CAS). Such transcripts cannot be released to the person making the request in the student's stead. When a student orders a transcript to be sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status There is a $3 fee for each verification of student status performed by the Registrar's Office either at the window or by mail. Needs for which such verifications are performed include reference checks, bank loans, applications for good-student-driver insur\u00ad ance rates, and Social Security payments. For verification pur\u00ad poses, enrollment in 12 units or more in regular sessions is con\u00ad sidered to be full-time status; enrollment in eight units is con\u00ad sidered to be half-time status. Summer session enrollment in eight units is considered to be full-time status. Diplomas Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is about four months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then pick up their diplomas at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to send their diplo\u00ad mas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations outside the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $10 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All out\u00ad standing debts due to the University, with the exception of long\u00ad term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. See Commencement, pages 61 and 78. Cancellation/Withdrawal Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form, together with their identification card for the current quarter, to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean and, for undergraduate stu\u00ad dents, the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medi\u00ad cine. This form serves two purposes: (I) a refund of fees, if appli\u00ad cable (see Fee Refund section); and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal used in determining the percen\u00ad tage of fees to be refunded is the date on which the student sub\u00ad mits the withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office or to the Cur\u00ad ricular Affairs Office. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which enroll\u00ad ment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of withdrawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. (See W notation under Grading System section.) A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the Cancellation/Withdrawal form and an application for a Leave of Absence. Further information about leaves of absence and cancellation/withdrawals appears in the Research and Grad\u00ad uate Studies section. If an undergraduate student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of withdrawal is not necessary. See page 30 for information on fee refunds. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the policy below in for\u00ad mulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. To apply for readmission, a stu\u00ad dent must first pay a nonrefundable $40 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office, and then file an Application for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired. Readmission is subject to dean's approval and campus deadlines (August I for fall quarter, November I for winter quarter, and February I for spring quarter). If a student has been academically disqualified from the Univer\u00ad sity or has left the University while on probation or subject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmission in the manner prescribed above. The application, however, will be for\u00ad warded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about aca\u00ad demic life, and/or that the student has displayed capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be sub\u00ad mitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $40 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be att\u00ad ached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Intercampus Visitor: Undergraduates Only \\ currently registered UCI undergraduate student in good stand\u00ad ing may apply for intercampus visitor status at another campus of the University for one quarter. Forms and instructions are available at the Registrar's Office. California Residence All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the establish\u00ad ment of California residence (including exceptions pertaining to minors, aliens, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Regis\u00ad trar's Office, 215 Administration Building, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine, CA 92717, (714) 856-6129 or the Office of the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters, 300 Lakeside Drive, 7th Floor, University of California, Oakland, CA 94612-3550. Please refer to the Fees section for information on the Nonresident Tuition Fee and California residence. Commencement Students who graduate any quarter of the academic year may participate in the year-end graduation ceremony. Commencement protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in late spring and also is available in the office of each academic counse\u00ad lor. See Diplomas, page 60. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate counseling office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing an Application for Graduation are established quarterly by each academic unit so that candi\u00ad dates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all gradua\u00ad tion requirements have been met. These dates vary among aca\u00ad demic units. Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplementary Educational Programs Orientation Orientation programs include Academic Advising and Orienta\u00ad tion Week, held in the fall; the Student-Parent Orientation Pro\u00ad gram (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; and Uni-Prep, a five-day, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills. All of these programs are sponsored by the Student Support Services Office, 209 Administration Building; telephone (714) 856-7759. Academic Advising and Orientation Week, commonly known as \"0-Week,\" offers academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the begin\u00ad ning of fall quarter classes. Students who enroll later in the aca\u00ad demic year (winter or spring quarter) participate in an abbre\u00ad viated orientation prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter. Student-Parent Orientation Programs (SPOP) are held three dif\u00ad ferent times during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new students with their registration materials and offers informative sessions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing -choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in residence halls for the program. There is a fee for the program that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about SPOP in the spring. Orientation, Campus Publications 61 Uni-Prep is a five-day program for entering students held in early September. Participants live in the residence halls and attend workshops and other activities designed to provide them with information about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about Uni-Prep in the spring; Major Campus Publications Several major publications available on campus provide informa\u00ad tion about academic programs, student activities and services, en\u00ad rollment in classes, and specifics pertaining to the individual departments and schools. Some of these publications are described here; others are listed in the UCI Student Handbook published each fall. The UCI General Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and the courses they offer, degree requirements, major requirements, the UCI breadth requirement, and various academic policies and procedures (see page 15). The Catalogue is published in mid-July, and copies are available by mail and in person. The copies cost $4.50 each if purchased at the University Bookstore or from University Extension. (See page 363 for the pricing of mailed copies.) Because the Catalogue is prepared well in advance of each academic year, some information in it may not be current. Current information on specific courses offered is available in the Schedule of Classes and in quarterly information published by various academic units. Schedule of Classes The Schedule of Classes contains current information on fees, how to enroll in classes, and final examination schedules. Most importantly, it lists all classes to be offered each quarter and the time, room, and instructor scheduled for each. If there are any enrollment restrictions on the class, such as consent of instructor required, these are noted. Just prior to the first day of instruction for each quarter, the Registrar's Office issues an addendum to the Schedule that lists added and canceled classes; changes in time, instructor, or classroom assignments; and other information. Because the Schedule is published several times each academic year, it is a timely source of information on new policies and procedures, or changes in fees or procedures, that could not be included in the Catalogue because of the latter's less frequent publication schedule. Except for the fall edition, the Schedule of Classes is published just before the beginning of each quarter; the fall Schedule is available in mid-spring for the convenience of students already attending UCI who will be continuing at UCI in the fall. The Schedule is distributed to new and continuing students when Reg\u00ad istration Packets are distributed and also is available for purchase from the University Bookstore for 30<!:. Departmental and School Announcements Publications by schools and academic departments contain information regarding a wide assortment of academic informa\u00ad tion of immediate, timely interest to students, and all students are strongly urged to read them. The publications come in various forms, from brochures of several pages to one-sheet photocopied announcements, and contain information specific to the individ\u00ad ual academic unit. These publications usually are posted on departmental bulletin boards, are available in academic counse\u00ad lors' offices, or can be obtained from departmental offices.

ROTC/Education Abroad Program 63 Center for International Education The Center for International Education includes the Education Abroad Program and International Opportunities Program. The Center is a comprehensive resource and counseling center which helps students take advantage of the many worldwide opportuni\u00ad ties that exist for study, work, internship, volunteering, and research. Participating in an international educational experience typically introduces students to ways of thinking different from their own, broadens their understanding of the historical and contemporary world, sharpens their interest in particular fields, and enhances their overall intellectual development. The Center is located in 1010 Student Services II; telephone (714) 856-6343. Education Abroad Program The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia offers upper-division students the opportunity to expe\u00ad rience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world. Admission of University of California undergraduate students is subject to the following qualifications: a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the time of application; junior standing by departure (except for specific short-term programs); completion of language courses as required, with an overall minimum grade point average of 3.0 or the equivalent; and the recommendation of the campus EAP Selection Committee. Prior language study is recommended for participants in several programs and is required for certain other programs. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, his\u00ad tory, government, or social institutions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain sub\u00ad stantially from first-hand academic experience. Classes in the natural and physical sciences, engineering, and in computer sci\u00ad ence are available at selected host institutions. In addition, what\u00ad ever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their out\u00ad look and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign coun\u00ad try. Study abroad allows students to experience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making pro\u00ad gress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books, and personal expenses. The only additional costs directly related to the Program are for round-trip transportation and vacation travel, and personal expenses beyond what normally would be spent at home. Most University of California financial aid, including grants, scholarships, and loans, is available to EAP students who qualify. Most EAP participants going to Pacific\u00ad region countries receive UC scholarships which are awarded on a merit basis. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so application for EAP usually is made in the sophomore year. However, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth\u00ad year seniors or as second-year graduate students. Students inter\u00ad ested in EAP should contact the EAP Office early in the fall quarter concerning application deadlines. Students interested in short-term study and work programs, field research, educational travel, or volunteer projects are referred to the International Opportunities Program description (see page 67); An informative brochure and application forms for EAP are available from the Center for International Studies Office; 1010 Student Services II; telephone (714) 856-6343. UC IRVINE - 1990-199164 Education Abroad Program Academic Program. Generally, EAP students attend courses taught by faculty of the host university in the language of the host country; thus, language skills are very important. The aca\u00ad demic program includes (I) an intensive course in the language of the host country, if applicable (this does not apply to programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hungary, India, Kenya, Egypt, and Taiwan, in which English is the language); (2) a full year of academic courses (although a few shorter programs are available); and (3) opportunity to audit courses within the host university. Students may go to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Israel, Hong Kong, Korea, Thailand, or Indonesia with no prior knowledge of these countries' languages, but must spend the summer in intensive language programs which prepare them in the language for the academic year. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to complete a minimum of 36 units during the academic year in addition to units earned in the intensive lan\u00ad guage program. Although units and grade points earned through the EAP are incorporated into the participant's University transcript and grade point average, the academic uniUn which the participant's major is offered determines which EAP courses will be accepted in satisfaction of requirements for the specific major. A number of majors require that certain key upper-division courses be com\u00ad pleted in residence at UCI. EAP participants who satisfy all degree requirements while abroad and who expect to graduate upon completion of their year abroad should file for candidacy to receive their degree in September because, unfortunately, grades from abroad take time to reach the home campus and are not received in time for EAP returnees to be included on the June degree list. Such returnees, however, may participate in June Commencement. Study Centers. The courses and fields of study open to EAP par\u00ad ticipants vary at each center, and some vary from quarter to . quarter.

Language requirements for admission to this program are (a) two years of university-level Portuguese language study or the equivalent, (b) one year of university-level Spanish language study and one-year of university-level Portuguese language study, or (c) twci years of university\u00ad level Spanish language study and completion of an intensive course in Portuguese language study prior to departure. A compulsory intensive language program precedes the beginning of the academic year. University of Sao Paulo: Brazilian literature, Portuguese language, arts, economics, humanities, and social sciences courses are available. (This is a cooperative program with the University of Indiana.) Costa Rica. Three different programs are offered. University of Costa Rica (San Jose): Participants study for the academic year which is from March through December. Students take regular uni\u00ad versity courses in the humanities and social sciences, and at least half of their course work is related to Central America. All classes are taught in Spanish. The Medical Program is a seven-week program for fourth-year medical students in the winter quarter and first-year medical students in the summer. It includes language and community and family health clin\u00ad ical studies at the University ofCosta Rica. Monteverde Institute: Tropical Biology Program during the spring quar\u00ad ter is offered to students who meet certain biology prerequisites to study tropical biology in the rain forest of Monteverde. Previous Spanish lan\u00ad guage study is preferred. Mexico. Three programs are offered. Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City: Students have the option of spending one semester (two UC quarters) or a full year at UNAM. A compulsory intensive language program pre\u00ad cedes the beginning of the academic year, augmented by courses in con\u00ad temporary Mexico (history, art, literature). A wide variety of social sci\u00ad ences and humanities courses are available. All instruction is in Spanish. A month-long volunteer work field placement in a community outside of Mexico City is an integral part of this program. Study and Field Experience: The program is available in either the fall or spring quarter and begins in Mexico City with six weeks of intensive lan\u00ad guage courses and a course on contemporary Mexico. The final weeks of the program are spent doing volunteer work in a community outside of Mexico City to complement formal course work. San Nicolas de Hildalgo University of Michoacan (Morelia): The Summer Intensive Language and Society quarter provides total immer\u00ad sion in Mexican society and Spanish language instruction. Students must have completed one year of university-level Spanish language study before departure. Because instruction is at the second-year level the pro\u00ad gram is not appropriate for advanced students in Spanish. Peru. A compulsory intensive language course precedes the beginning of the academic year. All courses are taught in Spanish. Pontifica Universidad Catolica del Peru (Lima): Humanities, social sciences, anthropology, archaeology, and ethnohistory are subjects of special interest. (This is a program of the Peru Consortium, which is composed of the University of Indiana and a number of California universities.) South Pacific In the Southern Hemisphere, the academic year extends from the begin\u00ad ning of instruction in early March through the examination period, which starts in November. UC participants leave in February and do not enroll in UC classes during the winter term preceding departure. Australia. Students may study at one of nine universities: Australian National University (Canberra), Flinders University (Adelaide), La UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Education at Home Program 67 Asian Week, a campus celebration of cultural diversity, is one of the annual events sponsored by the Cross-Cultural Center. Trobe University (Melbourne), Monash University (Melbourne), Univer\u00ad sity of Adelaide, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales (Sydney), University of Sydney, and University of Wollongong .. Students may indicate a preference for the host university, but final assignment is based on a student's academic field and space availability in a given department. Once accepted, students are expected to concen\u00ad trate ori their major or closely allied field. Students of most academic disciplines can be accommodated in one of the universities. New Zealand. Students may study at one of five universities: Lincoln College, Christchurch; Massey University, Palmerston North; University of Auckland; University of Otago, Dunedin; and Victoria University, \u00b7 Wellington. Students may indicate a preference for the host university, but final assignment is based on a student's academic field and space availability in a given department. Most academic disciplines can be accommodated. North America Canada University of British Columbia (V~ncouver): The program consists of courses in the students' major or an allied field through the regular uni\u00ad versity system. Most disciplines can be accommodated. The University is renowned for its teaching and research in forestry, biotechnology, microelectronics and lasers, international business, computer technology, and Pacific Rim studies. All instruction is in English. International Opportunities Program The International Opportunities Program (lOP) provides infor\u00ad mation and advice to students who are interested in international study, short-term employment, field research, volunteer work, internships, scholarships, or educational travel abroad. lOP differs from the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP) in that (I) lOP participants can stay abroad for shorter time peri\u00ad ods (e.g\u00b7., a summer, an academic quarter) as well as longer peri\u00ad ods (for one academic year or longer); (2) it offers programs in countries in which EAP does not have study centers; and (3) the language, grade point average, and class standing requirements vary. lOP helps students enroll directly in foreign institutions, partici\u00ad pate in study-abroad programs sponsored by a variety of U.S. colleges and universities, or enroll directly in independent lan\u00ad guage schools. Students who go abroad through the lOP are elig\u00ad ible to earn transferrable credit from the sponsoring institution. To acquaint students with opportunities abroad, lOP sponsors the yearly \"International Opportunities Fair,\" and periodic seminars. It also maintains a library of international resources and governmental publications, as well as a data base to assist students in locating opportunities abroad. lOP is located in IOIO Student Services II Building; telephone (714) 856-8657. Education at Home Program In winter quarter the University's Riverside campus will continue the Education at Home Program (EHP) for those students with special interest in early American history and culture. Those selected for participation in this program will spend nine weeks in Williamsburg, Virginia; one in Philadelphia; and a concluding week in Washington, D.C. The program is open to all under\u00ad graduates from all campuses in the University of California sys\u00ad tem. With the prior approval of their graduate advisor, graduate students also may apply. Participants register for three courses through the Riverside campus' Department of History (History 157, 158, 159). Special arrangements for additional independent study (maximum of four units) may be made with the student's home campus. Costs for housing: food, and transportation are the individual participant's responsibility. Further information, brochures, and an application form is available from the Educa\u00ad tion at Home Program Office; telephone (714) 787-3820. Prefer\u00ad ence is given to applications received by June 30. UC IRVINE - 1990-199168 Academic Regulations and Procedures Academic Regulations and Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Additional information concerning academic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained permanently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as academic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional or gradu\u00ad ate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their enroll\u00ad ment and academic records and may do so throughout the aca\u00ad demic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since all data entries for each student's current quarter class en\u00ad rollment are put directly into the academic record system from source documents completed by the student, it is extremely important for each student to complete these source documents (e.g., Enrollment in Classes Petition and Add/Drop/Change cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regula\u00ad tions specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automatically be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regulation IR 345). Grading System A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B ~ Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate stu\u00ad dents only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR ~ No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instructor, at the student's request, may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop the class, which would result in the NR becoming a W). UR-Unauthorized Repeat. A UR notation is recorded for the grade when a student already has a passing grade for a nonrepeatable course and has repeated the course again. W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus and minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, except the A+ grade which carries grade points equivalent to the A grade, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of cer\u00ad tain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of bacca\u00ad laureate credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an aver\u00ad age of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI normally' offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the fol\u00ad lowing text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course taken for a letter grade times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. Baccalaureate credit counts toward degree requirements and is used to compute the grade point average. Workload credit is used to determine full-time status for financial aid, housing, student loans, and other purposes. For most courses at UCI, baccalau\u00ad reate credit and workload credit are identical. Courses differing in this credit or \"workload credit only\" courses are identified in the course description. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Cleri\u00ad cal or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. No grade may be revised by reexamination or, with the exception of I and IP grades, by completing additional work. If a student is dissatisfied with a grade, the student should review their work with the instructor and receive an explanation of the grade assigned. A grade may be appealed on any reasonable grounds to the instruc\u00ad tor, the chair of the department, and the dean/director/chair of the school/program. If the matter is not resolved, the student may go for counsel to the Office of the University Ombudsman. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instruc\u00ad tor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incom\u00ad plete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been temporarily excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear per\u00ad manently on the record. The student should consult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instructor UC IRVINE - 1990-1991is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the student and the instructor pre\u00ad pare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is com\u00ad pleted within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the counseling office of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete grade. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year fol\u00ad lowing the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are I's treated as Fs. If the student's overall aver\u00ad age is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. PassiN ot Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on a student's permanent record. How\u00ad ever, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candi\u00ad dates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/ Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course require\u00ad ments of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are Academic Regulations and Procedures 69 not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction of the quarter. 5. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option unless the course is offered on that basis only. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual grad\u00ad uate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. With the approval of the Graduate Council, certain graduate courses are graded S/U Only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quar\u00ad ter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or l (or if an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent, a grade of P or NP). The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or bet\u00ad ter. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quar\u00ad ter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Committee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent en\u00ad rollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript nota\u00ad tions are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. UC IRVINE - 1990-199170 Academic Regulations and Procedures Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, I point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit, with the excep\u00ad tion of the A+ grade which is assigned 4 points per unit. Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one. to 12 units each (see departmen\u00ad tal course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total unit value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades, as well as workload credit, are excluded in computing grade point average. Repetition of Courses Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received or when the course has been approved for repetition. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned. All courses which were originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/ Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a let\u00ad ter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. If a student repeats a course for which a passing grade has already been received and the course is not approved as repeat\u00ad able for credit, the student will receive a UR and no credit will be given. Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-and upper-division writ\u00ad ing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the lower-division courses: I. Students who fail to attain a grade of C in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course after satisfying the Subject A requirement should substitute English and Comparative Literature WR39C if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C if they need two quar\u00ad ters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the upper-division writing course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C in English and Compara\u00ad tive Literature WRI39W should repeat it. Students following any other approved upper-division writing option should enroll in English and Comparative Literature WRI39W if a Cis not attained in the selected course. See page 56 for further information on the Writing requirement portion of the breadth requirement. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by tak\u00ad ing a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed procedures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any peti\u00ad tion for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. - The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (I) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as a letter grade (e.g.,A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points (if applicable) will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu-_ dents at UC/. The independent-study option allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a clear relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergraduates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equivalent, as indi\u00ad vidually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These exami\u00ad nations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Special arrangements may be made for disabled students. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Student Copies of Quarterly Grades After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list UC IRVINE - 1990-1991of the University requirements completed (Subject A, American History, and American Institutions). Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of cer\u00ad tain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0-40.4 40.5- 83.9 84.0-134.9 135.0- 180.0 Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll' for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the student's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Students in the part-time study program are referred to page 47. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic proba\u00ad tion if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satis\u00ad factory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the Uni\u00ad versity if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalau\u00ad reate degree. 1. Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com\u00ad pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 12-15 8-11 7 2 24-30 16-23 15 145-150 142-144 141 11 162-165 160-161 159 12 180 Academic Regulations and Procedures 71 2. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed the number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (1) is making normal pro\u00ad gress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (1) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (1) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that student's school or pro\u00ad gram or its designated agent. 3. Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under ( 1) are subject to disqualification. \u00b7 A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. 4. For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Entrance I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (4) above: (a) Advanced Placement Examination; (b) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. 6. The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalau\u00ad reate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offering the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. 7. The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress requirement for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic stand\u00ad ing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqua1ification. If a stu\u00ad dent becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school UC IRVINE - 1990-199172 Program of Academic Support Services and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to main\u00ad tain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Honors Information about the Campuswide Honors Program and the major-specific honors programs available at UCI is found on page 53. Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to students who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Students may graduate with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning gradu\u00ad ate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire pro\u00ad gram of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should secure prior approval from the Office of Admissions and their academic dean. The Office of Admissions is responsible for determining if these credits are transferable to UCI, and the academic dean or director of the academic unit which offers the student's major is responsible for determining if the credits are applicable to major and breadth requirements. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit; then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Forms for securing such authorization are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension before enrollment in graduate study at UCI.

Program of Academic Support Services The Program of Academic Support Services (PASS) is a campus\u00ad wide program designed to help students fulfill their potential and attain their academic goals at UCI. PASS offers a wide range of services and programs which are course-specific, discipline\u00ad specific, or general. Services are provided in a variety of formats, including workshops, laboratories, adjunct classes, small~group tutoring, and individual conferences. The Program's services sup\u00ad plement classroom instruction. Counseling and referral services for specific student groups also are provided. Although most PASS programs are not offered for academic credit, they have been developed in coordination with academic departments. Presented in a coherent, educationally sound manner, these programs are intended to meet the individual needs of all UCI students. For example, programs are available to students who desire greater academic proficiency in courses ranging in level from introductory through honors and upper division. Students who desire assistance have the opportunity to find a PASS program that is suited to their needs and that will make their education at UCI more successful and rewarding. Administered through the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, PASS programs and services are organized under four units: the Learning Skills Center, Student Academic Advance\u00ad ment Services, the Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office, and the Tutorial Assistance Program. All PASS units are located in the Student Services II Building. The Learning Skills Center provides programs designed to help students strengthen and develop their reading, writing, mathe\u00ad matics, science, analytic thinking, and study skills in order to enrich and enhance their education at UCI. Some Learning Skills programs are neither discipline- nor course-specific, but stress the development of abilities that all students need regardless of field or major. Such programs include workshops and individual counseling in writing, time-management, overcoming procrastina\u00ad tion, listening and note-taking, test-taking, and preparation for the graduate entrance examinations. Classes in critical reading also are offered. The Center offers a program of course-related adjuncts in con\u00ad junction with designated introductory courses in writing, humani\u00ad ties, chemistry, mathematics, and the social sciences. These adjuncts, coordinated with regular course instruction, provide an opportunity for students to improve their academic skills in spe\u00ad cific courses.

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Horace Mitchell Vice Chancellor Student Affairs U CI seeks to develop the whole student and, as we prepare to move into the twenty-first cen\u00ad tury, that includes several aspects-exposing students to the diversity of life, to a sense of community and community service, and to leadership opportunities. It is critical that students learn that they will be at a per\u00ad sonal and competitive disadvantage if they don't develop an ability to relate effectively across cultures. Nobody-no matter what their background-will have the option in the future of simply staying within the context of their own culture. To this end, we have established traditions at UCI that celebrate cultural diversity, and our Academic Senate has created the new breadth requirement category in mul\u00ad ticultural and international/global issues. To increase our students' interest in public service, we host an annual fair at which they can match their personal interests with involvement opportunities at a variety of community and volunteer agencies. We also tie in public services involvement and the need many students have for an internship experience as part of their educational plan. This helps students gain exposure to areas of academic interest in a nonacademic environment. We put great emphasis on student leadership development. Our goal is to develop future leaders who understand the nature of society and the context within which people live. UCI has several leadership programs that give students the opportunity to learn about organizational management, explore and develop their leadership skills, and become involved with decision-making that can affect the entire campus. Faculty involvement in student development also is criti\u00ad cal, and we are developing programs and strategies for enhancing out-of-class interactions between students and faculty members.

Undergraduate Housing\u00b7 Mesa Court and Middle Earth, UCI's residence halls, house 2,330 single undergraduate students. Each hall houses from 40 to 60 students and a student resident assistant. The small-scale build\u00ad ings provide excellent opportunities for social interaction, student government, and leadership experience. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. The residences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms also are available in each residence hall. Every room has carpeting and draperies, and is furnished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of draw\u00ad ers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth residence halls have com\u00ad plete food service and dining commons for their residents. Stu\u00ad dents who live in the residence halls participate in prepaid 10-or 19-meal-per-week plans. Meals are served cafeteria-style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on week\u00ad days (brunch and dinner on weekends). The halls are closed dur\u00ad ing the Christmas recess, and although they remain open over the Thanksgiving holiday and the spring recess, no meals are served. The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have responsibility for providing student residents with an envi\u00ad ronment conducive to their intellectual, social,and personal growth. The housing staffs work closely with students to create opportunities for educational exploration and ways of developing interpersonal skills. The residence halls have distinctive personali\u00ad ties. In many cases, an academic interest characterizes a hall style. The Outdoor and Photography \u00b7Halls are examples of special interest hall programs. Weekend field trips and retreats, designed to amplify on-campus experiences, are often part of the interest hall programs. The Student Programs Offices also supervise and train resident assistants, advise the residential student govern\u00ad ment, and coordinate information and skill development workshops. Charges for the 1990-91 academic year (late September through mid-June) are $5,212-5,458 for a single room and $4,717-4,969 for a double room; rates include a $21 annual association fee. An increase in cost is anticipated for the 1991-92 academic year. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments.

To be qualified to receive the benefits of this fund, each fully registered student must have complied with the medical history and physical examination requirement of UCI. Students are not eligible for benefits until these records are on file in the medical records department of the Student Health Center. Medical history and physical examination forms are mailed to new under\u00ad graduate and graduate students and to readmitted students as their names become available to the Student Health Service. Medical students receive the packets from Medical Student Admissions. International students' packets are mailed by the Office of International Services with their initial registration packet. Students should check with the Student Health Service for information on the benefits and limitations under the emer\u00ad gency medical fund. Student health coverage extends from the first day of the quarter to, but not including, the first day of the following quarter, but begins only after the student has paid the full Registration Fee and has been issued the Class Verification and Identification Card. There is an exception for spring quarter coverage which extends only to the last day of that quarter. An optional insurance plan covering major medical occurrences for students, spouses, and children and coverage for the summer or one unregistered quarter each year is available. Enrollment in this plan is limited to a short time at the beginning of each quar\u00ad ter. To ensure coverage, students should visit the Student Health Center during the first week of each quarter for information and application forms. All international students are required to carry adequate health insurance. Those students who have private insurance which is equal or superior to the policy provided through the University may be eligible to have the International Student Health Insur\u00ad ance Fee waived. As of fall 1989 the fee was $110 per quarter. Additional information is available from the Student Health Ser\u00ad vice Insurance Coordinator; telephone (714) 856-7093. Physical Examinations and Health Clearances. All new students and students returning to UCI after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a complete physical examination within 90 days prior to the first day of the quarter. The examina\u00ad tion should be performed by the student's own physician. If this is impractical, the examination can be obtained at the Student Health Center for a fee. For an appointment telephone (714) 856-5304. Students transferring from another University of Cali\u00ad fornia campus where their medical records are on file should have the records transferred to the UCI Student Health Center. Failure to comply with the physical examination requirement results in loss of emergency medical fund eligibility, and a fee for services provided by the Student Health Service, Student Health coverage provides as many services as possible without additional charge; however, some services are available only on a fee-for-service basis. Some of the services available for a charge are immunizations; allergy desensitization injections; prescriptions from the Student Health Pharmacy; dental services including minor surgery; elective laboratory tests; and, time per\u00ad mitting, physical examinations for employment, insurance, or. a marriage license.

Sypherd Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Gradu\u00b7ate Studies Research and graduate education, two major areas of responsibil\u00ad ity of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs leading to doc\u00ad toral or master's degrees are offered in more than 85 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national reputations for. excel\u00ad lence, and several are internationally recognized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate programs continue to grow and to evolve in directions that are consistent with the Univer\u00ad sity's teaching, research, and public service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excitement and satisfaction that spring from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meeting new challenges. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has general administrative responsibility for research and gradu\u00ad ate education. In the area of research, the Vice Chancellor has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded train\u00ad ing grants, general research administration, and research policy development and implementation. Graduate education responsi\u00ad bilities include admissions, enrolled-student actions and advising, degree awards, fellowship and assistantship administration, teach\u00ad ing assistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Oppor\u00ad tunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minority students and women in graduate education. The Office of Research and Graduate Studies also is administra\u00ad tively responsible for Organized Research Units, Irvine Research Units, Focused Research Programs, contract and grant adminis\u00ad tration, and other campus research activities. The following sec\u00ad tions describe areas of research and graduate education, and include information about academic regulations and policies important to applicants and graduate students. Research The University of California is the State's primary research insti\u00ad tution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are sup\u00ad ported by University funds or by grants and contracts from fed\u00ad eral and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. Faculty at UCI participate in activities in many tradi\u00ad tional fields of endeavor as well as in \"new\" interdisciplinary pur\u00ad suits. For example, in the humanities, UCI has become a world center for the study of critical theory. In physics, UCI scientists are involved in ongoing studies on the nature of subatomic parti\u00ad cles. Members of the Chemistry faculty are leaders in the study of atmospheric phenomena such as ozone depletion. Faculty research in biomedical sciences covers a wide range of areas including neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics, and cancer\u00ad related studies. The Vice Chancellor for Research has responsibility for research administration, including research policy, research development, organized research activities, UCI-industry relations involving research, animal research administration, and research committee support. In addition, the Vice Chancellor is responsible for con\u00ad tract and grant administration which includes the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotia\u00ad tion of all awards for extramurally funded research, training, fel\u00ad lowship, and public service programs. The Office of Research and Graduate Studies also maintains a resource center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units, Irvine Research Units, and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. University of California Humanities Research Institute The University ofCalifornia Humanities Research Institute was established on the Irvine campus in September 1987 to provide a Universitywide locus for collaborative and individual research in the humanities among University of California scholars and their national and international colleagues. The Institute sponsors conferences, seminars, and workshops addressing themes at the. forefront of current dialogue in the humanities, providing forums for the emergence and enhance\u00ad ment of new research interests and scholarly collaboration. In addition, the Institute produces a series of publications, including conference proceedings, monographs, and books developed through these various forums. Research themes are developed from four major areas of human\u00ad istic concern: (I) Area studies-western, eastern, Third World, dominant, and minority cultures, examined individually or com\u00ad paratively; (2) Historical studies-the retrieval of texts and con\u00ad texts in the major literary periods, examined individually or com\u00ad paratively; (3) Discourse studies-the languages of the arts, the humanities, and the sciences; and (4) Humanities beyond its boundaries-humanistic concerns in medicine, law, business, science, technology, public policy, and public institutions. Organized Research Units Organized Research Units (ORUs) normally consist of an inter\u00ad departmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some OR Us is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phenomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University are the Cancer Research Institute, the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, the Critical Theory Institute, the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), the Institute for Surface and Interface Science (ISIS), and the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO). Cancer Research Institute The Cancer Research Institute provides leadership and support for researchers working toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Institute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and directing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from several departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. It provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and Clinicians can assess ad\u00ad vances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or condi\u00ad tions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, viral carcinogenesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory The Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory fos\u00ad ters multidisciplinary research concerning the neurobiological processes underlying learning and memory. Research efforts are stimulated and coordinated through research seminars, colloquia, quarterly meetings, and international conferences, as well as col\u00ad laborative research projects involving faculty members of the Center, visiting fellows, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Research programs include investi\u00ad gations at several levels of analysis including cell chemistry, cell physiology, brain systems, cognitive processes, and neural model\u00ad ing. Members include faculty from the Department of Psychobi\u00ad ology in the School of Biological Sciences, the Department of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Department of Physics in the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences, as well as faculty from other UC campuses. Critical Theory Institute The Critical Theory Institute provides a locus for the conduct and support of collaborative, interdisciplinary research focused on the theoretical underpinnings of such fields as history, litera\u00ad ture, philosophy, art, and politics. The Institute's principal func\u00ad tion is to provide a forum for debate among competing move\u00ad ments in contemporary critical theory so that existing theoretical models can be challenged and refined. The Institute's research consists not only of the application of theory to data but also of self-reflexive investigation of theoretical presuppositions in order to produce alternative theoretical constructs and strategies. A recently completed research project of the Institute concerns the increasingly complex nature of the problem of representation in contemporary theories ofliterature, art, history, and the social sciences. A current project focuses on recent transformations in the concepts and use of language and discourse in the various fields and disciplines of the human sciences (humanities and social sciences). It studies the impact of the displacement of tradi\u00ad tional, \"natural\" models for language by institutional or com\u00ad municational models. The Institute organizes colloquia, lectures, seminars, and work\u00ad shops in which leading theorists from the United States and abroad participate in its research projects. It also sponsors the annual Wellek Library Lectures in which a leading theorist gives a series of lectures on a topic of importance in critical theory. Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center (DBC) provides focus and support for research in developmental biology in several depart\u00ad ments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. The research activities are concerned with identifying the activities of cells that convert the fertilized egg into a fully formed and functioning organism. These activities, which include cell division, migration, and differentiation, are controlled by localized factors in the egg and by interactions between cells that are not yet understood. DBC investigators are studying these problems at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels using a variety of experimental organisms. The DBC is the site of a National Science Foundation Biological Facilities Center which provides the latest technology in microscopic imaging, computer\u00ad based image processing and analysis, flow cytometry, single-cell microinjection, and DNA sequence analysis. A National Institute of Health Predoctoral and Postdoctoral Training Program pro\u00ad vides support for some of the DBC trainees, and an Industrial Internship program is available for undergraduates. The DBC sponsors and organizes local, national, and international confer\u00ad ences and hosts visiting scientists for collaborative research work. Organized Research Units 83 The results of the work will contribute to the understanding of normal development, growth control, and the regeneration of body parts as well as abnormalities that lead to birth defects, cancer, and nervous-system malfunction in the human body. Institute for Surface and Interface Science The Institute for Surface and Interface Science provides an inter\u00ad disciplinary environment for the study of phenomena which occur at the boundaries between phases of matter. The properties of surfaces and interfaces control a wide variety of technologi\u00ad cally important problems, including corrosion and lubrication phenomena, the behavior of semiconductor devices, the fabrica\u00ad tion of integrated circuits, and catalysts used in automobile exhaust systems. Research into the properties of surfaces and interfaces is conducted by faculty from the Departments of Chemistry and Physics in the School of Physical Sciences and from the Department of Electrical Engineering in the School of Engineering. The Institute supports a number of programs to enhance the environment for collaborative research, including a Distinguished Lecturer Program which brings senior scholars from around the world to UCI, visiting fellows programs, post\u00ad doctoral fellowships, seminars, and conferences. Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies at Irvine (ITS-Irvine) is part of a multicampus research unit of the University of Califor\u00ad nia which was established in 1947 to assist in research and educa\u00ad tion related to transportation system operation, technology, and policy. The Irvine branch of the Institute was established in 1974. Emphasis at Irvine has been on the development of a strong interdisciplinary research capability. ITS-Irvine research involves faculty and students from the School of Engineering, the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management, the School ofSocial Sciences, and the Program in Social Ecology. The Institute hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facilitate collaborative research and information exchange. Conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results to the broader academic and professional com\u00ad munity also are sponsored by the Institute. Research at ITS-Irvine focuses upon planning and analysis of transportation systems, transportation safety, transportation engineering and operations, expert systems, transportation eco\u00ad nomics, fiscal and administrative issues in public transit, and energy and environmental issues. Recent projects have dealt with the monitoring and control of urban freeway traffic, truck acci\u00ad dents on urban freeways, transit service contracting, forecasting of transportation energy demand, alternative fuels, highway pric\u00ad ing and investment, suburban land use/travel relationships, free\u00ad way carpooling behavior, household adaptation to changing travel characteristics, effects of commuting on health and com\u00ad munity well-being, and application of expert systems and image processing to pavement rehabilitation and hazardous waste management. The transportation research program at Irvine is augmented by the Transportation Systems Center and the ITS-Irvine Transpor\u00ad tation Library. The Transportation Systems Center offers a vari\u00ad ety of computer services in support of research and training. The ITS-Irvine Transportation Library contains books, journals, technical res ports, and dissertations in the field of transportation, and offers a variety of manual and computer-based information retrieval services. UC IRVINE - 1990-199184 Irvine Research Units The Institute maintains a regular publication series of reports documenting its research. ITS-Irvine is the editorial headquarters of the international journals Transportation Research and Accident Analysis and Prevention. In conjunction with University Extension, ITS-Irvine sponsors short courses and certificate programs for the nation's transpor\u00ad tation professionals. Specialty conferences, such as the 1986 National Conference on Commuter Lanes and Transitways and the 1988 conference \"Paying the Toll\": National Perspectives on Toll Road Development, attract an international audience. The Institute works closely with campus academic units to enhance graduate education in the areas of transportation plan\u00ad ning, engineering, management, and policy. Courses of study leading to graduate degrees in the School of Engineering, the School of Social Sciences, and the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment are available for students interested in transportation stud\u00ad ies. The Institute extends its support to a large number of gradu\u00ad ate students from these various disciplines, enabling students to enrich their studies by participating in ongoing research. Twenty-nine faculty members, seven professional researchers, and twenty-five students participated in ITS-sponsored research in 1988-89. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is a multidisci\u00ad plinary research unit that conducts basic and policy-related research in social sciences. Research efforts are focused on four programmatic areas: impacts of technology, community and environmental issues, organizational management, and issues of interest to Orange County, including an annual public opinion survey of Orange\u00b7 County residents. A combination of faculty from the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment, Department of Information and Computer Science, School of Social Sciences, Program in Social Ecology, and School of Medicine work with the unit. Their areas of expertise include public administration, economics, law, information and computer science, public finance, political science, sociology, psychology, planning, and public health. Currently, about 50 faculty and their students are conducting research in PPRO. Like the staff, PPRO research projects reflect a multidisciplinary nature. Ongoing studies include the future of computerized information systems in governments; the use of mathematical evidence in court; the effects of seat-belt restraint on incidence of injuries to children; the effects of parents' commitments to work and child-rearing on family life; and the use and impact of white\u00ad collar utilization of office automation. Additional studies involve an examination of the impact of governmental policy on the pro\u00ad duction and use of computer technology in Pacific Rim nations; an inspection of Asian organized crime in California and New York; and an investigation of the variety and effectiveness of worksite and school health-promotion programs that currently exist. PPRO projects are based in the social sciences and many have requirements for original data collection and sophisticated analy\u00ad sis. In support of data collection activities, PPRO has developed the Center for Survey Research which includes state-of-the-art Computer Assisted Interviewing (CATI) capabilities, data man\u00ad agement and data analysis, and on-line, interactive computing. PPRO's administrative support team included professional sup\u00ad port in proposal development, project budgeting, and project management. A limited number of graduate assistantships and work-study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to par\u00ad ticipate in PPRO research projects, including data collection and analysis in the Center for Survey Research, or the preparation of research proposals. Irvine Research Units Irvine Research Units (IRU) are established on the Irvine campus for the purpose of providing an organizational structure for the conduct of research that is difficult or infeasible to be carried out within the normal school or departmental structure. Irvine Research Units normally are established for a period of five years, and may provide the basis for establishment of extramu\u00ad rally supported research centers or Organized Research Units. Currently established Irvine Research Units are in Animal Virol\u00ad ogy, Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology, Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, and Molecular Neurobiology. Animal Virology Faculty participants in this program are from the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biological Sciences and from the Department of Microbiology and Molecu\u00ad lar Genetics in the College of Medicine. The goal of the program is to provide a core facility for the collaborative interaction among faculty researchers working in several related areas of virology. A major activity is the development of communication between virologists in the UCI community and their colleagues at other institutions. Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology Participants in the IRU in Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology include faculty, students, and staff in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering; the Department of Chemistry, School of Physical Sciences; and the Department of Community and Environmental Medicine, College of Medicine. The goals of the IR U are to (I) develop a more complete understanding of the physiochemical processes of combustion and propulsion with particular emphasis on turbu\u00ad lent transport, liquid sprays, two-phase particle flows, high-speed and supersonic mixing, laser diagnostics, chemistry-turbulence interaction, and advanced computational methods; (2) establish relationships between these processes and potential health and environmental impacts associated with soot particulate and gaseous pollutant emissions; and (3) apply this understanding to applications of technological importance. The IRU in Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology promotes interaction, provides a broader portfolio of research experiences and opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, sponsors a seminar series and workshops, and supports a visitors program to enhance interaction with distinguished scientists from both industry and academia. Mathematical Behavioral Sciences The goals of the Mathematical Behavioral Sciences research unit are to foster research in the application of mathematical methods to model and to better understand human behavior, both indi\u00ad vidual and social. The unit sponsors specialized seminars and col\u00ad loquia, a visiting scholars program, summer workshops, and focused research subteams of faculty, students, and visitors. Par\u00ad ticipants include faculty from the Departments of Cognitive Science, Economics, Politics and Society, Anthropology, and Sociology in the School of Social Sciences; the School's Mathem\u00ad atical Social Science group; the Department of Mathematics in the School of Physical Sciences; the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humanities; and the Graduate School of Management. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Molecular Neurobiology Faculty participants in this program are from the Departments of Biological Chemistry, Anatomy and Neurobiology, and Pharma\u00ad cology. The group's goal is to pool their expertise and focus on the investigation of the major human neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's, and the investigation of the nature of neuro-oncogenesis, the fundamental mechanisms of which are likely to yield clues to understanding why brain cells degenerate. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs (FRP) are established for the pur\u00ad pose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Two groups of faculty, students, and other researchers currently are recognized as Focused Research Programs. Public Choice Faculty from the Departments of Economics, Political Science, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management apply economic concepts to the study of government behavior. The research topics include governmental policy on research and development and on health, the importance of race in politics, and the ne.ed for government-given alternative motivations of individuals. Southern History Faculty from the Department of History in the School of Humanities and faculty from the School of Social Sciences are working in collaboration with faculty from the Department of History at the University's San Diego campus. The objective of the FRP is to provide a forum for defining and investigating the sources, uses, and consequences of power and authority in the southern United States from the seventeenth through the twen\u00ad tieth century. Individual research projects consider various facets of the larger problem of power and authority. The program spon\u00ad sors colloquia during the academic year and hosts a research seminar during the summer. .. Graduate Education With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies administers graduate education in accordance with academic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty 111 UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for undergrad\u00ad uate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCI General Catalogue and individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies is ready to help answer questions about admis\u00ad sion, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other matters of concern to applicants or graduate students. The Office is located in 145 Administration Building; telephone (714) 856-6761. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program (GPOP), steps are taken to increase the participation of tradi\u00ad tionally underrepresented minorities (including women in desig-Graduate Education/ Application Procedures '85 nated fields) in the graduate academic and professional programs of the University. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admission process, and every effort is made through GPOP ad\u00ad vising and support to ensure that all students will have a reason\u00ad able chance to attain their academic objectives. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philos\u00ad ophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program on the basis of such factors as aca\u00ad demic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommenda\u00ad tion, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical ques\u00ad tion is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasona\u00ad bly be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommo\u00ad date all applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the pro\u00ad fessional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of tradi\u00ad tional academic appointments in certain disciplines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly motivated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earn\u00ad ing an advanced degree from a respected university. UCI is com\u00ad mitted to helping graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. Application Procedures How to Apply Applicants must complete the Application for Admission which may be obtained by contacting individual graduate programs or the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. The application must be submitted on the forms supplied by UCI and accom\u00ad panied by a check, draft, or money order payable to Regents-UC in the exact amount of the $40 Application Fee. This fee is not refundable. Detailed instructions on how to complete the applica\u00ad tion are contained in the application packet. When to Apply For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by February I to receive full consideration for fellowship and assist\u00ad antship awards. Some academic units will accept applications for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are Octo\u00ad ber 15 and January 15 respectively. In order to process applica\u00ad tions in time for the applicant to receive full consideration, letters of recommendation, official transcripts, and test scores must be received before the published deadlines. Applications for admis\u00ad sion received after the published deadline for the quarter requested will be deferred automatically to the next open quarter. UC IRVINE - 1990-199186 Graduate Education/ Admission and Registration Required Supporting Documents Letters of Recommendation Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recommenda\u00ad tion forwarded directly to their prospective major department or program. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet. Only one set of recommendation letters needs to be sub\u00ad mitted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recommendation be completed by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (GRE) General Test, with the following exceptions: (I) the Graduate School of Management prefers that applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no tests are required of those who seek the Master of Fine Arts degree, the Master of Arts in Teaching, or California education creden\u00ad tials. There is no minimum GRE score. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Subject Test. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. The GRE is administered five times a year in the United States and in 96 other countries. In addition, several administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE may be obtained from the Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, New Jersey 08541~6000. Academic Records Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be forwarded directly to their prospective major department or pro\u00ad gram. Two complete sets of official records covering all post\u00ad secondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. University of California transcripts must also be requested by applicants including those who are UCI undergraduates. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. Foreign Academic Records Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the prospective major department or program at UCI. Records of academic study from foreign institutions must be official, bear\u00ad ing the signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing insti\u00ad tution. Applicants should not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly certified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or rat\u00ad ings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases the insti\u00ad tutional grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Official evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) All applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit the test results of the TOEFL examination. The TOEFL examination should be taken at the earliest available date to allow for scores to be reported in time to meet the appli\u00ad cation deadlines. A score of 550 or better is required for admis\u00ad sion consideration. Arrangements for taking the TOEFL may be made through the nearest United States Embassy or by writing to the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6151, U.S.A. Test of Spoken English (TSE) All applicants whose primary language is not English and who wish to be considered for a Teaching Assistantship appointment must undergo and submit results for the Test of Spoken English (TSE). A minimum score of 220 is required in order for a TA offer to be made. (The Departments of English and Comparative Literature and Politics and Society require a minimum score of 250.) The Test of Spoken English is given six times during the year at TOEFL test centers around the world. Information on taking the TSE may be obtained by writing to the Test of Spoken English, P.O. Box 6157, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6157, U.S.A. Special Note to Foreign Applicants Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess suffi\u00ad cient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. A Foreign Applicant Questionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon receipt of the completed Application for Admis\u00ad sion. The required financial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each appli\u00ad cant as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registration for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter. Information on registration dates and procedures will be mailed to new applicants prior to the registration cycle. ~. If any applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quarter, the Office of Research and Graduate Studies must be notified in writing. After formal admission has been offered, the academic unit must approve a request for deferral. Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (1) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a graduate degree. While Limited Status is intended to serve a broad range of educa\u00ad tional objectives, the most common objectiVe for which the Dean of Graduate Studies offers Limited Status admission is study leading to California education credentials. The general require\u00ad ments for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Sta\u00ad tus is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree program at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate standing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses iaken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admittea. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed graduate advisor or director of graduate studies. The graduate advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor. The graduate advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the graduate advisor is instrumental in the nomination of stu\u00ad dents for fellowship support, the selection of students for assist\u00ad antship and fellowship appointments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an asso\u00ad ciate dean for graduate studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both graduate advisors and deans are important links between the stu\u00ad dent and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty ad\u00ad visor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic petitions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described here apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education credentials. Other regulations and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfac\u00ad tory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent aca\u00ad demic record and overall performance. A graduate student nor\u00ad mally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regu\u00ad lar academic session (unless on an approved leave of absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, upon petition, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses Graduate Education/ Academic Advising 87 applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program, see page 89), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees con\u00ad (erred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfac~ory pro\u00ad gress is not eligible for any academic appointment such as Reader, Graduate Student Researcher, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satis\u00ad factory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). With the approval of the Grad\u00ad uate Council certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enroll\u00ad ment but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change-of-grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the stu\u00ad dent has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the re\u00ad moval or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F or NP which will remain permanently upon the student's record. I' UC IRVINE - 1990-199188 Graduate Education/Policies A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Aca\u00ad demic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the stu\u00ad dent is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Graduate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two six\u00ad week summer sessions, or four units of credit in an eight-or ten\u00ad week summer session. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Policy Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower\u00ad division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units IJer quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combina\u00ad tion. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recognizes the legiti\u00ad mate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to providing thoSe opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part-time students wherever good educational reasons exist for so doing. Under this policy, part\u00ad time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less, including enrollment in physical education classes. Within the guidelines and limitations on the application form available in the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all require\u00ad ments for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not official until all required fees have been paid and the student's Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and sub\u00ad mitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of Cali\u00ad fornia for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official leave of absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadlines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after en\u00ad rolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies. A graduate student in good academic standing who with\u00ad draws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a leave of absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a leave of absence. A leave of absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's academic unit, subject to the following guidelines: I. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's 'academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a Univer\u00ad sity fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or comparable Uni\u00ad versity employment. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn UC IRVINE - 1990-1991academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facilities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic ses\u00ad sion following the expiration of leave will lose graduate stand\u00ad ing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a $40 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Graduate Studies may grant readmission when recommended by the aca\u00ad demic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must satisfy the aca\u00ad demic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required, to satisfy certain requirements a ~econd time, includ\u00ad ing those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to can\u00ad didacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter follow\u00ad ing readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advan\u00ad tage of educational opportunities available only at another cam\u00ad pus of the University of California may do so through the Inter\u00ad campus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and will have well\u00ad defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respective deans of graduate studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating student's needs. Students may take courses on more than\u00b7 one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and should be filed with the Office at /east four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late filing of the study list. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be .completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another graduate division of the University of California. After enrollment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student Graduate Education/Policies/Degrees 89 has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a leave of absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the depart\u00ad mental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI summer sessions, provided that the formal date of admission pre\u00ad cedes summer session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI summer sessions. Graduate Degrees Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quar\u00ad ter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected . The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses com\u00ad pleted while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts, Dance, Drama, or Studio Art) ) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon success\u00ad ful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional development. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually includ\u00ad ing summer session course work. A thesis project or other com\u00ad parable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. UC IRVINE - 1990-199190 Graduate Education/Degrees Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of con\u00ad centration within it. The research dissertation is expected to dem\u00ad onstrate critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time resi\u00ad dence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mastery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the stu\u00ad dent will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candi\u00ad dacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy com\u00ad mittee list must be submitted to the Office of Research and Graduate Studies (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given so that for\u00ad mal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate stand\u00ad ing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted stu\u00ad dent who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies (on behalf of the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examina\u00ad tion if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guid\u00ad ance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examina\u00ad tion will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic ses\u00ad sion, and will be open to all members of the academic commun\u00ad ity. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a normative time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enroll\u00ad ment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with nor\u00ad mal preparation who are able to study without serious interrup\u00ad tions. The normative time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Administra\u00ad tion (six), Anatomy and Neurobiology (four), Classics (six), Comparative Culture (six), Comparative Literature (six), English (six), French (six), German (six), History (six), Information and Irvine Meadows West, a recreational vehicle park, is an unusual and popular student housing option. Computer Science (six), Philosophy (six), Physics (six), Social Ecology (six), Spanish (six). A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quarterly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: l. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the normative time for completion of the Ph.D. established for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less (a) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (b) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); 3. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Grad- uate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must con\u00ad duct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or disserta\u00ad tion in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or master's candidates who are writing a thesis or dissertation should consult with the manuscript advisor in the Office of Research and Grad\u00ad uate Studies. The manuscript advisor has the responsibility of ensuring that the established procedures and standards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and dissertations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Graduate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a master's thesis) must be filed with the manuscript advisor for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the University's requirements for style, format, and appear\u00ad ance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations and theses must be filed no later than the end of the eighth week of instruc\u00ad tion in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. The Filing Fee Under certain circumstances, a student who has advanced to candidacy for a graduate degree may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any aca\u00ad demic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following readmission and will be accepted immediately following a leave of absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other stu\u00ad dent fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the student must subse\u00ad quently register and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies. The student should consult the departmental graduate advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a diploma information form with the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. If a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation is to be submitted, the manuscript advisor should be consulted well in advance about the final format and the deadline for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Graduate Education/Financial Assistance 91 Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate stu\u00ad dents at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants-in-aid, student loans, and work-study. Applicants inter\u00ad ested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by February I to receive full consideration for fellowship and assist\u00ad antship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fellowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their pro\u00ad gram. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year begins in the winter quarter. UCI subscribes to the agreement of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April IS to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universities may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment with\u00ad out first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents' and UCI Chancellor's Fellowships are awarded to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards may include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the academic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. A graduate assistant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to entering and continuing graduate students from groups including minori\u00ad ties and women in certain fields who traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education in the United States. All fel\u00ad lowship awards and assistantships appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. A limited number of dissertation fellowships are awarded each year; additional information is available from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies; telephone (714) 856-6761. The Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Expenses and Fees and the Financial Aid sections in this Catalogue contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office including grants, loans, and work-study awards. A financial aid booklet is available from the Financial Aid Office. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS School of Biological Sciences L. Dennis Smith Dean Mark C.

Ayala, Ph.D. Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and of Philosophy First Bren Chair and Founding Director of the Bren Fellows Program Avery important activity of the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, and something we are dedi\u00ad cated to, is the provision of creative research opportunities not only in the training of our graduate students, but in the education of our undergraduates as well. At any one time we have about 500 undergraduate students who are engaged in per\u00ad sonalized research projects in laboratories with the faculty. This is done through our independent study research course (Biological Sciences 199). The participation of undergraduates in research is a unique feature of our pro\u00ad gram, one that is not available to undergraduates at most institutions. This is because it requires much more faculty time and energy, as well as laboratory resources, to involve students in research than does the lecturing process alone. But our enthusiasm for this program responds to a vision of what undergraduate education should be. Creative research provides a wonderful opportunity that no under\u00ad graduate should miss. To do research, and particularly to discover something new, is a thrilling experience. Students get bitten by this bug of research and the thrill of discover\u00ad ing something that nobody knew before. One of the great privileges one can find in life, certainly in graduate and undergraduate education, is an opportunity to experience the effects of a mentor. Not only does a faculty member provide research guidance, but much more than that is style-a way of doing things as well as of approaching science, an experience that goes beyond the realms of knowledge. One-to-one daily contact by the stu\u00ad dent with the professor/mentor is so important. One-to\u00ad one relationships do make the difference in a student's education.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Biological Sciences No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecu\u00ad lar basis of embryonic development, and the rules that help pre\u00ad dict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face the human race in the UC IRVINE - 1990-1991coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated people understand the contributions that biological sci\u00ad ences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of human beings. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biol\u00ad ogy in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to avail themselves of the principles and ever-increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future . educational needs of majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the. responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportun\u00ad ity for undergraduates to participate in research, through the Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 199 program. Each quarter more than 450 undergraduate students and 200 graduate and postdoctoral stu\u00ad dents participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are how an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the eight-quarter Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major concepts of mod\u00ad ern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addi\u00ad tion to the regular major in Biological Sciences, a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Intro\u00ad ductory courses for nonmajors are designed to inake the biologi\u00ad cal sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of biological phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in developmental, clinical, environmental, health, or social psy\u00ad chology, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings in the Program of Social Ecology section. Students interested in human experimental psychology as applied to the study of sensation, perception, learning, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cognitive Sciences in the School of Social Sciences section.

Degree in Biological Sciences University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, IOi, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, 106L, 107); minimum of three satellite courses (see School Residence Requirement below); Chemistry I A-B-C, 5JA-B-C, and ILB-LC, 51LA-LB; 3LA-LB or 5A-B-C, 5LB-LC; and Humanities I A-B-C, or another option of the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth require\u00ad ment (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humani\u00ad ties or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. School Residence Requirement: At least three satellite courses must be successfully completed at UCI. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology Sample Program -Biological Sciences Freshman Sophomore Fall Chern. lA Bio. Core Human. IAa Chern. 51A, LA Bio. 2 (Fr. Sem.)

No student may enter as a double major, but students interested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program approves. A strong aca\u00ad demic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, see page 97. UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have com\u00ad pleted the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two exceptions: the upper-division writing requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. \u00b7 Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternaiive satisfies Cate\u00ad gory IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower-division writing requirement when two quarters of the writing component are passed with a grade of C or better. Chemistry and physics \u00b7 satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Category V, Foreign Lan\u00ad guage, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, and Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. The academic program shown below is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities requirement, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test Junior Senior Bio. Core\u00b7 Bio. Core Physics 3A, LA or Electived Bio. Satellite Bio. Satellite\" Research Elective/Research Elective Bio. Core Research Physics 3B, LB or Elective Electives Bio. Satellite Elective/Research Bio. Core Research Physics 3C or Elective Electives Bio. Satellite Elective/Research a students may replace Humanities !A-B-C with another option of the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter breadth sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower\u00ad division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities I A must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 units) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. bstudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics portion of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. cstudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics JA-B-C and JLA-LB in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for nonmajors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics 5A-B-C, which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some gradu\u00ad ate schools. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. 1n addition to the listed biological sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C, and Psychology !51 A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991(SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter and should note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. During their freshman year, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry 51 A), continue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humanities requirement if they have not taken it during their freshman year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics 5A-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Jun\u00ad iors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements and research. Since research and the content of most satellite courses are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for stu\u00ad dents to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses or beginning their research. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core, con\u00ad tinue their research, and become involved in an area of specializa\u00ad tion within the School. Individualized accelerated programs of study are designed for students entering the School with strong backgrounds in biology. Please see page 98. for details regarding the Freshman Honors Curriculum. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sci\u00ad ences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathematics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this pro\u00ad gram of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Biological Sciences 97 Freshmen should complete English and Comparative Literature WR39A, Mathematics I, Biological Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathematics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter. \u00b7 During the second year, students should begin general chemistry (Chemistry JA-B-C), continue working on the breadth require\u00ad ment and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students will begin the Bio\u00ad logical Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry 51 A\u00ad B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satel\u00ad lites and research and to complete any remaining Biological Sci\u00ad ences Core Courses. Requirements for the B.S. Degree in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecol\u00ad ogy and Environmental Biology which provides a second path\u00ad way to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a Jesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdisciplinary program in environmental studies within the framework of a broad and rigorous physical and bio\u00ad logical sciences background. A vi'tal goal is to allow the student completing the course of study to be broadly trained as a biolo\u00ad gist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environ\u00ad mental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective.

Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics section of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Cstudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirements in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training: Required electives are two courses selected from among various Biological Sciences courses and two courses selected from among various Social Ecology and Engi\u00ad neering courses. See School requirements for the Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology. UC IRVINE - 1990-199198 Biological Sciences and the physical and biological sciences, the student must com\u00ad plete a core of environmentally based courses from the Depart\u00ad ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Program in Social Ecology, and the School ofEngineering. Exposure to cur\u00ad rent thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in several general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and exper\u00ad imental relationships in terrestrial or aquatic systems through \u00b7 Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, bufmay\u00b7also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology. Students may wish to participate in the Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram's Tropical Biology Quarter whiCh is for undergraduates with at least one year of introductory biology, one quarter of upper-division biology, and a serious interest in biological studies.\u00b7 The program includes lectures, field laboratories, and indepen\u00ad dent research, with an emphasis on direct field experience.-Stu\u00ad dents also take a course in Spanish language and Latif) American\u00ad culture. Additional information is available in the Education Abroad Program section. Students should also investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 269), offered jointly by ihe School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology, The Applied Ecology major - emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science. University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 106, 106L, 120, 166. Two required electives from: Biological Sciences 150, 168, 169, 173, 174, 179, 186 (see School Residence Require\u00ad ment below); and two required Computer Science 1A Mathematics 2A-B and one quarter statistics; Physics 3A-B-C, 3LA-LB; and Humanities I A-B-C, or another option of the lower-division writ\u00ad ing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Cate\u00ad gory IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Bio\u00ad logical Sciences courses. School Residence Requirement: At least two required Biological Sciences electives must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences major. A program of study in Ecology and Envi\u00ad ronmental Biology requires Biological Sciences 166 and 120 . .In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering, and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concentra\u00ad tion in Ecology and Environmental Biology in the same manner as the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Envir\u00ad onmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Special Programs and Courses Freshman Honors Curriculum Individually accelerated programs of study can be designed for freshman students who enter the School of Biological Sciences with strong backgrounds in biology and who have achieved scores of 4 or 5 in the biology section of the Advanced Placement Examination. Such freshmen are exempt from the first course in the Biological Sciences Core (Biological Sciences 90, Diversity o[ Life) and begin the sec'ond Core course (Biological Sciences 101, Evolutionary Biology and Genetics) during the fall quarter of their first year. This program enables participants to complete the fourth Core course by the end of their first year. Any student with such Advanced Placement credit should contact the Biologi- \u00b7 cal Sciences Student Affairs Office for more information regard\u00ad ing this program. Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sciences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimental labora\u00ad tory or field research tinder the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scien\u00ad tist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence 'as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptibnal students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that students possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign lan\u00ad guage needs with their advisors to see if such training is impor\u00ad tant for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sciences is best accomplished by students working together with a faculty advisor. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful partici\u00ad pation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excellence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of seeing their research papers published. Selected papers are published in the School's Journal of Under\u00ad graduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a minimum of three quarters on the same project (with at least one quarter taken dur\u00ad ing the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to partici\u00ad pate. They must be in good academic standing; have a grade point average of 2. 7 or better, and be making normal progress in Biological Sciences. Ecology Super Course During one quarter of alternate academic years (and usually in the spring quarter), several courses are combined into a Super Course. These courses, together with a Biological Sciences 199 (Independent Study in Biological Sciences Research), constitute the student's entire curriculum for that particular quarter. (Dur\u00ad ing any quarter in which the Super Course is taught, students may not enroll in part of the Super Course requirements individ\u00ad ually.) Extensive fieldwork is involved. Enrollment is limited to UC IRVINE - 1990-199120 students, with selection based upon application and an inter\u00ad view at the end of the preceding quarter. Prerequisites are com\u00ad pletion of Biological Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Focal Areas Undergraduate students have the opportunity to focus in one or more specific areas of biology by taking a series of related courses within the School's curriculum.

This program provides opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity io experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an over\u00ad seas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world. Detailed information is available on page 63. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding Biological Sciences majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students nor\u00ad mally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Biological Sciences 99 Biological Sciences majors have the opportunity to experience the challenge and excitement of participating in research projects. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Beckman Laser Facility and Medical Clinic, a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or biological mole\u00ad cules such as recombinant DNA which would be hazardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Systematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which currently contains material on local populations of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing the cellular and genetic mechanisms underlying growth, development, and regeneration; the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, a research center for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory; the UCI Arboretum, a botani\u00ad cal garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; the Theoretical Neurobiology Facility, which provides computational resources for physiologically realistic simulation of neuronal sys\u00ad tems; and the UCI Ecological Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the College of Medicine, thereby providing an opportunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991100 Biological Sciences Advising: Academic, Career, Health Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofessional career counseling. Undergraduate Biological Sciences students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for infor\u00ad mation on academic requirements for the degree, career oppor\u00ad tunities, the Biological Sciences 199 Research Program, available tutoring for Biological Sciences courses, Biological Sciences stu\u00ad dent organizations, and scholarship information. Students can also come to the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office to change a grade, change their major, apply for graduation, or for any other help they might need related to their academic career at UCI. All freshmen will enroll in small-group freshman seminars (Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 2) and all other new students will enroll in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. Upper-division peer advisors are actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper\u00ad division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their functions include counsel\u00ad ing students in matters of major selection, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The Peer Advisors are located in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. The UCI Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. The Student Affairs Office has developed a complete career library and a close relationship with the CPPC in an effort to provide current, relevant career infor\u00ad mation for biology students. Special events designed to provide career information are the annual Biological Sciences Career Fair and monthly career workshops, many of which are cosponsored by the Student Affairs Office and the CPPC. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Science degree include laboratory technology, publishing, .technical edit\u00ad ing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare students for employment in education, medical technology (usually one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmen\u00ad tal health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and tropical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, molecu\u00ad lar biology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medi\u00ad cine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veteri\u00ad nary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in . the Office. They also should check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other required tests and application deadlines. The New MCAT and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year at UCI. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the stu\u00ad dent plans to enter medical or dental school. Many Biological Sciences students desire a career related to their education in the biological sciences. Students can go into medi\u00ad cine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medi\u00ad cine, and related medical fields~ into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly preparing for such careers, planning is essential early in a student's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recommend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training at UCI. This prepro\u00ad fessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and fulfilling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose electives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physical chem\u00ad istry, or other specific courses required or recommended by grad\u00ad uate schools.

Graduate Program The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sciences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolution\u00ad ary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobi\u00ad ology) and four Departments of the College of Medicine (Anat\u00ad omy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Depart\u00ad ments encourages an interdisciplinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Biological Sciences. Each Department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and by the pro\u00ad gram or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Depart\u00ad ment of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biological Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the College UC IRVINE - 1990-1991102 Biological Sciences of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interac\u00ad tion among graduate students and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and bio\u00ad physical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy pro\u00ad grams are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the depart\u00ad ments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are avail\u00ad able to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the stu\u00ad dent plans an academic program in consultation with the gradu\u00ad ate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is pos\u00ad sible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, pro\u00ad vided that they are acceptable into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching expe\u00ad rience varies with the department. Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Master of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan The student completes seven upper-division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan The student completes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field specialization. This program is terminated with a compre\u00ad hensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence The student attains this level by com\u00ad pleting oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology L. Dennis Smith: Molecular biology of oogenesis and early development; nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is concerned with the development, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in developmental biology, comparative physiology of animals, or cellular and developmental plant biology. The Department maintains facilities for research involving biochemis\u00ad try; genetics; electron microscopy; cell, tissue, and organism cul\u00ad ture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biology generally enter one of three graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Developmental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing developmental biology take a three-quarter sequence of courses on molecular and cellular biol\u00ad ogy during the first year, followed by a total of five advanced courses during the subsequent years. Those emphasizing cell biology take a three-quarter series of core courses focused on cell biology as well as courses in protein and nucleic acid biochemis\u00ad try. The selection of the first-year course program is made in con\u00ad sultation with a faculty advisory committee when the student first arrives on the campus. This committee monitors the student's progress through the first year after which the student's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in sub\u00ad sequent years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology and cellular and developmental plant biology take an oral examination that coyers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in developmen\u00ad tal and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are examined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doc\u00ad toral students in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department requires each graduate student to participate in a directed teaching experience during each year of the graduate program. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Some faculty from the Department are members of an interdisci\u00ad plinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 101 for a description of the program.

Faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology study questions pertinent at a variety of levels of biological organization, from molecular aspects of evolution to the ecology of ocean ecosystems. Research is conducted in both the laboratory and field and includes work on a variety of organisms from phage and bacteria, to higher plants and animals. Primary attention is given to evolutionary and ecological questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often collaborative and interdisciplinary in approach. Departmental research activi\u00ad ties include ecological energetics, ecology and genetics, life history evolution, population and reproduc\u00ad tive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors provide a balance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolutionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a three-quarter graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students complete an oral examina\u00ad tion based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Each entering graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student meets at least once each quarter. All students are encour\u00ad aged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required .before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than six years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attain\u00ad ment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign lan\u00ad guage (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doc\u00ad toral candidacy by a comprehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Applicants for this program should have a solid under\u00ad graduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathematics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit aptitude and advanced biology GRE scores.

The curricu\u00ad lum is designed to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth comprehension of modern biochemistry and molecular biology and who are highly competent in a given subspecialty. The faculty's research interests include structure and synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, virology, biochemical genetics, gene organization, and immunology. The first-year stu\u00ad dent is required to take a core of advanced courses (203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and 209), to become associated with the labora\u00ad tories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. During the first year, students are advised by members of the graduate committee. Upon successful completion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examination to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supplemental work may be recommended, the student normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. The student, by passing an oral examination by the end of the third year on the proposed disser\u00ad tation work, may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students normally complete their degree programs after a total of five years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) for three years are expected of all continuing stu\u00ad dents. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and bio\u00ad chemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C by the end of the second year.

Weinberger: Neural bases of attention and learning Pauline I. Yahr: Behavioral neuroendocrinology Psychobiology is concerned with the biology of the nervous sys\u00ad tem and behavior. The Department of Psychobiology emphasizes the adaptive aspects of neural and behavioral plasticity. The faculty's research interests include the biochemical, endocrinolog\u00ad ical, genetic, and experiential determinants of nervous system function and behavior. Focal topics include synaptic processes, neurophysiology, neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, molecular neurobiology, neuropharmacology, and attention, learning and memory, reproductive behav\u00ad ior, and communication. The importance of developmental and comparative approaches to these problems is stressed. The Department of Psychobiology offers graduate training lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate students must complete a sequence of core courses (lectures and laboratories) during their first and second years. They also must take a min\u00ad imum of four advanced courses before graduation and must par\u00ad ticipate in directed research and teaching each year. To advance to candidacy, the student must prepare a critical review paper in the area of the proposed dissertation research and must pass an oral examination in psychobiology by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on successful preparation and oral defense of a dissertation based on the student's research. Students are expected to complete this program in five years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken under\u00ad graduate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory physics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit GRE Aptitude test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergraduates. The Department accepts only those students seeking a doctorate, though students who do not successfully complete their course work or do not advance to candidacy may, with the consent of the faculty, complete a Master's thesis and receive an M.S. degree in Biological Sciences. Applicants with substantial outside commitments that would curtail laboratory research or prolong the time to degree are not accepted. Students are encouraged to take the GRE no later than October.

Swett: Peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, pain mechanisms Yasuhiro Torigoe: Visual and vestibular regulation of eye movements The Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, intracellular physiology, molecular neurobiology, forebrain organization and development, and structure and function of sensory and motor systems. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following of neuroscientific data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using interdisciplinary techniques. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the necessary technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative, fundamentally important research. The second goal is to gain the knowledge and ability 'to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anat\u00ad omy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the indi\u00ad vidual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modern neurobiology, with an emphasis on morphology, chemistry, and physiology. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in neuroanat\u00ad omy and physiology, including a year-long course in neural sci\u00ad ence techniques. In the second year, students take a year-long course in neural systems, as well as biochemistry and pharmacol\u00ad ogy courses. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to complete a practical course in statistics, selected departmental seminar courses, at least two laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology or other departments on campus may also be taken. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Fol\u00ad lowing the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in the neuroanatomy core course. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991114 Biological Chemistry The emphasis of the graduate program in Anatomy and Neuro\u00ad biology is on research, and a student's participation in laboratory research begins in the first week of graduate study. Students rotate through at least two laboratories during the first two years. By the end of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the disser\u00ad tation research. A two-part Qualifying Examination at the end of the fall quarter of the third year is given to the student by a Can\u00ad didacy Committee. The first part consists of a written examina\u00ad tion in three of the following areas: molecular and ral systems-motor,and neural systems-other. The second part consists of an oral examination. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Dissertation Committee, and an oral research proposal is made. The majority of the third and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Dissertation Committee constitutes the final exami\u00ad nation. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded fol\u00ad lowing completion of all the requirements, a process that nor-. mally will take four years to complete.

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991118 FineArts School of Fine Arts Robert Hickok Dean The School of Fine Arts is dedicated to the study, creation, and performance of the arts within the context of their history and theory. The School consists of the Departments of Art History, Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art. Each department offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs, with the exception of the Department of Art History which currently offers the B.A. degree only. The degree programs include exten\u00ad sive studio, workshop, and performing experiences, theoretical and historical studies, and work in criticism. In addition, the School offers a General Interdisciplinary Program which includes significant work in serveral Fine Arts departments. All of the School's departments are located in the Fine Arts Vil\u00ad lage, facilitating daily interaction between students in all Fine Arts disciplines. The Village includes studio and classroom facili\u00ad ties, five theatres, a concert hall, the University Art Gallery, the Gassman Electronic Studio, and a television studio. Profession\u00ad ally operated scenery and costume shops supporting the School's extensive production and performance schedule also are located in the Village. Fine Arts students regularly participate in choirs, instrumental ensembles, drama and dance productions, and art exhibitions. Qualified students from other academic areas also are eligible to participate in many of these activities and are encouraged to do so. Many of the School's future productions will be held in the new Irvine Theatre, a fully equipped, 750-seat performing facility that is scheduled to be completed in fall 1990. In addition to the artists, scholars, and performers who are members of the Fine Arts faculty, visits by distinguished guest artists/teachers are a regular feature of the School's activities. Students receive assistance with program planning and a variety of other support services from the professional staff in the Office of Fine Arts Student Affairs. The staff also assists the faculty in providing academic counseling to Fine Arts students. Degrees Art History ......................................... B.A. Dance ..................................... B.A., M.F.A. Drama ...................................... M.F.A. Education Abroad Program Upper-division, and in some cases graduate, students have the opportunity to experience a different culture while making pro\u00ad gress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which oper\u00ad ates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and col\u00ad leges in 33 countries throughout the world. Detailed information is available on page 63. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding Fine Arts majors who are interested in a career in arts management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encour\u00ad ages students to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of several disciplines. Information is available on page 173. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be considered for honors at graduation. General criteria are that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus and must have a grade point average of 3.0 or better. More specific criteria include, but are not limited to, cumulative grade point average in the major, curricu\u00ad lum breadth, and extracurricular efforts such as service to the major of the School, and creative/artistic activities. See the indi\u00ad vidual departments for additional information. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than 12 percent of the graduating seniors may receive honors. Undergraduate Program Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: None Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments Graduate Program The School of Fine Arts offers programs leading to the Master of Fine Arts degree in Fine Arts with a concentration in Music, to the Master of Fine Arts degree in Dance, to the Master of Fine Arts degree in Drama, and to the Master of Fine Arts degree in Studio Art. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is performance-the creative act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio expe\u00ad rience. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and histori\u00ad cal courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce literate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence can\u00ad not exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quaJter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March I as the number of grad\u00ad uate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for auditions, inter\u00ad views, and the submission of portfolios, compositions, and dos\u00ad siers, as appropriate, by March l. Students applying for scholar\u00ad ships and fellowships should do so by February I, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June I for the fol\u00ad lowing academic year. Upon admission to the program the student is assigned an ad\u00ad visor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if full benefit from graduate study is to be derived. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Margaret Murata, Ph.D. Professor of Music I t is often said that a good education is one that teaches you how to learn: But if it were just a matter of learning facts, a universal encyclopedia or up-to\u00ad date database could replace teachers everywhere. What teachers do, of course,\u00b7 is select the informa\u00ad tion they think is most important to impart. What profes\u00ad sors do further is structure information, as well as observa\u00ad tion and interpretation, by constant're-examination and re\u00ad invention of both structuring and modes of observation. Professors find new facts and ideas and thereby change our knowledge of whole sets of facts and ideas. A good college education, then, not 'only allows a student to absorb. information about a subject (say, musical harmony) but also to witness firsthand how knowledge about a subject is created, to se'e by demonstration how we think we know anythi~g about anything. The way to learn is by finding out how we know. We evaluate perception, we explore cognition, we test cul\u00ad tural bias, we discover the formative hand of history\u00ad from the Greek's atomos to Cold War detente, from cave paintings to video art. Medieval music shocks us out of our Romantic prejudices. Modern music tests our abilities to make sense of sound. We discover that musical symbols are not universaL Questions arise: What is natural? What makes beauty? What is expressed in \"expression\"? What\u00b7is music? A good general education leads one to evaluate old questions and ask new ones. Only this teaches us the qual\u00ad ity of our knowledge. If we ask, What do humans create? What do they do? and Why? then we are forced to ask the most educational question, What are we doing, and why?

Yale University, Associate Professor of Drama and Head of Directing The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to investigate the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the pro\u00ad gram emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in four of the School's departments. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of the Chair or an appropriate advisor. Because the general interdisci\u00ad plinary program is designed for students with a strong sense of personal direction and a desire for an academic appreciation of the arts, students wishing to enter the program must submit a statement of purpose to the General Interdisciplinary Studies Committee prior to the quarter in which they intend to declare their major. Admission to the program is based upon the state\u00ad ment of purpose and upon the student's prior record of high aca\u00ad demic performance. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdiscipli\u00ad nary as the area of concentration. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. European study centers of particu\u00ad lar interest to the Fine Arts (General Interdisciplinary) major which are strong in the history, theory, and criticism of the arts are located in Vienna, Austria (music, art), Copenhagen, Den\u00ad mark (medieval studies), Paris, France (French critical thought and film criticism), Gottingen, West Germany (music, archaeol\u00ad ogy), and Bologna, Italy (music, art, drama). Arts courses also are part of the general curriculum in other study centers in France, Hungary, Spain, Israel, and Sweden, in addition to arts courses in English-language study centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, and India.

The Art History curriculum is designed to provide a comprehen\u00ad sive study of art as a humanistic discipline. The program is con\u00ad cerned with both the formal structure of the visual arts and their function within society. Students majoring in the history of art thus are urged to take appropriate courses in classics, history, literature, and philosophy, as well as in other areas of the fine arts. All majors also are encouraged to study a second language beyond the minimum departmental requirement of two years in a single foreign language at the University level. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Study centers of particular interest to Art History majors are in Vienna, Venice, Padua, Madrid, Cairo, Jerusalem, Leningrad, Latin America, France, Great Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia. In addition, students focusing in Asian art may be interested in programs in China, India, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, or Japan; and Chengchi University in Taipei offers a track in English that is devoted to Chinese art and art history. Special scholarships are available for Pacific region programs. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Careers for the Art History Major A Bachelor's degree in Art History is excellent preparation for pursuing either a career as an art historian, art conservator, or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely different discipline. Art History majors have gone on to graduate and pro\u00ad fessional school to study art history, archaeology, architecture, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the fine arts), or teacher education. The study of the history of art is a valuable part of a liberal education that provides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: None.

The Department prepares students for various professions in the field of dance by providing a curriculum and an at\u00ad mosphere in which the student may create, perform and analyze, and study dance from historical, philosophical, and scientific perspectives. The program proyides studio experience in the knowledge and techniques of classical ballet, contemporary dance, historical dance forms, and selected ethnic dance cultures. Theoretical studies include history; philosophy, aesthetics, and criticism; notation; teaching methods; and dance science. The traditional technique 9f classical ballet constitutes a craft and style for the dancer that serves not only as a basis for the logical training of the. body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. While ballet is emphasized by the Department, it is balanced by work in other genres. Studio expe\u00ad riences build progressively on the techniques of baliet and extend through the contemporary idioms of modern and\" jazz as well as through historical and ethnic dance forms. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, creativity, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive dancer. The theoretical, historical, and scientific courses are designed both to broaden the perspective of those students whose first interest is performance or choreography and to provide a founda\u00ad tion and beginning of training for those students who plan to pursue careers in the academic, scientific, or administrative fields of dance. Careers for the Dance Major A career in dance requires excellent training and extraordinary discipline, tenacity, and dedication. Beyond the perhaps more obvious careers in professional dance performance, choreog\u00ad raphy, and teaching, the major in Dance also serves as a basis for graduate study or job opportunities in fields such as dance his\u00ad tory, dance science, dance reconstruction, dance criticism, and dance video. Related fields, such as arts administration, law in relation to the arts, arts therapies, design, and music also offer positions for the individual trained in dance. Graduates of the Department have an excellent record of place\u00ad ment in the many fields of dance. Some have become professional dancers in ballet companies (including the San Francisco, Frank\u00ad furt, and Stuttgart Ballets); in modern dance companies (includ\u00ad ing the Bella Lewitzky, Lar Lubovitch, and Bat-Dor Companies); and in musical films, television, and theatre. Others have entered the professions of dance education, dance anthropology, medi\u00ad cine, law, and psychology. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to major in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet, modern, and jazz dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet, modern, and jazz at which the student is placed. Freshmen declaring the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I, Modern I, and Jazz I. At the end of the freshman year the stu\u00ad dent should select one of the five major emphases with faculty approval. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty deter\u00ad mines whether the student is making sufficient progress to pro\u00ad ceed in their desired emphasis. All advanced standing applicants to UCI (entering students with 12 units or more) who have indicated an interest in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the student's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and will indicate the appropriate placement level in ballet and modern for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the min\u00ad imum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Students who wish to be considered for the under\u00ad graduate choreography emphasis must show examples of their work, either on videotape or by prearranged audition. Inasmuch as the level of performance abiiity generally determines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must antici\u00ad pate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of performance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet performance requirements.

Each Drama major studies and practices in each of several mutu\u00ad ally related areas of the theatre: performance, literature, history, criticism, and design and production with particular emphasis upon performance. The curriculum is structured to relate studio practices, technical resources, and production techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical theory. The program is designed for students preparing to work profes\u00ad sionally in the theatre, often after more specialized training at the graduate level, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Careers for the Drama Major A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employment in theatre or films. A professional career demands, in addition to excellent training, great talent, great dedication, and not a little bit of luck-intangibles no drama program can promise or even imply. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and television. They serve as artistic directors, designers, art directors, business man\u00ad agers, and performers at more than 100 theatre companies, and as faculty at more than 75 insitutions of higher learning. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts management, advertising, and teaching; others pursue further study earning the Master of Fine Arts degree at UCI or elsewhere.

Programs of Study The Department of Music offers two undergraduate degrees (the Bachelor of Arts in Music and the Bachelor of Music), an under\u00ad graduate minor in Music, and the Master of Fine Arts degree in Fine Arts. The Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree program is performance\u00ad oriented. It offers students the opportunity to specialize in one of the following: bassoon, clarinet, contrabass, flute, French horn, harp, lute and guitar, oboe, percussion, piano, saxophone, trom\u00ad viola, appears on the student's UCI transcript.) In addition, B.Mus. students may qualify for the Special String Performance option, an intensified curriculum for professional-level students. All B.Mus. students receive continuous private instruction and present a solo recital during their senior year. B.Mus. students participate in performance classes each quarter. Vocal perfor\u00ad mance students focus on diction, movement, stage presentation, repertory, criticism, and style. Guitar and lute students focus on ensemble work, repertory with other instruments and voice, criti\u00ad cism, and pedagogy. Piano students give weekly solo performan\u00ad ces before other students, and also focus on criticism, style, and interpretation. String, wind, brass, percussion, and also piano students focus on quartet work, small ensembles, and solo sona\u00ad tas privately coached and presented in afternoon recitals. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree program enables students to pursue elective subjects in music (such as composition or con\u00ad ducting), in the fine arts, or in other academic disciplines. Several music scholarships are offered to promising undergradu\u00ad ate performers. Application for a scholarship audition (usually held in November, January, and May) should be made at the departmental office as soon as possible after the student has applied to the University; telephone (714) 856-6615. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad their junior year (see page 63). Music majors may enroll in conservatories and universities in several countries; highly qualified performers may be eligible to attend the Conservatorio G. B. Martini in Bologna, Italy. In each baccalaureate degree program, students receive private lessons on their instruments, or in voice, and perform in orches\u00ad tral or choral concerts, in chamber ensembles, and in solo reci\u00ad tals; however, such participation varies according to which degree the student elects to pursue. A five-year program coordinated with the UCI Office of Teacher Education is available for students interested in obtaining a Cali\u00ad fornia Teaching Credential. The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree program in Fine Arts emphasizes composition, choral conducting, voice, piano perfor\u00ad mance, and instrumental performance. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Music 133 Music majors receive private lessons from faculty artists such as Lecturer Haroutune Bedel ian and perform in orchestral or choral con\u00ad certs, in chamber ensembles, and in solo recitals. Performance Opportunities The Department offers a variety of choral ensembles that give every student, regardless of major, the opportunity to sing. Some groups participate in international concert tours. The California Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Madrigal Singers, Women's Chorus, Men's Chorus, University Singers, and Jazz Singers make up the permanent ensembles. Additional performances are presented in conjunction with professional orchestras, invitational festivals, and Southern California concert venues. In December, the Department also produces the annual series of Madrigal Dinners that celebrate the Christmas season at the court of Henry VIII. The UCI Symphony Orchestra offers participants an opportunity to explore the great masterworks of the standard orchestral reper\u00ad tory. The orchestra performs a number of programs each year and each performance ,features a guest artist. Artists during the 1989-90 season included Lincoln Mayorga, piano; Magic Flute was pres\u00ad ented in conjunction with the Departments of Drama and Dance. Careers in Music A degree in Music offers many career opportunities. Music is a highly competitive profession and a degree may or may not lead to professional employment with an orchestra or as a concert artist. Many graduates do, however, become successful freelance members of symphony orchestras, composers, and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in performance, music history, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composition, or secondary or postsecondary education. Some graduates have made careers in music publishing and in the recording industry.

The curriculum constantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness through as wide a range of the study of arts as possible. The student majoring in Studio Art develops creativity by learning to think with the materials and techniques of various media. Departmental faculty expect students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels to be willing to experiment and change rather than to conform with the kind of work they were doing when they were admitted into the program. The faculty supports work in process as well as finished projects, so long as the student is practicing sustained and disciplined work habits. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Special programs for Studio Art majors are offered in Venice (for graduate-level study also) and in Florence; the latter program, at II Bisonte, focuses on lithography and intaglio printmaking. Careers for the Studio Art Major Department faculty and gallery exhibitions have provided career examples and inspiration for prospective professional artists. An unusually high percentage of alumni have gone on to successful exhibitions and arts management careers. Many graduates teach at all levels and work in museums as curators or preparators (those who prepare the gallery for an exhibit and hang or install the works). A Studio Art major is also good preparation for graduate-level study. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: None.

General Information The M.F.A. program focuses on development of experimental concepts and approaches relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on traditional techniques and ideas. A small, personal environment supports the individual's efforts in research, development, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possible. Faculty meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups provides a vari\u00ad ety of art experiences. Internships, selected field trips, contem\u00ad porary exhibitions in the University Art Gallery, contact with vis\u00ad iting professional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Off-campus graduate student studio space is available on a limited basis by application to the appropriate program chair or to the graduate advisor. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March I a portfolio of their creative work or 12 or more slides, on a #80 Kodak Carousel tray, of their most recent work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admission into the program. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclu\u00ad sive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee yearly. A satisfactory opinion by this commit\u00ad tee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific crea\u00ad tive project, which usually takes the form of a graduate exhibition in the University Art Gallery. This project is to be supported by a thesis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the project and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the can\u00ad didate's general knowledge in the area in which the project falls. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper-division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B or a Satisfactory in each course. Not more than 20 units in upper-division courses may count toward the degree. Electives may be taken in any discipline.

Parsons Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its students with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human com\u00ad munication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the ver\u00ad bal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of language, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamentally with the texture and dimensions of experience, both individual and social, past and present. The School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal education not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the dis\u00ad ciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with lan\u00ad guage and its many facets. Further, though the School has estab\u00ad lished a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the under\u00ad graduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

B.A., M.A., M.A.T., Ph.D. Honors at Graduation Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be eligible for nomina\u00ad tion the student must, by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year, file an Application for Graduation and meet the fol\u00ad lowing criteria: (I) achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40, (2) complete at least 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC campus, and (3) receive strong recommendation from the major department. Eligible students are automatically considered for Honors at Graduation. Undergraduate Programs The School offers undergraduate majors in Chinese Language and Literature, Classical Civilization, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, Film Studies, French, German, History, Humanities (an interdisciplinary major which might include an Emphasis in Women's Studies, Concentration in Religious Stu\u00ad dies, Minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies, Minor in Latin American/Chicano Studies, or other area of interest), Japanese Language and Literature, Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers courses in Italian and Portuguese. The Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office, located in the Humanities Annex Building, is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Transfer students in particular will need to consult an academic counselor to determine major requirements. Students who expect to pursue graduate study also should consult with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores who are interested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and are especially knowledgeable about University regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the undeclared student keep options to a major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely will construct programs that include a good number of_such courses. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Human\u00ad ities, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to graduate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the human\u00ad ities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government ser\u00ad vice at all levels, and also medicine. Humanities Honors Program The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is designed to challenge superior students and provide them with unique oppor\u00ad tunities for interdisciplinary work. Honors Program participants have the added advantage of being able to pursue independent research with a faculty member and to participate in advanced seminars in humanistic inquiry. The Program is open by invita\u00ad tion to students from programs and disciplines outside the School of Humanities. Additional information is available from the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office; telephone (714) 856-5132. Language Learning Resource Center The Language Learning Resource Center (LLRC) provides facili\u00ad ties, services, and resources in support of foreign language learn\u00ad ing at UCI and throughout the extended UCI community. Included among the resources available through the LLRC are audio tapes, foreign language movies, computer software, and music libraries in various languages. LLRC services include training faculty in the use of instructional technologies for foreign language teaching, providing forums through workshops for sharing teaching technologies, and pro\u00ad viding referrals for translation, interpretation, and tutoring needs. Among the facilities located in the LLRC are a listening labora\u00ad tory (207 Humanities Hall), a language laboratory (213 Humani\u00ad ties Hall), a professional audio recording and duplicating facility (263B Humanities Hall), a video laboratory (207A Humanities Hall), and a computer laboratory. LLRC hours are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. For additional information telephone (714) 856-6344. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Associate Professor of History H istorians confront two challenges-to com\u00ad prehend people's experience of the past and to analyze processes of change. But it is dif\u00ad ficult to know when we have understood the minds and hearts of people with whom we cannot speak. It is equally difficult to know which set of events or circumstances was most responsible for condi\u00ad tions that followed when we cannot perform experiments. Our uneasiness on both counts has been exacerbated by our discoveries about diversity across societies. While foreign cultures display distinctive sensibilities, we continue to expect increasing similarities across societies. Humanitie~ 143 Americans tend to generalize from their own traits to expect others to become increasingly like them. This is doubly flawed. First, other societies remain different, a fact that most any African or Asian knows well. Second, we ourselves are hardly a homogenous group others can become similar to. This state of affairs has clear implications for both research and teaching. We need to strengthen non-Western studies and integrate these areas into the research prob\u00ad lematics of social science and humanistic disciplines, as well as into our teaching curriculum. If we can promote awareness of different ways of thinking and begin to explain the distinctive paths along which societies have entered the modern world, we will help give students tools with which to shape their own futures and to understand the world around them. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991144 Classics Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an over\u00ad seas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world. Detailed information is available on page 63. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer stu\u00ad dents may substitute appropriate course work in composition, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission; apply in the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office); two years of work in a single acceptable for\u00ad eign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equiva\u00ad lent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. Foreign Language Placement. Students entering UCI with pre\u00ad vious foreign language training are placed as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in 18-, 1C-, 2A-, or 28-levellanguage courses, respectively. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director. Transfer students may not repeat foreign language courses for which they received credit upon matriculation to UCI. Maximum Overlap Between Major Requirements: Students com\u00ad pleting double majors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both majors simultaneously (i.e., a double major in Comparative Literature and Spanish can count only two upper-division Spanish literature courses for both majors). School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed successfully at UCI. See individual major requirements for specific courses. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various departments. Further, several departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on commit\u00ad tees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student graduate advisory com\u00ad mittee, which directly advises the Dean. Department of Classics Faculty Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Chair of the Department and Professor of Classics (Greek and Latin drama, Greek poetry) Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Classics (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (computer applica\u00ad tion to classical literature, Augustan literature) Walter Donlan, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Professor of Classics (early Greek literature and social history) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history, Classical tradition) Shelley P. Haley, Ph.D. University of Michigan, Assistant Professor of Classics (Latin historiography, women in antiquity) B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Patrick Sinclair, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Assistant Professor of Classics (Latin prose, lexicography) Albert Watanabe, Ph.D. University of Illinois Visiting Assistant Professor of Classics (later Greek philosophy) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergraduate student with a working knowledge of the origins and heritage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: ( 1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical Civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), helping students, through courses in Clas\u00ad sical literature, history, civilization, mythology, and religion taught through English translations, to appreciate the high achievements of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an empha\u00ad sis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civil\u00ad ization in which most of the required courses are in English trans\u00ad lation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classi\u00ad cal authors in the original. From then on, courses are devoted to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students gain first-hand knowledge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue graduate study in the classics, yet wish to obtain an undergradu\u00ad ate degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of 10 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civiliza\u00ad tion, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion should obtain a copy of the brochure, \"Undergraduate Study in Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school UC IRVINE - 1990-1991work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) JB, IC, 25, and 101 respec\u00ad tively. Placement may vary, depending on the extent of the stu\u00ad dent's preparation. Students with transfer credit for Greek and/ or Latin may not repeat those courses for credit. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the under\u00ad graduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their consti\u00ad tuency, for representing the students' interest in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the academic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, planning a program of stuay, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, telephone (714) 856-6735 or 856-5896. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Normally two years of Hebrew are offered, which meet the Humanities foreign language require\u00ad ment. Emphasis is on modern Israeli-spoken Hebrew, with some instruction in Biblical Hebrew during the second year. Hebrew language courses will not be offered in 1990-1991. Courses will continue to be offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and Classical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): Greek I A-B-C; Greek 25; Greek 101- 102; Latin Classics Latin !A-B-C; Greek 25; Greek 101-102. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study. Greek concentration-Greek 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C; Latin 25, 101, 102; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Greek 120 recommended) or Latin concentration-Latin 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C; Greek 25, 101, 102; Linguistics 50, 110, 120, 130 (Latin 120 recommended). NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional course at the 100 level in the same language may be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) I A-B-C, or equivalent; Classics 35A-B-C or 50A-B-C; four upper-division Classics courses; three additional courses in classical history, classical phi\u00ad losophy, or classical art. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Classics 145 Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek !A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Greek 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Latin: Latin !A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Latin 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Classical Civilization: Classics 35A-B-C or Classics 50A-B-C; five courses from Classics 140, 150, 151, 160, 165, 169, 170. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students planning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest pos\u00ad sible moment to Jearn about the various programs. Career Opportunities The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for mod\u00ad ern life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a liberal education. Greek and Latin language and literature, history and philosophy, mythology and religion make an excellent basis for exploring all periods of Western culture down to the present day. Classics is an interdisciplinary study, exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, Jaw, manage\u00ad ment, and other fields welcome students with training in the Clas\u00ad sics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of a Classical edu\u00ad cation. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express themselves in clear, coherent, and cogent language, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physicians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the grad\u00ad uate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate further study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excel\u00ad lent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and linguistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of the humanities and social sciences. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991146 Classics Graduate Program From the program's inception in 1970, emphasis has been on close attention to each student's progress, together with a rela\u00ad tively high reliance on independent work. Each graduate student is assigned to a faculty preceptor, who monitors student progress in language skills, knowledge of the discipline, competence in research, and experience in teaching. The principal strength of the Department lies in the fields of language and literature. The graduate program is closely connected with the Thesaurus Lin\u00ad guae Graecae research project, and this especially recommends our program to prospective students interested in computer\u00ad assisted research in these areas. The Department offers a Ph.D. program with specializations in Greek or Latin. The program is based on a three-year cycle of seminar and course work. Graduate students enroll in the follow\u00ad ing courses each quarter for three years: Classics 220 (seminars, devoted mainly but not exclusively to major literary topics); Clas\u00ad sics 230 (directed reading courses, focusing on the graduate read\u00ad ing list); and Classics 240 (Greek and Latin language study, with regular exercises in prose composition and translation). Diagnostic tests administered at the start of the graduate stu\u00ad dent's career are used in planning work, so that each student is encouraged to focus their energies and to progress in a steady, organized manner. Progress evaluation examinations are adminis\u00ad tered regularly in order to identify student strengths and weak\u00ad nesses. Normally a total of three years of course work is required for the Ph.D. A comprehensive candidacy examination is required after the completion of course work, and a dissertation is required. Experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity normally is required. All students entering the Ph.D. program, with the exception of those granted advanced standing because they hold the M.A. degree from another institution, will be concurrently enrolled in the M.A. program. The requirements for the M.A. degree will be six quarters of course work (i.e., 72 units), passage of a special set of examinations, and completion of a paper. The normative time for completion of the M.A. degree will be two years. Course work for the M.A. degree will normally consist of three quarters of Classics 2IOA-B-C, three quarters of Classics 220, six quarters of Classics 230, and six quarters of Classics 240. Completion of a minimum of three quarters of Classics 220 is required. Students will be required to pass a departmentally administered reading examination in German, or otherwise demonstrate proficiency in German in a manner acceptable to the Department, by the beginning of the second year of course work. Demonstration of reading proficiency in German will be a prerequisite to admission to Classics 220 seminars. Upon completion of the requirements for the M.A. degree, a student will be permitted to continue in the Ph.D. program only upon a positive vote of a majority of the Classics faculty. In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, including computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read exten\u00ad sively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass a reading examination in a second modern language by the end of the third year. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage .. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by con\u00ad tributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrange-ments are in force among the Classics graduate programs of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Bar\u00ad bara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affil\u00ad iated with the Department of Classics although it is administra\u00ad tively separate.

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991148 East Asian Languages and Literatures Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures Faculty Pauline R. Yu, Ph.D. Stanford University, Chair of the Department and Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures (classical Chinese poetry and poetics, comparative literature) Steven Carter, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures (medieval Japanese poetry and intel\u00ad lectual history) Theodore Huters, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures (modern Chinese literature and literary history) The curriculum in East Asian Languages and Literatures enables students to understand the extensive and rich literary, historical, social, and aesthetic traditions of East Asia through the intensive study of Chinese or Japanese and of literary texts in translation and in the original language. Students take a total of four years of either Chinese or Japanese language courses, in which com\u00ad prehension, speaking, reading, and writing are stressed. Literary studies occur throughout the curriculum: the first three years stu\u00ad dents read literature in translation and the fourth year they read in Japanese or Chinese. The literature-in-translation courses consist of general introduc\u00ad tory overviews as well as more specific topics at the intermediate level for those students whose language proficiency is insufficient to cope with difficult literary texts. At the advanced level, course content focuses on reading texts in the original language and rotates among significant literary and cultural topics. In these courses, the curriculum integrates the study of East Asian litera\u00ad tures with theoretical issues that shape the study of world litera\u00ad ture in general. In this way, the student gains the dual perspec\u00ad tives of studying East Asian cultures on their own terms as well as recognizing the affinities these civilizations share with the emerging world culture. The Department offers two undergraduate majors: the B.A. degree program in Chinese Language and Literature and the B.A. degree program in Japanese Language and Literature. In addi\u00ad tion, the Department offers minors in these areas of study. Careers for the Major / Studies in Chinese or Japanese will give the student the intensive linguistic and cultural preparation needed to pursue a career involving these important Pacific Rim nations. In an era in which the United States is seeking to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities presented by this vital area of the world, the training in language and literature offered by the departmental faculty will serve the student well in a variety of endeavors, such as international business, law, government service, journalism, teaching, and other careers involved with public affairs. Under\u00ad graduate studies in Chinese or Japanese are also an indispensable prerequisite for those students intent upon purusing graduate study in any field of East Asian language or culture. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty adviser (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program that both fulfills the requirements of the major and covers the student's areas of inter\u00ad est in allied fields outside East Asian Languages and Literatures. Students are placed in Chinese and Japanese courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Chinese or Japanese taken in the United States is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school work will most often enroll in Chinese or Japanese 1 B, 1 C, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Students with background in an Asian language gained through primary or secondary school work taken in Asia must consult with the faculty to determine their proper placement level. Those who have gained substantial knowledge of Chinese or Japanese either through scecondary school work or through college-level lan\u00ad guage courses may not repeat those courses for credit. Prospec\u00ad tive majors who place out of the upper-division language requirement are expected to substitute an equivalent number of other upper-division Chinese or Japanese courses. The faculty encourages students to study in China or Japan, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently, after completing at least two years of study (or its equivalent) of the relevant language at UCI. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available in the Department office. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the Majors Two separate majors: Chinese Language and Literature and Jap\u00ad anese Language and Literature.

Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary con\u00ad cern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all stu\u00ad dents write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through two elected student committees, one of under\u00ad graduates, one of graduates. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommen\u00ad dations of student committees become matters of record which accompany any recommendations emanating from the Depart\u00ad ment. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Depart\u00ad ment have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. Careers for the English or Comparative Literature Major The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public relations, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Literature is also an especially good preparation for graduate study. Department advisors encourage their students to investigate vari\u00ad ous careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these students have completed their undergraduate educations. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a variety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of English, Amer\u00ad ican, and comparative literature. The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry or fiction. Undergraduate courses in journalism and nonfiction are also available, including formal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the campus news\u00ad paper. The aim of the program is to encourage the creative pow\u00ad ers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under cer\u00ad tain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category 1). See page 56. The Program in Comparative Literature, which though adminis\u00ad tratively a part of the Department, is basically interdisciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern educated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who com\u00ad pletes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or. national origins. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Comparative Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Two courses from the E 28A-B-C or CL 50A-B-C groups (includ\u00ad ing either E 28A or CL 50A) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 8; CR IOOA; CR IOOB and CL 100 (approved seminars from the course groups numbered in the 103s and 104s may be substituted for these courses); at least four courses from theE 101 group; at least five Department courses numbered above 101, excluding E 140, E 150, WR 139, or WR 179; competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at UCI (in classical languages, !A-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language. (Students electing Chinese, Japanese, or Russian should be aware that three years of language study or their equivalent are necessary as preparation for the study of literature.) Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR IOOA, CR IOOB, and three E lOis must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E 28A-B-C, CL 50A-B-C, or E 6, 7, 8 sequences, including at least one quart-er of E 28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 101 or higher, although two courses from the following may be substituted: CR IOOA, CR IOOB, WR IOOB, CL 100, Residence Requirement for the English Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recom\u00ad mended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Literature majors are normally required to take CL 50A-B-C. Transfer stu\u00ad dents may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR IOOA, CL 100 twice, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two difc ferent foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; two courses from CL 103 or CL 104; three additional upper-division courses chosen from the offerings in comparative literature, Eng\u00ad lish, literary criticism, and creative writing. Courses in allied areas, e.g., history, philosophy, social science, may be counted toward the major if they deal with literary or philosophical texts, though prior approval of a faculty advisor is necessary~ The Comparative Literature Program maintains a comprehensive reading list in world literature, on which CL 50A-B-C is based. Students may, by prior arrangement with the Director of the Pro\u00ad gram, take an examination on one or more parts of the list and thereby become exempt from one or more quarters of CL 50A-B-C. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: CR IOOA and four upper-division English or Comparative Litera\u00ad ture courses must be completed successfully at UCI. English and Comparative Literature 151 Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL 50A-B-C, CR IOOA, CLIOO, CL 103 or 104 (three courses), and one upper-division literature course taught in a foreign language. Residence Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully compieted at UCI. Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent pro\u00ad grams of study, including undergraduate seminars, workshops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an English or Comparative Litera\u00ad ture major as preprofessional training in government, law, medi\u00ad cine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospec\u00ad tive professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject teaching credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Education) to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of w,ork on the under\u00ad graduate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in Eng\u00ad lish, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may stress in their qualifying examina\u00ad tions and dissertations. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies, admits stu\u00ad dents to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close administrative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examina\u00ad tion, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philos\u00ad ophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion (GRE) including the Subject Literature in English Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991152 English and Comparative Ljterature Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the aca\u00ad demic year. The normal expectation, however, is enrollment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to com\u00ad plete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can frequently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature nor\u00ad mally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate depart\u00ad ments should be training college teachers as well as scholars\u00ad indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Compara\u00ad tive Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. Candidates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmen\u00ad tal office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate ad\u00ad visor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (I) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accomplished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Graduate Committee, who will review and assess the stu\u00ad dent's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. The Department of English and Comparative Literature sponsors a Summer M.A. Program designed for teachers. The M.A. degree in English is awarded to candidates who complete 32 units of graduate course work through two consecutive summers in the program and submit an acceptable Master's essay. Applicants from outside the State of California may apply for the program. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-to three-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will com\u00ad plete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); pro\u00ad ficiency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, mod\u00ad ern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evidence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of translation; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student takes general exam\u00ad inations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The student has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candi\u00ad dacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral examination on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: I. An undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equival\u00ad ent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suffi- cient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a particu\u00ad lar area of research and concerned with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between literatures, the the\u00ad ory and practice of translation, and other literary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the profes\u00ad sional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans UC IRVINE - 1990-1991and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly appara\u00ad tus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should complete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 ( Problems in Translation) with a project in either French or German and appropriate graduate-level work in Eng\u00ad lish, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as recommended by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty, which will be emphasized in progressing toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a preliminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowledge of one foreign language and literature and a considerable knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in consultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The student's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's specialization. Nevertheless, every list should include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional stu\u00ad dents may be exempted from taking the examination by petition\u00ad ing the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per\u00ad formance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director of the Program in Comparative Literature. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Comparative Literature, English, the various foreign language departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of compe\u00ad tence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student will be exam\u00ad ined in the following areas of knowledge: (l) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature.

Film Studies seeks to comprehend the appeal, function, and changing character of these aural and visual forms, and to consider how they affect our understanding and experience. The Program in Film Studies provides a systematic and compre\u00ad hensive exposure to cinema, television, and modern media. The curriculum is composed of a coherent sequence of courses which span the film medium's connection to other art forms, its histori\u00ad cal development, and its function as an institution and an indus\u00ad try. The Program familiarizes students with the history, theory, and aesthetics of cinema, a wide array of national cinemas, and individual filmmakers, period styles, and genres. Additional course work acquaints students with the practical and technical aspects of film production and scriptwriting. The curriculum is complemented by regular film series, visits from directors and scholars, and critical symposia. The School of Humanities charges a laboratory fee of $20 per course to all students taking Film Studies courses. Film Studies students have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the University's Education Abroad Program. Information is available both in the Film Studies Office and the Education Abroad Program Office. Career Opportunities In addition to providing students with a solid grounding in hu\u00ad manistic studies, a degree in Film Studies prepares students to seek a career as a film educator, to attend graduate school in film studies, to continue literary studies connected with film, and to work in the rapidly growing entertainment industry, in either its commercial or independent sectors.

It seeks to enrich students' appreciation of their. own civili\u00ad zations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mut\u00ad ually reinforcing. The Language Laboratory is used to comple\u00ad ment classroom activity. All upper-division literature and culture courses are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in number of students, they promote and encourage participation and discussion and facilitate direct contact with professors. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Careers for the French Major The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and commerce, where they can take advantage not only of their competency in communicating in French but also of what they have learned from the study of French literature and civilization. The study of literature teaches students to think critically and develops analyti\u00ad cal skills; it also helps them to express their own ideas clearly and persuasively. In practical terms, these skills will allow them to operate efficiently in marketing, publicity, public relations, and UC IRVINE - 1990-1991158 French and Italian management, where sophistication has become essential. A number of students also follow careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCJ students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Undergraduate Program in French While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teach\u00ad ing profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts pro\u00ad gram offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conver\u00ad sation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in their historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is intro\u00ad duced to various critical concepts and vocabulary. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or critical problem within a historical period. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodi\u00ad cally to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. ' Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French his\u00ad tory, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with a historical emphasis (for instance, the world of the Renaissance in France; the Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti-Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, poetry and painting; literature and society; women in literature; Paris and the history of art; literature and history). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the struc\u00ad ture of the French language and to phonetics. Students are placed in French courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school French is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school French will enroll in French IB, JC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this placement formula must be approved by the appropriate course director. Students with transfer credit for college-level French may not repeat those courses for credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the Major French Major with Emphasis in Literature and Culture: French II, 100A-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature, culture, or civilization. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, 100A-B, 10 I A-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Linguistics 50, I 10, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospective elementary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civilization is required by State credentialing authorities. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-division courses (above 101A-B-C) required for the major must be com\u00ad pleted successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French 100A-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division. Prerequisite: French 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfill the literature and culture or the linguistics emphasis. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, indus\u00ad try, journalism, law, civil service, etc. Undergraduate Program in Italian The Department offers a minor in Italian. Lower-division courses gradually develop the student's mastery of spoken and written Italian and, as the sequence progresses, introduce readings in literature and culture. A third-year, two-quarter sequence is designed to improve the student's proficiency in aural and written comprehension as well as in speaking and writing skills. A three-quarter introduction to Italian literature acquaints the student with major historical peri\u00ad ods and genres, and introduces the student to various critical concepts and vocabulary. Tutorial and seminar courses provide the advanced student with an opportunity for in-depth study of a single author, critical problem, or historical period. From year to year, the Department's offerings in literature vary considerably; students interested in planning course work in Italian should con\u00ad sult with Department of French and Italian faculty. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literature, culture, history, art, and music. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Italian JOOA-B, 101A-B-C, 130, and one other course outside the Department on Italian history, film, art, or other aspect of Italian culture, chosen in consultation with Department of French and Italian faculty. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program in French The Department's program of graduate study reflects its concern with the nature of both literature and the critical discourses used to interpret it. Seminars focusing on relationships between litera\u00ad ture and theory explore various critical approaches and engage related fields of inquiry such as history, philosophy, aesthetics, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and anthropology. Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Mas\u00ad ter's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most can\u00ad didates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. Particularly well\u00ad prepared students may receive special permission to take a min- UC IRVINE - 1990-1991imum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are coun\u00ad seled by the graduate advisor. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each stu\u00ad dent who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate stu\u00ad dents are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addi\u00ad tion to French is required for the M.A. degree (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral com\u00ad prehensive examination on material drawn from the class pro\u00ad gram and the Master's reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating skills of literary analysis and an understanding of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks as well to test the students' broader knowledge. The Master's examination is normally given at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examination and admission to the Ph.D. program, or upon admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Commit\u00ad tee is appointed in consultation with the student. The Guidance Committee advises the student in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The Commit\u00ad tee is composed of three faculty members from the Department, one faculty member from outside the Department, who repre\u00ad sents the student's outside area of specialization, and, for the defense, one faculty member who is not affiliated with the School. One member of the Committee is expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign lan\u00ad guages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A. and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specializa\u00ad tion are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Depart\u00ad ment and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all can\u00ad didates without previous teaching experience are required to par\u00ad ticipate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination-Written and Oral: Upon completion of course work, the student takes a series of examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The Ph.D. Exami\u00ad nation encourages focus and depth at a time when the student's area of specialization and eventual dissertation topic should be taking an increasingly clearer shape. Accordingly, the examina\u00ad tion is divided into five topic areas: author, genre, period, criti\u00ad cism, and an outside area. In consultation with the Guidance Committee, the student defines the precise nature and scope of the topics for the examination, which consists of written and oral parts. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Quali\u00ad fying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. French and Italian 159 Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and com\u00ad pletion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Department of German Faculty Ruth Kluger, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Chair of the Department and Professor of German (Kleist, nineteenth-century liter\u00ad ature, Stifter, Holocaust literature) Meredith Lee, Ph.D. Yale University, Associate Professor of German (lyric poetry, Goethe and eighteenth-century literature, German\u00ad Scandinavian literary relations) Herbert Lehnert, Ph.D. University of Kiel, Professor of German (modern German literature) William J. Lillyman, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of German (Romanticism, Goethe, Tieck) Bert Nagel, Ph.D. University of Heidelberg, Professor Emeritus of German (medieval German literature) Eric Rentschler, Ph.D. University of Washington, Director of the Pro\u00ad gram in Film Studies and Professor of German (German film, modern German literature, German comedy) Thomas P. Saine, Ph.D. Yale University, Professor of German (eighteenth-century German literature, Goethe) John H. Smith, Ph.D. Princeton University, Associate Professor of German (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and intellec\u00ad tual history, literary theory) The Department of German sees its contribution in the context of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of related but different languages and cultures. The Department offers courses on the German lan\u00ad guage and on German literature and film. The study of Gennan literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its historical, social, and political significance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate context. The history of German literature and film, the theory of literature and literary criticism, and the relations of German literature to other litera\u00ad tures are also studied in the Department's courses. German 161 Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in literature and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the lan\u00ad guage, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use is made of the Language Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic struc\u00ad ture of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be developed gradually. A three\u00ad quarter, third-year course stresses composition and provides an introduction to contemporary German culture. It can be followed by a course in phonetics which aims to perfect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectal variants. The introductory course in literature, usuallg' taken in the third year, presents a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarizes the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of literature, and uses these concepts in practical interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which cover German literature from the Reformation to the present and are especially recommended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) treats questions of theme and genre and topics in literary theory and criticism, as well as perspectives in German cinema. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of work and study abroad during the summer and the junior year. The University's. Education Abroad Program has study centers in Gottingen and Vienna, among other locations. Certain courses taken while participating in the Education Abroad Program are recommended as contributing to fulfillment of the German major requirements. Students are placed in German courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter ofUCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German IB, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second-year German instruction. Students with transfer credit for college-level German may not repeat those courses. Careers for the German Major German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sciences, busi\u00ad ness and management, and the computer sciences, and it is inval\u00ad uable for advanced work in the humanities and the fine arts. The ability to speak and write German, when combined with other skills and specific training, can open up opportunities in com\u00ad munications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, govern\u00ad ment, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, professional translating, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991162 German Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Literature Emphasis German 100A-B-C; German 101; eight upper-division literature courses; and two courses selected from German 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 50, English and Comparative Literature CL 50A-B-C, a course in German history, or a course in German philosophy, as approved by the advisor for the major. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Linguistic Emphasis German IOOA-B-C; German 101; five upper-division literature courses; Linguistics 50, I 10, 120; one course selected from Lingu\u00ad istics 130, a Middle High German course, or a course in the his\u00ad tory of the German Language; one course selected from German 140, 150, 160. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in linguis\u00ad tics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper\u00ad division courses required for the major must be completed suc\u00ad cessfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German 100A\u00ad B-C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical under\u00ad standing of the nature of literature in its specific application to literature written in the German language. The Department also offers regular courses devoted to the history, analysis, and theory of German film, viewing the medium in its relationship to other forms of expression as well as considering it as an art form in its own right. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The graduate program in German is essentially a program lead\u00ad ing to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to eam the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bache\u00ad lor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a for\u00ad eign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this requirement before entering the program. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candi\u00ad dates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (including works read during the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodo\u00ad logical progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secon\u00ad dary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively for\u00ad mulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the following items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The dis\u00ad cussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The course Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised indi\u00ad vidually as to remaining course requirements. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examina\u00ad tion. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the student will choose either ( 1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agreement with the candidate's examination com\u00ad mittee. The examination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from .a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examina\u00ad tion committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive competence in one lan\u00ad guage other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these require\u00ad ments may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the stu\u00ad dent should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the title page of the dissertation.

The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disci\u00ad plinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all History majors to participate in an introductory core course, History 29A, 29B, 29C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focusing on the historic process of moderni\u00ad zation in different societies over time. The Department has established a minor in History, designed for students who are interested in the study of history but who are majoring in other disciplines. The program incorporates the main elements of the Department's program for majors but allows stu\u00ad dents enough flexibility to pursue programs in other departments and schools. From this introductory course the student moves on to a series of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., European History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to historical analyses of political, socio\u00ad economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women and the Family in the United States). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international his\u00ad tory, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The colloquia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The senior seminar is a two-quarter research seminar in prim~ry materials that cul\u00ad minates in the writing of a research paper. Faculty members in the Department of History work closely with their students. All upper-division History majors are\u00b7assigned a faculty advisor, whom they are encouraged to consult at least once each quarter. Careers for the History Major The training and discipline derived from historical studies pro\u00ad vide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. Many students who com\u00ad plete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to graduate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, manage\u00ad ment, public relations, publishing, and government service. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A, B, C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history); at least five upper-division historical studies courses; at least one collo\u00ad quium and one senior seminar (a two-course sequence) or three colloquia; and three additional courses (which may be drawn from lower-and upper-division offerings). Residence Requirement for the Major: Three historical studies and a senior seminar (or two colloquia) must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required, including either at least one quarter of History 29 or at least one quarter of History 50. (Minors are encouraged to take the full History 29 sequence.) At least four of the remaining six courses must be upper-division History courses and must include two colloquia or one senior seminar. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-division History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both advanced his\u00ad torical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologically sophisti\u00ad cated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candi\u00ad dates for an advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and mod\u00ad els. The History and Theory course also examines the phenome\u00ad non of modernization-the general world transformation of the past four hundred years-and seeks to understand the social institutions through which this process has occurred. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self\u00ad consciousness and methodological facility have been systemati\u00ad cally and carefully developed. During the first year of study, graduate students take a pro\u00ad seminar and an associated one-quarter research seminar. Each proseminar provides an orientation to the literature on a broad historical subject, and an associated seminar offers guidance in research and writing on problems within these broad areas. Stu\u00ad dents awarded M.A. degrees at other institutions before entering History 165 the graduate program at UCI may be exempted from this requirement, subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses. During the second year of study, Ph.D. students take a second proseminar. They also take a two-quarter research seminar where they have an opportunity to work on problems of their own choosing; students entering with an M.A. degree must also take this seminar. The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief histori\u00ad cal works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowl\u00ad edge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American history and modern European history, biannually in early modern Euro\u00ad pean history, Latin American history, and ancient history, and occasionally in medieval history. A student may prepare a disser\u00ad tation in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop three fields of competence in preparation for a comprehensive examination. These fields are: first \"time-place\" field (field in which the dissertation is written); second \"time-place\" field; and \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intellectual, or interna\u00ad tional history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical community at Irvine in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in His\u00ad tory, the Department also accepts students who have previously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sus\u00ad tained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommenda\u00ad tion, scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and exam\u00ad ples of written work in history from their undergraduate classes. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is March 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoretical and historiographical dimensions of history. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia, two in proseminars, and one in a related first-year research seminar. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirement. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Students in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a one-quarter departmental course in quantitative methods for the M.A. foreign language requirement. Language proficiency is usu\u00ad ally demonstrated by passing a departmental exam administered by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language; students can also fulfill the requirement by achieving a score of 500 or more on the appropriate ETS examination. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991166 History Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive oral examination covering the student's major field (e.g., America, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in aca\u00ad demic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, example(s) of written work; and apti\u00ad tude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. In addition, a departmental interview may be required. Ph.D. students are advised to begin their graduate work at UCI, since those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming students, with the exception of the First Year Research Seminar. Subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses, students will be exempted from this requirement. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to advantage in speeding them to examinations. To be admitted formally into the doctoral program, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is March 1. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in four different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the stu\u00ad dent's dissertation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the problems and phenomena of the field, to make comparisons, and to introduce the student to the theory and method of relevant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and the two Research Seminar sequences. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. However, applicants may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows students to take a lighter course load at reduced fees. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, completion of the M.A. foreign language requirement will fulfill this requirement. Profi\u00ad ciency usually is established by passing a departmental examina\u00ad tion administered by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language; students can also fulfill the requirement by obtaining a score of 500 or more on the appropriate ETS examination. Stu\u00ad dents in American history who have opted for a language substi\u00ad tute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the alternate skill requirement discussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the stu\u00ad dent selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying examinations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in American history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by passing a language examination designed by a faculty member or by achieving an ETS score of at least 500), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., statistics, linguistics) that will be useful in mastering the chosen historical fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non-American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second for\u00ad eign language. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work, the student will take written examinations in the two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral Qualifying Examination in the \"focus\" field and first \"time-place\" field. Upon successful completion of these examina\u00ad tions, the student will be advanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation normally will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years.

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991170 Humanities/Women's Studies Special Programs in the Humanities Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Community; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's supervision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and Univer\u00ad sity requirements for graduation. (See pages 54 and 144.) Inquir\u00ad ies by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the Senior Academic Counselor in the School's Office of Undergrad\u00ad uate Study.

As an interdisciplinary course of study, the Emphasis in Women's Studies offers an opportunity for reflection upon these relationships from a variety of perspectives and from the broadest point of view. Courses focus on the cultural role of women, women's history, and women's socioeconomic condition, as all of these have been con\u00ad ceived traditionally and as they are currently undergoing change in the modern world. The value of pursuing this Emphasis at this time will continue to increase as women come more and more to take positions of decisionmaking and leadership in determining the future shape and direction of cultural and social life. The Emphasis equips students with the proper critical tools for accomplishing the historically unprecedented tasks with which they are faced in contemporary life. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Career Opportunities The degree in Humanities with an Emphasis in Women's Studies affords the student several options in diverse career fields in both the public and private sectors: several leading universities have begun to offer graduate training in women's studies; businesses and corporations, as more women join the workforce, are discov\u00ad ering needs for specialists in women's studies; and the growth of women's organizations, women's research centers, and women's resource organizations across the country and around the world (including the United Nations) indicate that opportunities for people with backgrounds in women's studies are growing and should continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines represented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate curriculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the concentration that participating students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the concentration takes as its subject all religion and reli\u00ad gious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western reli\u00ad gious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the con\u00ad tributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the concentration. The courses are gathered into three generic categories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the concen\u00ad tration, 343 Humanities Office Building. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991174 Humanities 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in manage\u00ad ment may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program.

Ph.D. with Interdisciplinary Emphasis in Humanities Critical Theory 175 The School of Humanities offers no degree called the Ph.D. in Humanities. However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modification of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs con\u00ad cerned. Such students will do about 60 percent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 percent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humani\u00ad ties series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Advisor in their major department. Emphasis in Critical Theory Committee on Critical Theory Mark Poster, Department of History; Director of the Emphasis in Criti- cal Theory and Director of the Critical Theory Institute Ellen Burt, Department of French and Italian David Carroll, Department of French and Italian Michael Clark, Department of English and Comparative Literature Lucia G. Cunningham, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Jacques Derrida, Departments of English and Comparative Literature and French and Italian Alexander Gelley, Department of English and Comparative Literature Wolfgang Iser, Department of English and Comparative Literature Murray Krieger, Department of English and Comparative Literature Jean-Francois Lyotard, Department of French and Italian David McDonald, Department of Drama J. Hillis Miller, Department of English and Comparative Literature Gonzalo Navajas, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Jane Newman, Department of English and Comparative Literature Leslie Rabine, Department of French and Italian John Carlos Rowe, Department of English and Comparative Literature Gabriele Schwab, Department of English and Comparative Literature David Smith, Department of Philosophy Juan Villegas, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Andrzej J. Warminski, Department of English and Comparative Literature An emphasis in Critical Theory, under the supervision of the Committee on Critical Theory, is available for doctoral students in all departments of the School of Humanities. Each Ph.D. stu\u00ad dent in Humanities may, with Committee approval, complete the emphasis in addition to the degree requirements of the student's graduate program. Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program requirements or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Criti\u00ad cal Theory) testifying that the student has satisfactorily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional requirements must be met: these consist of a sequence of courses in theory, a theoretical section on the qualifying examination, and a theoretical component in the dissertation. Critical theory at UCI is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assumptions, problems, and commitments of the various dis\u00ad courses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional humanistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any human\u00ad istic discipline. In recognition of the interdisciplinary nature and goals of critical theory, the Committee on Critical Theory coor\u00ad dinates the activities of theorists from literary, historical, philoso\u00ad phical, and linguistic fields of study. The emphasis consists of six graduate courses in critical theory: a three-course sequence offered in several departments and designed to introduce students to major theoretical issues and their historical settings; and at least three advanced seminars which build on the student's historical competence in order to UC IRVINE - 1990-1991176 Linguistics probe topics of contemporary interest. Additional theory courses are offered by several departments. The Critical Theory Institute (CTI) is an important resource for graduate students in Humanities doctoral programs. To acquaint Humanities graduate students with the most recent developments in the field, the CTI augments its teaching and research resources by inviting visiting theorists for varying periods of residence. The campus library has strong holdings in critical theory, and students also have access to the resources of the Rene Wellek Collection of the History of Criticism. The annual Wellek Library Lecture Series provides for an extended dialogue with major contem\u00ad porary theorists. For further information, please contact the Committee on Criti\u00ad cal Theory, School of Humanities, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717; telephone (714) 856-5583. Emphasis in the History and Philosophy of Science An emphasis in the history and philosophy of science is available for doctoral students in the Departments of History and Philo\u00ad sophy. The emphasis is administered by the Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science. Student participants must ful\u00ad fill special course, examination, and dissertation requirements. Additional information concerning the emphasis is available from the director, Professor Karl Hufbauer, 323 Humanities Office Building; telephone (714) 856-6317 or 856-4234. Graduate Courses Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 212, 220, and 230 introduce study in five disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seeking familiar\u00ad ity with disciplines other than their own.

Humanities 399 University Teaching (4-4-4) F, W, S. Required of and limited to Teaching Assistants. Program in Linguistics Faculty Bernard Tranel, Ph.D. University of California, San Diego, Director of the Program and Professor of Linguistics (phonetics, phonology, mor\u00ad phology, French linguistics) Richard Barrutia, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Spanish and Linguistics and Coordinator of the Education Abroad Program (Span\u00ad ish phonology, language acquisition, general applied linguistics including English as a Second Language and bilingualism) Mary Ritchie Key, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Linguistics (historical and comparative linguistics, American Indian languages, sociolinguistics, nonverbal communication) Armin Schwegler, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Assistant Professor of Spanish and Linguistics (history of Spanish, dialectology, historical linguistics, typology, Creoles) (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human languages, witn theories that seek to explain the nature of language, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. The undergraduate major in Linguistics, administered by an interschool Linguistics Committee, is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. A Linguistics minor is also offered .. There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an undergraduate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Linguistics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Humanities or through the School of Social Sciences. Track II, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents interested in areas of the cognitive sciences such as psy\u00ad chology and artificial intelligence. Track II may be taken through either the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Track III, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested in lan\u00ad guage teaching including but not limited to the teaching of Eng\u00ad lish as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students also may major in Classics, French, German, Russian, and Spanish with an emphasis in Lin,guistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Linguis\u00ad tics and either English or a foreign language. This is especially recommended for students following Track III. Students who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Careers in Linguistics A major in Linguistics prepares students for a wide variety of careers in teaching, law, publishing, and public service, among others. Linguistics at UCI is also excellent preparation for gradu\u00ad ate work in a number of areas. General Linguistics prepares stu\u00ad dents for advanced work in the field; Theoretical and Formal Lin\u00ad guistics students may continue work in formal linguistics, psy\u00ad chology, or other areas in the cognitive sciences; and those who concentrate in Applied Linguistics may pursue careers in the teaching of English as a second language or in other areas of lan\u00ad guage teaching. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Lewis, Ph.D. Harvard University, Associate Professor of Mathematical Behavioral Science and Philosophy Roger N. Walsh, Ph.D. University of Queensland, Professor of Psychia\u00ad try and Human Behavior and of Philosophy Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insistently in every area of human experience and in every discipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and religion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Careers for the Philosophy Major The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excellent prepara\u00ad tion for a variety of careers. Many undergraduates trained in Phi\u00ad losophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or Philosophy 179 Special areas of interest within the School of Humanities include literary theory, Southern history, the philosophy of science, gender studies, American literature, and the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project. law. The analytical skills developed in Philosophy courses seem to be especially useful in legal education; indeed, many UCI Philos\u00ad ophy graduates have established fine records at top law schools. Former Philosophy students also have used their skills to advan\u00ad tage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforce\u00ad ment, and computer programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the graduate level, either in philoso\u00ad phy or a related discipline. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991180 Philosophy Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, there\u00ad fore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sus\u00ad tained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some pro\u00ad fessional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in grad\u00ad uate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30A-B, 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; two of the follow\u00ad ing: Philosophy 140A-B, 145A-B, or 170A-B; four additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 130. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of two portions: a lower-division portion and an upper-division portion. Both must be satisfied. Lower division: Three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 4, 5, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 6, 7, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 10, 11, 12, 13, 30A. Upper division: Four courses in a given subfield of philosophy, some of which have been pre-approved by the Department and are included below: Value theory (ethics, politicaVsocial, beauty), which includes Philosophy 111, 170A-B, 171,172,180,181,182, 184,and 190. / Epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science, which includes Philosophy 127, 145A-B, 155, 156, 160, 162, and 186. Metaphysics and philosophy of religion, which includes Phi\u00ad losophy 122, 140A-B, 195, and 196. \u00b7 Logic and philosophy of language, which includes Philosophy 122, 130A-B, 132, 133, 134, 150, 151, and 165. History of philosophy, which includes Philosophy courses numbered between 100 and 129 and Philosophy 181. Other four-course sequences may be possible, subject to writ\u00ad ten permission by the Department. Such a sequence must con\u00ad sist of related courses in a coherent subfield. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellec\u00ad tual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philo\u00ad sophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a faculty member whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the faculty each quarter about progress and any administrative or academic difficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of April. When the student has satisfied residency, tools of research, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Com\u00ad mittee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the disser\u00ad tation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio requirements for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in.which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the nor\u00ad mally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are require\u00ad ments for the Ph.D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate level in a disci\u00ad pline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an inte\u00ad grated unit in light of the student's research interest. *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and consist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wish\u00ad ing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Phi\u00ad losophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building; telephone (714) 856-6525. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Logic Requirement: Students entering the program are expected to be familiar with elementary quantification theory and some natu\u00ad ral deduction techniques. If they are not, students may take Phi\u00ad losophy 30A-B (no graduate credit is given for this course) or arrange to cover equivalent material in individual study courses. Students in the Ph.D. program must complete, with a grade of B or better, Philosophy BOA and BOB. Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philos\u00ad ophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. Papers will be evaluated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. The portfolio is due at the end of the fourth week of classes of the seventh quarter of residence. Breadth Requirements. Historical Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in at least four courses covering at least three of the following five historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Kant and nineteenth-century, and twentieth\u00ad century. Field Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in one course in metaphysics, one course in epistemol\u00ad ogy, and two courses in value theory. Both breadth requirements must be satisfied by the end of the seventh quarter of graduate study. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by fill\u00ad ing out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philoso\u00ad phy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including at least one member from an academic area outside of the School of Humanities is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a can\u00ad didate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the develop\u00ad ment of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee administers an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. Undergraduate Courses 1 Problems of Philosophy (4).

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991184 Russian Program in Russian Faculty Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Director of the Program in Russian and Associate Professor of Russian (eighteenth-century Russian theatre and literary theory, Pushkin, Chekhov, Kuzmin, Russian Symbolist theater, Russian literature and theater of the 1920s) Harold Baker, Ph.D. Brown University, Assistant Professor of Russian (comparative literature, critical theory, nineteenth century, pastoral) Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, Professor of Russian (modern Russian literature, peace studies, philosophy of nonviolence, Tol\u00ad stoy's thought, Gandhi's thought, religious studies, Russian intellec\u00ad tual thought, Pasternak's life and work) Russian is a language spoken by 215 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo\u00ad European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is English, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric poe\u00ad try to the seeming harshness and brashness of the futurist poets. For the first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have attained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant masterworks-in the original. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history and thought. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on lan\u00ad guage and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistic theory. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the frame- work of Slavic and general linguistics. , The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and litera\u00ad ture. This emphasis is based upon a multidisciplinary approach (through language, the arts, thought, literature, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to mankind's cultural heritage. Various specializa\u00ad tions and challenging new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Two minors are also offered by the Program. The Russian Lan\u00ad guage minor is geared to the student who already has a good command of the language and who wishes to strengthen language skills while acquiring knowledge of Russian literature in the orig\u00ad inal. Students whose main interests are cultural and historical will find the Russian Area Studies minor of value. Students planning to major or minor in Russian should contact the Program Office t J obtain the most current information. Stu\u00ad dents are placed in Pussian courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Russian is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian 18, 1C, 2A, and 28, respectively. Exceptions to this placement formula must be approved by the Program Director. Students with high school train:ng in Russian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. Students with transfer credit for college-level Russian may not repeat those courses for credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Program Requirements for the Major Russian Major with Emphasis on Literature: Russian IOOA-B-C; 101A-B-C; Russian Major with Emphasis on Linguistics: Russian IOOA-B-C; 101A-B-C; two courses from 180; Linguistics 50; 110; 30; 40; IOOA-B-C; 150A-B-C; two courses from three courses from History 137 A-B, Social Sciences 122A, and any other Rus\u00ad sian or Soviet studies course approved by the Program; choice of one course from 110A-B-C, 160, 170, 180.

Residency Requirement for the Russian Language Minor: Four upper-division courses must be-successfully completed at UCI. Program Requirements for the Russian Area Studies Minor Russian 1A; two courses selected from Russian 150A-B-C; His\u00ad tory 137 A-B; choice of three courses from the following: Russian 18-C, remaining course of Russian 150A-B-C, Russian 180; and either one of Social Sciences 122A or any other Russian area studies course approved by the Program. Residency Requirement for the Russian Area Studies Minor: Four upper-<livision courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with stu\u00ad dents on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the combined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to a career with the federal government, in private enterprise, or in education. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Information Office, and the Library of Congress all hire people who can speak and write Russian. The United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers opportunities in research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing. Because of the importance of Russia in world politics and eco\u00ad nomics, private businesses and corporations dealing in the inter\u00ad national marketplace increasingly employ persons skilled in Rus\u00ad sian language and knowledgeable about Russian society and political institutions. Individuals with degrees in Russian may find employment in private enterprise as interpreters and transla\u00ad tors in the following areas: library science, communications media, science, and technology. Students who major in Russian may either go on to graduate programs or enter a career in education. Many students have entered teaching at the secondary level, while others, after gradu\u00ad ate work in education, seek positions at colleges and universities. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of Russian provides access to a large body of the world's scholarly, scientific, and technical literature. While the study of Russian language, literature, and civilization provides training that may lead to careers similar to those described above, the major program is viewed primarily as a valuable component of a liberal education and an instrument for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Undergraduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese The main objectives of the program in Spanish and Portuguese are to develop competence in the ability to understand, speak, read, and write Spanish and Portuguese, and to provide through the knowledge of these two languages an understanding and appreciation of their literature and culture. Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Spanish is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Spanish will enroll in Spanish IB, IC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this placement formula must be approved by the appropriate course director. Students with transfer credit for college-level Spanish may not repeat those courses for credit. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary level. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year two\u00ad quarter sequential course stresses composition and introduction to literary analysis. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pro\u00ad nunciation and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced literature courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements:\u00b7 See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 144. Departmental Requirements for the Major Spanish 2C is a prerequisite to major requirements. Students are strongly advised to take Spanish IOA-B before the 101 series. Core: Spanish IOA-B, lOlA-B-C-D; Spanish !lOA, B, or C; Spanish 113A. In addition, the student must choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature. Two courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted. Linguistics: Linguistics 50, Spanish 113B plus any three selected from the following: Spanish 187; Spanish 200 or Linguistics 140; Spanish 201 or Linguistics 130; Spanish 205. Also, students must take two additional upper-division Spanish linguistics or linguis\u00ad tics courses. Students are encouraged to take the Spanish linguis\u00ad tics courses in their senior year. Students may double major in. Spanish and Linguistics but may not count the same course for both majors. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish IOOA; Spanish or 134A orB; one upper-division literature course. In addition, students are required to take Spanish IIOC of the core curriculum. For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguistics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113B (Spanish Linguis\u00ad tics).Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Spanish Minor Seven courses in Spanish, including Spanish lOA and JOB and at least four upper-division courses. Prerequisite: Spanish 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Portuguese Minor Prerequisite: Portuguese IC or the equivalent. Requirements: Spanish and Portuguese 187 Seven upper-division courses: Portuguese 140A-B, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145. (These are offered on a two-year cycle.) Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Career Opportunities Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, interna\u00ad tional relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Master's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. . Bilingualism and English as a Second Language are very useful preliminary emphases for ma\u00b7ny of the fields described above. These areas are closely related to the teacher preparation pro\u00ad gram offered by the UCI Office of Teacher Education for stu\u00ad dents interested in the Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis credential. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Graduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of the UCI undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239A, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maxi\u00ad mum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken and will also test students abil\u00ad ity to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in aca\u00ad demic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. The com\u00ad prehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991188 Spanish and Portuguese M.A.T. in Spanish This program is specifically designed to meet the needs of work\u00ad ing credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in the late afternoon. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of lO courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civilization; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. BilinguaVCross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addi\u00ad tion to the regular teaching credential for elementary school (Multiple Subject). See page 320. Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by choosing the track in Bilingualism and English as a Second Language. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a minor in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. The Department thereby hopes to aid in the formation of Ph.D. can\u00ad didates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. The Department is concerned also with the practical aspects of helping its graduates become good teachers. The secondary field can be Spanish literature, Spanish-American literature, Chicano studies, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, comparative literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other languages relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. Advanced study in one of these languages may be offered in lieu of the reading knowledge of the other. The choice of languages requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A. Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and synchronic (the student who selects Linguistics as a secondary field will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature); Spanish 239A-B; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the student's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specialization); two courses outside of the Depart\u00ad ment in non-Iberic literatures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish-American literature, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. B. Additional courses for the major and the secondary field: l. Ten courses in the major, including one course on theory of the genre. Those students who major in twentieth\u00ad century Spanish-American literature are required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the secondary field. Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another university will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, to evaluate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the stu\u00ad dent's graduate advisor direct the doctoral dissertation and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possi\u00ad ble. Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full\u00ad time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student-teach in an upper-division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a majority vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candidacy Commit\u00ad tee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A. The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Committee, may choose one of the following options: I. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts l, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a disserta\u00ad tion project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the examination de\u00ad scribed below. B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: \u00b7 l. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a rela\u00ad tively brief organic section will constitute the text. The stu\u00ad dent's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demon\u00ad strate the relationship of the text to the total work as well UC IRVINE - 1990-1991as to the author's total production and the author's posi\u00ad tion in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the com\u00ad prehensive exams, the student will write a dissertation project of approximately 40 typewritten (double-spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the com\u00ad prehensive exams. The topic as well as the dissertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and justify it by discussing its significance. b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theoreti\u00ad cal works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the prepara\u00ad tion and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examina\u00ad tion normally will be given while the graduate student is in resi\u00ad dence at UCI. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individ- ual Committee members on the title page. \u00b7 Courses in Portuguese lA-B-C Fundamentals of Portuguese (4-4-4) F, W, S.

Moore Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Mathe\u00ad matics, and Physics. In addition, a new graduate degree program in geosciences is being developed. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will prepare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical universe provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. The new geosciences program will also be grounded in the traditional physical sciences while breaking new paths in the quantitative study of changes in the global environment. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the aca\u00ad demic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergraduate and graduate students. Degrees Chemistry ............................... Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting can\u00ad didates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately I percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for stu\u00ad dents in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Students who choose a major in the School of Physical Sciences have a variety of academic advising and counseling resources available to them. In addition to faculty advisors, there is a Chief Academic Advisor in each department who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements, reviewing student petitions, and assisting with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff, employed in the Associate Dean's Office, is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In consultation with their faculty advisor or an academic counselor, students should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, stu\u00ad dents may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students inter\u00ad ested in either physics or chemistry usually will include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be accomplished by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21, Engineering 10, or Engineering ECEIIA. Career Opportunities The majority of graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engi\u00ad neering, or postsecondary education. Some students enter profes\u00ad sional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business administration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, marketing, or sales. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an over\u00ad seas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world. Detailed information is available on page 63. 3-2 Program Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students nor\u00ad mally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Physical Sciences 193 Roger D. McWilliams, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Physics Director, Campuswide Honors Program A t age 25, UCI is making mature contribu\u00ad tions to the world. I believe the 1990s will see UCI become an internationally renowned campus. Being 10 years older than UCI and perhaps halfway through life makes this a year for personal reflec\u00ad tion on where UCI and I have been and are going. In the mid-1950s, Orange County became home when my family migrated from the Midwest. As the County gained the population base for a major university, I watched bull\u00ad dozers clear the land for UCI in the early 1960s, and in the mid-1970s I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics here. Growth and youth were evident throughout the campus. The 1980s' immigration wave brought an international population, giving UCI the vital cultural base of great universities. And, UCI's academic programs continued to strengthen so that intellectual depth and diversity became the rule. UCI's important aspect, for me, is its mission as a research university. The balance between teaching and research provides a unique synergism. Teaching provides a broadly vigorous alld reflective atmosphere. Research allows the intensely introspective time required for profound creativity. Teaching one-on-one while doing exciting research con\u00ad tributes substantially to one's life. I am fortunate to know that all of my Ph.D. graduates are working in the field in which they trained, from positions as diverse as professorc ships to those in industry. The opportunities at UCI pro- , vided them with solid training in leading-edge research. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991194 Chemistry Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sci\u00ad ences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the following breadth categories: Cate\u00ad gory III (Social and Behavioral Sciences); Category IV (Humanis\u00ad tic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that any three consecutive foreign language courses are acceptable. The lower-division courses in the minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies (History 11, Physics 16, and Political Science 26D) also constitute an approved sequence for this requirement. Graduate Programs A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A\u00ad B-C is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject matter of this course serves also as a thorough introduction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Completion of a one-year sequence in organic chemistry, either Chemistry 51 A-B-C or 52A-B-C, is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of interest to others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direc\u00ad tion of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequisite for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are referred to page 196. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with an academic advisor and/or a faculty member. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 194. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: Mathematics 2A-B-C, Physics 5A-B-C and 5LB-LC, Chemistry and (or 51A-B-C and 51LA-LB-LC), Chemistry 107 and 107L, Chemistry 131A-B-C or 130 A-B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 139W, 192, 194, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the following laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry 170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135, 136 and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Biological Sciences 106 (Biochemistry), Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 107 (Molecular Biology), Physics II JA-B (Classi\u00ad cal Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Phys\u00ad ics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Phys-\u00b7 ics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Phys\u00ad ics), Physics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Information and Computer Science, and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coin\u00ad cide with those of the School of Biological Sciences. For this rea\u00ad son a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences is popu\u00b7 Sample Program -Chemistry Chemistry 195 Jar and requires little extra course work. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an under\u00ad graduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not mandatory, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses should be included in the program of study: two courses from Mathematics2D-E, 3A, 3D; Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 170, or 180. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry I A-B-C and ILB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry 52A-B-C and 52LA-LB-LC (or 51 A-B-C and 51LA\u00ad LB-LC); the Physics 5A-B-C and 5LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's discretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sciences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in a year sequence of physical chemistry and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). Chemistry 130A-B-C and 13IA-B-C are parallel courses in physical chemis\u00ad try; both are acceptable to satisfy the physical chemistry require\u00ad ments for the major. Chemistry 130A-B-C, designed specifically for students with career interests in biochemistry, biophysics, physiology, and other basic life sciences, emphasizes applications of physical chemistry to liquid solutions, macromolecules, and other topics of biological relevance. During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department electives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences or Chemistry-Physics double majors have been prepared. A sample program for the Chemistry major is shown below. Sample programs for students considering double majors or other specialized curricula are available. This sample program is designed to meet the needs of students wishing to major in chemistry while retaining sufficient flexibility to allow for development of other interests. Students interested in pursuing the American Chemical Society certified degree, or a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences, are encouraged to seek advice about program planning from a counselor or faculty advisor early in their academic career.

The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out inde\u00ad pendent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admis\u00ad sion to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs, all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' com\u00ad petence in the general areas of chemistry (e.g., organic, physical, inorganic) at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper fundamental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appro\u00ad priate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfac\u00ad tory completion of a series of Cumulative Examinations. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the classic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, stu\u00ad dents must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumulative Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination require\u00ad ment, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examina\u00ad tion for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's disser\u00ad tation research project, and an original research proposition con\u00ad ceived, developed, and documented by the student. The commit\u00ad tee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units), in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses (or 40 units). Graduate students are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least four quarters during their grad\u00ad uate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doc\u00ad toral dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptabil\u00ad ity of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candidate will be examined in public on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Mas\u00ad ter's thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in res\u00ad idence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. The program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI depart\u00ad ments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together to discuss research problems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdisciplinary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. See page 101. In cooperation with the UCI Office of Teacher Education, the Chemistry Department sponsors a coordinated two-year program leading to the M.S. degree in Chemistry and the California Secondary Teaching Credential. The M.S. degree may be obtained under either Plan I or Plan II described below. Prospec\u00ad tive graduate students interested in this program should so indi\u00ad cate on their graduate application and should request a detailed description of the program from the Chemistry Department Graduate Affairs Office or the Office of Teacher Education. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry.

To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, language, and residency requirements, and pass a com\u00ad prehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are three areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Mathematical Statistics. Each concentration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper\u00ad division or graduate courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses appli\u00ad cable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concen\u00ad tration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three addi\u00ad tional approved courses. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics con\u00ad centration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C and the A-B-C sequence of one of the following: Mathematics 201,292, 295, or Physics 212. The student must complete three additional approved courses; these may be selected from the immediately preceding list. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Sta\u00ad tistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C and 20ILA-LB\u00ad LC, Mathematics 202 and 202L, Mathematics 204A-B and 204LA-LB, and either Mathematics 203A-B-C or Mathematics 210A-B-C. Mathematics 199, 298, 299, and 399 may not be used to fulfill the course requirements for the Master's degree. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Master's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, Mathematics 220C, and Mathematics 230C. Applied Mathematics: Mathematics 2IOC, 220C, and the C part of the third one-year core course. Applied Mathematical Statistics: Mathematics 20 I C, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 204B. Students must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian. Proficiency in a higher level programming language may be substituted for French, German, or Russian only for the Master's degree with concentration in applied mathematical statistics. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of.study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant normally must have completed a Master's degree in Mathematics with distinction. Under certain circumstances, where there is evidence of deficiencies in preparation, applicants may be required to provide further evidence of the ability to suc\u00ad ceed in the Ph.D. program, by performing well, for example, in one or more of the specified comprehensive examinations. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student embarks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and individual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying examination and dissertation. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the quali\u00ad fying examination( or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consulta\u00ad tion with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instruc\u00ad tors' evaluations of the student's performance in courses and seminars. The departmental requirements for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree are: satisfactory performance in Mathemat\u00ad ics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, 230A-B-C (which can be taken as part of the Master's program) or the equivalent; satisfactory perfor\u00ad mance at the post-Master's level in three approved year-long graduate courses (nine one-quarter courses) which must exclude Mathematics 201,202, 204, 210, 220, 230, 298,299, or 399; satis\u00ad factory performance in two language examinations (French, German, or Russian); and satisfactory performance in the oral qualifying examination. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. After the student meets the requirements, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dis\u00ad sertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Yodh, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Vice Chair of the Department (Graduate Affairs) and Professor of Physics (experimental particle physics) Clare Yu, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of Physics (condensed matter theory) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of nat\u00ad ural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest particles of matter (quarks and leptons), nuclei, and atoms; the fundamental forces; the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engi\u00ad neering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living and a challenge to control these changes for the good of society. The knowledge gained in physi\u00ad cal studies has affected our daily life, our view of life, our philos\u00ad ophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various interests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in sev\u00ad eral forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. The faculty is vigor\u00ad ous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to com\u00ad munity action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty . interaction. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students without facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. The Physics major, concentrations in Applied Physics and Biomedical Physics, and a specialization in Astro\u00ad physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics Physics 207 are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized in the following table: Physics 3 Intended Audience Premedical students, Biological Sciences majors Prerequisites Algebra and trigo\u00ad nometry; concurrent enrollment in Math 2 Physics 5 Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engineering majors Math 2A (Calculus); Physics I or passing score on physics placement test. Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics 5C with All upper-division permission courses in physics Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements:. See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 194. Departmental Requirements Physics 16-24 Nonscience majors None None Physics 5A-B-C-D-E with 150-153); Mathematics 2A\u00ad B-C-D-E and 3A; and three additional coherently related four\u00ad unit upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Students who complete a program in Applied Physics, Biomedical Physics, or Astrophysics fulfill this requirement with course work taken in satisfaction of concentration or specialization requirements. Requirements for the Concentration in Applied Physics The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engi\u00ad neering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appro\u00ad priate engineering laboratory work. Requirements for the Concentration in Biomedical Physics The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus the follow\u00ad ing: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with associated labora\u00ad tories; Chemistry lA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: I. Chemistry 51A-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 . 2. Biological Sciences 105 plus two Psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 201A-B plus one additional Radiologi\u00ad cal Science course Sequences other than those above may be acceptable; approval must be obtained in advance from the program coordinator. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991208 Physics Requirements for the Specialization in Astrophysics The requirements of the specialization in Astrophysics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus the three astrophysics courses (Physics 137, 144, 145) and any two of the four special topics courses (Physics 132, 134, 135, 136). Introductory course work in computer programming (ICS 21, Engineering 10, or Engineering ECEIIA), Mathematics 3D, and Physics 20A or 20B are very strongly recommended during the freshman or sophomore years. Honors Program in Physics The Honors Program in Physics provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in Physics to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas of the Department, and leads to gradua\u00ad tion with Departmental Honors in Physics. The program requires participation in two quarters of Honors Research (Physics Hl95), in a two-unit Honors Seminar (Physics H196), and submission of a written thesis. Admission to the program is based on an application normally submitted by the sixth week of the spring quarter of the junior year. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.4 and a grade point average in physics courses of 3.5 or better. (Exceptions to these procedures and standards may be granted in unusual circumstances.) In selecting students for the program, the Department considers evidence of ability and inter\u00ad est in research. Additional information and program applications are available in the Department Office. Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical students, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompan\u00ad ies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 16 through 24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Phys\u00ad ics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics 5C. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics 5A-B-C. Physics I (or a satisfactory examination score as explained in the Physics 5A course description) is a prerequisite for the Physics 5 sequence and offers a review of math and problem-solving tech\u00ad niques in the context of introducing physics. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for students in phys\u00ad ics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas who are interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 2D concurrently with Physics 5C. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll in Mathematics 2D. Biological Sciences majors with facility in calculus should consider Physics 5 as an alternative to Physics 3. \u00b7 Physics courses numbered between 16 and 24 are general educa\u00ad tion courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and format of Physics 21 through 24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. Courses numbered I 10 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in physics. Courses numbered between I 10 and 116 emphasize the mathem\u00ad atical and theoretical structures that have unified our understand\u00ad ing of nature. It should be noted that multi-quarter courses such as PI13A-B-C must be taken and passed in sequential order. Courses numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. The Physics major with a career goal, for example, in medicine, law, teaching, or business should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. Any Physics major who is so inclined may take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, numbered 150 to 153. Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, German, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemistry are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid over\u00ad specialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. For example, exceptionally prepared students and/or Mathematics-Physics double majors may be allowed to substitute certain mathematics courses (Mathematics 140A-B-C, 142A-B-C, 144A-B) for Physics I 10. Furthermore, exceptionally prepared students are allowed to enroll in graduate-level courses; to do so requires the approval of the Physics Department Under\u00ad graduate Committee. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry !A-B-C and 5JA-B-C, and Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Physics majors who wi~h to follow an integrated program which com\u00ad bines biology and/ or chemistry with physics, and is suitable preparation for a graduate career in one of these interdisciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain: Education 173 and 174, and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 16 through 24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics 16 through 24 sequence may be appropriate.

It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particularly elec\u00ad trical engineering courses. In addition to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics Department. Examples of appropriate courses include Engineering Upon completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. Sample Programs -Applied Physics Fall Winter Spring Junior Physics I lOA Physics Engr. ECEI13 Elective Physics IIOB IOC Engr. Senior Physics li3A Engr.

Engineering ECE75 should be completed before the junior year. Program Planning-Biomedical Physics The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the student who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medi\u00ad cine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or phy\u00ad siology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and chem\u00ad istry (see table). A sequence of three or four integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator completes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The\u00b7 requirements are such that coordination of a pro\u00ad gram in the first and second years is essential. Program Planning-Astrophysics The Astrophysics specialization is primarily for students planning graduate work in astronomy or astrophysics. It also is a suitable focus for students who do not plan to pursue a graduate degree but anticipate a career in science journalism, teaching, science administration, or public relations. The course work includes that of the standard Physics major plus three courses in astrophysics (Physics 137, 144, 145) and two courses in related branches of physics (selected from Physics 132, 134, 135, and 136). Some familiarity with computer programming and differential equa\u00ad tions also is essential. Physics 20A or 20B provide a-useful intro\u00ad duction to the language of astrophysics. Graduate Program The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Phys\u00ad ics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primarily in recog\u00ad nition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma phys\u00ad ics, mathematical physics, gravitational physics, and astrophysics. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regu\u00ad lar colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate student is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to partici\u00ad pate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, plasma physics, and astrophysics. About 90 graduate students of physics were enrolled in 1989-90. Sources of support available to graduate students include teach\u00ad ing assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Stu\u00ad dents planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: ( 1) at least three quar\u00ad ters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a writ\u00ad ten comprehensive examination. Under special circumstances, a research project and thesis may be accepted in lieu of a written comprehensive examination. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualify\u00ad ing examination must register for Physics 264 (Seminar in Con\u00ad ceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 213C, 214C, 215C, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dis\u00ad sertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course require\u00ad ments. There is no foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classical Mechan\u00ad ics, Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B-C, must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strongly encouraged to take Physics 211, 212A-B-C, 213A-B, and 215A-B-C in their first year of study. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination are required to register for Physics 264. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will UC IRVINE - 1990-1991ordinarily take the core course in that Subject (:236A-B-C, 237 A\u00ad B-C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C-D) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. 'For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a writ\u00ad ten part and two oral parts. The written part, covering a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels, is normally taken in the fall following the student's first year. The first oral examination is administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be from the Department of Physics. A second attempt at this set of examinations will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraor\u00ad dinary circumstances. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approxi\u00ad mately one year after successful completion of the written exami\u00ad nation and the first oral. The candidacy committee that adminis\u00ad ters the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publica\u00ad tion in a scientific journal. The dissertation must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the UCI Physics Department. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualification and provide the foundation necessary for understanding and partici\u00ad pating in modern research might include: First 212A-BcC (Mathematical Physics); 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory); 215A-B-C (Quantum Mechanics). In the second and third years of graduate study, the student will take courses providing a background for dissertation research. Areas of concentration may include courses as shown below: For the student with an interest in astrophysics: 213C (Modern Optics); 214A-B (Statistical (Hydrodynamics); 236A-B-C (Astrophysics); 255 (General Relativity). For the student with an interest in condensed matter physics: 221 (Elasticity); 222 (Group Theory); 238A-B-C (Solid State Theory). For the student with an interest in elementary particle physics: 237 A-B-C (Elementary Particle Theory); 235A-B (Advanced Quantum Mechanics); 232B (Group Theory); 214A-B (Statistical Physics).

For example, transportation economists affect not only the roadways around the campus but also the highways of California. And, psychologists investigating development and aging affect the kinds of programs the government creates for both children and older people. Social policy decisions in the United States are based largely on the research of social scientists. Unless one understands the logic of research and the facts, one cannot evaluate the policy proposals put forward. An understanding of social sciences enables one to distinguish between policies put forward on the basis of prejudice and those put forward on the basis of true need. It is also very important that students know about the natural sciences-in particular, the physical sciences and mathematics. We live in an age where technology and an understanding of technology are increasingly important. Think, for example, of the important work being done in sequencing the human genome, which is of interest only given that we have the technology to make use of that knowledge and to exploit it for a common good. Scientific and technological literacy is essential so that an informed public can make the right choices and under\u00ad stand the priorities of government. Indeed, scientific liter\u00ad acy is absolutely essential for most career achievement and aspirations.

Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Chair of the Department of Cognitive Sciences and Professor of Psychology Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject areas of anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are included in the School's educational programs, but these pro\u00ad grams go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be char\u00ad acterized by the following three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional discipli\u00ad nary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cogni\u00ad tive anthropology, comparative culture, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that considers the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place substantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Educational opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with inter\u00ad ested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quar\u00ad terly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nomi\u00ad nate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of opportuni\u00ad ties for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Careers in Social Sciences Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many and diverse career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secondary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Many Social Sciences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doctoral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the professions of law and medicine, in education, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational pro\u00ad gram that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to understand quantitative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well-positioned for research and analysis positions in all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excellent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and professional programs. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni includipg career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Labora\u00ad tory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Labor\u00ad atory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms situated around a central core where two Micro Vax II systems are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for both faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educa\u00ad tional materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Laboratory of Anthropology is used for research in medical anthropology, quantitative studies, discourse analysis, and artifi\u00ad cial intelligence. Facilities include personal computers; computer terminals and software for statistical studies, parallel distributed processing, and content analysis; and a laboratory for biochemi\u00ad cal assays. Visiting Distinguished Professorships The School of Social Sciences sponsors a program of Visiting Distinguished Professorships that exposes students to seminal thinkers in the social sciences. The professorships normally are of a quarter's duration. Participants have included Martin Bronfen\u00ad brenner, Kenan Professor of Econonomics at Duke University and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (University of Michigan), President of the Ameri\u00ad can Political Science Association, and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology and Edu\u00ad cation Emeritus, Graduate School of Education (Harvard Uni\u00ad versity), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whiting, Professor of Social Anthropology (Har\u00ad vard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and James Coleman, University Professor of Soci\u00ad ology (University of Chicago) and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

To be considered for honors, a student must have a minimu!ll of 72 units in residence at a University of Cali\u00ad fornia campus and must submit an application for the B.A. degree by the end of winter quarter of the senior year. Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's \u00b7 degree programs and with good records at other accredited col\u00ad leges and universities normally will be presumed to have satisfied School requirement B and the University requirements, with the exception of the upper-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category 1). Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, however, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirements of the program (School requirement A). Every effort will be made.to accommodate individual variation in background, provided stu\u00ad dents are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four\u00ad year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in manage\u00ad ment may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for additional information. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an over\u00ad seas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world.

UC IRVINE - 1990-1991218 Social Sciences Minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies Faculty Dennis Aigner, Graduate School of Management Peter Bowler, School of Biological Sciences Francesca Cancian, School of Social Sciences Gordon Chang, School of Humanities Joseph DiMento, Program in Social Ecology John Graham, Graduate School of Management Lawrence Howard, School of Social Sciences Karl Hufbauer, School of Humanities Jon Jacobson, School of Humanities Gregory Kavka, School of Humanities Jon Lawrence, School of Physical Sciences Sung-Chull Lee, School of Social Sciences Franklin Long, School of Social Sciences and Program in Social Ecology Herbert Lehnert, School of Humanities Guy de Mallac, s\u00b7chool of Humanities Julius Margolis, School of Social Sciences Calvin McLaughlin, School of Biological Sciences Seymour Menton, School of Humanities Keith Nelson, School of Humanities Riley Newman, School of Physical Sciences Margot Norris, School of Humanities Frederick Reines, School of Physical Sciences Shawn Rosenberg, School of Social Sciences Sherwood Rowland, School of Physical Sciences Roland Schinzinger, School of Engineering Caesar Sereseres, School of Social Sciences Robert Scheer, School of Social Sciences and Program in Social Ecology Etel Solingen, School of Social Sciences Rein Taagepera, School of Social Sciences John Whiteley, Program in Social Ecology The minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is an interdisci\u00ad plinary curriculum designed to introduce the student to the phe\u00ad nomenon of international violence in the twentieth century, with particular attention to the danger of nuclear war and the chal\u00ad lenge of creating a satisfactory and enduring peace. The minor is available through the School of Humanities, the Program in Social Ecology, and the School of Social Sciences. The minor and its courses, however, are open to all UCI Students. Participants in the minor must complete the equivalent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating later with the Peace and Conflict Forum and its related seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the minor from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organ\u00ad ize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. Requirements for the Minor: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Conflict), Political Science 26D (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons). Five relevant upper-division courses. Among those usually offered are: History 146B (American Foreign Relations Since World War II), Political Science 123G (U.S. Foreign Policy), Political Science 123D (U.S. National Security), Economics 113D-E (Political Economy of National Defense), Political Sci\u00ad ence 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy), History 195 (Arms Control Simulation), Social Ecology S178, S179, S180 (Social Ecology of Peace), Soci\u00ad ology 161Z (Sociology of Peace and War), Psychology 159D (Psychology of the Nuclear Arms Race). With approval of the Global Peace and Conflict Studies faculty, relevant lower-division courses may be substituted for up to two of the five upper-division courses. A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Political Science 123S or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Conflict Forum-total of two units maximum for credit. One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Political Science 123T or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar-totaling two units, taken during winter quarter of the senior year. Further information concerning the minor is available in the Global Peace and Conflict Studies office, 734 Social Science Tower; telephone (714) 856-6410. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies en\u00ad courages the student to examine religion and religious phe\u00ad nomena in the context of several disciplines. Information is avail\u00ad able on page 173. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with the Undergraduate Advising Office (122 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate pro\u00ad gram of study. Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental con\u00ad cepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth require\u00ad ment, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Stu\u00ad dents who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas impor\u00ad tant to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an indi\u00ad vidualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (1) Normally, neither major program may be the general social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer science courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of UC IRVINE - 1990-1991both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathemat\u00ad ics sequences, Information and Computer Science-!, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching credentials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of matheniatics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for grad\u00ad uate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with addi\u00ad tional courses related to mathematics and social science method\u00ad ology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills neces\u00ad sary for successful graduate work. Courses in Social Sciences Courses in the School do not invariably resemble conventional university courses either in content or in format. Students at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intellectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive official credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (under\u00ad graduate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introduc\u00ad tory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to stu\u00ad dents without previous work in social science. Most upper\u00ad division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide con\u00ad tinuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range planning by students, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisciplinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. It is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individu\u00ad ally, as long as course prerequisites have been met. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual program of study in a par\u00ad ticular discipline or in an interdisciplinary area. Social Sciences 219 The Catalogue lists descriptions of some of the courses to be offered during the academic year. A final listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 122 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtain~ ing this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1990, should refer to previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering system prior to fall 1990.

The Department offers degree programs in Linguistics and Psychology. Information on graduate programs and courses begins on page 242. Program in Linguistics Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Linguistics University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 219. Departmental Requirements for the Major The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Social Sciences and the School of Humanities. These linguistics programs are administered by the Inter-School Linguistics Com\u00ad mittee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. Both Schools offer a minor in Linguistics. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991There are two ways to major in Linguistics in the School of Social Sciences. They are designated as Tracks I and II. Track I, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to students inter\u00ad ested in areas of cognitive science such as psychology and artifi\u00ad cial intelligence. Track I may be taken through either the School of Social Sciences or the School of Humanities (see page 177). Track II, General Linguistics, is for students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of linguistics. Track II may be taken through either the School of Social Sciences or the School of Humanities. In addition, a third track, Applied Linguistics, is offered solely through the School of Humanities (see page 177). Track/: Theoretical and Formal Linguistics School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 3 B. Social Sciences 14A. C. Six upper-division courses with emphasis 14IH, 14ll, Computer Science 162. Track /l\u00b7 General Linguistics School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 3. B. Two upper-division courses in each of the following modules: I. Social Sciences 141A, 14ll 3. Social Sciences 142 series 4. Social Sciences 143 series 5. Social Sciences 144 series C. One year (three courses) in a single foreign language. Students are strongly urged to study a non-Indo-European language (such as Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, Swahili) whenever available. Residency Requirement for the Linguistics Major: At least six upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 3, 141A, and 141H. B. Four additional upper-division linguistics courses selected from the Social Sciences 141, 142, 143, and/or 144 series. Stu\u00ad dents are encouraged to refer to the program requirements for the tracks of the Linguistics major and to consult with the faculty before making their selection. Residency Requirement: At least four upper-division courses required for the' minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Program in Psychology Students should be aware that psychology ~ourses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in developmental, clinical, environmental, health, or social psy\u00ad chology, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings in the Program in Social Ecology section. Students interested in human experimental psychology as applied to the study of sensation, perception, learning, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cognitive Sciences 223 Cognitive Sciences in the School of Social Sciences section. Stu\u00ad dents interested in the biological mechanisms of behavior are advised to consult the course listings in the School of Biological Sciences section. It is anticipated that the number of students who are qualified to elect Psychology as a major will exceed the number of positions available. Students applying for.admission for fall 1991 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1990. In the event that more applications for the Psychology major are received than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admis\u00ad sions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Psy\u00ad chology at the time of admission may opt for the undeclared major within the School of Social Sciences or for any other open major for which they qualify. However, lower-division courses prerequisite to upper-division major study are available to all students, and selection of the Psychology major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Psychology major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major as a junior. Such students should apply for admission during the first five weeks of the spring quarter of their sophomore year in the Undergraduate Counseling Office, 122 Social Science Tower. To be considered for admission into the Psychology major as a junior, students must have completed the following: (a) at least two quarters of the mathematic requirement, Social Sciences 11A-B, or IOOA-B, or Mathematics 2A-B, with a minimum average grade of B-(2.7); (b) Psychology 7 (Introduction to Psychology) and at least eight additional credits in psychology courses with a minimum average grade of B (3.0) across all psychology courses; and (c) the lower\u00ad division writing requirement. Selection criteria also will include affirmative action considerations. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Psychology Students who entered UCI prior to fall 1990 should refer to the Catalogue edition in effect the year they entered to determine which major requirements they must satisfy.

Department of Economics Economics is concerned with the way individuals or societies allocate scarce resources and distribute goods and services. Any situation requiring choice among competing alternatives can be viewed as an economic problem. Economics courses enable stu\u00ad dents to study the way individuals make these choic~s (microeco-, nomics), the way governments make these choices (public choice), and the aggregate consequences of these choices (macroeconom- . ics). In addition, the economics curriculum addresses interna\u00ad tional trade, money and banking, and economic development of the lesser developed nations. The Department of Economics is composed of faculty with inter\u00ad ests in a broad range of areas within micro-and macroeconom\u00ad ics, and the evaluation of public policy. It is especially strong in applied econometrics, public choice, and applied microeconomics including transportation, energy, industrial organization, labor, and urban development. Members of the Department maintain close ties with members of the Department of Politics and Society and the Graduate School of Management. It is anticipated that the number of students who are qualified to elect Economics as a major will exceed the number of positions available. Students applying for admission for fall 1991 should be \u00b7sure to file their application before November 30, 1990. In the event the major in Economics receives more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admis- , sions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Eco\u00ad nomics at the time of admission will be encouraged to opt for the Undeclared major within the School of Social Sciences or for any \u00b7 other open major for which they qualify. However, lower-division courses prerequisite to upper-division major study are available to all students, and selection to the Economics major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Economics major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major as a junior. Such students should apply for admission during t,he first five weeks of the spring quarter of their sophomore year in the Undergraduate Counseling Office, 122 Social Science Tower. The following three criteria must be met to be considered for admission as a junior: the student must have (a) completed two quarters of calculus (Mathematics 2A and.2B) with a minimum grade of B, (b) com\u00ad pleted the basic economic theory sequence (Economics l2A-B-C) with a minimum grade of a B in at least two of the three quarters, and (c) must have completed the lower-division writing require\u00ad ment. Selection criteria also will include affirmative action considerations.

In addition, an interdisciplinary concentration in Public Choice is offered within the programs in Economics and Political Science, and a special\u00ad ized concentration in Transportation Economics is offered within the program in Economics. When an applicant's interests lie out\u00ad side of or across these areas, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare occasions, appoint a three-member faculty committee to guide an indepen\u00ad dent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. Although the School does not admit students for a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture, Econom\u00ad ics, or Social Science may be conferred upon students in progress toward the Ph.D. degree. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Social Sciences 243 Assistant Professor Mark P. Petracca presents a comprehensive survey of the American presidency and raises questions about political power in his course Political Science 12JG. Admission Potential graduate students should apply by February I to receive fullest consideration for admission and for financial aid. Appli\u00ad cants should indicate the title of the degree sought (Ph.D. in Comparative Culture, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area of concentration (one of the eight listed above). All applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination General Test scores. Letters of recommendation and the applicant's statement of interest are important factors in the admission decision. In addition to the University admission requirements described in the Research and Graduate Studies section, individual graduate programs may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Such requirements are minimum standards only; successful applicants typically must exceed them by a substantial margin. Financial Support Many students receive financial support in the form of fellow\u00ad ships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Before accepting an offer of admission with financial support for the first year, applicants should inquire about the likelihood of such support in future years. Occasionally, a newly admitted student may receive a mul\u00ad tiyear commitment of some specified financial support, but this is not the rule. Students are also advised to seek aid from sources external to the University. (Note: Teaching assistantships do not include remission of fees or nonresident tuition.) Length of Study and Residence Students who enter with normal academic preparation should be able to earn the Ph.D. within four to five years, or in the case of Comparative Culture, six years. Because the intellectual training offered by the School requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students.

White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The graduate program in Comparative Culture is administered by the Program in Comparative Culture. It emphasizes the inter\u00ad disciplinary study of ethnocultural groups in the United States\u00ad dominant American, African-American, Asian-American, Chi\u00ad cano, Latino, and Native American-including their interrela\u00ad tionships and .antecedents. The program is designed to train research scholars in American and ethnic studies. It allows stu\u00ad dents to focus on one of two major approaches to cultural analy\u00ad sis. Students may choose to emphasize such expressive forms of culture as literature, religion, myth, and the arts in relation to his\u00ad tory and society. Or they may choose to concentrate on social inquiry, including social theory and the perspectives provided by such social sciences as anthropology, economics, psychology, social history, and sociology. Thus, graduate students are pre\u00ad pared for academic positions in interdisciplinary programs as well as in departmel)ts of English, history, and various social sciences. Admission The program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate stu\u00ad dents in the fall. Requirements and standards for admission are in keeping with those of the University of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and current academic interests. In addition to the general application material, the pro\u00ad gram requires test results from the verbal and quantitative sec\u00ad tions of the Graduate Record Examination. Minorities and women are particularly encouraged to apply. Applicants for fellowship or assistantship awards should apply by February I to receive fullest consideration. Application for assist\u00ad ance based upon financial need (grants, loans, or work-study awards) is made through the UCI Financial Aid Office. Late applications will be considered for the fall quarter only if space is available-otherwise they will be deferred until a later quarter. Residence The University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a minimum of six quarters. ' Required and Elective Courses The program requires 18 courses (72 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the program's graduate advisor so as to prepare the student for the first-year screening examination, the Ph.D. qualifying examination, and the devel\u00ad opment of a dissertation topic. The following courses are required of students during their first and second years of graduate study: Social Sciences 270A (Proseminar in Expressive Forms), 273A (Proseminar in Social Inquiry), 275A-B-C (Methods of Social Inquiry), 276A-B-C (Seminar in Expressive Forms of Culture), 271A-B-C (Colloquium on Dominant American Culture), 274A\u00ad B (Colloquium on Afro-American Culture), 274C-D (Colloquium on Asian-American Cultures), and 274G-H (Colloquium on Native American Cultures). Additionally, students take two four\u00ad unit elective courses upon advisement during their first and second years of graduate study. During the third year, students normally take elective courses and/or directed reading courses upon advisement in preparation for the Ph.D. qualifying examinations. All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Asso\u00ad ciates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of aca\u00ad demic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must peti\u00ad tion the Graduate Committee and gain the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except under extenuating circumstances. Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses. These courses normally are to be used in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives must be made to the Graduate Advisor. Approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies also is required. Language Requirements Two foreign languages or one foreign language and statistics are required. The language will be determined by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the Graduate Advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard Educational Testing Service examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Advisor. The statistics requirement can be satisfied by taking three quarters of course work in social science statistics chosen in consultation with the Graduate Advisor. The language and/or the statistics requirements must be satisfied before the Ph.D. qualifying examination can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Two weeks after final examinations in the spring_ quarter, first\u00ad year students are administered a comprehensive examination based upon materials from their course work. The examination is administered by the program's graduate advisor. Normally the examination consists of four sections, corresponding to the required courses offered that year. Students are notified of the results within 10 working days of the examination. A student must pass all sections of the comprehensive examina\u00ad tion in order to continue graduate study. A student who fails the examination has the option of retaking those failed sections once prior to the beginning of the fall quarter. The results of the second examination will be final. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination The Ph.D. qualifying examination must be taken by the end of the third year, after the completion of 84 units of course work, the language examination, and/or the language and statistics requirement. Doctoral students are administered two examinations, one writ\u00ad ten and one oral, which are based upon the written examination. The student's Ph.D. advisory committee is comprised of four members of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate or of per\u00ad sons with equivalent qualifications, and is formed by the Gradu\u00ad ate Advisor in consultation with the student and Comparative Culture faculty. The chair of the advisory committee and at least two other members of the examining committee must be Com\u00ad parative Culture faculty. The committee administers the sub\u00ad sequent oral examination and guides the student's dissertation project. The committee is responsible for formulating the exami\u00ad nation questions, though the entire Comparative Culture faculty may submit questions for the examination. The written examination is based upon program courses and elec\u00ad tives taken by the student in satisfaction of graduate course work. The written examination consists of four parts: nondominant cul\u00ad tures and classes, dominant American culture, cultural theory and method, and an area of specialization, perhaps including but not limited to the student's dissertation project. The fourth area is formulated by the student in close consultation with the exa\u00ad mining committee. The written examination is administered over two days, each section requiring three hours of writing. Students who fail the written examination may petition to take the failed portions a second time. Two failures culminate in expulsion from the program. Upon successful completion of the written examination, the stu\u00ad dent may advance to the oral examination, which is given no more than two weeks later. The oral examination is conducted by a candidacy committee appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of the four members of the written examination committee, plus a fifth member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. This committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the examination is successful. The Dissertation The student must present a written statement of a dissertation project to the dissertation committee, which must approve the proposal. This statement must be presented within a year of suc\u00ad cessful completion of the qualifying examinations. The disserta\u00ad tion itself normally should be successfully completed within three years after the qualifying examinations. The dissertation committee is appointed by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council upon the recom\u00ad mendation of the program graduate advisor after consultation with the student. Master of Acts in Comparative Culture Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehensive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved elec\u00ad tives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demon\u00ad strating proficiency in a language or an alternate skill. Additional Information Normal Progress. Normal progress is defined as earning B grades or better in all required courses, maintaining a B average in all co,.rse work, satisfactory r<:rformance on a first-year screening Social Sciences 245 examination, satisfactory performance on the Ph.D. qualifying examination taken by the end of the third year, and satisfactory completion of the doctoral dissertation by the end of the sixth year. A grade of incomplete in any course must be replaced by a satisfactory grade within three quarters of its incurrence. Grades of incomplete will not be given for three-quarter or two-quarter course sequences except under extenuating circumstances. In Progress grades can be awarded for the first term of a two\u00ad quarter course and for the first and second terms of a three~ quarter course. To be eligible for a teaching assistantship a student can have no more than one incomplete within the last three quarters and must carry a minimum of twelve units per quarter with satisfactory grades for the last three quarters. All incompletes must be resolved before the Ph.D. qualifying examination can be taken. Leaves of Absence. A Student must formally petition the Gradu\u00ad ate Advisor for a leave of absence from graduate study. Such leaves normally will be granted for medical or financial reasons. Students are entitled to no more than three quarters of leave dur\u00ad ing their tenure in the graduate program.

Drawing upon the School's strong quantitative tradition, it specializes in econometric techniques applied to government behavior, labor economics, transportation economics, and urban economics. Admission is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of overlap between faculty and student research interests, the program offers exten\u00ad sive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Motivated and well-qualified students find the UCI graduate program in eco\u00ad nomics highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-discipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. Requirements All students must show competence in microeconomic theory, macroeconomics, and econometrics. Normally this is done by taking a three-course sequence in each of these areas. Students also must master two fields of applied economics by taking a two-course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and. writing a research paper in each. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Economics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discussion of the papers presented and addi\u00ad tional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of currerit economic research early on in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. Knowledge of one foreign language is required; a computer language may be substituted at the discretion of the faculty. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon completion of an oral examination on a written dissertation proposal. Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also be awarded a Ph.D. in Economics with a con\u00ad centration in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the unusual collection of transportation researchers on the cam\u00ad pus, both within the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Transportation Studies, a systemwide research unit headquartered at UCI. It facilitates student research by pro\u00ad viding research assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those de\u00ad scribed above with the following three exceptions: ( 1) instead of the third quarter of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, students may substitute specified courses such as Discrete Choice Econometrics (Social Sciences 213G), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineering CE220A), or Operations Research for Management (Management 201B); (2) one of the student's two required fields of competence must be transportation economics; the other must be a cognate field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organization, or a transportation-related field from outside economics such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transportation policy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economics; and (3) students must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. Concentration in Public Choice Students can also earn a Ph.D. degree in Economics with a con\u00ad centration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of Economics and Political Science, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Econom\u00ad ics, Politics and Society, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management are involved in research\u00b7 that supports the concentration through the Focused Research Program in Public Choice. Students who elect thi~ concentration are admitted under the normal procedures for the program in Economics and must fulfill all the requirements for the Economics degree with the following modifications: ( 1) one of the student's two required fields of competence must be public choice; included is a three-quarter core course in public choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Department of Economics and the Department of Politics and Society. (A background in\u00b7 economic theory equivalent to Economics HlllA-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a prerequisite. to this sequence.) The requirement for compe\u00ad tence in a second field may be met with a one-quarter .course, instead of two, if it provides sufficient fluency in the field; and (2) students must obtain a background knowledge in political sci\u00ad ence equivalent to that provided by a one-year undergraduate survey course, if they do not already have it. Research Facilities UCI is a major research university and has an excellent library with a collection of more than 1,300,00 volumes, as well as spe\u00ad cial interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of Cali\u00ad fornia libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a com\u00ad puter laboratory and a small economics library. The Economics Department has a small library with current journals and unpub~ lished working papers from other universities. Students also have access to several campus computers including a Convex C240 mini-super computer. Three Organized Research Units-the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Public Policy Research Organization, and the Focused Research Program in Public . Choice, and the Irvine Research Unit in Mathematical Behavtoral Sciences-provide research opportunities for graduate students. Admission The deadline for application for admission is February I for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are con\u00ad sidered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record 'Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadline. Foreign applicants must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. \u00b7 Doctor of Philosophy in Political Science Participating Faculty Michel Crozier: Organizational Sociology, Pub~ic AGmini.stration Russell Dalton: West European Politics, Mass Politicai.Behavior James Danziger: Urban Political Systems, Public Policy Analysis, and Technology and Politics David Easton : Political Systems, Political Structures Harry Eckstein: Macropolitics and Authority Relations.

It emphasizes empirical democratic theory, with an emphasis on the United States and other industrialized and industrializing nations, within a compar\u00ad ative context. Faculty interests include political behavior, political psychology, public choice theory, international relations, systems theory, mass media, and authority relations. Institutions of inter\u00ad est include the chief executive branch, bureaucratic politics, polit\u00ad ical parties, and representation and electoral systems. The strengths of the Political Science graduate program include its small size, its personalized attention to students, and its location within an interdisciplinary school. Special emphasis is placed on recruiting students whose interests overlap with those of faculty. Students with an interest in comparative political behavior are encouraged to spend a portion of their third year of graduate study at a research site in another country as part of various ongoing multinational research projects. Two Organized Research Units, the lnstitute'of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization, and one Irvine Research Unit, the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, offer opportunities for participation in ongoing faculty research. One group of Political Science faculty share interests in applied Public Choice with faculty members in both economics and philosophy; another group is involved with the program in Global Peace and Conflict Studies; and others are involved with the study of East Asia. Another subset of faculty, together with distinguished visitors from leading European universities, is involved with the study of parties and elections in industrialized nations; while another group of faculty studies the impacts of the media and of information technology on politics. \u00b7 Admissions Students are normally admitted for fall quarter; admission for winter or spring quarters is available only under exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances Additional information is available in the general section on admission to Social Science graduate programs. Requirements First-year students must take a core program of graduate semi\u00ad nars, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research Social Sciences 247 methods. Students are required to complete one year of statistics, either before enrollment or during their first year. Competence in a foreign language is required and assessed by an examination administered under the auspices of the chair of the student's Ph.D. committee. Attendance in a colloquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year, a review of performance in the graduate program will be conducted for each student by the Politics and Society faculty. A set of three papers, normally completed by the third year of study, tests the student's competence in a set of major domains for intellectual inquiry. These domains are determined by the stu\u00ad dent and the Political Science Graduate Director. Upon success\u00ad ful completion of these papers and demonstration of competence in mathematics and foreign language, a candidacy committee is appointed to oversee the qualifying examination and the formal advancement to candidacy. Students are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of gradute study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral committee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, supervises work toward completion of the dissertation. Concentration in Public Choice Students can also earn a Ph.D. degree in Political Science with a concentration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of political science and economics, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the function\u00ad ing of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Politics and Society, Economics, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management are involved in research that supports the concentration through the Focused Research Pro\u00ad gram in Public Choice. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the normal procedures for the program in Political Science and must fulfill all the requirements for the Political Science degree with the following modifications: (1) students must complete the core sequence in Public Choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Department of Politics and Society and the Department of Economics as part of the six required social science courses that may be outside of the political science area. (A background in economic theory equivalent to Economics H III A-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a prerequisite to this sequence); (2) students must complete three courses designated by the interdisciplinary committee such as American Political Insti\u00ad tutions, Comparative Political Parties and Electoral Systems, and Theory of Political Coalitions; (3) students are encouraged to take graduate-level econometrics; and (4) students are expected to write their dissertation on a topic related to Public Choice.

Watt: Cognitive Semiotics \u00b7 John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Psychology and Visual Perception The graduate program in Psychology is administered by the Department of Cognitive Sciences, which has faculty interested in human cognition, perception, cognitive psychology, theoretical linguistics, and psycholinguistics. The faculty lay special stress on precise scientific approaches to issues in human cognition, and view formal models as instrumental in understanding the nature of the human mind. Research interests include: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, artificial intelligence, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, semio\u00ad tics, and theoretical linguistics. The graduate program does not emphasize traditional training in psychology; rather, it stresses the integration of research in the areas mentioned above, and in related areas, into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. The Department also administers a graduate concentration in Linguistics, as explained elsewhere. Admission In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are considered highly desirable: com\u00ad puter science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be con\u00ad sidered on its own merits. Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language (Social Sciences 241A, 24IB, 24IC). The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics (Social Sciences 242A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the Department's Director of Graduate Studies. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Know!-edge of one foreign language appropriate to the student's research concerns is required. Students are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Social Sciences 240A\u00ad B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to advancement to candidacy. Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first tWo years. By the end of the second year, each student should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that is potentially publishable in a relevant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cog\u00ad nitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficiencies of each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and, at the faculty's option, a written examina\u00ad tion as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the program. The examination will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Doctor of Philosophy in Social Science The graduate program in Social Science comprises four concen\u00ad trations: Linguistics, Mathematical Behavioral Science, Social Networks, and Social Relations. Each is administered by by a dif\u00ad ferent group of faculty. Concentration in Linguistics Participating Faculty Hagit Borer: Theoretical Syntax, Cognitive Theories, and Language Acquisition C. T. James Huang: Syntactic Theory, East Asian Linguistics Mary-Louise Kean: Biological Foundations of Language Virginia A. Mann: Speech Perception and Psycholinguistics Robert May: Theoretical Linguistics, Syntax, Semantics of Natural Language Louis Narens: Formal and Computational Models of Language Semiotics The doctoral concentration in Linguistics, administered by the Department of Cognitive Sciences, is focused on theoretical linguistics and its role in the cognitive sciences. The research UC IRVINE - 1990-1991emphasis is directed towards the core areas of theoretical work in syntax, semantics, phonology, and psycholinguistics with a con-. centration on the formal analysis of natural language. Additional emphasis is on the study of a broad range of languages and lan\u00ad guage families, including East Asian, Romance, and Semitic. Stu\u00ad dents are further exp~cted to gain expertise in other areas of the cognitive sciences, especially as this pertains to the study of language. Admission While at least some undergraduate training in theoretical linguis\u00ad tics is desirable, applications are also welcomed from students with interest in linguistics, but with background in other areas, e.g., philosophy, psychology, language studies, computer science. Decisions on admissions are based on students' undergraduate performance, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and any written research materials submitted by the candidate. Applicants must submit Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores; applicants from non-English speaking nations must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. Requirements Students will be assigned an advisor until advanced to candidacy, at which time a committee will be formed consisting of three pro\u00ad fessors, one of whom will be designated as Chair. This committee and the student will work out a plan of course work and research, commensurate with fulfilling all necessary requirements, for the student's graduate career. Students are required to demonstrate mastery of a foreign lan\u00ad guage on the basis of a written examination. The quantitative methods requirement will be fulfilled by the course, Computa\u00ad tional Models of Language and Cognition (one of the supplemen\u00ad tary courses). Course requirements consist of seven core courses and eight sup\u00ad plementary courses, covering class work and research seminars in phonology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics, cognitive sci\u00ad ences, and related areas. A critical literature survey of an area outside of, but related to, linguistics is. to be written under the guidance of an appropriate faculty member. Two papers of pub\u00ad lishable quality are also required in two of the following areas: phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and psycholinguistics. Evaluation of these papers will be included in the qualifying examination. 1 Students are expected to attend Linguistics and Cognitive Science colloquia and must give a colloquium presenting original research during their third year.

Yellott: Mathematical Psychology and Vision Perception The concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Science offers a program of interdisciplinary and mathematical approaches to the study of human behavior, providing high levels of training in cur\u00ad rent mathematical modeling and mathematical skills. The pro\u00ad gram is adminis~ered by an interdisciplinary group of faculty. Admission Admission to the program requires evidence of appreciable mathematical skill and knowledge. As an absolute minimum, a candidate should have taken one full year of calculus, including calculus of several variables, and one course in linear algebra. In addition, candidates must provide evidence of additional mathematical depth. of knowledge, which can be manifested in a number of different ways including, but not restricted to, an undergraduate degree in mathematics or physical science, a high score in the GRE Mathematics Subject Test, or a strong under\u00ad graduate minor in mathematics. In addition, students should have some exposure to a behavioral science field; especially useful is some experience with behavioral science modeling. Requirements Four major classes of requirements must be fulfilled. Since a number of options are available, the student will, in consultation with an advisor, submit a plan of study to the Graduate Commit\u00ad tee of the program. Language and Quantitative/Mathematical. Students must attain proficiency in reading social science publications in one foreign language. (A higher level of proficiency may be required if war\u00ad ranted by the nature of the student's research plans.) The quantitative methods requirement consists of completing, by the end of the third year, the following courses: (I) one each in analysis beyond calculus, abstract algebra beyond linear algebra, and logic; and (2) two quarters of mathematical statistics, with calculus as a prerequisite and covering the fundamentals of prob-\u00b7 ability and random variables. \u00b7 Substantive Minor. Students are expected to develop considerable expertise in some substantive field of social science and in the application of models to it. This requires the completion of three courses at the upper-division or graduate level that do not neces\u00ad sarily entail extensive modeling, and three courses or seminars in which the primary thrust is mathematical modeling. Computer. Students must be sufficiently familiar with various programs and languages to be able to conduct serious research in their field of interest and must submit either proposed courses or some demonstration of competency as part of their plan of study. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991250 Social Sciences Research Papers and Colloquia. A research paper reporting origi\u00ad nal research or a penetrating analysis of some subtopic of mathematical behavioral science is expected at the end of the seond year. An oral presentation will be given to faculty and graduate students. Students also are expected to regularly attend the Colloquium in Mathematical Behavioral Science. Master of Arts Degree The M.A. degree is awarded only to Ph.D. students who com\u00ad plete nec_essary requirements; students are not admitted for grad\u00ad uate study leading only to the Master's degree. Requirements include the submission of a petition to the Graduate Committee along with a proposed plan of study consisting of 36 units of relevant Mathematical Behavioral Sciences courses, normally including the core requirement in mathematical statistics.

White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Con\u00ad straints, Decision-Making Networks, and Social Processes The Departments of Anthropology and Sociology jointly offer a concentration in Social Networks that focuses on the patterns or forms of relations that link persons or other social actors together in coherent wholes. Thus, Social Networks stresses the structural interests of several disciplines including sociology, anthropology, and cognitive science. It is concerned with problems of represent\u00ad ing such structures, both statically and dynamically, and with exploring the implications of structural form for individual and collective behavior. In addition, the networks perspective has important applications in the study of international relations, organizational behavior, health and mental health, and human communications research. Admission The graduate concentration in Social Networks seeks qualified graduate. students who are well-trained in either (a) a structural approach in some traditional social science discipline or (b) mathematics. Students also should be willing to learn either a set of social science orientations and models or the appropriate mathematical skills to do research in social networks, depending upon their prior training. Requirements Students are encouraged to develop their own research foci and specializations within the general social networks perspective. All students are expected to become acquainted with the general perspective and to develop a minimum set of formal and method\u00ad ological skills. A set of core courses has been developed that is aimed at acquainting incoming students with theoretical, mathematical, and methodological tools for the study of social networks. Selec\u00ad tion of other courses will be by agreement between student and advisor. In addition to relevant courses offered throughout the School, courses specifically tailored for students In Social Net\u00ad works are offered by faculty on a regular basis. Students must demonstrate proficiency in reading social science publications in one foreign language or demonstrate a higher level of proficiency if required by the nature of the student's research plans. Reviews and Examinations Students. enrolled in the concentration are expected to meet the requirements of UCI and the School as well as those of the con\u00ad centration. In addition, each student is reviewed three times to ascertain progress. The first review is of the student's first-year performance. The review results in a faculty-student conference in which a recom\u00ad mendation is made for continuation or withdrawal. The second review is the oral examination for the student's quali\u00ad fication for advancement to candidacy. It is designed to assess the likelihood of the student successfully completing the Ph.D. disser\u00ad tation and is based on the student's dissertation research proposal as well as on the progress in course work. Students are expected to complete this examination on or before the end of their third year of residence. The third review is a dissertation defense. The defense will be in the form of a public colloquium presentation. The faculty may recommend revisions, after which the dissertation may be submit\u00ad ted for the doctoral degree in Social Science.

Waitzkin: Comparative Health Care Systems, Primary Care and Community Medicine, Doctor-Patient Communication The graduate concentration in Social Relations is administered jointly by the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology. It centers on interdisciplinary research in social science, particularly where the traditional concerns of sociology and anthropology converge. Because of a low student-to-faculty ratio, each student works closely with a faculty committee to develop an individual\u00ad ized course of study. Students may work on a broad range of top\u00ad ics, including cognitive anthropology, the sociology of culture, culture and health practices, family and gender, Third World development and social change, and social structure and networks. Admission The faculty welcomes students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corres\u00ad ponding to those of specific faculty members are especially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type program. Requirements Each new student is assigned an advisor who serves until a three\u00ad person committee is formed. The committee oversees the stu\u00ad dent's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets one quarter in the first year and two quarters in the second year is required. Additionally, three basic courses in particular substantive areas of anthropology and soci~ ology are offered each year as core courses. In each of their first two years, students must take two of these three focused semi\u00ad nars. Two quarters of statistics are required; one quarter must be taken in the first year. In addition, two quarters of research design or data collection methods are required; one quarter must be taken in the first year. Students also take additional seminars pertinent to their own research interests. Course work usually takes two years, during which time students choose an area of concentration. By the end of the third year, students are expected to have selected a faculty committee and to have made plans for their doctoral dissertation research. All stu\u00ad dents are expected to continue to participate in both the Social Relations Colloquium Series and in less formal aspects of intellec\u00ad tual life in the program. During the second year each student will prepare an original paper, which will be presented by the student at a meeting during the spring quarter. The group will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the second-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The advancement-to-candidacy examination should ordinarily be taken no later than the spring quarter of the student's third year. A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required.

States, together with graphs on indi\u00ad viduals, are used to define stochastic processes. These processes are used to model such phenomena as ferromagnetism in physics and clique for\u00ad mation in social science. 284A-8 Research Design I, II (4-4). Focuses on data collection, organiza\u00ad tion, and analysis in natural (ethnographic or quasi-experimental) set\u00ad tings.

I think of myself as someone who creates situa.tiorts in which students can learn. When I think of the people I learned the most from (and some of them are here at UCI), I realize it is not what they told me that changed me. Rather, it was the way they persuaded me to look at things differently-to ask and answer the important questions myself. They set an example for me, and in doing so they nurtured in me the underlying values of curiosity and dis\u00ad cipline on which the academy is built. Some students are surprised when I say I'm not here to teach them. They think that they came to UCI to find out \"how it really is\" and that the faculty are here to tell them. They're in for a\u00b7 surprise. If we knew how it really is, we'd all be filthy rich, idling our time away and soaking up rays on some tropical isle. We're here because we don't know how it really is, but we want to find out. Most students realize in time that they l;iidn't come to UCI to learn what to think, but rather how to think. If I can help them realize this, their education can really begin; and as long as they remember, it never stops. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991258 Information and Computer Science Raymond Klefstad, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Lecturer in Information and Computer Science (programming languages, com\u00ad pilers, software engineering) Frank Murgolo, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Lecturer in Information and Computer Science (data structures and algorithms) Rika Yoshii, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine, Lecturer in Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science (natural language processing, computer\u00ad aided instruction) The development of the modern digital computer has made pos\u00ad sible the solution of large-scale information processing problems in science, industry, and government. These problems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keep\u00ad ing track of inventories, and sending mail electronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a proce\u00ad dure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic operations, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of operations within the computer. Infor\u00ad mation and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and with the study of the social setting in which procedures are used. The implications of research in information and computer science extend beyond direct applications of the modern digital com\u00ad puter. Many animate and inanima~e systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and analyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process information. Thus, information and computer science provides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available on the campus include interactive access to the systems in the UCI Computing Facility-a DEC VAX 11/780, 11/785, and 8350 (VMS), and a Sequent Symmetry shared memory multiprocessor (Unix). Instructional computing resources within the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) include four micro\u00ad computer laboratories using Toshiba T-300s, Macintosh II work\u00ad stations, and Macintosh Plusses. An advanced workstation labor\u00ad atory comprising 10 Sun 3/50 workstations also is available. Upper-division students have access to a Sequent Symmetry Unix timesharing machine. Additional departmental resources for research include a second Sequent Symmetry, 10 Integrated Solu\u00ad tions workstations, and over 150 Sun workstations. Degrees Information and Computer Science .......... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the grad\u00ad uating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on cri\u00ad teria such as grade point average (including overall, ICS, mathe\u00ad matics); number of upper-division ICS courses completed beyond the minimum; courses taken outside ICS beyond required breadth; and research activities. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. To be considered for honors, students must file their application for graduation by March 31. Careers for the ICS Major Students with undergraduate degrees in Information and Com\u00ad puter Science have been successful in finding career opportunities in recent years. Entry-level positions have included S,YStems pro\u00ad grammer, systems analyst, marketing and sales support person\u00ad nel, and software engineer. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities and a career library. The Department of Information and Computer Science, in conjunction with the Career Planning and Placement Center, offers workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. A Bachelor's degree in Information and Computer Science can be part of a preparatory program for graduate work in computer science or a related field. Undergraduate Program The major in Information and Computer Science (ICS) provides serious students the opportunity to study the underlying princi\u00ad ples, current practice, and probable future trends of computer science. Just as it is important for students to acquire a broad and basic education in the major segments of modern academic study, it is essential that they obtain an educational foundation that ~ill permit them to continue to learn and keep up with the expanding field of computer science. It is this focus on founda\u00ad tions for lifelong learning that is the hallmark of the ICS under\u00ad graduate program. The ICS curriculum enables students to study basic concepts and practice of data organization, algorithm design, organization of hardware and software systems, system design and construction, theoretical models and analysis, artificial intelligence, and the nature of the personal, social, and organizational impact of com\u00ad puters. In the process of mastering the ICS curriculum, students learn several current programming languages, operating systems, support tools such as graphics packages, and hardware systems. Students also learn to use various current systems aimed at improving personal productivity. These objectives provide a basis for professional work and grad\u00ad uate study in computer science and sophisticated applications of computers. While many ICS graduates are successfully pursuing careers in a variety of fields, including many kinds of applica\u00ad tions, the curriculum focuses on the underlying principles of computer science rather than on specific applications. Students whose interests are primarily applications-oriented are encour\u00ad aged to pursue in-depth study in another field, combined with a selection of basic courses in ICS. Note: The award of a B.S. degree in ICS requires that students complete the course requirements for the degree and that they be enrolled in the ICS major. Students who would like to change their major to ICS should contact the ICS Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office to discuss their plans. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer programming and the field of computer science will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Computer Science I (ICS 21) and continue in the programming sequence with Introduction to Computer Science II and III (ICS 22 and 23) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis, statistics, probability, or other applied mathematics areas. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and digital systems should also consult the list of courses offered by the School of Engineering. Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The ICS Undergraduate Counseling Office is staffed by profes\u00ad sional academic counselors and peer advisors. These individuals are available to assist students with program planning, questions on University and departmental policies and procedures, progress toward graduation, and other questions that arise in the course of a student's education. Faculty also are available for advising, generally for suggestions of additionaicourse work in the stu\u00ad dent's area of specialization and on preparation for graduate school. Transfer Student Policy Students who transfer to UCI .in fall 1990 or thereafter will be held to the following requirements: \u00b7 1. One year of college mathematics. Courses equivalent to Mathematics 6A-B-C are preferred as this facilitates schedul\u00ad ing after transfer to UCI. If not available, students should \u00b7 take first-year calculus. A semester of precalculus and a semester' of calculus may not be.used to satisfy this requi~ement.. \u00b7 2. CompletiQn of one year of computer science courses. The year of computer science course work must contain one program\u00ad ming course involving concepts such as those found in Pascal, Ada, or another modern, high-level language. For students who entered college in fall 1987 or thereafter, programming- \u00b7 only courses in BASIC, FORTRAN, and COBOL are not suf\u00ad ficient. Additional classes beyond the programming course must be taken to satisfy the year of computer science. It is strongly recommended that these courses be selected from classes that do not focus strictly on learning a programming language, such as courses in data structures or computer architecture, if such courses are available. 3. Satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition). Note: For,students who entered college in fall 1987 or thereafter, the lower-division requirement in ICS consists of five courses which must be taken in sequence and completed before going on to upper-division course work. Students who transfer to UCI as juniors and must complete all or part of this sequence will there\u00ad fore find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees. Alternately, lower-division eligible transfer students can come to the campus without declaring a major, take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of-major requirements, and then apply for a change of major. On the basis of our experience over the past' several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and advanced\u00ad standing students who elect ICS as a major will exceed the number of positions available. In this case, incoming applicants who elect ICS cannot all be admitted to the major. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall quarter, students should be sure to file their application by November 30 of the prior year. The selection criteria include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. Information and Computer Science Major Requirements Lower-division (these must be completed prior to taking required\u00b7 upper-division ICS courses): Mathematics 6A-B-C and 2A-B-C; ICS 21, 22, 23, 51, 52.

Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the Department in the spring. Applications are available each year beginning May 15 and must be submitted by June 15 to ensure consideration. For an application to be considered; the following conditions must be met (although exceptions may be granted in unusual circumstances): 1\" l. The student must have completed the required lower-division ICS courses and Mathematics 6A-B-C by the end of the spring quarter in which the application is made. 2. The student must have the following grade point averages: a. an overall grade point average of at least 3.2; \u00b7 b. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in the required lower-division ICS courses; c. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in Mathematics 6A-B-C. 3. Application must be made in the spring of the student's sophomore year. Certain exceptions are available, for exam\u00ad ple, for transfer students whose completion of the lower\u00ad division courses is delayed. In selecting students for the honors program, the Department also considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Stu\u00ad dents admitted to the program participate in the ICS Honors Seminar (ICS 197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the Department, followed by a minimum of two quarters of independent supervised work (ICS 198). In order for the stu\u00ad dent to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be certified to be ofhonors quality by the student's advisor and by the program advisor. The 198s may be used to satisfy one of the project courses required for the major. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career;in manage\u00ad ment may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management .section for additional information. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP i.s an over\u00ad seas study program which operates in cooperation with more than 85 host universities and colleges in 33 countries throughout the world. Detailed information is available on page 63. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991260 Information and Computer Science Graduate Program Master of Science Program The Master of Science degree in Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence is awarded only to Ph.D. students who complete necessary requirements. Students are not admitted for graduate study lead\u00ad ing only to the Master's degree. Ph.D. Program The graduate program in Information and Computer Science leads to a Ph.D. degree. The program is research-oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Current research activi\u00ad ties include analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, com\u00ad puter systems design, programming environments, software engi\u00ad neering, computer-aided instruction, and the study of the interre\u00ad lation of computing, organizations, policy, and society. The Department receives substantial extramural funding. The Ph.D. program is designed for full-time study, and can be completed in five to six years, depending upon the focus of research. Admission Applications are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and potential for creative professional contribu\u00ad tions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer science undergraduate train\u00ad ing is not required, but some familiarity with machine organiza\u00ad tion, data structures, software systems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE General Test and the GRE Subject Test in Computer Science. Personal interviews are desira\u00ad ble but not required. Additional information about the graduate program in Information and Computer Science and application forms may be obtained by writing to the Graduate Counselor in the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teach\u00ad ing and research assistantships. There are some research and teaching assistantships available for the summer as well. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. program has three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in computer science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory performance in core courses. Nine graduate courses must be taken as designated by the faculty, with no grade below a B. These courses include four core courses plus one course from each of the five concentrations. Students must complete Phase I by the end of their second year. Phase II. Depth: The purpose of the depth phase is to develop research skills and creative problem solving ability. The student must select an area of specialization and I. demonstrate deep understanding of that area by satisfactory performance in two advanced courses and on a written compre\u00ad hensive examination 2. pass one other advanced course of the student's choice 3. demonstrate research ability by preparing a survey paper and a research paper of publishable or near-publishable quality 4. present a research colloquium 5. receive approval from the faculty to take a Candidacy Oral Examination 6. pass the Candidacy Oral Examination conducted by a formal candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. The area of specialization is normally one of the Department's five concentrations: computer systems design; software; theory of algorithms and data structures; artificial intelligence; computing, organizations, policy, and society (CORPS). However, an area of specialization other than one of the above concentrations may be chosen with the approval of the graduate advisor. All students in the Ph.D. program are eligible to be awarded an M.S. degree upon completion of all course requirements of Phase I and II of the Ph.D. program plus either the Phase II paper requirement or the Phase II written examination. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost exclusively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal quali\u00ad fying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doctoral com\u00ad mittee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. Teaching Requirement: All ICS doctoral students are required to participate in teaching activities before being advanced to candi\u00ad dacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. Programming Competence Requirement: A computer scientist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumericallanguages.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy (moral development, late adolescent to early adult development, social ecology of peace) The Program in Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit spanning the environmental, legal, behavioral, and health sciences. The Program is comprised of nearly 40 full-time faculty, 1,030 undergraduate majors, and 100 graduate students. The dis\u00ad cipline of social ecology applies scientific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among issues of long-standing interest in the Program are crime and justice in society, social influences on human development over the life cycle, and effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. The Program maintains a central interest in human adaptation and a special, but not exclusive, interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Carol K. Whalen, Ph.D. Professor of Social Ecology and of Psychiatry and Human Behavior T he undergraduate years provide opportunities to hone cognitive processing competencies and to acquire methodological skills for framing and solving problems. Especially in the sci- . ences, the contents of courses-the details and facts-are less important than are the processes used in problem solving. The most important goal of undergradu\u00ad ate education is to learn how to analyze, integrate, and evaluate-to acquire portable thinking skills that will transfer across situations and problem.domains and endure the tests of time and technological development. One of the most powerful and engaging ways for students to acquire these.problem-solving competencies is through participating in research. UCI's nonhierarchical tradition of mutual participation in faculty research projects enables participants to make important contributions, whatever their background and experience. In research, the hours often are less regular, the progress less rapid, and the tasks more demanding than planned. But the experiences gained usually are invaluable, providing enduring preparation for both professional and personal problem solving. In the day-to-day hustles and hassles, it is often difficult to look beyond immediate needs in order to focus on long\u00ad term goals and benefits. Adopting a broader perspective at least occasionally, however, enables students to take advantage of the best that a university can offer. UCI stu\u00ad dents are particularly privileged in this respect because; I believe, UCI faculty are especially approachable. As the campus matures, it will be important to protect this \"small town\" quality. Social Ecology 265 UC IRVINE - 1990-1991266 Social Ecology The faculty is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists with a variety of specialties (e.g., developmental, clinical, social, and environmental psychology), sociologists, program evaluators, criminologists, lawyers, urban and regional planners, environ\u00ad mental health scientists, and environmental design specialists. While faculty members are firmly grounded in these parent disci\u00ad plines and teach basic courses in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem-oriented courses, they integrate concepts and per\u00ad spectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commit\u00ad ment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). A number of social ecologists are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and com\u00ad munities function; a number of others are involved in inter\u00ad ventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The Social Ecology Building features several facilities for experi\u00ad mental research, including wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environmental health sciences; behavioral assess\u00ad ment laboratories for research in human development, social rela\u00ad tions, and legal studies; and an environmental simulation labora\u00ad tory for studying the effects of environmental conditions. The wet laboratories are used for studying air and water pollution. The behavioral assessment laboratories are used for studying social phenomena such as parent-child interaction, cooperation among children, hyperactivity, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The environmental simulation laboratory permits full-scale, realistic simulations of interior environments such as offices, classrooms, and apartments. Within these settings, physi\u00ad cal conditions (e.g., ambient lighting and color patterns, music and noise, spatial arrangements and physical density) and social processes (e.g., group communication patterns) can be varied experimentally so that researchers can assess the separate and joint effects of these conditions and processes upon occupants' performance and well-being. Degrees Social Ecology .......................... B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) ................ B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A general criterion is that stu\u00ad dents must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a Uni\u00ad versity of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Direc\u00ad tor for Undergraduate Studies. Honors Program in Social Ecology The Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportunity for selected students majoring in Social Ecology to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal application normally submitted in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the following requirements: completion of all lower\u00ad division Social Ecology courses required for the major; comple\u00ad tion of at least five upper-division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achieve\u00ad ment of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Invitation to the program is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Success\u00ad ful completion of the program requires two quarters of super\u00ad vised, independent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H 190A-B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology Hl90C). Undergraduate Program in Social Ecology The Social Ecology major offers either a general interdisciplinary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through one of three specializations: Environmental Health and Planning; Criminology, Law, and Society; and Psychology and Social Behavior. The specialization designation is noted on the student's transcript upon graduation. A minor in Social Ecology is offered for students who wish to be exposed to an interdisciplinary, scientific orientation toward environmental, social, and criminal justice problems while pursu\u00ad ing another major. The Social Ecology faculty believes that an exposure to the components of the Program's curriculum is valu\u00ad able to the educated individual. Program components include an integrative theoretical framework, an understanding of the research world, and familiarity with the use of scientific informa\u00ad tion in problem solving and policy making. Career Opportunities Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, mental health settings, educational institu\u00ad tions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociol\u00ad ogy, criminology, and urban planning. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. Field Study An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to upper\u00ad division Social Ecology majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social-environmental problems as they occur in community settings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the classroom; and to conduct natural\u00ad istic observations and investigations at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students are encouraged to evaluate procedures and problem-solving strategies used in the work place and to observe the links between com\u00ad munity practices and academic ideas and issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies in both the private and the public sector (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office, UCI Medical Center, California Department of Transpor\u00ad tation, American Red Cross, primary and secondary schools, Fairview Development Center, Irvine Temporary Housing). All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis and require Departmental approval. Further information on field study, including information about sign-up procedures and prerequi\u00ad sites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Environmental Health and Planning The Environmental Health and Planning specialization is con\u00ad cerned with the interactions between the physical environment and human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecology, environmental quality, environmental psychology, urban sociology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem-oriented courses in these areas, enriched by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the effects of environmental stressors (e.g., crowding, smog, noise); environmental pollution; the biology and politics of water pollution; potential impacts of natural disasters; compliance with environmental regulations; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well\u00ad being of its residents; the effects of stress on health; causes and consequences of urbanization and population change; and risk assessment. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional opportunities related to environmen\u00ad tal analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, public health, and urban sociology. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment. Field study is done in city planning departments, private architectural firms, environmental information centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Specialization in Environmental Health and Planning Following the completion of Social Ecology E8 (Introduction to Environmental Analysis), students must complete six courses from the following list: EIOl Environmental and Public Health Policy El07 Urban and Regional Planning SilO Human Stress E 111 Survey Analysis of Urban Residents Ell2A-B Design and Behavior I, II Ell9 Urban and Regional Analysis El20 Topics in Applied Ecology El25 Microbial Ecology of Natural and Polluted Waters El25L Microbial Ecology of Natural and Polluted Waters Laboratory El26 Environmental Designs for International Tourism El27 International Environmental Management El30 Urban Issues, Policy, and Theory El32 Urban Sociology E136 Social Ecology of the Borderlands El39 Urbanization and Social Change E 140 The Chemical Components of Water Quality El43 Elements of Environmental Design El47 Environmental Programming El49 Life in Space El53 Chronological Dating Techniques in Environmental Reconstruction El55 Environmental Chemistry El57 Strategies of Health Promotion El58 Community Health: An Epidemiological Approach El59 Environment and Health Sl59 The Family El61 Chemistry for Environmental Engineering El62 Environmental Law El65 Health and the Social Environment El67A History of Water Pollution: Biological El67B History of Water Pollution: Chemical El69A-B Applied Ecology Seminar E 171 Dynamics of Human Populations El73 Human Ecology E 175 Environmental Reconstruction El75L Laboratory for Environmental Science El87 Environmental Psychology Social Ecology 267 El88 Advanced Environmental Psychology: Facilities Design for the Workplace El89 Environmental Design Research Methods The following lower-division course is recommended: E5 Introduction to Environmental Quality and Health Psychology and Social Behavior The Psychology and Social Behavior specialization is concerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to study variations in social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace) that affect human behavior over the life cycle. Stu\u00ad dents begin with basic course work in developmental, social, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work examines a vari\u00ad ety of topics pertinent to the fields of community, abnormal, developmental, environmental, clinical, and health psychology, and the psychological study of social problems. Sample courses cover psychosocial development in children, adolescents, and adults; gerontology, childhood behavior, disorders, and change; psychology and the law; stress and coping; counseling and therapy. Opportunities also are available to work with faculty on research in these and other areas. Students are given a foundation that will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sectors or to do graduate work in psychology, human development, health ser\u00ad vices, social work, counseling, or education. Approximately 50 agencies are available for field study in this specialization, includ\u00ad ing schools, child care facilities, community clinics, counseling centers, hospital settings, and social service agencies. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in developmental, clinical, environmental, health, or social psy\u00ad chology, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings in the Program in Social Ecology section. Students interested in human experimental psychology as applied to the study of sensation, perception, learning, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cognitive Sciences in the School of Social Sciences section. Stu\u00ad dents interested in the biological mechanisms of behavior are advised to consult the course listings in the School of Biological Sciences section. Specialization in Psychology and Social Behavior Following the completion ofS9 (Introduction to Human Behav\u00ad ior), stupents must complete six upper-division courses from among the following. Listed courses are arranged in course groupings that represent the major areas of psychology within the Program in Social Ecology: Developmental Psychology, Envi\u00ad ronmental Psychology, Social Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Health Psychology, and Psychology and Social Problems.

Basic courses Jnrernship experience, whether in the private or public sector, is an integral aspect of the undergraduate program in Social Ecology. present overviews of American legal systems with particular emphasis on criminal and juvenile justice, the forms of criminal behavior, and the role of law in understanding social and psycho\u00ad logical phenomena. Subsequent course work provides under\u00ad standing of the theoretical structures used to explain criminal behavior, the effects of crimes from the perspectives of victims, the operations of systems of justice and their underlying institu\u00ad tions, the goals of governmental regulation and the methods used to achieve those goals, and more advanced issues in the interac\u00ad tions of law and such fields as psychology, sociology, and plan\u00ad ning. In addition, substantive areas of law, such as criminal, environmental, and family law, are introduced. This specialization provides students with opportunities to become acquainted with the varieties of behavior that society chooses to control or regulate, the methods and institutions used to achieve that control or regulation, and the approaches aimed specifically at altering the unacceptable behavior. In addition, there is provision for students to use their increasing knowledge of the law, and its procedures and its institutions, to enhance their understanding of the social sciences. The course of study provides excellent preparation for law school and for graduate study in sociology, criminology, and criminal justice. Careers for students who terminate their University educations at the bacca\u00ad laureate level may be developed through placements in criminal justice and regulatory agencies, in organizations determining pub\u00ad lic policy, and in programs that deliver services to people who have difficulties with some aspect of the legal system. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, the State juvenile detention system, the Orange County Victim/Witness Assistance Program, juvenile shelters, the Orange County Legal Services Program, the UCI College Legal Clinic, and in private legal firms. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Specialization in Criminology, Law, and Society Following the completion of J4 (Introduction to Criminal Jus\u00ad tice), students must complete six of the following courses: J101 Civil Legal System S108 The Social Ecology of Child Abuse and Neglect Jll4 Organized Crime and American Society 1115 Federal Law Enforcement Jl20 Law and Inequality Sl20 Violence in Society Jl21 Sociology of Law 1132 Juvenile Delinquency J 133 Deviance J 134 Victimless Crimes J 137 Criminal Procedure J 138 Victims of Crime J 140 Prisons, Punishment, and Corrections J 141 Seminar in Criminal Justice Jl42 White Collar Crime \u00b7 Jl43 Theories of Punishment Jl44 Criminal Law J 145 Government Crime J 146 Social Control of Violence Jl47 Law and Social Change Jl48 Criminological Theory Jl50 The Legal Profession Sl61 Family Law El62 Environmenta:I Law J 164 Social Control of Delinquency J 181 Contemporary Legal Issues J 182 Legal Sanctions and Social Control Jl90 Psychology and the Law The following courses are especially recommended to students who desire exposure to legal reasoning and analysis in order to help decide whether to pursue a career in law, and to students who wish to learn how to \"think are taught by members of the Social Ecology faculty who are lawyers. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 54-57. Social Ecology Major Requirements Lower-Division Requirements Social Ecology 10 (Research Design); 13 (Statistical Analysis in Social Ecology); J4 (Introduction to Justice); E8 (Intro\u00ad duction Analysis); and S9 (Introduction to Human Behavior). Upper-Division Requirements Ten upper-division Social Ecology courses (numbered 100-193), 194 (Studies in Field Settings); two quarters (eight units) of 195 (Field Study) taken during junior and senior years. Students must complete required prerequisite courses prior to field study enroll\u00ad ments; open only to Social Ecology majors. In order to remain in good standing and be eligible for gradua\u00ad tion from the Program in Social Ecology, a student must main\u00ad tain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in all required lower\u00ad division Social Ecology courses (10, 13, J4, E8, S9) and also in the 10 required Social Ecology upper-division courses (100-193) plus 194. Planning a Program of Study Students who major in Social Ecology, although they may be specializing in a single area of interest, are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person-environment problems. The strongest program of study also includes basic course work in at least one of the social, biological, or physical sciences. Stu-Social Ecology 269 dents who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all stu\u00ad dents in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, ser\u00ad ies of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences offer a program of undergraduate instruction leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation' for students inter\u00ad ested in advanced study in environmental planning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisciplinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for stu\u00ad dents to specialize in an area of their choice. Careers in Applied Ecology Careers in the fields of environmental and resource management and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology back\u00ad ground. Many graduates hold technical or ad:ninistrative posi\u00ad tions in, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Department of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, laboratory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health professionals are in demand to help determine the safety of workplace environments for the labor force. The Applied Ecol\u00ad ogy major also provides a strong academic foundation for gradu\u00ad ate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natu\u00ad ral resources, environmental health science, microbiology, public health, law, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a comprehen\u00ad sive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engi\u00ad neering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the con\u00ad centration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences.

Further information concerning the minor is available in the Global Peace and Conflict Studies office, 734 Social Science Tower; telephone (714) 856-6410. Graduate Program in Social Ecology The graduate program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical envi\u00ad ronment. Emphasis is placed primarily upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Problems are Social Ecology 271 researched from the complementary perspectives of a multidisci\u00ad plinary faculty that includes specialists in environmental, social, developmental, clinical, and health psychology; planning and architecture; urban sociology; law; criminology; and environmen\u00ad tal health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspective of a single disci\u00ad pline. Ph.D. degree students may elect to pursue a generai course of graduate study in the principles and methods of social ecology, or they may elect to pursue the Ph.D. in Social Ecology with a specialized course of study in one of four concentrations: Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design; Criminology, Law, and Society; Health Psychology; and Human Development. M.A. degree stu\u00ad dents may pursue a general course of study or specialized training through concentrations in Urban and Regional Planning, and Facility Planning and Management. / Social Ecology faculty members apply diverse methods of scien\u00ad tific inquiry to social and environmental problems. Evaluation research, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental tech\u00ad niques receive equal emphasis with laboratory experimentation. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important \u00b7 component of graduate education in the Program. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, use of deadly force by police, legal sanctions and deterrence, white-collar and organized crime, effects of the physical environment on social behavior and health, childbearing decisions, personality and psychopathology, effects of social environments on early child development, urban decentralization, community studies, social support systems among the elderly, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific information in public policy formation, the performance and health impacts of work environments, and environmental regula\u00ad tory processes. Admission The Program offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Social Ecology. Indi\u00ad viduals desiring a Ph.D. degree should apply directly to the Ph.D. program. Applicants may apply either for the general course of graduate study in social ecological principles and methods or for a specialized course of study in one of the four concentrations. All applicants should submit a formal application before January I and undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores before February I. Additional information is available from the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor; telephone (714) 856-5917. Career Opportunities Graduates of the M.A. and Ph.D. programs enjoy a wide variety of career opportunities and have succeeded in obtaining positions in academic institutions such as Stanford University; Rutgers State University of New Jersey; The Johns Hopkins University; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; the University of Oregon; the University of Wiscon\u00ad sin; Indiana University; and the City University of New York. Other graduates have established research and administrative careers in government agencies and private\u00b7 firms throughout the United States and Canada, including the National Institutes of Health, the Toronto Department of Public Health, The United Cerebral Palsy Foundation, The Philadelphia Geriatric Center, The New Mexico Tumor Registry, Orange County Superior Court, Southern California Metropolitan Water District, and in marketing and research firms such as the Yankelovich Group. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991272 Social Ecology M.A. Program The Master's program offers advanced training that prepares stu\u00ad dents for a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and proba\u00ad tion and parole. In addition, a number of students with the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Each incoming Master's degree student is assigned a faculty advi\u00ad sor with whom the student discusses an individual program of education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), and at least one additional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's a:pademic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty ad\u00ad visor. The seven required courses must include at least five grad\u00ad uate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, inde\u00ad pendent study, or thesis courses (Social Ecology 298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (Social Ecology 297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee _ap\u00ad pointed, after a review of their graduate work and thes1~ plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. students who have been m the M.A. program for three or more years will be formally ~valuated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academ1c year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student con\u00ad tinue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the s~udent's com\u00ad mittee, ordinarily takes about two years. The reqmremen_ts fo: the two concentrations differ somewhat and are summanzed m the following sections. M.A. Concentration in Urban and Regional Planning The Master's concentration in Urban and Regional Planning seeks to train researchers and professionals in state-of-the-art methods of health and environmental planning. Students gain familiarity with planning practice and implementation, the socio\u00ad economic impacts of planning, and quantitative methodology in planning. The by-products of planning decisions at micro and macro levels are examined with respect to multiple outcomes including indicators of personal and public health, individual and organizational productivity, and socioeconomic and demographic change. Emphasis is placed on ways of reconciling the need for economically viable development with the need for effective planning to help reduce health and behavior~) problems su~h as pollution, crime, and accidents. The mtegratwn of perspectives from multiple disciplines; the focus on health, behavioral, a_nd legal aspects of planning; and the emphasis on methodological rigor represent unique features of the concentration. The range of employment opportunities for professional plan~ers is expanding, due to rising concerns over health and commumty environmental issues and to recent legislation providing addi\u00ad tional safeguards. Career paths exist in governmental agencies dealing with air quality and water treatment, public utilities and public works, health care organizations and public health agen\u00ad cies, and conservation organizations and agencies. Private con\u00ad sulting firms specializing in environmental impac~ assess\":'ent_ also represent important sources of employment, particularly m v1ew of current and future legislation on public health hazards and the need for competent studies of these hazards. The program leads to the M.A. degree in Social Ecology with a concentration in Urban and Regional Planning. Students are required to complete nine courses: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), an approved course in statistics or methodology, and six elective courses selected from the curriculum offered by the Urban and Regional Planning faculty. In lieu of a thesis, students must suc\u00ad cessfully complete a comprehensive examination consisting of oral and written components. M.A. Concentration in Facility Planning and Management The Master's concentration in Facility Planning and Manage- . ment is designed to train researchers and professionals who will contribute to our understanding of the health, behavioral, and socioeconomic impacts of facility design and building technolo\u00ad gies. Major research problems emphasized in this concentration include the implications of population dynamics for the planning and design of facilities, potential hazards in the physical envi\u00ad ronment and the perception of risk among environmental regula\u00ad tors and the general population, institutional responses to public policies that regulate private use of the physical environment, the usefulness of technological innovations for improving the envi\u00ad ronment, and the manner in which policy makers approach and solve problems of the physical environment. Developed in _co?sul\u00ad tation with the International Facilities Management Assoc1at1on (IFMA), the training program emphasizes the incorporation ?f behavioral and health data into the siting, construction, and mte- rior and exterior design of buildings. \u00b7 The need for people trained in facility planning and management is growing rapidly, as corporations and organizations increasingly require the expertise of individuals who can plan and manage facilities. Facility managers are employed to manage a wide array of physical facilities, including corporate and government build\u00ad ings, educational institutions, hospitals, facilities for the elderly, utility companies, and factories. The program leads to the M.A. degree in Social Ecology with a concentration in Facility Planning and Management. Students are required to complete nine courses: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), an approved course in statistics or methodology, and six elective courses designed to train students in strategic planning and man\u00ad agement of built environments. In lieu of a thesis, students must successfully complete a comprehensive examination consisting of oral and written components. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares stu\u00ad dents for academic careers in research and teaching. Graduates also are well qualified for employment in private or governmental agencies, where they can bring advanced academic training, . strong methodological and statistical skills, and spec1al expertise to such issues as environmental health and design, urban and regional planning, criminal justice, and social policies affecting mental and physical health. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. in four to five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to dis\u00ad cuss an individualized program of graduate education. The fol-\u00b7 lowing core courses are required of all Ph.D. students: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, and either Program Evaluation (Social Ecology 291), Social Epidemiology (Social Ecology 224), or Strategies of Theory Development (Social Ecology 261). UC IRVINE - 1990-1991In addition to these five required core courses, doctoral students who are pursuing a general course of study must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate-level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (Social Ecology 297, 298, 299, or 296). Students may take each of their electives within a different substantive area or may take clusters of courses within fewer subareas. The requirements differ somewhat for students who choose to pursue a more specialized course of study in one of the four con\u00ad centrations. The requirements for the concentrations are summar- ized in subsequent sections. \u00b7 Program faculty.believe that Ph.D. students should become involved in research very early in their graduate careers. To encourage such involvement, doctoral students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The method of research may include experi\u00ad ments, questionnaire and interview studies, systematic field observation, secondary analysis, computer simulations, and other methods. It is expected that students will begin their project dur\u00ad ing the first year in residence and will complete it during the second year. The written report of the project may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be submitted as such if the student's committee approves. Also, before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree, doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of one or more research areas within Social Ecology. Accordingly, students are required to submit a written analysis of a social\u00ad environmental problem relevant to one or more disciplines within Social Ecology. The breadth requirement can be completed through alternative written formats including a comprehensive examination or the submission of a major paper or series of papers that intensively examines specific research issues. Prefer\u00ad ably, the perspective taken should be interdisciplinary, but a sin\u00ad gle disciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the stu\u00ad dent's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a com\u00ad mittee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to assemble and meet with this committe<; as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the stu\u00ad dent's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining committee will meet with the individual to determine if the breadth requirement was successfully completed, and to recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to \u00b7candidacy for the Ph.D. degree when all requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thorough examination of the his\u00ad tory of the problem being proposed for investigation, its current status; the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge, a detailed specification of the proposed method of approach to the problem, and a description of the planned methods for analyzing the data collected. It is strongly recom\u00ad mended that students advance to candidacy during their third year of study. In no case will students be. allowed to advance to candidacy after the end of their fifth year of study. ' Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree will be made by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candidacy committee. Alterna-Social Ecology 273 tively, the committee may recommend a course of action to strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy. All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the stu\u00ad dent continue toward the Ph.D. degree, complete the M.A. degree .only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation committee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D. degree, each doctoral student must serve as a Teach\u00ad ing Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. Ph.D. Concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design The doctoral concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design prepares students to conduct research on questions of vital importance to environmental and planning professionals. These questions deal with health, behavioral, and environmental design factors, as well as the urban and regional planning options considered by public and private-sector policymakers. The cur\u00ad riculum and the diversity of faculty within the concentration afford unique opportunities for multidisciplinary research and training. One of the concentration's strengths is its research methods sequence, which draws from several disciplines and includes survey and epidemiologic methods, water and air quality testing, facilities programming and postoccupancy evaluation, legal research, assessment of psychological effects of environmen\u00ad tal factors, and analyses of urban and regional phenomena. Potential employment sources for graduates include academic and research institutions; federal agencies; policy-making organi\u00ad zations; urban workplace health-promotion programs; and envi\u00ad ronmental design consulting firms. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of all Ph.D. students, noted above, and eight elective courses drawn from the three focal areas within this concentration: Environmen\u00ad tal Design and Behavior, Urban Planning and Design, and Environmental Health and Public Policy. The elective courses cover topics such as environmental and urban design, environ\u00ad mental health risk, urban planning, facilities design and manage\u00ad ment, behavioral epidemiology, demography, the regulatory pro\u00ad cess, urban and regional analysis, technological hazards and change, and environmental toxicology. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in research activities as early as their first year of graduate study. Two years of course work are followed by a predissertation research project, the ful\u00ad fillment of the breadth requirement, and the preparation of a dis\u00ad sertation proposal. The fourth and possibly fifth years are devoted to the development and completion of the dissertation research. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991274 Social Ecology Ph.D. Concentration in Criminology, Law, and Society The study of the criminal, crime, and institutional responses to illegal behavior is the focus of the doctoral concentration in Criminology, Law, and Society. Students examine issues related to the etiology of crime, the impacts of crime on society, and the process of changing criminal behavior. The concentration also includes an emphasis on social regulation and the civil justice sys\u00ad tem which combine in a unique program that allows the investi\u00ad gator to address the nature of illegal activities as well as the response of individual and social systems to those activities. Students gain familiarity with a number of subjects including sen\u00ad tencing; crime rates; of timology; white-collar\"and organized crime; behavior of courts, juries, and regulatory agencies; and interactions among organiza\u00ad tions within the legal system. Students may concentrate on par\u00ad ticular substantive areas of Jaw and society including occupa\u00ad tional health and safety, white-collar or economic crime, envi\u00ad ronmental law, and business-government interactions. In general, students are introduced to the leading classical and contemporary issues in criminology, law, and society and to ways of under\u00ad standing them through interdisciplinary research. The concentra\u00ad tion aims to develop theoretical sophistication and to prepare the graduate student for research, teaching, and administrative work in institutions in the legal system, the criminal justice system, and related organizations. In addition to the five core courses and other requirements for the Ph.D. degree, students take at least six other graduate courses in areas such as theories of crime, Jaw and society, and legal insti\u00ad tutions and social policy. Students become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and conduct independent, supervised research projects during the second year of graduate study. Methods of research may include experiments, questionnaire and survey studies, systematic field observation, computer simulation, and legal research. Students complete a breadth requirement during year three. One option for doing so is by means of a critical and conceptually integrative literature review on a specific topic in criminology or law and society, although other options-including a comprehensive examina\u00ad tion-are available. The fourth and fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research. Opportunities for field place\u00ad ments in legal and criminal justice settings are also available. Ph.D. Concentration in Health Psychology The doctoral concentration in Health Psychology focuses on identifying, evaluating, and enhancing the psychosocial and behavioral factors that promote health, prevent disease, and optimize medical treatments. The concentration involves a strong commitment to multidisciplinary scholarship and a focus on knowledge and theory, research competencies, and health profes\u00ad sional skills. Students are encouraged to join active investigative teams studying processes such as adaptive aging; stress, coping, and social support; personality factors that increase resilience to health threats; the development of heart-healthy behavior pat\u00ad terns during childhood and adolescence; worksite health promo\u00ad tion and the design of work environments; and perceptions of health and environmental risks. In addition, a year-long practi\u00ad cum provides students with research experience in health care set\u00ad tings and exposure to clinical interventions in the field of health psychology. Potential employment sites for graduates include academic institutions; health care settings; federal agencies; school, workplace, and community health-promotion programs; research organizations; and university and government policy institutes.

Students are expected to become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and to conduct an inde\u00ad pendent, supervised research project during their second year. Students take a two-part qualifying examination during their third year, involving a written comprehensive examination (in ful\u00ad fillment of the breadth requirement) and a critical and conceptu\u00ad ally integrative literature review on a specific health psychology topic. The fourth and possibly fifth years are devoted to develop-1 ing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing disser\u00ad tation research. Opportunities for field placements in health\u00ad related settings also are available. Ph.D. Concentration in Human Development The doctoral concentration in Human Development focuses on the development of individuals through the life span and the effects of the varying social, physical, and cultural contexts in which development takes place. Students are trained in key developmental theories and concepts, with attention to all phases of the life span; in the research methods of several social-scientific specialities; and in the conduct of problem-oriented research that addresses issues of current concern to individuals and to society as a whole. Potential employment sites for graduates include aca\u00ad demic institutions (e.g., departments of psychology or human development); human services settings (e.g., hospitals, schools, community agencies); research organizations; government policy institutes; and a variety of private sector employers. Students are encouraged to become actively involved in research from the earliest stages of their training. Current research teams are investigating the effects of divorce and custody arrangements; the effects of maternal and paternal employment on parents' well\u00ad being and child and adolescent outcomes; children's health risk perceptions; the strengths and limitations of children as witnesses; modes of adapting to stress over the life span; and the impact of activity patterns and social ties on the well-being of the elderly. Students fulfill the basic requirements for the Ph.D. degree including the required core courses. In addition, students take two human development courses, Principles of Human Develop\u00ad ment (Social Ecology 220) and Issues in Human.Development (Social Ecology 236A-B); two courses from the life span cluster of the curriculum, e.g., Adolescence (Social Ecology 204), Social Gerontology (Social Ecology 225); and four additional courses, distributed as best suits the student's plan of study. Students select these courses from clusters that focus on the foundations of development; different parts of the life span; methods and strate\u00ad gies of research; social, physical, and cross-cultural contexts of development; health and adjustment over the life span; and social problems and social policies. In addition to courses offered by the UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Program in Social Ecology, the Human Development curriculum may include courses offered by the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment, the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences, and the Departments of Anthropology and Sociol\u00ad ogy in the School of Social Sciences. In addition to course work, students conduct an independent, supervised research project during their second year. They take a two-part qualifying examination during their third year, consist\u00ad ing of a written comprehensive examination (in fulfillment of the breadth requirement), and prepare a critical and conceptually integrative literature review on a topic of importance to the field of human development. This topic often is related to the student's future dissertation research. The fourth and possibly fifth years are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research.

Sirignano Dean The School of Engineering provides a stimulating intellectual environment for its community of scholars. The Departments of Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs of study for indi\u00ad viduals who will engage in the professional practice of engineer\u00ad ing as it relates to design, development, research, and teaching in industry, government, or a university. A concentration in Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering offers graduate degree programs of study. Programs at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, enabling the graduates to continue professional development through formal or informal study. The degree pro\u00ad grams in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profession and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level, a Bachelor of Science degree program in Engineering, with options in Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering, is offered respectively through the Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering Departments. Each of these options is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Courses in aerospace engineering are offered within the Mechani\u00ad cal Engineering option. Courses in computer engineering are offered within the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in com\u00ad puter science are offered external to the School of Engineering by the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS). Students with high achievemeilt may declare a double major in Engineering and ICS. Early consultation with the School is advisable on this and other double-major programs, such as the one with Biological Sciences. The undergraduate Engineering curriculum provides a firm back\u00ad ground in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathe\u00ad matics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the engi\u00ad neering sciences through required basic engineering courses; and specialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part-time employment or major extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can catch up by en\u00ad rolling in summer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. Each of the three Departments and the concentration in Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering offer graduate-level options leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed; the exact selection of the courses is formulated through consultation between the student and a faculty advisor. Thesis and nonthesis programs are avail\u00ad able. The Ph.D. program is less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demonstrate various competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organ\u00ad izations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and in many instances are local chapters of national engineering societies. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them alsoparticipate in the annual Engineering Week activities, held each February, and in other School functions. There are student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronau\u00ad tics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechanical Engi\u00ad neers (ASME), the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engi\u00ad neers (SWE), the Structural Engineering Association of Califor\u00ad nia (SEAOC), and the honorary engineering societies Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, and Chi Epsilon. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving person\u00ad nel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encouraged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student eval\u00ad uation of the quality of instruction for each course is requested each quarter. Institute for Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology The Institute for Combustion and Propulsion Science and Tech\u00ad nology, an Irvine Research Unit, is a multidisciplinary activity addressing both fundamental and applied research in combus\u00ad tion. The Institute is described in greater detail on page 84 and 302. Research in Image Engineering Image engineering synthesizes current research on technologies which utilize visual images. For more information, see page 296. Degrees Engineering .............................. B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engineer\u00ad ing are awarded on the basis of grade point average, service to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement 'in research projects. A general criterion is that stu\u00ad dents must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a Uni\u00ad versity of California campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Additional awards in other categories are made throughout the academic year. Education Abroad Program Upper-division and graduate Engineering students can participate in a \"number of programs which offer unique opportunities for education and training abroad, usually after the completion of the sophomore year. The University's Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram (EAP) offers engineering course work for UCI academic credit at a number of universities. Some of the EAP-affiliated engineering schools require proficiency in the host country's lan\u00ad guage, while others are English speaking. Study abroad may postpone the student's graduation for one or two quarters, depending primarily on the student's language preparation (which can begin in the freshman year), but the added experience can add to the student's maturity and professional competence. EAP students pay regular UCI fees and keep any scholarships they may have. The only extra cost is round-trip airfare. Detailed information is available on page 63. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Engineering 285 Rokind Schinzinger, Ph.D. Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of Management A s members of a Land Grant institution, the faculty of the University of California has the responsibility for both teaching and crea\u00ad tive activity. In engineering as well as in the sciences, creative activity is most often evi\u00ad denced in research to develop new, or expand existing, bodies of knowledge. I view teaching and research as complementary activities. As an engineer, my research has to do with understanding the physical world well enough so that when a problem needs solving, I can formulate it properly and devise a mathematical model or experimental procedure to find an answer which not only meets known physical and societal constraints but is also the optimum according to a desired criterion. The teaching aspect enters through the active participation (and not mere note-taking) by students in this quest. Initially, the students will be facing a problem new to them but not necessarily to me. As the students progress, we tackle open-ended problems leading to research. Teaching involves taking our results or failures and making sense of them to the students as well as to colleagues and the public outside the University. My main academic interest is in the design and operation of reliable, economical networks for supplying our popula\u00ad tion centers with vital services and commodities such as energy, communications, food, and water. Coupled with this interest is a concern for the responsibility of engineers to society for the consequences of their creations and actions. I do not expect students to share my views in such matters, but I want them to keep their eyes, ears, and minds open so that they acquire the wider understanding needed to make not just any handy decision, but rather to make wise decisions. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991I 286 Engineering Undergraduate Program NOTE: The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering, with accredited options in Civil Engineering, Elec\u00ad trical Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI only as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wishing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 1991 must have submitted their completed appli\u00ad cation forms during the priority filing period (November l-30, 1990). High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram are advised to have completed four years of English, four years of mathematics, and one year each of physics and chemis\u00ad try. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admit\u00ad tance to the Engineering major during periods of restricted en\u00ad rollments. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT scores and three Achievement Test Scores by mid-January, 1991. All applicants for the School of Engineering must apply for admission to a specific Engineering department. These departments are Civil Engineering (CE), Elec\u00ad trical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering (ME). If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. A student may be admitted to a program (i.e., Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering) in the School of Engineering \u00b7either from another major at UCI or from another college or university, including a community college. A student seeking admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced standing and must have completed the appropriate pre\u00ad requisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. Since the requirements vary from program to program, those contemplating admission in advanced standing to the School should consult the Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs, 114 Rockwell Engineering Center, (714) 85~6749, for the specific requirements of each program. Transfer students satisfying the Statewide Articulation Agreement on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Com\u00ad munity Colleges-California State Universities-University of Cali\u00ad fornia) may complete the remaining requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, provided one or two designated courses are taken in summer session prior to entry. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Advising Academic advising is available from faculty advisors, academic counselors, and peer advisors. Freshmen and sophomores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counse\u00ad lors and by the peer advisors in the School's Office of Under\u00ad graduate Student Affairs. All Engineering students must consult at least once every year with the academic counselors in the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Students also are encouraged to consult with their faculty advisors. Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering students are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year and whenever they desire to change their program of study. Career Advising The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 76. In addition, special career planning events are held throughout the year including an annual Career Fair. Individual career counseling is available, and students have access to the Career Library which contains information on graduate and pro\u00ad fessional schools in engineering, as well as general career information.

Students wishing to obtain variances should submit peti\u00ad tions to the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited department options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on opportunities within each option is available from faculty ad\u00ad visors and academic counselors, who will also advise students on selection of courses. Students must realize, however, that ulti\u00ad mately they alone are responsible for the planning of their own pro\u00ad grams and for satisfactory completion of the graduation require\u00ad ments. Mechanical and Civil engineering students are required to have their program of study approved by their faculty advisor at least once each year and whenever they desire to change their program of study. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain prior approval from faculty of the School. Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most Engineering courses. The sample programs shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. \u00b7 Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses \u00b7 in the freshman and sophomore years in order to qualify for en\u00ad rollment in any upper-division Engineering course. School of Engineering policy does not permit the addition or deletion of Engineering courses after the third week of the quar\u00ad ter. Individual instructors may have more stringent add/drop policies; students should request a statement of the instructor's policy at the beginning of each quarter's class. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic stand\u00ad ing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Undergraduate Study Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Stu\u00ad dents are required to complete the lower-division writing requirement (see page 56) during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level lan\u00ad guage such as BASIC, FORTRAN, and/or PASCAL) is expected in all Engineering courses. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Subject A and upper-division writing requirements; any free electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement. Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the approval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves labora- . tory exercises, the student may be required to perform experi\u00ad ments as well as to take a written examination. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a student has taken before at UCI. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engineer\u00ad ing courses in addition to the undergraduate degree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the Engineering 287 petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. Graduate Program Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concentrations in Bio\u00ad chemical, Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. The pro\u00ad gram in Biochemical Engineering emphasizes bioreactors, recom\u00ad binant cells, and separation operations. Civil Engineering focuses upon four major thrust areas: structural mechanics; earthquake and reliability engineering; geotechnical engineering; transporta\u00ad urban systems; and water resources and envi\u00ad ronmental engineering. The concentration in Electrical Engineer\u00ad ing includes the three major thrust areas of computer engineering, optical and solid state devices, and systems and signal processing. The thrust areas in Mechanical Engineering include the thermal and fluid sciences, combustion and propulsion, control systems, robotics, materials, and aerospace engineering. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 85. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be ad\u00ad mitted to full graduate standing. Those admitted from an allied field may be required to take supplementary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units is required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch graduate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. the\u00ad sis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertaking an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a min\u00ad imum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). In Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering the comprehensive examination includes a research project and/or additional course work. In Electrical Engineering the comprehensive examination takes the form of a core course program (see Graduate Courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering). In Civil and Mechanical Engineering, the comprehensive examination includes a project and a report. The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formu\u00ad lated in consultation with an advisor who takes into considera\u00ad tion the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the spe\u00ad cific requirements of the School. Students should acquaint them\u00ad selves with core course requirements in the various concentra\u00ad tions of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full-time students must carry 12 units per quarter and should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991I 288 Engineering M.S. students with theses or projects have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. Specific M.S. program information is presented in the Biochemi\u00ad cal, Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering sections. Part-Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since Univer\u00ad sity residence requirements necessitate the successful completion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate coordi\u00ad nator in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of the appropriate program (BE, CE, ECE, or ME). M.S. pro\u00ad grams must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. Transfer of Courses Upon petition, a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses. For further information, see page 89. - Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; within one year of arrival on the campus, passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; meeting departmental teaching requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy through qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; completion of a significant research investigation; and completion and defense of an acceptable dis\u00ad sertation. There is no foreign language requirement. Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral pro\u00ad grams must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching assist\u00ad antships, is available. Specific Ph.D. program information is presented in the Biochem\u00ad ical, Civil, Electrical and Computer, and Mechanical Engineering sections. General Engineering Lecturers Brad J.

DaSilva, Ph.D. California Institute of Technology, Assistant Professor of Biochemical Engineering (recombinant cell bioengineering) Juan Hong, Ph.D. Purdue University, Associate Professor of Biochemical Engineering (biochemical engineering, bioseparations). Henry C. Lim, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Professor of Biochemical Engineering (bioreaction and bioreactor engineering) Biochemical Engineering is concerned with the processing of bio\u00ad logical materials and processes that use biological agents such as living cells, enzymes, or antibodies. Biochemical Engineering, with integrated knowledge of the principles of biology and chem\u00ad ical engineering, plays a major engineering role in the rapidly developing area of biotechnology. Career opportunities in Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering are available in a variety of industries such as biotechnology, chemical, environmental, food, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries. The principle objectives of the graduate curriculum in Biochemi\u00ad cal Engineering are to develop and expand students' abilities to solve new and more challenging engineering problems and to promote their skills in independent thinking and learning in preparation for careers in manufacturing, research, or teaching. These objectives are reached through a program of course work and research designed by each student with the assistance, advice, and approval of a primary faculty advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Master of Science Degree Two options are available for the M.S. degree: a comprehensive examination option which requires completion of an examination based on a research project and/or additional course work as prescribed by the graduate committee; and a thesis option which requires the completion of an original research project, the writ\u00ad ing of a thesis, and the successful defense of the thesis. Each option requires a minimum of 36 approved units; a thesis or project typically accounts for seven units of credit. Students who enter the program with a B.S. degree in chemical engineering must take eight courses (29 to 32 units), while stu\u00ad dents who enter without undergraduate preparation in chemical engineering are required to .take four to seven additional prereq\u00ad uisite courses. A detailed program of study for each entering stu\u00ad dent is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor. Doctor of Philosophy Degree An applicant for admission to the Ph.D. program in Biochemical Engineering normally will have completed an M.S. program with distinction from an institution of recognized high standing. Miles\u00ad tones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the following: three courses ( lO to II units) beyond those required for the M.S. program, acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor, successful completion ofthe Ph.D. preliminary examination, passing of the qualifying examinat.ion which assesses the candi\u00ad date's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed origi\u00ad nal research, successful completion of the research, and presenta\u00ad tion and successful defense of the dissertation.

University of California, Irvine, Lecturer in Civil Engineering (surveying, computer-aided drafting) Civil Engineering has been described as the art of harnessing the great powers of nature for the use and convenience of human beings. The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers\u00b7 in South\u00ad ern California has been transformed into a thriving metropolis largely by the application of civil engineering. The goal of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare gnidu\u00ad ates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the under\u00ad graduate level a common core of fundamental subjects is pro\u00ad vided, with opportunity to specialize in the senior year. Graduate opportunities are in three major thrust areas: structural analysis, design, and reliability; transportation and urban systems; and water resources and environmental engineering. The career opportunities in civil engineering are varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consulting firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good ground for many administrative and managerial positions. Undergraduate Option in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The program objective is to prepare civil engineering graduates for a career in the profession or for entry into graduate school. The curriculum provides the opportunity to obtain a firm foun\u00ad dation in engineering science and to develop the techniques of analysis and design, which are basic for the successful practi\u00ad tioner. Emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree with the Civil Engineering Option University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 286., Departmental Requirements: Students must complete the follow\u00ad ing core courses: in the stu\u00ad dent's chosen area of concentration); one environmental studies course from an approved list; two technical elective courses in the student's chosen area of concentration, selected among struc\u00ad tures, transportation, or water resources; and technical electives containing enough units of design to aggregate 23 units. Design unit values are indicated at the end of each course description. In addition, students must select a second, different area of concen\u00ad tration from among either structures, transportation, water resources, or construction and project management, and take two technical elective courses in the second concentration. Upper-division students must obtain their faculty advisor's approval of the courses to be taken each quarter. Program of Study The sample program of study chart is typical for the accredited option in Civil Engineering. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most compelling reasons. Students must have their programs approved by their faculty advisor. Graduate Concentration in Civil Engineering Master of Science Degree The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of competence for the professional practice of civil engineering. Two routes are available to those working toward the M.S. degree: (l) successful completion of 36 approved units (which include a project) and a comprehensive examination, or (2) a combination of academic course work and a thesis (typically 28 approved units of course work coupled with a thesis counting for 8 units). All students must present their thesis research findings in a public seminar. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Ph.D. degree indicates attainment of an original and signifi\u00ad cant research contribution to the state-of-the-art in the candi\u00ad date's field, and an ability to communicate advanced engineering concepts. The requirements for the Ph.D. degree include an early UC IRVINE - 1990-1991assessment of the student's research potential (this may consist of a preliminary examination), research preparation, passing the qualifying examination, adva.ncement to candidacy, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation.

Weill, Ph.D. University of Idaho, Lecturer in Electrical and Computer Engineering (information theory and communication systems) Electrical and Computer engineering is a broad field encompass\u00ad ing such diverse subject areas as computers, control, electronics, digital systems, communications, signal processing, electromag\u00ad netics, and physics of electronic devices. Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences is applied to the theory, design, and implementation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of behavior of elec\u00ad tronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study the generation, trans\u00ad mission, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of elec\u00ad trical engineers studies the behavior of complex electronic sys\u00ad tems such as computers, automatic controls, telecommunications, and signal processing. Still another group studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Of this latter group, those engaged in designing a variety of electronic computers and computer\u00ad based application systems are often called computer engineers. Most electrical engineers begin work in a large organizational environment as members of an engineering team. They obtain career satisfaction from solving meaningful problems that con\u00ad tribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As they mature, electrical engineers have the opportunity to grow techni\u00ad cally, administratively, or both. Technical growth most naturally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the under\u00ad graduate years. Administrative growth can result from the devel\u00ad opment of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. In either case, the undergraduate curriculum in Electrical Engineering provides a solid foundation for future career growth. Research in Image Engineering Spanning the growing industrial-scientific spectrum of technolo\u00ad gies which utilize visual images, image engineering synthesizes current research in a comprehensive way that may have far\u00ad reaching effects on fields such as manufacturing, fluid mechanics, structural vibrations, chemistry, cardiology, and radiology. This new concept in engineering could impact a range of industries from radar to pharmaceuticals, from medical ima~ing to computer-aided manufacturing, from vehicular guidance and inspection to electronic cameras. Participants include engineering firms and several academic disciplines at UCI. Further informa\u00ad tion is available from Professor Jack Sklansky, Director, Image Engineering Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717. Undergraduate Option in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate Electrical Engineering curriculum is built around a basic core of humanities, mathematics, natural and engineering science courses. It is arranged to provide the funda\u00ad mentals of synthesis and design that will enable graduates to begin careers in industry or to go on to graduate study. Electrical and Computer Engineering students at UCI are exposed to courses in network analysis, electronic system design, signal pro\u00ad cessing, control systems, electromagnetics, and computers. They learn to design circuits and systems to meet specific needs and to use modern computers in problem analysis and solution. A major program emphasis within the Department is computer engineering, a discipline primarily concerned with design and analysis of computer systems. Students can take a program of study leading to strong proficiency in computer engineering, in particular, the design and analysis of microprocessor-based sys\u00ad tems. In addition to the courses offered by the Department, this program includes selected courses from the Department of Information and Computer Science. The Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in the following fields: communications theory; computer systems; control systems; integrated and acoustics; medi\u00ad cal imaging and automatic pattern classification; power systems and electromechanics; and quantum electronics and optics. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree with the Electrical Engineering Option University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School Requirements: See page 286. Departmental Requirements: At least 97 units consisting of: A. Seventy-four units of core courses and associated laboratories: Physics 5D Eighteen units of technical electives and associated laboratories which may be selected from science or engineering fields. Stu\u00ad dents wishing to take courses outside of the Department of Elec\u00ad trical and Computer Engineering must receive written permission from their faculty advisor. C. Five units of free electives. Students should select their electives so that they aggregate a min\u00ad imum of 26 design units. At least one of the Engineering courses taken to satisfy the graduation requirement should have more than 50 percent design content. Students should consult their academic counselor (114 Rockwell Engineering Center) or the ECE Department for the design unit value of each course. Program of Study Students must complete all required freshman and sophomore courses before they enroll in any junior or senior electrical engi\u00ad neering courses. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The sample program of study chart is typical for the accredited option in Electrical Engineering. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most compelling reasons. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their programs approved by the appropriate advisor. Graduate Concentration in Electrical Engineering Because most graduate courses are not repeated every quarter, students should make every effort to begin their graduate pro\u00ad gram in the fall. Master of Science Degree The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers two routes to the M.S. degree: a comprehensive examination option and a thesis option. The comprehensive examination option is a nonthesis program. Candidates take the five Electrical and Computer Engineering core courses (ECE2IOA, ECE235, ECE240A, ECE279, and ECE287 A) and a coherent set of courses in a specialization approved by their faculty advisor. In addition to the University's grade-point-average requirements, each of the core courses must be completed with a grade of B or better. The thesis option is available for those graduate students who might best benefit from intense concentration on a specific prob\u00ad lem. For the thesis option, students (during the first quarter of the program and in consultation with their faculty advisor) are required to develop and obtain approval of a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis and, when the thesis is approved, to administer an oral examination on basic princi\u00ad ples and the thesis contents. It is possible to meet either degree requirement on a part-time basis. All M.S. students are required to enroll in the weekly departmen\u00ad tal seminar, ECE294, for at least two quarters. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering requires a commit\u00ad ment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collabora\u00ad tion with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After substantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work as understudies to facu~ty advisors. The process Sample Program of Study-Electrical Engineering1 Freshman Sophomore Fall Math 2A Math 2D Physics 5D, 5LD ECEllA Free Elective' Breadth Breadth Spring 5B, 5LB Physics 5E, 5LE ECEllB ECE70 Electrical and Computer Engineering 297 involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and cul\u00ad minates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. All Ph.D. students are required to enroll in the weekly depart\u00ad mental seminar, ECE294, for at least four quarters. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the follow\u00ad ing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor dur\u00ad ing the student's first quarter of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for doing research, completion of the School of Engineering teaching requirements, and the development of a research proposal; pass\u00ad ing the Qualifying Examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed research; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; presentation of the dissertation and final examination on its contents. The Ph.D. preliminary examination contains two parts: a depth examination administered at the end of the first year of doctoral study by faculty in the student's area of specialization; and, preceding it, a breadth examination consisting of the General Record Examination Subject Tests in either Physics, Mathemat\u00ad ics, or Computer Science. The results of the Subject Test must be made available to the faculty prior to the end of the winter quar\u00ad ter of the student's first year of study in the doctoral program. The Ph.D. preliminary examination may be repeated once. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doctoral committee and the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

Schaufele, M.S. California Institute of Technology, Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering (aircraft design, aerodynamic analyses) Mechanical engineering is concerned with energy conversion and transfer, forces and motions, and material behavior in the design of systems. Knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry lies at the core of the field, but application of this knowledge to design uses engineering technology-a disciplined way of think\u00ad ing, modeling, and testing that enables design to proceed despite incomplete information and uncertainty. The undergraduate option in Mechanical Engineering includes both a traditional mechanical engineering curriculum and a developing focus in aerospace engineering. Both areas include statics, kinematics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, solid mechanics, mechanical behavior of materials, controls, and experimental methods. Application areas in mechanical engineering include combustion, heat engines, refrigeration, and robotics. Application areas in aero\u00ad space engineering include propulsion, aerodynamic design, con\u00ad trols and performance, light weight materials, and terrestrial and aerospace vehicles. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991302 Mechanical Engineering The developing focus in aerospace engineering includes courses especially relevant to aeronautical and space sciences, and addi\u00ad tional courses are added each year. The core courses in the mechanical engineering undergraduate curriculum provide the fundamental basis for the specialized courses which students take in their senior year. These courses are Combustion in Practical Systems (MEllO), Propulsion (ME112), Digital Control Systems (ME170B), Instrumentation and Data Acquisition (ME180), and Aeronautical Design (MEl 58). In addition, a substantial propor\u00ad tion of the faculty in the department specialize in aerosciences with research ranging from propulsion to the control of large space structures. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of subjects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in areas such as environmental engineering, medicine, law, and management. Institute for Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology The Institute for Combustion and Propulsion Science and Tech\u00ad nology, an Irvine Research Unit, is a multidisciplinary activity addressing both fundamental and applied research in combustion and propulsion. The activity is built on a foundation that has evolved over fifteen years of major collaborative research activity at UCI which now encompasses faculty, students, and staff in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Department of Chemistry, and the College of Medicine. The Institute promotes and expands this interaction, provides a broader portfolio of research experiences and opportunities to graduate and under\u00ad graduate students, sponsors a seminar series and workshops, and supports a visitors program to enhance interaction with distin\u00ad guished scientists from both industry and academia. The goal of the Institute is to ( 1) develop a more complete under\u00ad standing of the physiochemical processes of combustion and pro\u00ad pulsion with particular emphasis on turbulent transport, liquid sprays, two-phase particle flows, high-speed and supersonic mix\u00ad ing, laser diagnostics, chemistry-turbulence interaction, and advanced computational methods; (2) establish relationships between these processes and potential health and environmental impacts associated with soot particulate and gaseous pollutant emissions; and (3) apply this understanding to applications of technological importance. The focus of the Institute is directed to laser diagnostics (velocity, temperature, species concentration, droplet size, droplet volocity, and soot particulate), advanced numerical methods (direct simu\u00ad lation; mass, heat and momentum transport; spray processes), and applications (turbulent transport, spray combustion, chemi\u00ad cal kinetics, chemistry-turbulence interaction, and health effects). The Institute interacts closely with industry and national labora\u00ad tories in the conduct of both the basic and applied research activities. Further information about the program is available from Profes\u00ad sor G. S. Samuelsen, Director of the Institute for Combustion and Propulsion Science and Technology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717; telephone (714) 856-5468. Undergraduate Option in Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Electives in the humanities are required for intellectual development. Engineering courses in fundamental areas fill much of the remaining curricu\u00ad lum; a few electives allow the undergraduate student to specialize somewhat or to pursue broader areas. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree with the Mechanical Engineering Option University Requirements: See pages 54-57. School RequirementS: See page 286. Departmental Requirements: At least 102 units of Engineering and technical subjects. The Core Courses are: Chemistry IB and also are required. Techni\u00ad cal electives must be approved by the faculty advisor. In addition, students must aggregate a minimum of 34' design units; at least ten of the 34 design units must be obtained in the courses approved as technical electives. Design unit values are indicated at the end of each course description. The faculty advisors and the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office can provide necessary guidance for satisfying the design requirements. Selection of elective courses must be approved by the assigned faculty advisor and the departmental undergraduate advisor. Program of Study The sample program of study chart is typical for the accredited option in Mechanical Engineering. The chart shows samples of coordinated sets of technical electives by area of specialization. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with adequate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most com\u00ad pelling reasons. Students who are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their programs approved by their faculty advisor. Graduate Concentration in Mechanical Engineering Master of Science Degree Two options are available to pursue study toward the M.S. degree. The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gairl research experience or as preparation for study toward the doctoral degree. The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, execution and documentation of a design project (which can count for up to three of the 36 required units), and completion of an examination on the course work and project. This plan is available for those who wish to emphasize profes\u00ad sional practice. Doctor of Philosophy Degree An applicant for admission to the Ph.D. concentration in Mechanical Engineering normally will have completed an M.S. program with distinction from an institution of recognized high standing. Evidence of superior scholarship and potential for orig\u00ad inal creative work are necessary for admission to the program. Before seeking admission an applicant should communicate directly and in some detail with a prospective faculty sponsor. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The student's objectives and financial resources must coincide with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a teaching assistantship or fellowship will ordinarily support only one year of the period of several years required to complete the program. During the balance of the period the student will be in close collaboration with the faculty research director, will be employed as a research assistant through the faculty member's research grants, and will use labor\u00ad atory supplies, equipment, and computer facilities purchased through these extramural funds. Admission to the concentration requires demonstration of educational preparation, intellectual capacity, dedication, and sufficient financial support. The Mechanical Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in five thrust areas: combustion and propulsion, thermal and fluid sciences, control systems, robotics, and materials, Combustion and propulsion encompasses laser diagnostics, experimental methods, and advanced numerical analyses. Ther\u00ad mal and fluid sciences encompass natural convection and radia\u00ad tion heat transfer, turbulent transport, and atmospheric pro\u00ad cesses. Control systems include robust stabilization, parameter identification, and advanced experimental design techniques. Robotics includes mechaniCal design, robot navigation, and coordination of multiple robot systems. Materials research encompasses creep, superplasticity, and advanced composites.

McGuire, Ph.D. Professor of Management F or almost 40 years I have been academically involved with students attending the University to learn how to become successful members of the business community. I have learned that \u00b7students are individuals, and that an instructor should treat them as such rather than approach them with preconceived and stereotyped notions of their talents and abilities. It is, nevertheless, difficult to resist the temptation to generalize about business students and the education they receive. One common generalization is that the drive for success and monetary reward is extremely powerful among these students. Nowhere else in higher education is the emphasis on material self-aggrandizement so central as in management education. As a consequence, there is a great danger that management students can leave the university prepared to pursue commercial success, but be almost untouched by civilizing influences and humanistic im\u00ad pulses. In UCI's two-year M.B.A. program the student is instilled with commercial values but, if all meshes well, these strong drives will at least be somewhat tempered by other graduate and undergraduate experiences. My vision of a good management education, then, is one that focuses on more than the techniques for making money and getting ahead in the organization. I would like management students and graduates to be aware of the issues of the day and to think deeply about the impact of their decisions on society and their fellow humans. Society as well as business desperately need executives who strive to increase company profits, but always within parameters acceptable to them as caring, civilized, human, beings.

The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modern management, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degree is profes\u00ad sional in nature; the Ph.D. in Administration is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. The Master's program is intended to provide future managers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in manage\u00ad ment tools and techniques. Each student in the Master's program focuses upon an institutional area and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has academic and research objectives. Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of gradu\u00ad ate education. First, there are significant phenomena and prob\u00ad lems common to business, educational, and governmental organ\u00ad izations; second, a common set of disciplines, concepts, tech\u00ad niques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many adminis\u00ad trators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, condi\u00ad tions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic con\u00ad cepts of management; the structure and functions of organiza\u00ad tions, including comparative analysis and interorganizational relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In\u00ad depth study of specific institutional environments for administra\u00ad tive practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as lan\u00ad guages which will tend more and more to dominate professional and scholarly literature, and above all, as foundations for rele\u00ad vant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; operations research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, infor\u00ad mation sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of interper\u00ad sonal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and competence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellec\u00ad tually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethi\u00ad cal and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Master's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assess\u00ad ment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The University admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergradu\u00ad ate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only. Deadline for application is April 1. The Ph.D. program requires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other requirements, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to submit a pre\u00ad viously prepared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with back\u00ad grounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is pre\u00ad ferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate undergraduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, political science, business or public administration, mathematics, computer sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Management 311 GSM students use computing technology in virtually every course and gain a solid understanding of how computers can be effectively used as management tools. with academic strengths in disciplines riot usually considered as precursors for management (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior and development, operations research, management information sys\u00ad tems, managerial economics, finance, accounting, marketing, and strategy/policy. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 14 common core courses of the Master's degree program. In addi\u00ad tion, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realis\u00ad tic range is four to six years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for dissertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is completed when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. Master's Degree Programs GSM admits students for study leading to the Master's degrees in the fall quarter. The deadline for complt;tion of all phases of the application procedure is May I. In addition to the general Uni\u00ad versity rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM nor\u00ad mally requires the following: I. Those applicants seeking to be admitted to the M.B.A. pro\u00ad gram are required to take the Graduate Management Admis\u00ad sion Test (GMAT). 2. College-level mathematics including a course in introductory calculus, statistics with probability, and introductory com\u00ad puter programming. Applicants without adequate mathemati\u00ad cal or computer preparation may be admitted with the condi\u00ad tion that they complete preliminary courses with a grade of B or better. These courses should be completed by fall quarter, but no later than the end of the second quarter in residence. Undergraduate courses in both the social sciences (e.g., eco\u00ad nomics, political science, psychology, sociology) and informa\u00ad tion and computer sciences are strongly recommended. The Graduate School of Management offers the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree which requires a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The Master's degree program normally takes two full academic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commitments take two courses per quarter and are required to complete the Master's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours (beginning at 4:00 p.m.). There is no thesis required. The courses in the Master's degree program are divided into two groups, each group designed to achieve specific educational objectives. The courses are divided as follows: 14 required Common Core Courses and nine elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and edu\u00ad cational interests. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991312 Management Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of the junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and an M.B.A. degree after the fifth year. The ability to complete both degrees in five years may vary by academic program. Students should consult with their academic counselor in their major School for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Required Course Work Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Man\u00ad agement of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Operations Research for Management, Organizational Analysis for Management, Financial and Managerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics for Management, Macroeconom\u00ad ics for Management, Government and Public Policy, Computer and Information Systems for Management, Marketing for Man\u00ad agement, Managerial Finance I, Operations Management, Busi\u00ad ness Strategy. The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will consist of nine electives for the M.B.A. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's educational and career goals and interests. Special Opportunities To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Manage\u00ad ment Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Pro\u00ad gram through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organizational representatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encountered by the interns in their positions. Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two Universitywide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organization ' (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant pub\u00ad lic policy issues. PPRO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. Among the projects currently in progress are studies on the effec\u00ad tiveness of Federal Civil Service reforms, the use of information systems in United States and European local governments, the social and mental health impact of economic change, the effects of environmental air quality on respiratory symptoms, the inci\u00ad dence of injuries to children in auto accidents, and case studies on the problems and costs faced by new users of computer technol\u00ad ogy. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and transportation sys\u00ad tem evaluation. Recent projects have concerned the control of urban freeway traffic, strategies for highway reconstruction, sta\u00ad tistical measurement of public transit performance, the use of part-time labor in urban transit, computer simulation of house\u00ad hold travel and activity patterns, and impacts of transportation management strategies for the 1984 Olympic Games. Placement Services The GSM Placement Office, located within the School, was established to serve the unique placement needs of M.B.A. stu\u00ad dents and alumni. It has two main functions: (1) attracting a vari\u00ad ety of organizations to interview and hire graduates and (2) coun\u00ad seling students in career opportunities and the techniques neces\u00ad sary to conduct effective job searches, not only for their first jobs but throughout their careers. The relatively small size of the M.B.A. program allows considerable interaction between the Placement Office and students. Executive M.B.A. Program The Executive M.B.A. Program is designed for managers and professionals who are highly motivated toward a career in man\u00ad agement of organizations and for those currently in executive positions. It enables participants to enhance their management skills while obtaining a high-quality advanced education. Stu\u00ad dents may continue in their full-time professional roles while enrolled in the program. Limited class sizes are maintained, and all participants gain extensive work and managerial experience. The program consists of a 92-unit course of study completed on alternating Fridays and Saturdays, with three five-day residential sessions held during the 21-month sequence. Emphasis is placed on organizational and interpersonal skills; increased competence in specific management techniques; overall management training; and developing an understanding of the integration of business and the environment. - Further information may be obtained by contacting the Director, Executive M.B.A. Program, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717; telephone (714) 856-4951. Undergraduate Minor in Management The GSM faculty and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies offer an undergraduate minor in Management. The minor consists of seven courses: one lower-division introductory course and six upper-division courses. Students are eligible to apply for the minor in Management if they have completed all prerequisite courses (including Manage\u00ad ment 5) with a grade no lower than C (2.0) and have upper\u00ad division standing. Completion of the prerequisite courses does not guarantee admission to the minor in Management. Admis\u00ad sion is on a competitive basis and students must submit an appli\u00ad cation, transcripts, and a statement of purpose. The deadline for completion of the application is May I. Interested students may obtain further information from the GSM Students Affairs Office, Room 220. In establishing the GSM undergraduate minor in Management, the faculty anticipated three types of students to be drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations as a way of gaining apprecia\u00ad tion for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing UC IRVINE - 1990-1991for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of admin\u00ad istration but not a high concentration in the field, and (3) stu\u00ad dents who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guidance and undergraduate work appro\u00ad priate to this career objective. Prerequisite Courses The following are prerequisite for enrolling in the upper-division undergraduate minor courses: Management 5; Economics 12A and 12C; Mathematics 2A; one from either Mathematics 7, Mathematics 131 A-B-C, Social Sciences llA-B-C, Social Sci\u00ad ences lOOA-B-C, Social Ecology 13, Social Ecology 166A-B-C, or Civil Engineering 105.

Wynne, M.A. University of Washington, Supervisor of Teacher Education (early childhood and special education) The Office of Teacher Education is dedicated to a high level of academic scholarship in its professional programs and to excel\u00ad lence in the preparation of teachers and school administrators. The Office offers programs which lead to credentials required by those who teach or administer in the public and private schools of California. Faculty associated with the Office of Teacher Education include distinguished scholars, researchers, and authors of national or international reputation. Most faculty have themselves taught or served as administrators in public or private schools, and all have shown commitment to the continued improvement of education through the processes of professional study, the development of new approaches to teaching, and the design or publication of innovative and scholarly courses of study. The Office of Teacher Education is organized around the creden\u00ad tial programs it offers. Faculty members generally are associated with the credential programs representing their areas of expertise and interest. The programs provide opportunities for interaction among students and faculty who share common interests. Reading-Neurolinguistic Clinic The Office of Teacher Education operates a Reading\u00ad Neurolinguistic Clinic in collaboration with College of Medicine faculty. The Clinic has a mission which includes research, teach\u00ad ing, and community service. Clinic staff diagnose and treat stu-dents of all ages with moderate to severe learning disabilities. Credential candidates may attend seminars and discussions and observe advanced procedures for working with students who are \u00b7 in need of remedial instruction. The.Clinic sponsors interdisci\u00ad plinary research concerned with reading and neurolinguistic development. Credential Programs The Office of Teacher Education offers programs which lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and \u00b7Licensing Law of 1970, known generally as the Ryan Act. In addition, a program leading to the Administrative Services Credential is offered. There are two basic teaching credentials in California: the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Credential. They are called basic because all other teaching and most nonteaching cre\u00ad dentials have one of these two credentials as prerequisites. Teaching credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single sub\u00ad ject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These. creden\u00ad tials are awarded by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity ih any public school in California. Single Subject Instruction Credential \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assigning teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is commonly prac\u00ad ticed in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but normally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credentiaL Single Subject Instruction Credentials are authorized by the State of California in art, English, foreign languages, history, life science, mathemat~ ics, music, physical science, social science, as well as agriculture, business, government, health science, home economics, industrial arts, and physical education. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Edu\u00ad cation 101; Education 102A-H (students enroll in the section of their major); Education 1058; Education 105LB; Education 162 (usually taken after student teaching); Education 173; 174; Education !OIL; Education 380.

Messina Supervisor of Teacher Education Assistant Director of the Office of Teacher Education Teacher Education 319 M y most rewarding teaching experience was at a reading clinic.for disabled students in the public schools. Teaching those young\u00ad sters to read gave me the greatest satisfac\u00ad tion I have experienced as a teacher. I genuinely believe that literacy increases personal indepen\u00ad dence. Learning how to unleash a child's unlimited poten\u00ad tial is why I believe UCI Teacher Education students enjoy the reading courses that I teach, especiaily Education 105A, Curriculum and Methods for Elementary School Reading, and 105LA, Diagnostic-Prescriptive Reading Instruction. In those courses we explore methods to help students who are not responding to learning to read. Another very gratifying aspect of being a teacher is having former students come back after a couple of years and say, \"When you made me do such and such, I thought you were crazy. Now that I'm on my own and in a school dis\u00ad trict where there are no specialists, I'm finding that the things you said to do are working. I just wanted to let you know.\" It is extremely rewarding to hear students say again and again that their education at UCI prepared them for the real world. When we ask applicants to our program why they are choosing UCI, the most common response is that they either know someone who has gone through the program and recommends it or they have talked with people in the public schools who praise the \"top drawer\" quality of our graduates. We have the luxury of a good reputation, but our goal is to become even better. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991I 320 Teacher Education Multiple Subject Instruction Credential \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assigning teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teachers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades l-12 inclusive, but normally the assign\u00ad ment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential pro\u00ad gram at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education l05A; Education l05LA; Education llOA, llOB, Education 360; and Education 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Multiple Subject Credential Fall Ed l05A Winter Ed l04A Spring Ed llOC Ed llOA Ed llOB Ed Ed 173Ed 174 Ed 300A,B Ed 174 Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Credentials may apply the basic professional courses of Education lOlL, l05A, l05LA, 162, 173, 174,301,360, and 380 toward both cre\u00ad dentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, l04A, llOA, llOB, llOC; do student teaching in both areas; demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject exam\u00ad inations where needed; and pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Sin\u00ad gle Subject Credential. The stipend is paid by the school district. To serve as an intern in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a postbaccalaureate student in the Office of Teacher Education. Students should plan to interview for the intern pro\u00ad gram during the winter quarter, and seek admission to the Teacher Education program for the spring quarter to enroll in required courses before beginning their one-year internship. Intern candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the background and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particular school, and the candidate's eligibility for the University's Teacher Education pro\u00ad gram. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. Specialist Credentials The Specialist Credential authorizes teaching in the specialization area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for specialist credentials, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential (either the Single Subject or Multi\u00ad ple Subject Credential) and complete a specialized program of professional preparation in an approved program. The State of California authorizes seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agri\u00ad culture, health science, and special education. UCI offers prepa\u00ad ration for Specialist Credentials in the special education areas of the learning handicapped and the severely handicapped. Students interested in the details about Specialist Credentials should make an appointment for program counseling with the special educa\u00ad tion coordinator in the Office of Teacher Education. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for two areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped and Severely Handicapped. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence requires possession of a valid Special Education Credential, and three or more years of teaching experience, including both regular and special education teaching experience. A clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence authorizes service only if a valid Special Education Credential, other than an emergency credential, is held concur\u00ad rently. The UCI program leading to the clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence is a 16 quarter-unit program divided into four courses, and followed by an exit assessment. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a can\u00ad didate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a basic teaching credential. The UCI program is limited to the develop\u00ad ment of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second lan\u00ad guage in the Multiple Subject Credential Program. \u00b7 At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the student will complete a significant part of the specific requirements for a Bilin\u00ad gual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of prepara\u00ad .tion for the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Entry and exit examinations are required for this program. Services Credential The Ryan Act provides for five categories of nonteaching creden\u00ad tials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclass\u00ad room services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabi.litative ser\u00ad vices. UCI offers a program which leads to an Administrative Services Credential, generally required by school administrators. This credential is effective for grades K-12. The Administrative Services Credential is a two-stage credential which requires completion of 36 quarter units for a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential and completion of an addi\u00ad tional 36 quarter units for the Professional Administrative Ser\u00ad vices Credential. Prerequisites for the Preliminary Administrative Services Credential include a basic teaching credential, three years of acceptable full-time teaching experience, completion of Educa\u00ad tion 162 (or its equivalent), and a passing score on the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Prerequisites for the Professional Administrative Credential include two years of successful full\u00ad time school administrative experience in public schools requiring the Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is valid for five years while the candidate studies for the Professional Credential. Students interested in these credentials should make an appointment with a counselor in the .office of Teacher Education. Planning a Program of Study Any credential program can be completed with one year of full-. time postbaccalaureate study, but it is possible for students to pursue a credential in their undergraduate program. All students interested in pursuing a credential should contact an academic counselor in Teacher Education. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Office of Teacher Education program requires two field experiences prior to entering the program. One such experience might be a tutoring assignment during the freshman or sopho\u00ad more year and another might be serving as a teacher's aide in the junior year. Several options are available for course credit (Ed 100A, 100B, 100C) for this field experience. Such field experience programs may be cooperative arrangements between the Univer\u00ad sity and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers. However, field experience can come from any of several public or private agencies which provide instruction so long as students work under the supervision of an experienced teacher. As a tutor, the college student usually works with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the stu\u00ad dent typically works for a block of time per week for one quarter with a teacher in the classroom. During this time, students are given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the class\u00ad room. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teaching are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI student in making a more realistic career choice. It also involves the public school in the selection of future student teachers. Preparation for Admission Students are required to (I) pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) prior to applying for admission to Teacher Education and (2) successfully complete the National Teacher Examination (NTE) or four-fifths of an approved waiver pro\u00ad gram prior to beginning their student teaching (normally by the second quarter of enrollment). Reservations to take both examinations must be made well in advance. Students are urged to contact the Office of Teacher Education for information about the tests and test dates six months before they plan to enter the program. Admission to the Teacher Education Program All students are welcome to apply for admission to the Teacher Education program. Students are usually admitted twice a year, in the fall and spring quarters. Information and an application for admission are available from the Office of Teacher Education, 422 Social Science Tower. Admission is based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a. grade point average of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the Teacher Education program at UCI. (Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to credentials still must be admitted to a fifth year of study-to be described later.) Two official transcripts from each college attended are required. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a Cer\u00ad tificate of Clearance from the Commission on Teacher Creden\u00ad tialing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is prim\u00ad arily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this process. Interview. An Admissions Committee is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have a personal interview with a member or members of the Committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation for admission are required. Such recommendations should indicate the student's ability to perform graduate-level work. CBEST. Evidence of having passed the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test should accompany the application for admission. Teacher Education 321 Admission. Both the UCI academic department corresponding to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Educatibn. Admission is not automatic. Minimum Requirements for the Basic Teaching Credential The minimum requirements for the teaching credential in Cali\u00ad fornia are established by California state law. Requirements include: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than pro\u00ad fessional education, from an approved institution. 2. A fifth-year approved program of professional preparation. This means a sequence of education courses, including an all-day, full-time assignment of a semester's duration (or the equivalent) in student teaching. 3. Passage of the National Teacher Exam or its waiver via an approved academic program. Information on waivers is available from Office of Teacher Education counselors. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. (Industrial arts, physical education, music, art, and home economics are exempt from this requirement.) 6. A course or an examination covering the U.S. Constitution. 7. A fifth year of study is still required, even though a student may elect to start or complete the approved program of pro\u00ad fessional preparation as an undergraduate. 8. Successful completion of the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants are required to pass this test prior to application for admission. 9. A grade point average of B or better in all required educa\u00ad tion courses. 10. A grade of B or better in all student teaching or required field experience. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation The \"Approved Program\" refers to the minimum number of education courses required for the teaching credential. UCI defines the approved program as consisting of core courses plus student teaching. Six quarter units of this instruction are required in the teaching of reading. Passage of a Subject Matter Examination Single Subject Examinations. California requires all students to pass the National Teacher Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching major prior to student teaching except where particular institutions have developed an approved major which waives the NTE. Students pursuing a waiver option must complete four\u00ad fifths of the waiver prior to student teaching. Many academic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teacher Examination. How\u00ad ever, there are certain requirements that a student must complete while fulfilling the major in order to receive this waiver. Students should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991I 322 Teacher Education Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teaching authoriza\u00ad tions beyond the single subject major. Students deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: I. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for details. 2. Students may pass the National Teacher Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional author\u00ad ization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. The National Teacher Examina\u00ad tion General Knowledge section of the Core Battery is a require\u00ad ment for the multiple subject credential. It includes the following areas: English, fine arts, mathematics, science, and social science. All students must pass the NTE prior to beginning student teach\u00ad ing or must complete at least four-fifths of a waiver program. The UCI program for the Multiple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the student completes the required diversified program. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. Requirements for Waiver of the Multiple Subject National Teacher Examination. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, advanced composi\u00ad tion, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three approved courses in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy Since the academic major on the UCI campus will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four requirements is possible if planned early in the student's career. Fifth-Year Requirement The UCI Teacher Education program defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted, or postbaccalaureate-level work. In each instance the fifth year will consist of a program, individually determined and based upon the assessed needs of the student. Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a professional clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: I. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 301, Classroom Applications of Computer Technologies c. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commitment d. Education\u00b7 380, Health Education for Teachers The Intern Teaching Credential Program, under the direction of Carolyn Bouldin, Ed. D., is one of the options for fulfilling student teaching requirements. Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Student teaching is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for 18 weeks (or its equivalent) in the appropriate classroom training environment. Regular seminars are held as part of the total student teaching program. Evaluation is based on performance, excellence in instruction, and professional maturity, factors which are assessed by the resident teacher, the University supervisor, and the candidate. A grade of B or better is required in student teaching in order for a student to be recommended for a teaching credential. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other requirements are met, the student qualifies for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. Multiple Subject Instruction candidates are assigned to teach in grades K-8. The assignment is split to include two levels within this range. Student teaching for Multiple Subject candidates con\u00ad sists of assignments with increasing levels of responsibility in each assignment. Single Subject Instruction candidates are assigned in grades 7-12. This assignment is split to include two levels within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day for a full semester (or its equivalent), the same as is required of the regular teacher; student teaching experience includes faculty meetings, parent conferences, and sponsorship of events. The intern teaching program, described earlier, provides another option for fulfilling student teaching requirements. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to gua\u00ad rantee that each student will have student teaching experience in a multi-or cross-cultural situation. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the Certificate of Clearance, a current health clearance, academic preparation clearances, and successful completion of either the National UC IRVINE - 1990-1991Teacher Examination (NTE) or four-fifths of an approved waiver program. A student must apply for a student teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for appropriate information. Preliminary, Professional Clear, and Life Credentials Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the baccalaureate, the professional education sequence, a course in the teaching of read\u00ad ing, student teaching, completion of the Introduction to Educa\u00ad tional Technology requirement, a course or examination covering the U.S. Constitution, a passing score on the California Basic Educational Skills Test, and by passing the National Teacher Examination or completing an approved waiver as required by the Ryan Act. Under the present program, a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. However, the fifth year must be completed within five years after the pre\u00ad liminary credential is issued. A certificate of completion is awarded to students satisfactorily completing requirements for a credential. The Professional Clear Credential. The Professional Clear Creden\u00ad tial cannot be awarded by the State until the completion of (a) a baccalaureate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential. The Life Credential is no longer awarded in California. Professional Clear Credential holders will be required to meet professional growth requirements as a condition for renewing this credential.

Professor of Medicine I think UCI is one of the most exciting campuses in the world. In fact, ~.\u00b7f I were a student today, I really couldn't think of any better university to come to. That's true for several reasons. We're in a very nice geographic location, and we're part of the 122-year\u00ad old University of California system. But we have some\u00ad thing here that a lot of campuses don't have. We have a real sense of excitement. We're building. And every student who comes through has a chance to put another brick in the wall. At the older, more established campuses it's hard for students to make a real contribution-people come and go and hardly leave a dent. Well, that's not as true here. The campus is new and it's growing, and everybody has an opportunity to make a very significant contribution. We are beginning to build a tradition at UCI, that is, a basic pride in what the campus is all about and in what its accomplishments have been, as well as pride in where it is going. I think when students contribute to that building process, everyone comes away a little bit better. If you can do something creative as a student, it gives you satisfaction you'll have the rest of your life, as well as a feeling of commitment to the campus that doesn't end the day after you receive your degree. I think our students have that kind of opportunity.

Ziemba, M.D. University of California, Davis, Assistant Clini- cal Professor of Medicine (Internal Medicine) The UCI College of Medicine became part of the University of California in 1965. Prior to this time it was known as the Califor\u00ad nia College of Medicine, a private institution founded in 1896. The College is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and prac\u00ad tice of medicine for the benefit of society. This mission is being achieved through the accomplishment of the following com ple\u00ad mentary and synergistic objectives: Scholarly research of the highest quality to further the under\u00ad standing of human biology and the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Education of physicians who meet the highest standards of profes\u00ad sional competence and achievement. Development of scholars in the clinical and basic sciences who will assume leadership roles in medical practice, education, and research. Provision of high-quality medical care to patients through the UCI Clinical Services System that will serve as a model of excellence. Dissemination of the results of advances in medical research and practice. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991338 College of Medicine Health Sciences Complex The medical school facilities comprise a 121-acre site which has been designated the Health Sciences Complex. Twenty-nine acres have been developed to provide space for teaching, research, and patient care as well as offices for departmental administration. The College's basic science instructional programs are located in modern, well-equipped, medical sciences buildings. These units provide space for first-and second-year classes, lecture halls, offices and laboratories for various basic and clinical depart\u00ad 'ments, and a student center. Other buildings house the College's administration, laboratories, and the Biomedical Sciences Library. Faculty from the Departments of Pharmacology, Biological Chemistry, and Psychiatry and Human Behavior, and the Univer\u00ad sity of California Southern Occupational Health Center share laboratory space with corporate researchers in a building adja\u00ad cent to the College. This facility also houses the headquarters of the Whitby Research and Development Company, a private pharmaceutical development research firm, which is a subsidiary of the Ethyl Corporation. In addition, the 40,000-square-foot Hitachi Chemical Research Center, which was completed in spring 1990, is devoted to basic research in the fields of neurological disorders, diagnostic systems and reagents, and industrial bioreactors. Comprehensive outpatient services are available on campus through the UCI Medical Plaza and the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic. Housing one of the world's leading programs in medical laser technology, the Beckman Laser Clinic offers state-of-the-art treatment for cancer of the head, neck, and female reproductive system and for cardiovascular disease. The UCI Medical Plaza capitalizes upon the broad range of diag\u00ad nostic and therapeutic programs of the College as well as the extensive clinical expertise of the faculty. The facility offers ser\u00ad vices in a variety of specialties, including internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, ophthalmol\u00ad ogy, cardiology, orthopedics, gastroenterology, and neurology. Special programs in diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and inflamma\u00ad tory bowel diseases also are available. Also located in the Plaza is the Lon V. Smith Eye Clinic, which offers the latest in diagnostic health care for eye diseases, including computerized refraction analysis, glaucoma diagnosis, and ultrasound analysis of eye disorders. Clinical Services System Medical services offered by the College are provided through the UCI Clinical Services System. This System comprises the UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) in Orange, one community clinic in Santa Ana, another clinic in Anaheim, and numerous affiliated hospitals and clinics located in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernar\u00ad dino, and Kern Counties. It incorporates the talents and broad range of medical expertise of more than 450 full-time clinical faculty of the .College as well as approximately 1,800 community physicians who serve as voluntary faculty. The purposes of the UCI Clinical Services System are to serve the community and to maintain an environment of excellence in medical education and research. At UCIMC the College offers students and residents a full range of clinical education and research activities, from primary care to the most technical sub\u00ad specialties. The community clinics offer primary, continuity-of\u00ad care medicine, and the College's affiliated hospitals and clinics round out the educational program. Together, these facilities offer opportunities for clinical training in specific specialties and exposure to a wide range of patient populations for more than 600 resident physicians, 184 third-and fourth-year medical stu\u00ad dents, and numerous allied health and nursing students. Third-and fourth-year medical students rotate through 13 clerk\u00ad ships, in areas ranging from pediatrics to ophthalmology, to gain clinical experience. As major providers of medical care, the institutions of the UCI Clinical Services System play a critical role in meeting the health care needs of four Southern California counties. The College has one of the largest training programs for primary care physicians in the United States, and its clinical programs in burns, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, psychiatry, obstetrics, infectious disease, perinatology, and trauma are recognized across the country. UCI Medical Center The University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCIMC), located in the City of Orange, is a 493-bed, comprehensive medi\u00ad cal care center. It is the principal clinical facility of the College of Medicine operated by the University. The medical faculty of the College of Medicine, together with the medical resident-physician staff, provide the professional care at UCIMC. Services are pro\u00ad vided in medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, dermatology, pathology, radiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, neurology, and anesthesiology. UCIMC also has cardiac, pediatric, neonatal, respiratory, burn, and medical-surgical intensive care units, and more than 90 specialty outpatient clinics. UCIMC is the desig\u00ad nated countywide Level I tertiary trauma referral center. A major capital improvement program at UCIMC includes the construction of new intensive care units for medical, surgical, and cardiac patients. In addition, the lobby, pathology laboratories, and general medical floors are being upgraded. The construction of a 92-bed psychiatric hospital to replace the existing psychiatric facility also is planned. The UCI Medical Pavilion, a companion facility to the UCI Medical Plaza on campus houses multi\u00ad specialty care facilities. It is also the interim site for the UCI Clin\u00ad ical Cancer Center while construction progresses on a 56,000- UC IRVINE - 1990-1991square foot facility for comprehensive outpatient cancer care. Upon completion in 1991, the center will encompass all of the basic and clinical subspecialties involved in adult and pediatric oncology; including ~pecialized medical, nursing, and ancillary care necessary to diagnose and manage patients with cancer. UCI-Community Clinic of Orange County The Community Clinic of Orange County (CCOC) is located in the City of Santa Ana and is the home of the Refugee Preventive Health Service Program and the Urban Health Initiative Program which are overseen by the Department of Family Medicine. eeoc provides training for medical students in their primary care rotations as well as for first-, second-, and third-year year Family Medicine residents.

Introduction to the Clerkships This course combines information from several departments to familiarize the student with the clinical experience. It is a major link in the student's transition from basic science courses to the clinical clerkships. Following this course students will be prepared to commence practical work and begin their clinical clerkships. Third and Fourth Years: Clinical Sciences The clinical experience is composed of (a) core clerkship rota\u00ad tions, with a specific allotment of time in each department and (b) electives. Sequencing of clerkships is determined by a student lottery conducted by the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs. Clerkships Anesthesiology . During the one-week required core clerkship, students spend time observing the anesthetic management of patients in the operating room. They are instructed in the basic principles of airway man\u00ad agement, preoperative evaluation of patients, and pharmacology of routine anesthetic and basic resuscitative drugs. A four-week, fourth year elective is offered at UCIMC and the Veteran's Administration Medical Center, Long Beach (VAMCLB). Students participate in supervised hands-on pati<;nt care in the operating room and gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia. In addition, students are expected to attend weekly lectures and clinical conferences which are devoted to presentations and discussions of interesting cases and complications. A four-week rotation through the VAMCLB Surgical Intensive Care Unit and an eight-week research rotation also are offered. Junior Medicine Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses. The intent is that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diagnosis and therapy, students will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Expe\u00ad rience is provided with common medical procedures such as lum\u00ad bar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The stu\u00ad dent is expected to assume increasing responsibility for hospital\u00ad ized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. Senior Medicine Students spend five weeks as subinterns during which time they carry the full ward responsibility of an intern on one-half the number of patients usually carried by an intern. Neurosciences The clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the development of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medi\u00ad cal and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology During this clerkship, students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiology, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical experience is offered in the management of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and surgical gyne\u00ad cology. Students who have completed an introductory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that allows a progres\u00ad sion of clinical responsibility both in operative obstetrics and College of Medicine 343 office gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Ophthalmology The core clerkship provides instruction in the basis of ophthal\u00ad moscopy, slit lamp examination, visual function testing, and management of emergency eye problems. Electives from one to four weeks may be taken in clinical suites, with exposure to oph\u00ad thalmic surgery and emergency eye care. Pediatrics The pediatrics clerkship serves as an introduction to general pediatrics. Students rotate through the pediatric ward, the pediat\u00ad ric outpatient clinic, and the newborn nursery. During the clerk\u00ad ship, students are expected to refine their knowledge and skills in obtaining accurate historical data, performing physical examina\u00ad tions with pediatric patients, and developing appropriate diag\u00ad noses and management plans. Subspecialty clinics and commu\u00ad nity pediatric experiences also are included in the clerkship. The session also offers insight into the natural history of diseases associated with pediatric patients and stresses the relationship of the health of infants, children, and adolescents with regard to the integrity of the family unit. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, stu\u00ad dents are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are discussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physical techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which perman\u00ad ently affect this process. Primary Care This unique clerkship matches students with a primary care phy\u00ad sician for the entire third year. Each student attends a UCI clinic or a private physician's office for a half day per week where the principles of primary care practice are taught. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a number of patients and continues to care for them throughout the clerkship. Psychiatry The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and conferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, substance abuse, child psychiatry, con\u00ad sultation psychiatry, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. A required lecture series is presented on Tuesday afternoons at UCIMC. Radiology Radiological sciences involves the diagnostic use of imaging and the therapeutic effect of radiation upon abnormal lesions in the body. Radiological sciences is taught throughout the four years of medical school: during the anatomy course in the first year, in the \"Mechanisms of Disease\" course the second year, as a required clerkship in the third year, and as an elective in the fourth year. The Department has specialists in all subspecialty areas of radi\u00ad ology (nuclear medicine, ultrasound, computerized tomography, UC IRVINE - 1990-1991344 College of Medicine magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy) and the general diag\u00ad nostic areas of radiology (chest, bone, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary). There are daily clinical film conferences with staff and residents. The American College of Radiology film learning laboratory is available for student use. There are daily seminars interrelating general medicine, surgery, and radiology. Emphasis is given to the use of all forms of imaging for diagnosis and treatment including an understanding of the risk/benefit ratios involved and the clinical indications for various radiologic procedures. Surgery The surgical clerkship provides students an opportunity to study surgical patients in outpatient and hospital settings as members of the surgical team. Students acquire surgical knowledge, as well as develop skills in taking medical histories and conducting phys\u00ad ical examinations. Emphasis is placed on the clinical evaluation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of surgical diseases. Surgical Specialties The objective of the surgical specialties clerkship is to provide an opportunity for students to expand their skills and knowledge in the surgical field. Students are required to complete six weeks of surgical specialties including urology, plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and otolaryngology. Electives A total of 24 weeks in the medical curriculum are allotted for elective time. Sixteen of those weeks are nondesignated electives, and students, depending upon their particular interests, needs, and goals, may take a variety of elective courses consisting of at least 30 contact-hours per week beginning in the fourth year. In addition, five weeks are devoted to medically related electives which may include pediatrics or family medicine, and three weeks are devoted to surgically related electives which may include anesthesiology or obstetrics and gynecology. Electives must be approved by the clinical faculty advisor and the department chair. Students may take up to 12 weeks of electives at institutions other than UCI. A listing of elective courses and descriptions can be found in the Elective Book, which is available from the Office of Curricular Affairs (on campus), and the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs at the UCI Medical Center. All questions regarding the curriculum, electives, or matters of records should be directed to: Curricular Affairs Office Medical Sciences I, Room E120 College of Medicine University of California Irvine, CA 92717 (714) 856-5282 Office of Student and Curricular Affairs The Office of Student and Curricular Affairs provides the day-to\u00ad day link between medical students and the academic and admin\u00ad istrative functions of the College.

In addition to providing general services to all students, the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs is responsive to the unique concerns of women, minority, disadvantaged, and non\u00ad traditional students. Such services include the following programs: The Summer Pre-Entry Program introduces newly accepted minority and/or disadvantaged students to the type and volume of study materials they will encounter in medical school. The program is intended to help students adjust to the professional school setting, meet new classmates, become acquainted with the surrounding communities, and get situated with living accommo\u00ad dations. The rigorous, highly scheduled, six-week summer pro\u00ad gram is designed to prepare entering students to succeed in the regular medical school curriculum, which begins in September. On-campus housing during the regular academic year is provided to students who qualify according to Federal Health Careers Opportunity Program guidelines. The Summer Premedical Program seeks to increase the number of minority and/or disadvantaged students who are accepted into medical school and who successfully complete their medical edu\u00ad cation. The program achieves this goal by providing participants with the special skills and prerequisites needed to become more competitive for entrance into a health professional school. The program is conducted on the UCI campus from early July to mid-August. Participants are provided with room and board paid by a grant from the Federal Health Careers Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram. Undergraduate students entering their second year in col\u00ad leges and universities are encouraged to apply. Individuals who show a commitment to ultimately practicing in medically under\u00ad served areas are given highest priority. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Postbaccalaureate Program is a one-to two-year program aimed at increasing the number of minority and/or disadvan\u00ad taged students who are accepted into medical school by assisting individuals who have been unsuccessful in earlier attempts to gain admission. During Phase I of the program, which is conducted from July to September, students are offered an intense Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) preparation. Students review the .science areas of the exam and receive training in reading, writing, and quantitative skills. Room and board are provided during this phase. During Phase II of the program, students are enrolled in undergraduate courses that supplement and review the premedical science requirements. They also have the opportunity to participate in research projects with faculty members. The National Board Review Course is designed to assist minority and/or disadvantaged students who have been unable to pass Part I of the National Board Examination. The course, offered for six weeks during August and September, provides each stu\u00ad dent with an extensive package of content review materials and room and board. Routine examinations and review sessions in each of the basic sciences are given. Lectures are conducted by medical school faculty who are nationally recognized experts in the subjects reviewed. Lectures on other topics such as study skills, note-and test-taking skills, time management, and test anxiety reduction are also offered. Postgraduate Educational Programs Residency Programs The College of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals offer more than 600 residency positions in almost all areas of medicine. Training levels range from first-year residencies through sixth\u00ad and seventh-year levels and subspecialty fellowships. Inquiries about specific programs should be directed to the Program Direc\u00ad tor as listed in the Directory of Residency Training Programs, pub\u00ad lished each year by the American Medical Association, or to the chair of the appropriate College of Medicine department. All residency programs meet the formal standards of the Ameri\u00ad can Medical Association and the appropriate specialty boards. UCI adheres to the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976, P.L. 94-484, Section 709, regarding shared-schedule residency training positions. Residents in all programs rotate to the UCI Medical Center at some time. Residents in anesthesiology, dermatology, diagnostic radiology, therapeutic radiology, medicine, neurology, ophthal\u00ad mology, pathology, surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and psychiatry also rotate to the Veterans Administration Medi\u00ad cal Center, Long Beach (VAMCLB). Residents in medicine, fam\u00ad ily medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmol\u00ad ogy, pathology, pediatrics, physical medicine and rehabilitation, diagnostic radiology, surgery, and therapeutic radiology also rotate to the Memorial Hospital Medical Center (MHMC), Long Beach. Residents may also spend periods of time at other affil\u00ad iated hospitals and clinics. Anesthesiology The Anesthesiology Residency Program offers training for resi\u00ad dents at the postgraduate PG-2 to PG-4 levels. The residents spend three years in intensive clinical anesthesia training at VAMCLB, San Bernardino County Medical Center, and UCI Medical Center, with a one-month rotation at Children's Hos\u00ad pital of Los Angeles and a month of cardiac anesthesia at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Los. Angeles).

Residents in their fourth postgraduate year may elect to take three to six months of subspecialty training in obstetrical anesthesia, critical care medicine, pediatric anesthesia, pain management, or research. Community and Environmental Medicine (Occupational Medicine) This residency program is offered by the Division of Occupa\u00ad tional Medicine, Department of Community and Environmental Medicine. It is intended for physicians who are seeking certifica\u00ad tion by the Board of Preventive Medicine. A prerequisite to par\u00ad ticipation is a minimum of one year of postgraduate clinical training in a primary care discipline. The objective of the Pro\u00ad gram is the training of physicians in the fields of occupational medicine and industrial medical care. The resident is provided an academic foundation in occupational medicine, industrial hygiene, environmental toxicology, and epidemiology, in addition to practical experience in preventive medicine as it is applied to employed persons. This two-year program includes didactic train\u00ad ing and clinical and field experience in occupational health and safety. Upon completion of training, the resident is qualified to enter the specialty practice of occupational medicine in an indus\u00ad trial setting, in private practice, in a government agency, or in an academic institution. Dermatology The Dermatology Residency Program provides a strong founda\u00ad tion in clinical dermatology, as well as experience in investigative dermatology. All areas of dermatologic care and its subspecialties are included in the three-year Program. The Program integrates the activities of outpatient and inpatient facilities of the VAMCLB, the UCI Medical Center, faculty offices, and other clinical settings. Family Medicine The Family Practice Residency Program aspires to train compe\u00ad tent family physicians who are prepared for practice in a setting of economic, ethnic, and cultural diversity. The program com\u00ad bines strong clinical rotations with ongoing training in family medicine that emphasizes behavioral medicine, cross-cultural medicine, preventive medicine, and practice management. Interest in health care for the medically underserved is encouraged. Internal Medicine The Department of Medicine's Residency Program is fully approved for three to five years of training by the American Medical Association's Council on Medical Education and Hospitals. The resident positions are divided into a traditional three-year track (the majority of positions), a primary care track, a one\u00ad year-only program (one position), and a combined medicine/pe\u00ad diatrics program. Residents spend the majority of their time at the UCI Medical Center. They also rotate to Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach; the VA Medical Center, Long Beach; and Kaiser Hospital, Bellflower. Teaching is done primarily by full-time faculty within the Department of Medicine. Subspecialty fellowships are offered in clinical immunology, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, nephrology, primary care, pulmonary disease, and rheumatology. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991346 College of Medicine Medicine/Pediatrics (Combined Residency Program) The Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine offer a four-year combined residency in medicine and pediatrics. This program was developed to blend two of the major specialities of medicine to allow residents to gain an in-depth understanding of both dis\u00ad ciplines. This combined residency is expected to produce physi\u00ad cians who are capable of full-time practice in either discipline. Graduates are eligible for Board certification in both internal medicine and pediatrics. Neurology The Neurology Residency Program emphasizes the education and training of neurologists to meet the clinical needs of their patients by using both traditional methods and new techniques, some of which have been developed at the UCI Medical Center. Training takes the form of graded responsibility for inpatient care, regular outpatient clinical responsibilities, and rotations in associated neurological specialties. The Department strongly believes that an understanding of basic research methods is essential for the train\u00ad ing of clinicians who will deal with the diversity of clinical prob\u00ad lems in modern neurology. Thus, during the three-year training program, residents have the opportunity to participate in a vari\u00ad ety of ongoing basic and clinical research projects within the Department. Obstetrics and Gynecology This four-year program provides a solid foundation of reproduc\u00ad tive pathophysiology in the obstetric, gynecologic, endocrino\u00ad logic, and oncologic aspects of women's health care. Based on this foundation, training continues with progressive resident responsibility for operative and medical management and surgical techniques. While predominantly clinical in scope, the program is strongly flavored by academic and research exposure. Training is provided in general obstetrics and gynecology with rotations in the subspecialties of perinatology, oncology, and endocrinology. There are seven resident positions available each year. Ophthalmology The three-year Ophthalmology Residency Program includes clini\u00ad cal experience with opportunities for basic research. The Department focuses on the total care of the patient. Experience is provided in a broad spectrum of disease and/or injuries and the full range of subspecialties as a result of the quality and diversity of teaching hospital facilities and faculties available to the resident. Pathology The Department of Pathology offers a residency training pro\u00ad gram covering all areas of anatomic and clinical pathology. The program is affiliated with Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach. The training for the combined anatomic and clinical pathology program consists of six months training in both anatomic and clinical pathology each year. The first two years consist of a core program providing exposure to each of the subspecialty areas of clinical pathology as well as surgical pathology, autopsy pathol\u00ad ogy, and cytopathology. The program is flexible to permit con\u00ad centrated study in one of the subspecialties of clinical pathology or in straight anatomic pathology during the last two years. Ample opportunities for research and teaching exist for individ\u00ad uals wishing an academic career. The opportunity for excellent preparation is also provided for individuals planning on a private practice in a community hospital. Pediatrics The Pediatric Residency Program emphasizes the interrelation\u00ad ship of patient care, didactic teaching, and research in the train\u00ad ing of the pediatric resident physician. The focus of the Depart\u00ad ment is on the total care of the child from birth through young adulthood. A strong clinical and educational foundation is pro\u00ad vided through experiences in a broad spectrum of disease and/or injury as well as training in biosocial pediatrics, preventive health care, and community resources. The program offers variety and depth due to the diversity of the Department's two major teaching hospitals-the UCI Medical Center and the Miller Children's Hospital (located at Memorial Hospital Medical Center, Long Beach). The faculty at these insti\u00ad tutions provide a comprehensive teaching program in general pediatrics and cover the full range of pediatric subspecialties. The care of children seen through the two hospitals represents a cross\u00ad section of racial, cultural, and socioeconomic groups from a local population of more than 2.5 million. Thus, pediatric residents are exposed to a wide range of problems presented in settings ranging from intensive care to supervised office-based practice. The Pediatric Primary Care Training Program is for residents who are particularly interested in practicing or teaching primary care pediatrics. The program blends an emphasis on ambulatory, continuous, primary pediatric care with training in traditionally underemphasized subspecialty areas such as learning and lan\u00ad guage disabilities, adolescent medicine, genetics and genetic coun\u00ad seling, and community medicine. It is designed to produce top caliber pediatricians who have the special skills essential to prim\u00ad ary care practice. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation The Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation offers both a four-year combined internship-residency and a three-year residency for applicants who have had training in another field. The focus of both programs is on the diagnosis and comprehen\u00ad sive treatment and care of patients with neuromusculoskeletal or cardiopulmonary disabilities, from newborns to the elderly. Resi\u00ad dents are also involved in research and medical student teaching. Psychiatry The Psychiatry Residency Program is a four-year program that fosters individuality, academic excellence, and broad patient experience. The core curriculum includes basic seminars, adult inpatient and outpatient psychiatry, child psychiatry, medicine, neurology, emergency psychiatry, consultation and liaison psychi\u00ad atry, forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and substance abuse. Residents spend time at the UCI Medical Center, private facilities, VAMCLB, and a State hospital, all of which provide a broad base and mix of experience in psychopathology. A wide variety of elective courses and experiences are available in this flexible, eclectic program. All residents are expected to complete a research project of high quality prior to completion of the program. Radiological Sciences (Diagnostic Radiology) The Department of Radiological Sciences has 28 residents train\u00ad ing for certification in diagnostic radiology. The program is based at the UCI Medical Center and integrated with VAMCLB, and MHMC. Residents rotate through all three institutions. The objectives of the program are (l) to provide individuals with a solid background in all modalities of imaging, (2) to provide an atmosphere conducive to research ahd to encourage opportunities for residents to participate in research work with physicians and scientists, and (3) to provide elective periods in which residents UC IRVINE - 1990-1991College of Medicine 347 r )\\ ,, ,, The UCI Medical Center is nationally recognized for its burn center and its expertise in the surgical replantation of severed limbs. In addition, it has the only Level I trauma referral center in Orange County. can work in given areas of the Department to increase their expertise or work on research projects during their residency training. The residency program includes specialized training in interven\u00ad tional radiology, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computer\u00ad ized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, as well as opportunities to participate in major research programs conducted jn the Department. All residents are expected to com\u00ad plete at least one major paper during the program. Candidates are accepted only at the postgraduate-2 level for a four-year program. Fellowships are available for an additional year in specialized areas following the successful completion of the residency. The newest technologies in the field of radiological sciences are available at UCI Medical Center and the College's affiliated institutions. Radiological Sciences (Therapeutic Radiology) The Residency Training Program in Therapeutic Radiology is designed to prepare suitably qualified applicants for careers in radiation oncology. Candidates enter a four-year program which includes one year of research experience. Unique opportunities exist for training in the use of interstitial and intracavitary treat\u00ad ment using radioactive isotopes and specially designed applica\u00ad tors. Elective rotation periods may be spent in related branches of medicine (e.g., medical oncology, surgical pathology, gynecologic oncology, etc.) or at other radiation therapy departments. The Program includes obligatory rotations at five participating hos\u00ad pitals: UCI Medical Center, VAMCLB, MHMC, City of Hope National Medical Center, and St. Joseph Hospital. Radiological Sciences (Nuclear Medicine) Candidates who wish to obtain certification for the Board of Nuclear Medicine or who wish to have further training in nuclear medicine must have completed the required period of prior resi\u00ad dency training in either diagnostic radiology, internal medicine, or pathology. The Nuclear Medicine Training Program involves one or two years and includes clinical and basic science components. It is a joint program with rotations at UCI Medical Center and VAMCLB. Didactic lecture series include physics, instrumenta\u00ad tion, radiopharmacy computer principles, and radiation protec\u00ad tion. All trainees are expected to be involved in some degree of research during the program. Surgery The philosophy underlying all aspects of surgical training is that surgery is best learned, taught, and practiced as applied clinical physiology. Operative techniques and applied anatomy receive appropriate attention. Major portions of clinical experience, teaching, conferences, research, and patient care are oriented toward understanding and correcting disordered human biology. The surgical specialty involves more years of training than other medical disciplines due to the breadth of diseases and complexity of pathophysiology involved in surgery. The Department offers residencies in general surgery, neurological surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology (head and neck) surgery, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, and urology. It also offers fellowships in burn surgery, hand surgery, and surgical research. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991348 College of Medicine Graduate Academic Programs The College's basic medical science departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics participate jointly with the School of Biological Sciences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences.

Ribak: Neurocytology; immunocytochemistry; neurotransmit- ters; Molecular genetics of extracellular matrix molecules John E. Swett: Peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, pain mechanisms Yasuhiro Torigoe: Visual and vestibular regulation of eye movements The Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the ' neurosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, intracellular physiology, molecular neurobiology, forebrain organization and development, and structure and function of sensory and motor systems. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following techniques: of neuro\u00ad scientific data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous interdisciplinary techniques. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative and fundamental research. The second goal is to gain the knowledge and ability to teach graduate, undergradu\u00ad ate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modern neurobiology, with an emphasis on morphology, chemistry, and physiology. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in neuroanat\u00ad omy and physiology, including a year-long course in neural sci\u00ad ence techniques. In the second year, students take a year-long course in neural systems as well as biochemistry and pharmacol\u00ad ogy courses. Over the usual four-year training period, the student will be required to complete a practical course in statistics, selected departmental seminar courses, at least two laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiol\u00ad ogy or other departments on campus may also be taken; research and training in areas other than neurobiology are possible. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. The emphasis of the graduate program in Anatomy and Neuro\u00ad biology is on research, and a student's participation in laboratory research begins in the first week of graduate study. Students rotate through at least two laboratories during the first two years. By the end of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the disser\u00ad tation research. A two-part qualifying examination at the end of the fall quarter of the third year is given to the student by a Can\u00ad didacy Committee. The first part consists of a written examina\u00ad tion in three of the following areas: molecular and neuro\u00ad science, ral systems-motor, and neural systems-other. The second part consists of an oral examination. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Dissertation Committee. The majority of the third and fourth year is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Dissertation Committee constitutes the final exami\u00ad nation. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded fol\u00ad lowing completion of all the requirements, a process that nor\u00ad mally will take four years to complete. Information on specific course descriptions in anatomy can be found in the School of Biological Sciences section. Biological Chemistry Faculty Ralph A.

Wasmuth: Regulation of amino acid metabolism; mammalian cell genetics Graduate instruction and research in molecular and cellular bio\u00ad chemistry leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences is offered by the Department of Biological Chemistry in the College of Medi\u00ad cine. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for creative UC IRVINE - 1990-1991and productive careers in academic science and biotechnology. Faculty research interests focus on the regulation of gene expres\u00ad sion (RNA splicing, mammalian chromosomal organization, and nucleic acid-protein interactions) and the regulation of cellular processes (membrane-hormone interactions, regulation of protein synthesis, molecular genetics of metabolic processes, and intracel\u00ad lular protein localization). Students are exposed to technical expertise in all facets of current research in molecular biochemis\u00ad try from protein chemistry to genetic engineering. In the first year, emphasis is placed on immediate research partic\u00ad ipation, supported by formal course work in protein and nucleic acid chemistry and function, enzymology, biological regulatory mechanisms, cell biology, and somatic cell and molecular genet\u00ad ics. Initial laboratory experiences are achieved by rotation through several laboratories with selection of an advisor occur\u00ad ring at the end of the first year. Student competence and critical thinking in the molecular aspects of biological sciences are tested by comprehensive examination following the first year of study. At the beginning of the third year, students take the advancement-to-candidacy examination for the Ph.D. degree by presenting and defending a proposal for specific dissertation research. Completion of the Ph.D. degree normally requires five years. Applicants for admission are expected to be well-prepared in the biological and chemical sciences. Graduate Record Examination General Test and Biology or Chemistry Subject Test scores are required. Information on course descriptions may be found in the School of Biological Sciences section.

Shank, Graduate Program Director: Biochemical mechanisms in toxic tissue injury with emphasis on chemical carcinogenesis; application of tools of molecular biology to study cytotoxicity The Department of Community and Environmental Medicine provides training in environmental toxicology, culminating with the award of the degree of Master of Science or Doctor of Phi\u00ad losophy in Environmental Toxicology. The Program in Environ\u00ad mental Toxicology provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary and appropriate to teach and/or conduct basic and applied research programs in inhalation/pulmonary toxicol\u00ad ogy, environmental carcinogenesis, biochemical neurotoxicology, and toxicokinetics. College of Medicine 349 Toxicology involves scientific study of the entry, distribution, bio\u00ad transformation, and mechanism of action of chemical agents harmful to the body. The Program interprets environmental toxi\u00ad cology as the study of the effects and mechanisms of action of hazardous chemicals in food, air, water, and soil, in the home, workplace, and community, and considers experimentally and theoretically such diverse research problems as: (I) new scientific approaches to toxicological evaluation of environmental chemi\u00ad cals such as air and water pollutants, food additives, industrial wastes, and agricultural adjuvants; (2) mechanisms of action in chemical carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; (3) the molecular pathology of tissue injury in acute toxicity; and (4) scientific prin\u00ad ciples involved in extrapolating from laboratory animal data to expected effects on human health in environmental exposures. Students entering the program have varied backgrounds, includ\u00ad ing chemistry, biology, and physiology. The curriculum is based on a foundation of basic and health sciences with applications of scientific principles to environmental problems. Formal course work is enriched by a strong commitment to student-professor contact throughout the program. An important and integral part of the learning process is an early and intensive involvement of the student in ongoing original research projects in environmental toxicology, especially inhalation/pulmOJiary toxicology, chemical carcinogenesis, biochemical toxicology, and neurotoxicology. The University of California, Riverside (UCR) also offers a grad\u00ad uate program in environmental toxicology which emphasizes natural resources and environmental sciences. The UCI program, in contrast, emphasizes health effects and medical sciences. Cooperative arrangements facilitate interaction between the two programs. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements set by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, applicants must be admitted by an Admissions Committee composed of faculty members from the Department of Community and Environmen\u00ad tal Medicine. Candidates are selected on the basis of a balanced evaluation of the following criteria: (I) prior scholastic perfor\u00ad mance, including a consideration of grade point average, course load, nature of courses taken, and college attended; (2) recom\u00ad mendations by professors and others; (3) scores on the Graduate Record Examination; the Subject Test in either Biology or Chem\u00ad istry is strongly recommended; and (4)an interview by the Admissions Committee, when feasible. The applicant must have received a bachelor's degree in a biological or physical science, in a premedical curriculum, or have an acceptable equivalent. Applicants with a bachelor's degree in engineering may qualify for admission into the program if they have had sufficient train\u00ad ing in the biological and physical sciences. Undergraduate preparation of applicants should include six quar\u00ad ter units in general biology, zoology, bacteriology, or anatomy; 12 quarter units in mathematics, including calculus through vector analysis and differential equations; 32 quarter units of chemistry, including four quarter units of physical chemistry in which calcu\u00ad lus in used; 12 quarter units of physics, including optics; and four quarter units in molecular biology or biochemistry. Outstanding applicants who lack one or two of these prerequisites may be given an opportunity to take the required course(s) either before admission or during the first year in the graduate program; in such circumstances, none of these undergraduate courses may be used to satisfy the Program elective or core course requirements. Upper-division or graduate science courses may be considered as substitutes for the above prerequisites by the Admissions Committee. The graduate core curriculum for the Ph.D. degree includes Environmental Toxicology 201, 202, 298, and 299, Physiology UC IRVINE - 1990-1991350 College of Medicine and Biophysics 206A-B, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry 203 and 204, Pharmacology and Toxicology 252, and Anatomy and Neurobiology 203. The core requirements for the Master's degree include Environmental Toxicology 201, 202, 298, and 299, and Pharmacology and Toxicology 252. In addition, for either pro\u00ad gram competence in statistical experimental design and computer science must be demonstrated in the student's research project. Opportunities for individual training and independent research experience exist in inhalation and pulmonary toxicology, atmos\u00ad pheric chemistry and aerosol science, chemical carcinogenesis, neurochemistry, biochemical toxicology, toxicology of naturally occurring compounds, exercise physiology and stress, and envi\u00ad ronmental microbiology and chemistry. Graduate study in environmental toxicology is supported by a training grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences which offers stipends, tuition, and fees to quali\u00ad fied predoctoral graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.

Walker: Genetic counseling; delivery of genetic services; compu- ter uses in clinical genetics; genetics education The Division of Human Genetics in the College of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics offers graduate education leading to the Master of Science degree in Genetics Counseling. Graduates of the program are prepared to function as members of genetics teams engaged in providing clinical services, teaching, and research. Other roles for program graduates may include employment in local, state, or federal genetics programs, in cate\u00ad gorical disease foundations, or in public education. Division faculty and staff are involved in teaching, research, and patient service. Clinical activities include evaluation, early ascer\u00ad tainment, prenatal diagnosis, prevention, and management of genetic disorders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling conditions. Among faculty research interests are gene mapping \u00b7and linkage analysis using DNA probes; chromosomal syndromes; late-onset single-gene disorders; the incidence and perception of genetic disease, birth defects, and developmental disabilities in underserved ethnic populations; factors in the etiology of chromosomal abnormali\u00ad ties and malformations; the cytogenetics of cancer and sexual differentiation; psychosocial issues in genetic disease and prenatal diagnosis; and delivery of genetic services. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, stu\u00ad dents must complete a sequence of core courses in medical genet\u00ad ics, biochemical and molecular genetics, cytogenetics, child devel\u00ad opment, counseling issues and techniques, research methodology, ethical issues, and community resources. Experiential professional training occurs concurrently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics laboratory, and in certain com\u00ad munity agencies. Participation in these and other divisional and departmental professional and educational activities such as lec\u00ad tures, seminars, Pediatric Grand Rounds, cytogenetics rounds, and research, counseling, and patient management conferences is expected throughout the program. Completion of the program requires a minimum of 58 quarter units of credit, a research thesis which should be publishable, and demonstration of satisfactory professional skills in genetic coun\u00ad seling. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students, UC IRVINE - 1990-1991although teaching and supervision of professional experiential training is shared among all division faculty and staff, who fre\u00ad quently review student progress. In the second year, development of professional skills can be individualized according to the stu\u00ad dent's needs and interests. It is anticipated that graduates will be eligible for American Board of Medical Genetics certification in genetic counseling within a year of completing the program. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological sciences, especially in genetics, biochemistry, psychology, and human development. Course work in statistics is desirable. Facility in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language is a considerable asset.

Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. The primary concentration of the program is in imaging. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy empha\u00ad sis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an excep\u00ad tionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineer\u00ad ing, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospective students are cautioned that the program is extremely demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a variety of the conventional disciplines. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation biology, radia\u00ad tion physics, radio-pharmacy, and radiological engineering located on campus and at the hospitals associated with UCI. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to com\u00ad plete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiological Sci\u00ad ences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also prepares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qualifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying examination can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the fol\u00ad lowing year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing origi\u00ad nal research in the student's principal field of study must be pre\u00ad pared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direc\u00ad tion of the doctoral committee, represents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, and creativity. During the final quarter of graduate . study the student is required to defend the dissertation in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the biological sciences as well as in mathematics. Since most students will need some additional work in one or more disciplines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Appli\u00ad cations for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. Additional information on the graduate program in Radiological Sciences is available from the office of the program director; tele\u00ad phone (714) 856-6147.

The Department's faculty and professional staff are dedicated to pro\u00ad viding each student with the opportunity to participate in a broad program of physical activities, sports, and recreation. Students electing physical education activity classes, which include course offerings in 19 intercollegiate sports, may receive partial credit toward a degree up 'to a total of 4.2 units of credit. No degree in Physical Education is offered. Campus Recreation All officially enrolled students, as well as faculty and staff per\u00ad sonnel, are encouraged to participate in the Campus Recreation Program offered by the Department of Athletics and Physical Education. Intramural activities feature men's, women's, and co-ree team sports, and many individual and dual sports.

A sampling of individual and dual sports includes badminton, board games, racquetball, table ten\u00ad nis, tennis, track and field, two-person volleyball, and wrestling. The. emphasis is on participation, and activities are offered at all ability levels from novice to advanced. The sport clubs aspect of the Campus Recreation Program pro~ vides students, faculty, and staff with an opportunity to partici\u00ad pate in activities that fall beyond the scope of intramurals. Spe\u00ad cialized instruction and extramural competition are the highlight of many club activities. Since clubs are student-initiated, offerings vary from year to year. Currently, active clubs !nclude Aikido, bike racing, fencing, floor hockey, Hwa Rang Do, Karate, men's lacrosse, rugby, sailing, ski racing, surfing, table tennis, Tai Chi, Tang Soo Do, tennis, ultimate frisbee, water skiing, wind surfing, women's softball, women's water polo, and wrestling. Informal recreation provides the UCI community with an oppor\u00ad tunity to utilize the facilities in and around Crawford Hall, the departmental sports complex, in a nonstructured setting. Infor\u00ad mal recreation hours are scheduled on a quarterly basis and vary according to facility availability. Recreation instruction classes are offered quarterly to students, faculty, staff, and their spouses desiring specialized assistance in a variety of activities. Examples of these classes are: ice skating, jazz dance, lifesaving, scuba diving, tennis, aerobics, kayaking, and sailing. \u00b7 A special events program is offered each quarter to familiarize students with Campus Recreation activities and to facilitate cam\u00ad pus community interaction. Recent programs include \"Recreation 'Round the World,\" \"Almost Anything Goes,\" and \"Late Night with Campus Recreation.\" Members of the campus community who would like additional activities or clubs offered or who desire further information may contact the Campus Recreation Office, 1368 Crawford Hall, (714) 856-5346.

Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions and from the charter of the University of California, which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the protection of law\u00ad ful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchallenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion is as crucial within our campus community as is tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Education, and a clear, rational, and vigorous challenge are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University pro\u00ad perty or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with University policy. (See Sections 51.16 and 51.28 of the Policies.) All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Princi\u00ad ples of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs. Reprinted from the University of California, Irvine Campus Implemen\u00ad tation of the Interim Policies and Procedures Applying to Campus Activi-. ties, Organizations and Students-Part A Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. A handbook is available which I sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students,\" gives rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the President of the University. The booklet also incorporates campus regulations. Copies are available from the Assistant Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman, located in 255 Administration Building; from the Dean of Students, located in Student Services I, and from the Student Activities Office, located in 90 I Humanities Trailer Complex. Academic Dishonesty The UCI Academic Senate adopted the following policies on academic dishonesty on June 2, 1988. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the University of California, Irvine. Cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, and collusion \\n dishonest activitit:s erode the University's educational, research, and social roles. They cheapen the learning expe\u00ad rience and its legitimacy not only for the perpetrators but for the entire community. It is essential that UCI students subscribe to the ideal of academic integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work. All members of the academic community have a responsibility to ensure that scholastic honesty is maintained. Cheating and plagiarism are unfair, demoralizing, and demeaning to everyone. Faculty members are expected to: 1. Uphold and enforce the principles of academic integrity and explain clearly any qualifications of these principles which may be operative in the classes they are teaching. \u00b7 2. Minimize opportunities for academic misconduct in their courses. 3. Confront students suspected of academic dishonesty in a way which respects the students' privacy. \u00b7 4. Afford to students accused of academic misconduct the right to appeal any resulting disputes to disinterested parties for hearing and resolution. Students are expected to: I. Refrain from cheating and plagiarism. 2. Refuse to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty. 3. Notify professors and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to the .following examples: Cheating I. Copying from others during an examination. 2. Communicating exam answers with another student during an examination. 3. Offering another person's work as one's own. 4. Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself. 5. Sharing answers for a take-home examination unless specifically authorized by the instructor. 6. Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected, then returning it for more credit. 7. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes or information concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. 8. Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Dishonest Conduct I. Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. 2. Changing or attempting to change official academic records without proper sanction. 3. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. 4. Forging Add/Drop/Change cards and other enrollment documents, or altering such documents after signatures have been obtained. 5. Intentionally impairing the concentration of other students and/or the faculty member. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: I. To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words of another. 2. To use a creative production without crediting the source. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summarizing a work (in whole, or in part, in one's own words), and for information which is not common knowledge. The UCI Academic Senate has adopted a statement regarding plagiarism which is published each quarter in the UCI Schedule of Classes. Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student per\u00ad form any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to disci\u00ad pline for academic dishonesty. Procedures for Dealing with Incidents of Academic Dishonesty Many, perhaps most, incidents of academic dishonesty involve accusa\u00ad tions which are based on clear evidence and which are not contested by the accused student. In such cases, if the infraction is relatively minor and there is no indication that the accused student has previously been UC IRVINE - 1990-1991involved in such incidents, it is most appropriate that the matter be resolved between the student and the faculty member alone. When this occurs, it is nevertheless important that a written report of the incident be filed in order to ensure that penalties assessed are commensurate with the offense and that repeated infractions be detected and dealt with appropriately. More serious incidents and repeat offenses, which call for stronger disci\u00ad plinary action, will necessarily involve members of the University com\u00ad munity in addition to the instructor and accused student. In such cases sanctions described in paragraph 52.130 of Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students- Part A may be administered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs in addition to aca\u00ad demic penalties assessed by a faculty member. Finally, whenever an accusation of academic dishonesty or a penalty imposed by a faculty member is contested by an accused student, the student must have recourse to an appeal for resolution of the dispute to designated arbitrators or, in the last resort, to a properly constituted review panel. Processes for informal resolution by the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs and for formal resolution before a Stu\u00ad dent/Faculty Board of Review are described in paragraph 52.122 of the publication just cited. Additional avenues of appeal are described below. The procedures outlined here are designed to institute a system that rec\u00ad ognizes that many cases of academic misconduct are best resolved solely between the student and faculty member involved, while it provides for appropriate handling of serious and repeated offenses and guarantees a fair hearing to an accused student. Authority of Faculty Members When a faculty member has evidence of student academic dishonesty, the faculty member has the authority to impose one or more of the fol\u00ad lowing academic penalties, if possible foilowing a private meeting with the student to present the evidence: I. Issue a reprimand. 2. Require repetition of the questionable work or examination. 3. Reduce the grade to an F or zero, if appropriate, on the questionable work or examination. 4. Dismiss the student from the course with a failing grade recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Any such disciplinary action must be reported in writing to the student in a letter from the faculty member. Copies of this letter must also be sent to (a) the Associate Dean of the faculty member's school, and (b) the Associate Dean of the student's school, who will maintain a file of cases of academic misconduct involving students enrolled in that school. The faculty member is strongly encouraged to consult with the Associate Dean of their school before the letter is drafted. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Dishon\u00ad esty should be included in the letter. If action (4) is taken, the faculty member is responsible for making certain that the failure is recorded by the Registrar on the student's permanent academic record. The academic penalty imposed by the instructor is final unless appealed by the student within 15 calendar days of mailing of the letter. Careful documentation of the incident must be maintained by the faculty member in the event that their actions in the case should later be subject to review. Responsibilities of the Academic Associate Deans The Associate Dean (or equivalent official) of each school is responsible for maintaining confidential records concerning' academic dishonesty of students enrolled in that school. All letters reporting faculty-imposed academic penalties for academic misconduct will be included in these files, and the Associate Dean will be responsible for identifying serious incidents of academic misconduct perpetrated by students enrolled in that school as they occur. Such serious incidents of academic dishonesty, including all incidents which represent repeated offenses by a student, must be referred by the Associate Dean of the accused student's school to the University Ombudsman for possible imposition of sanctions des\u00ad cribed in policy 52.130, including suspension or dismissal from the University. The Associate Dean of an accused student's school is required to notify that student of the appeal process available to students accused of aca\u00ad demic dishonesty promptly upon receipt of an instructor's letter report\u00ad ing faculty-imposed academic sanctions. Authority of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs Whenever an incident of academic misconduct is referred to the Univer\u00ad sity Ombudsman by an academic Associate Dean, the Ombudsman will Academic Dishonesty 361 investigate the circumstances of the incident following procedures speci\u00ad fied under campus policy 52.122 and attempt an informal resolution of the case. In the event that the Ombudsman fails to achieve informal resolution of the matter, the Dean of Students will convene a Student/ Faculty Board of Review for formal resolution of the case. Formal or informal resolution under the authority of the Vice Chancellor-Student Affairs may result in the withdrawal of all charges against the student or endorsement of the academic penalties imposed by the faculty member and possible imposition of one or more of the sanctions described in pol-. icy 52.130, including suspension or dismissal from the University. Student Appeals When any student accused of academic dishonesty wishes to contest a sanction imposed by a faculty member, the student may, within 15 calendar days of the mailing of written notification of the academic penalty, submit an appeal in writing to the Associate Dean of the instructor's school. The Associate Dean will promptly attempt to mediate the dispute and reach a resolution. The result of a successful mediation will be reported in writing by the instructor to the student and to the Associate Deans of both the faculty member's school and the stu\u00ad dent's school. If the mediation process does not succeed within 10 calendar days following appeal of the matter to the Associate Dean of the instructor's school, the matter must be forwarded by the Associate Dean to the University Ombudsman for resolution under the procedures of policy 52.00ff. A student accused of academic dishonesty may, within 30 calendar days of the mailing of the initial letter detailing academic sanctions imposed by a faculty member for an incident of academic dishonesty, appeal the matter in writing to the University Ombudsman, who will seek to resolve the dispute under the procedures of policy 52.00ff. Students accused of academic dishonesty or considering an appeal of academic sanctions for alleged academic misconduct are urged to con\u00ad tact the Associate Dean of their academic school and/or the University Ombudsman concerning possible sources of advice and assistance. Maintenance of Disciplinary Records Records relating to academic dishonesty will be maintained by the Asso\u00ad ciate Deans (or corresponding officials) of the several academic units primarily to promote consistency of penalties for a given offense and to ensure appropriate action against repeat offenders. Records will nor\u00ad mally be destroyed after five years, unless the Associate Dean determines in any particular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. In order to ensure that minor and non-recurring infractions .do not negatively impact a student's career beyond UCI, any student may petition the Associate Dean of their academic school to have relevant .disciplinary records expunged after the record is two yeats old or upon graduation, whichever comes first. The Associate Dean has sole author\u00ad ity to consider and to grant or deny such petitions. The University will release a student's disciplinary records to potential employers, govern\u00ad mental agencies, other educational institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law.

Copies are available from the Office of Student Affairs, 260 Administration Building. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and wel\u00ad fare of the individuals involved. In January 1988, the Education Code of the State of California was modified to reflect changes to the State's anti-hazing statute. In accordance with the revised Education Code, stu\u00ad dents are advised of the following: Education Code 32050 As used in this article, hazing includes any method of initiation or prei\u00ad nitiation into a student organization or any pastime or amusement engaged in with respect to such an organization which causes, or is likely UC IRVINE - 1990-1991362 Anti-Hazing Compliance/Student Records/Salary Information to cause, bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or dis\u00ad grace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any student or other per\u00ad son attending any school, community college, college, university, or other educational institutions in this state; but the term \"hazing\" does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions. Education Code 32051 No student, or other person in attendance at any public, private, paroch\u00ad ial, or military school, community college, college, or other educational institution, shall conspire to engage in hazing, participate in hazing, or commit any act that causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to any fellow student or person attending the institution. The violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. Education Code 32052 Any person who participates in the hazing of another, or any corpora\u00ad tion or association which knowingly permits hazing to be conducted by its members or by others subject to its direction or control, shall forfeit any entitlement to State funds, scholarships, or awards which are enjoyed by him, by her, or by it, and shall be deprived of any sanction or approval granted by any public educational institution or agency. Copies of Sections 32050 through 32052 as well as UCI's policies regard\u00ad ing hazing are available from the Office of the Dean of Students, Student Services Building. Student Records The> University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University pol\u00ad icy and procedures\" implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: I. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capac\u00ad ity as stl!dents; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of person\u00ad ally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Ser\u00ad vices regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and Salary and Employment Information Field of Study Engineering Humanities Life Science Management Physical Science Social Science Bachelor's $2,354 1,593 1,530 1,922 1 570 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed with\u00ad out prior written consent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the Uni\u00ad versity is required to disclose information. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10.721 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to them\u00ad selves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the writ\u00ad ten consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that informa\u00ad tion cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regard\u00ad ing the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Assistant Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman, 255 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each. quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data.

It should be noted that a wide variation in starting salaries exists within each discipline based on job location, type of employer, personal qualifications of the individual, and employment conditions at the time of job entry. UC IRVINE - 1990-1991ermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is provided with a record of current terin enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the. next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enroll\u00ad ment. Studentit,are urged to report officially to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and enrollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and Uni\u00ad versity and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library.
