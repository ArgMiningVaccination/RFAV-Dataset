Ayurveda, which literally means Knowledge of Life, takes a natural approach to health and well-being by restoring balance and strengthening the body's inherent healing wisdom. Our new Ayurvedic spa treatments will draw upon this ancient wisdom to create an experience that will awaken and rejuvenate your body, mind, and spirit to its original harmonious state. In the tradition of Ayurveda, the practitioner will determine your present dosha, or body constitution, and customize the entire treatment to meet your specific needs and goals. You can expect a deeply relaxing experience where every opportunity is taken to ensure your comfort and aid in releasing the most deeply rooted toxins, tensions, and traumas. "}
