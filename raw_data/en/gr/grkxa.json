This long-time Charlotte County resident holds a bachelor's degree in the Science of Nutrition and a Doctorate in Chiropractic. In 1997, Dr. Van Nostrand left a very successful practice in Oakton, Virginia to move overseas to practice Chiropractic in The Netherlands ' 'Holland.' There he became one of the first American Chiropractors to work in Holland's world famous social health care system. Working closely with some of Holland's best Orthopedic, Neurological, Chiropractic, and Physical Therapy specialists, Dr. Van Nostrand experienced a different and more effective approach to treating neuro-muscular-skeletal disorders (muscle-related pain). Dr. Chance graduated from Palmer Chiropractic College in 2013 with Honors. He is accompanied by his wife Danielle and beautiful son Ridge. He enjoys playing a wide variety of sports from ice hockey, soccer, baseball, and football. In 1996 he was asked to tryout for the United States National Ice Hockey team.
