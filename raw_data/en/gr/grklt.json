We are pleased you have chosen to further your education at our School. Our facultyand staff look forward to working with you. You will find them anxious to meet you and happy to help you meet your goals. We recognize you are here to expand your knowledge and skills, and we will certainly do everything we can to help you do that.

Do plan to participate in these. We also offernumerous opportunities for students to be involved in various projects and programs inour local community and in more distant locations.

This relationship is reflected in the following values: Compassion toward fellow human beings, creatures, and nature Acceptance of each individual as a priceless child of God Respect for the beliefs, ideas, opinions, and cultures of others Equity in interactions with all individuals, races, ethnicities, and cultures Integrity by matching belief with action Faith in the outworking of God's ultimate purpose W isdom in research, study, and service SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 21 School Foundations HISTORY The School was begun in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research andteaching. After its reorganization in 1961, the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began to offer master's degree programs through the Graduate School. Establishment of the School of Public Health was authorized in 1964, and plans weremade for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on ProfessionalEducation of the American Public Health Association. In 1967 the School of Nutrition andDietetics (which had been organized in 1922 as the School of Dietetics) became a depart-ment of the School of Public Health. The name of the School was changed to School ofHealth in October 1970. Because the meaning of the term \"public health\" has graduallybroadened to emphasize lifestyle\u2014consistent with the goals of the School\u2014the originalname, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for HealthPromotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine PracticeGroup were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. This resulted in expandedfaculty and resources. The expanded School of Public Health also serves as theDepartment of Preventive Medicine in the School of Medicine.

All courses not listing academic credit in units must list credit in total hours of contact orclock hours. Graduate student course load On-campus students are considered to be in a full-time graduate program when they are regis-tered for at least 8 units, although 12 units perquarter is considered a normal graduate courseload. Students registered for a field practicum ofat least 400 hours are considered to be in afull-time program. Academic overloads are notencouraged, and those students desiring to takean overload must meet certain academic criteria. The total academic and work load includes the number of credit units registered at thisUniversity; registration in field practicum, clerk-ship, internship, or residency through thisUniversity; the number of credit units (prerequi-site or other courses) at another college or univer-sity; and the number of hours in volunteer orgainful employment.

Course audit Students in any admission classification may audit courses for purposes of supplementary edu-cation. This option is not available for predomi-nantly laboratory-experience courses. Consent toaudit is granted by the instructor, subject to class-room space. A request to change an audit courseto credit or credit to audit may be made no laterthan the seventh calendar day of a quarter. Anaudit course may not be repeated for credit. Extramural work When a student begins a degree program, it is understood that course work must be taken at thisUniversity unless, upon petition for extramuralwork, the student obtains prior consent from thedepartment for study at another institution. Insuch instances the student must arrange for evalu-ation of the work and, at its completion, recom-mendation as to credit. Since extramural work is atype of transfer credit, all policy relating to trans-fer credit also applies to extramural credit. Transfer credit For undergraduate degree transfer-credit information, please refer to the entrance-requirements section in this BULLETIN . Appropriate graduate-level courses, to a maxi- mum of 9 quarter units for master's degree pro-grams and 12 quarter units for doctoral degreeprograms, may be transferred into a School ofPublic Health degree program. These limitsinclude transfer of credit earned before entry intothe School of Public Health program, as well asextramural credit earned during the program.Courses must have been taken within the past fiveyears at an accredited institution, with a grade ofB or better. Requests must be initiated by the stu-dent, in consultation with the adviser and validat-ed by the department chair. Just as Loma LindaUniversity does not guarantee transfer of its cred-its to other schools, we reserve the right to denytransfer credit into our programs. For this reason,it is always best for the student to requestadvanced approval of any graduate courses s/heplans to take at another accredited university.38 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Waiver Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously complet-ed course work. Waiver of a specific courserequirement does not reduce the number of unitsrequired for the program. Advanced academic standing Graduate students with previous course work in areas of public health may apply for limitedunits of advanced standing. If approved by theprogram director or department chair and thedirector of admissions and academic records inthe School, degree requirements\u2014exclusive ofelective units\u2014are reduced. Courses taken duringthe past five years are considered in an evaluationof the student's qualification for advanced stand-ing.

Advanced standing is not granted forreligion courses. Shared units The maximum number of units that may be shared between a doctoral and master's degreeprogram within the University is 18 units. Themaximum number of units that may be sharedbetween a bachelor's and master's degree programwithin the University is 9 units. Shared units arenot automatically guaranteed. Independent study/special projects Independent study is offered to provide opportunity for the student to gain academicexperience beyond that which is available in regu-lar course work. Thus, it is seen neither as a sub-stitute for other course requirements nor as amechanism to obtain course work not currentlyscheduled. Master's degree students are restrictedto 4 units of independent study/special projectswithin the units required for the degree. Doctoraldegree students are restricted to 4 units of inde-pendent study/special projects per year or a maxi-mum of 6 units for the entire degree program. Credit by examination Credit for equivalency examinations is not accepted toward School of Public Health graduatedegrees. Equivalency examinations for graduatestudents may be used to challenge prerequisitesand to validate previous training for advancedstanding or waiver requests. Equivalency exami-nations may be accepted for School of PublicHealth undergraduate degrees. Requests for equivalency examination(s) must be approved by the current instructor of thecourse for which request is made, as well as bythe student's departmental faculty.

Withdrawals outsidethis time frame upon recommendation ofthe dean may be removed at the discretionof the vice president for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal froma course prior to completion of 80 percent ofthe course, excluding the final examinationperiod. Withdrawals during the first 20 per-cent of a course, excluding the final exami-nation period, are not recorded if the stu-dent files with the Office of UniversityRecords the appropriate form prior to thedate when this 20 percent of the course iscompleted. A student may withdraw only once from anursing or named cognate course that s/he isfailing at the time of withdrawal . UW Unofficial Withdrawal, indicates that the student discontinued class attendanceafter the close of registration but failed towithdraw officially. I Incomplete, given when the majority of the course work has been completed, andcircumstances beyond a student's controlresult in the student being unable to com-plete the quarter. An I notation may bechanged to a grade only by the instructorbefore the end of the following term(excluding the summer sessions for thosenot in attendance during that term).Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By the use of the petition form, the student requests an I notation from the instructor,stating the reason for the request andobtaining the signatures of the instructor,the department chair, and the associatedean. The form is left with the instructor.The instructor will then report the I nota-tion on the grade-report form, as well asthe grade that the student will receive if thedeficiency is not removed within the timelimit. The petition form is then filed withthe Office of University Records, along withthe grade-report form. The notation I is notgranted as a remedy for overload, failure onfinal examination, absence from finalexamination for other than an emergencysituation, or a low grade to be raised withextra work. IP In Progress, indicating that the course has a duration of more than a single term andwill be completed by the student no laterthan the final term of the course, not toexceed five quarters for independent studyand research courses (original quarter ofregistration plus four additional quarters).The student's final grade will be reportedon the instructor's grade report at the endof the term in which the course is complet-ed. If the course work is not completedwithin the five-quarter time limit, a gradeof U will be given. AU Audit, ind icating registration for atten- dance only, with 80 percent class atten-dance considered a requirement. Arequest to change a credit course toaudit or an audit course to credit may bemade no later than the fourteenth calen-dar day after the beginning of a quarteror the seventh calendar day after thebeginning of the summer session. (Thisdoes not address short summer courseslasting only a week or two.)

Such changes are permissible up to the endof the succeeding term. Academic performance level In order to remain at regular academic status, undergraduate students must maintain agrade-point average of 2.5; and graduate studentsmust maintain a grade-point average of 3.0 in themajor area(s) as well as in the overall program. Inaddition, a grade of at least C- (for either under-graduate or graduate students) must be earned inany course for which credit is to be applied to adegree program. In order to replace any grade, thestudent must repeat the course. This includesattending lecture and/or laboratory sessions asrequired, completing assigned work, and takingany required examinations. Full tuition ischarged. Both the original and repeat grades areentered in the permanent records, but only thesecond grade is computed in the grade-point aver-age and included in the number of units appliedtoward the degree. A course may be repeated onlyonce. Continuation in a degree program is serious-ly jeopardized for the student who has receivedmore than two grades of less than C-. Academic probation Students whose cumulative grade-point aver- age at the end of any quarter is less than 2.5 forundergraduate students or 3.0 for graduate stu-dents are placed on academic probation, and thenumber of units for subsequent registrations isrestricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Thegrade-point average is computed separately fortotal units applicable to a School of Public Healthdegree and for courses in the major area. Studentswith two quarters of unsatisfactory performancejeopardize their standing in a degree program. Repeating courses A student wishing to improve his/her grade once grades have been posted for a course mustrepeat the course. When repeating a course, thestudent must attend class and laboratory sessionsas ordinarily required, take all regularly scheduledexaminations, and pay full tuition. Both gradeswill appear on the student's permanent record,but only the repeat grade is computed in theG.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in astudent's degree program. Graduate-level courses Undergraduate seniors with G.P.A.s of 3.0 or better and who meet prerequisites may, withapproval of the instructor and consent of the asso-ciate dean of the School of Public Health and thedean of the school offering the course, enroll for alimited number of graduate-level courses (500-levelor above). Only with special permission may creditbe applied to the undergraduate degree, in whichcase the credit may not be applied toward a gradu- ate degree. Veteran's educational benefits eligibility If a student receives educational assistance from the Department of Veteran's Affairs and thecumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) remainsbelow the graduation requirements for more thanthe equivalent units of three consecutive terms,the student will not be certified for VeteransAffairs educational benefits until his/her academicstatus is restored to regular standing.

GhamsaryBessie L. HwangTom\u00e1s P. Matamala (SA) Shavlik E. Villalobos (SA) The epidemiology and biostatistics programs are jointly administered. The comple- mentary nature of these research disciplines provides an efficient investigativealliance that combines the health perspective of biological science with the objec- tivity of statistics. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious dis-ease outbreaks, the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries arealso considered by the modern epidemiologist. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations.Epidemiology comprises the research methods that identify and isolate the underlying causesof disease and injury as well as health. The diversity of this investigative science is illustratedby a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preven-tive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the develop-ment of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accom-plishments of epidemiology include discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved inthe spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive mea-sures for surgical-wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologicinquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electro-magnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of the health benefits of cho-lesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The epidemiologiststudies the distribution and determinants of health and disease in populations. The emphasisOUR MISSION 63 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS 63 that is placed upon the investigative process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. Epidemiologic research incorporates use of statistical techniques andan understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in diseasedevelopment and spread. Although epidemiology is a relatively young discipline, this collection of investigative methods has become an integral part of public health; epidemiologic findings permeate allfields of human health. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee anexciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. BIOSTATISTICS Biostatisticians have an important role in a wide variety of health and biomedicalinvestigations that explore the frontiers of man's knowledge. A biostatistician typi-cally serves on a research or management team, with the specific responsibility of guiding the design, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. A biostatisticianmay also be involved in projects that require the development of statistical methodologyin terms of refinement of old methods or development of new methods of analysis to han-dle data that depart from traditional models. The master's degree programs in biostatistics are planned in such a way as to provide concurrent preparation in statistical methodology, data processing, programming, and com-puter operations. Such combined training is widely regarded as the best method to ade-quately prepare statisticians to meet the needs of an increasingly computerized environ-ment. Students with diverse undergraduate majors\u2014mathematics, physical science, socialsciences, biology, business administration, and the health professions\u2014are usually eligibleto pursue these programs. Individuals enrolled in the statistics program are prepared to participate in projects such as the following: population surveys in which, with randomly selected samples, oneestimates the health status, the health care needs, or the health facilities of a particularcommunity; prospective studies in which the relationship between disease and other fac-tors is studied, or in which the effectiveness of a certain health program is evaluated; clin-ical trials in which a certain new drug, such as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent or someother treatment, is evaluated for its safety and effectiveness. The primary purpose of the biostatistics and epidemiology programs is to provide a climate in which students may grow in their knowledge and understanding of theory andpractice. Thus they may gain competencies that will enable them to apply the principleslearned to the solution of a broad variety of problems related to health and disease. Allactivities and resources\u2014including teaching, research, consultation, community service,and social and spiritual interactions\u2014are directed toward encouraging such growth bothin students and in members of the faculty.64 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Department goals The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics: 1.

OUR MISSION 111 THE GENERALIST PROGRAM 111 THE GENERALIST PROGRAM The Generalist Program is designed to meet the needs of practicing health profes- sionals who desire to augment their current careers with additional informationand skills. Such individuals would include physicians, dentists, nurses, health administrators, and practicing public health professionals. It is not designed for studentsentering graduate school directly from an undergraduate degree program; nor will it serveas a foundation for a major career change.

An off-campus degree program in a particular location is generally begun at the request of an organization that agrees to serve as co-sponsor. Instruction for the distance learning programs is primarily provided by regular School of Public Health faculty members who either travel to a given site or teach at theLoma Linda Hub for a three-to-five-day intensive session. Distance-learning technology(interactive computer hook-ups, live and prerecorded video/TV presentations, etc.) mayalso be utilized. Faculty members and course descriptions for these programs are listed inthe academic department through which they are offered. GENERAL INFORMATION Course work Course sessions are conducted at each off-campus site on a regularly scheduled basis.With the exception of format, courses offered offcampus are regular School of Public Health cours-es. They carry the same credit units as on-campuscourses. Each course consists of a ten-week mod-ule with independent-study assignments. Halfwaythrough the module, an intensive student/instruc-tor session of three-to-five days is scheduled atthe off-campus instruction center. Course load A full-time graduate course load consists of 8 units, and a half-time graduate course load is 4units. Students in the Distance Learning Programwho need to qualify for financial aid must take aminimum 4 units per quarter to establish andmaintain eligibility. Texts and syllabi Students must place orders for required texts and syllabi with the Office of ContinuingProfessional Education and Distance Learningsix-to-eight weeks prior to a course session.Course materials can be ordered by phone or bymailing in a preregistration card. Prepayment forcourse materials is required. Fact sheets A fact sheet is prepared for every course taught at each off-campus site. It provides infor-mation concerning the course, presession assign-ments, postsession assignments, and course workdue dates.Proctors Many courses require a proctored postcourse examination. Each student is required to have onfile with the Office of Continuing ProfessionalEducation and Distance Learning a signed proctorcontract with the name of a person who will serveas his/her permanent proctor. A proctored exami-nation is automatically sent to this person. The proctor may not be a relative or someone living in the same house as the student. The regis-trar of a local college or university, a librarian, ora minister are considered appropriate proctors. Grading procedure Grading of off-campus courses cannot be completed until all postsession assignments andexaminations from each student are received bythe School. Dates of class sessions may fall withina quarter designation of the on-campus calendar,but the postsession assignment and grading periodmay not. Because of this, it is often necessary toassign a grade of IP (in progress) for the first grad-ing period. Final grades will appear on the tran-script the following quarter. Enrollment The format of the courses offered off campus combines both independent study and intensivestudent/instructor contact. It is vital that the stu-dent preregister for each course through theOffice of Continuing Professional Education andDistance Learning at least six weeks prior to theclass session. Fact sheets and textbooks must bein hand a minimum of six weeks prior to thebeginning of the class session. Registration foroff-campus students takes place the first day ofOUR MISSION 113 DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMS 113 each class session. Selected off-campus courses may be taken by qualified on-campus students ona space-available basis. On-campus students alsosign up six weeks prior to the class session, butthey must register at the same time they registerfor on-campus courses. Withdrawing from a course An off-campus student wishing to withdraw from a class with no record on the transcript mustwithdraw prior to the end of the on-site class ses-sion. A student may withdraw up to five weeksafter the on-site class session by notifying theOffice of Continuing Professional Education andDistance Learning in writing; a \"W\" will appear onthe transcript. Withdrawal from class must takeplace before the date of the final examinationand/or the deadline for turning in final coursework. An on-campus student withdrawing from an off-campus course must follow the designateddeadlines published by University Records forwithdrawal from on-campus courses. Course scheduling The School of Public Health cannot guarantee to provide repeated cycling of courses at a particularsite. Consequently, it may not be possible to providean individual student with a course that s/he hasmissed at a given site. If a student misses any coursesduring the cycle, or if entry into the program occursafter the beginning of the cycle at a particular site, itis the student's responsibility to make up anymissed courses by attending them as offered atother sites. The Office of Continuing Professional Education and Distance Learning pledges to do all it can to help any individual who may be having dif-ficulty with course scheduling. Culminating activity The School requires that each graduate com- plete a synthesizing activity that demonstratesbasic competencies in the five core areas of publichealth. Students should discuss options with theiracademic adviser. Public health seminars Each School of Public Health student is required to attend a minimum of ten public healthseminars for each master's degree sought. This isseen as an enrichment that augments the stu-dent's acquaintance with diverse current publichealth issues and concerns. The seminar require-ment must be met during the student's enrollmentin the School of Public Health and is separatefrom course credit registration. No tuition or fee ischarged by the School. Seminar activities must beapproved by the associate dean. Religion course requirement Registration and completion of a 3-unit, graduate level, religion course is mandatory forcompletion of degree requirements. Religioncourses must have an REL_ prefix and be offeredthrough Loma Linda University. The purpose ofthe religion requirement is to provide a spiritualdimension to the professional training of public health students, to provide students with an oppor-tunity to further develop their skills in dealing withlife's challenges, and to provide opportunity forpersonal spiritual growth. Transfer of course unitsfrom other universities and institutions is notavailable; nor is a waiver option available, regard-less of educational background. Traditional lettergrading is required. Types of registration Two types of registration are possible: regular and audit. Regular registration provides academiccredit; audit registration does not. No change fromaudit to regular credit or from regular credit toaudit is permitted after completion of the registra-tion procedure for any off-campus course. Thisprocedure must be completed at the time a givencourse is in session. A course taken for audit maynot be repeated for regular credit. The completion of registration involves both academic and financial clearance. Spouses of reg-istered students may attend class sessions free ofcharge but do not receive academic credit. Student classification Students enrolled in courses prior to receiv- ing official acceptance into the School of PublicHealth are classified as PTC (permission to takeclasses) students by the University. Students mayretain this status only by permission of the direc-tor of admissions and academic records for a max-imum of l2 units of study before official accep-tance into the School. Grievance procedures After exhausting all resources as outlined in the University Student Handbook , an off-campus student may approach his/her state licensingagency for further assistance. Addresses for thelicensing agencies are available by site in this sec-tion of the BULLETIN . For additional information on admission and academic requirements, refer to those sections ofthis BULLETIN . FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial policies Tuition for off-campus courses is the same as the on-campus tuition rate. Tuition must be paidin full at the time of registration. Refund policy Tuition for courses dropped is according to the following schedule: First day of class, or fraction thereof\u2014100 percent of tuition refunded; Second day of class, or fraction thereof\u201475 percent of tuition refunded; Third day of class, or fraction thereof\u201450 percent of tuition refunded; After the on-site class session is completed\u2014 no tuition is refunded.114 SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH Financial clearance The student is expected to maintain a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearancemust be obtained: (a) before registering for anyclass; (b) before receiving a diploma; or (c) beforerequesting a transcript, statement of completion,or other certification to be issued to any person,organization, or professional board. Loans Inquiry about loans should be made to the University Office of Financial Aid. Only studentswho are accepted into a degree program are eligi-ble to apply. For loan purposes, off-campus stu-dents registered for 4 units per quarter are consid-ered to be enrolled half-time.

Its historical rootsgo back to 1907, when a small library collection wasstarted in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium.In 1953 the growing collection was moved to its ownbuilding on the Loma Linda campus. Then in 1981, anew library building was built from a grant by the DelE. Webb Foundation, giving the library a total floorspace of 87,670 square feet. This structure nowhouses the main library, while the old structure isnow shared between the Department of Archives andSpecial Collections and the bound retrospective jour-nals. As of June 2001, the library has a total collec-tion of 410,807 books, bound and currentjournals/periodicals, and media items (197,303books; 125,577 bound journals, 1,420 current peri-odical subscriptions, 349 nonsubscription periodi-cals; and 84,158 media items).
