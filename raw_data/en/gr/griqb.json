Thanks to the Consortium and the partnerships that BVGH has facilitated over the last few years, my team at the University of Buea has been able to achieve what some of our predecessors could not accomplish in a decade. Prof. Fidelis Cho-Ngwa, University of BueaValue Driver 1: Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships for Neglected Infectious Diseases BVGH's partnership development and alliance management approach prioritizes projects \u2014 termed targeted collaborations \u2014 that address the greatest needs and gaps for diseases of poverty. With over 150 WIPO Re:Search collaborations established to date, BVGH's partnering process catalyzes the sharing of intellectual property across sectors and geographies to drive product research and development (R&D) for malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. BVGH Utilizes a Unique Partnering Approach 1 2 3 456Join IntroducePartner Identify & Outreach Search & Match Engage 12Key Features of BVGH's Approach # BVGH identifies WIPO Re:Search Members with complementary interests, capabilities, and needs; introduces the parties to determine if there is mutual interest in collaborating; coordinates communications between partners to align on collaboration milestones, roles, and responsibilities; and, once legal agreements are in place between the participating entities, provides alliance management support to help ensure successful outcomes. BVGH focuses on deploying Members' assets within targeted collaborations that Sharing of assets and participation in collaborations is always optional. Members are empowered to make such decisions on a case-by-case basis. BVGH's services are driven by and evolve with Members' partnering interests, including but not limited to13Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships Aimed at Improving Health and Saving Lives in Low- and Middle-Income Countries Customized and Flexible Address unmet medical needs in areas of interest Employ innovative approaches or technologies Align wit h the priorities and interests of major global heal th funders and other stakeholders Ar e positioned to attract the financing and partners ne eded to transition innovation into impactful products Diseases Expected products (drugs, diagnostics, vaccines)Assets to be shared (such as compounds, data, clinical samples, technology, expertise) Specific researchers, institutions, countries, or regionsNumber and scope of collaborations 5 5 5 # %Proactive Profiling, Scouting, and Vetting Experienced BVGH scientists and alliance managers regularly reach out to Members to discuss collaboration interests. Informed by those discussions, BVGH actively searches for researchers\u2014both within and beyond the existing WIPO Re:Search network\u2014who best fit the Members' needs. BVGH's objective is to find the most suitable partners for each Member and collaboration, regardless of institution or location. Before introducing potential partners to a Member, BVGH conducts a rigorous vetting process to confirm their readiness for WIPO Re:Search collaborations. I think of BVGH as our external scouting arm for collaborations involving neglected tropical disease indications \u2014 we work closely with them to identify high-caliber collaborators for endeavors where MSD* can bring a unique asset to the table to impact a particular disease. Dr. David Olsen, Distinguished Scientist and Neglected Tropical Diseases Discovery Lead, MSD *MSD is a trademark of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA Robust Global R&D Network In scouting potential collaborators for Members, BVGH taps into WIPO Re:Search's international network, spanning over 140 corporate, academic, non-profit, and government organizations in over 40 countries on six continents. Disease-endemic regions are well represented; Africa alone is home to over 30 Member institutions. In the event that a Member's needs cannot be met by the current network, BVGH recruits new Members to expand the breadth and impact of collaborations. 5 55#5 14Connecting Expertise and Assets End-to-End Planning, Support, and Communication BVGH-facilitated WIPO Re:Search collaborations unite the scientific expertise and creative thinking of academic, non-profit, and government researchers; the in-depth disease knowledge of investigators in endemic countries; and the material assets and product development experience of global companies for optimal efficiency and impact. Realizing the full value of a collaboration requires not only a well-matched partnership, but also alliance management support from beginning to end. BVGH coordinates communications between partners to solidify collaboration details and responsibilities; organizes regular update calls to discuss progress and roadblocks; and recruits additional partners as needed. BVGH also helps collaborators identify high- value award opportunities to fund continued development of promising product candidates. Examples include Wellcome Trust awards secured for an onchocerciasis drug development collaboration between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and the University of Buea in Cameroon (read about this collaboration on page 39), and an antimalarial drug development partnership between MSD and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (see page 36 for more information about this collaboration). End 15Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships 1WIPO Re:Search Leverages Company Assets to Drive Drug Discovery Through WIPO Re:Search, Member companies contribute valuable assets\u2014both tangible and intellectual\u2014to neglected infectious disease drug discovery initiatives. BVGH connects company decision makers with investigators who have targeted collaboration needs. If a company decides to proceed with a collaboration and share a resource, BVGH oversees and guides the partnership so that the investigators can focus on what matters - advancing their work toward new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. University-Industry Partners Pursue Schistosomiasis Drug Discovery What are statins? Partner #1: Dr. Conor Caffrey, presenting a unique solution Dr. Caffrey at the University of California, San Diego discovered that statins kill schistosome worms and prevent them from producing eggs by inhibiting an enzyme called Schistosoma HMG-CoA reductase (SmHMGR). The problem: An old treatment, and the risk of emerging resistance Praziquantel is the only available treatment for schistosomiasis. Reliance on a single agent for mass drug administration increases the risk that resistance will develop. Statins have been used worldwide for decades to reduce blood cholesterol, with well-documented safety and tolerability. The decades of data on statins means that fewer studies will be needed to repurpose them for another medical condition, allowing scientists to bypass many of the time consuming, expensive, and risky stages of early drug discovery. Roadblock : Finding a library of statins to test Dr. Caffrey reached out to BVGH with interest in screening a statin library for schistosomiasis drug discovery. Partner #2: MSD*, identified by BVGH, providing the statin library MSD a pioneer in statin drug discovery/ development, invited BVGH to proactively present WIPO Re:Search collaboration ideas. After reviewing Dr. Caffrey's project outline, and under an appropriate agreement, MSD shared select statin compounds. MSD contributes additional resources MSD scientists provided codon-optimized gene constructs and technical input on protein expression/production. Roadblock: Pursuing structure-based drug design Dr. Caffrey determined that certain MSD compounds (hits) had promising activity against schistosome worms. His next step was to determine the crystal structure for SmHMGR, to pursue structure- based drug design. However, he needed additional partners for the crystallization work. 16 MSD UC San Diego SCRI SSGCID What is structure-based drug design? Next steps Once the crystal structure of SmHMGR is obtained, the collaborators will optimize the hit compounds to improve SmHMGR inhibitor activity. BVGH will continue to identify additional partners and resources to bring the project ever closer to a new, and crucially needed, schistosomiasis drug. Partners #3 and #4: Specialized experts, recruited by BVGH, solving a puzzle BVGH searched its diverse network and connected Dr. Caffrey with crystallization experts at Seattle Children's Research Institute (SCRI) and Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID). Roadblock: Producing SmHMGR to determine its crystal structure The SCRI/SSGCID experts had issues producing SmHMGR protein. They identified a specialized technology called codon-optimized gene constructs as a potential solution. Determining the three-dimensional crystal structure of a target protein such as SmHMGR allows scientists to predict which compounds\u2014based on characteristics including size and shape\u2014will best bind the target and inhibit its activity. Guided by those predictions, scientists can chemically modify the structures of hit compounds to improve their potency. 17Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships *MSD is a trademark of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USAUBCT akeda A Complicated Treatment Regimen in Need of Simplification Current treatment regimens for tuberculosis are lengthy and complicated, often involving multiple drugs taken on varying schedules\u2014some daily, some weekly\u2014for up to two years. Given the complexities of treatment, it is not surprising that many patients discontinue therapy before being cured, threatening their health and their lives. Patient non-compliance has also contributed to the rise of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. As resistance to current drugs grows, there is a critical need for medications with different mechanisms of action and shorter periods of administration. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can survive and reproduce inside the macrophages of infected individuals, eventually killing the cells and suppressing the body's immune response to the disease. Dr. Yossef Av-Gay at the University of British Columbia previously identified a human protein that promotes the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages. Through a BVGH-facilitated WIPO Re:Search collaboration, Dr. Av-Gay is partnering with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to develop inhibitors of the protein to treat tuberculosis. Using Takeda's inhibitors\u2014developed to treat other diseases\u2014as a starting point, Dr. Av-Gay identified highly active hits in screening assays that inhibited M. tuberculosis growth with relatively low macrophage toxicity. Such low toxicity is critical\u2014a drug must not only be effective against pathogens, but also safe for human use. University of British Columbia has filed a provisional patent application covering the use of the compound class as antitubercular drugs, and Dr. Av-Gay will advance several of the hits to animal studies in the near future. BVGH is now looking to connect Dr. Av-Gay with additional partners to continue moving the project toward human impact. Dr. Yossef Av-Gay, University of British Columbia 18 Sharing Drug Delivery Expertise Malaria claimed over 435,000 lives worldwide in 2017. Committed to changing this narrative, Dr. Audrey Odom John at Washington University in St. Louis* and Dr. Cynthia Dowd at The George Washington University have developed an antimalarial drug candidate targeting a pathway essential for Plasmodium falciparum survival. The drug's target is found in parasites but not humans, reducing the risk of severe side effects. Dr. Odom John and Dr. Dowd found that the drug candidate has a very short half-life in the bloodstream, meaning that it is quickly eliminated from the body and is unable to exert its antimalarial effects over a sustained period of time. Through WIPO Re:Search and BVGH, Dr. Odom John and Dr. Dowd requested a conversation with Pfizer regarding alternative ways to potentially formulate or deliver the drug to improve its half-life. A formulation expert at the company provided valuable information regarding two possible delivery approaches: an adhesive skin patch and an injectable gel. Dr. Odom John and Dr. Dowd will next perform a follow-up study leveraging this information, and then pursue the most appropriate delivery method based on the results. *Dr. Odom John is now at Children's Hospital of PhiladelphiaPfizer WUSTL GWU Dr. Audrey Odom John, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Dr. Cynthia Dowd, The George Washington University 19Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships For all of our tinkering in the laboratory, Mother Nature is the cleverest of us all. Thousands of years of evolution have led plants and fungi to produce molecules, or natural products, to help defend themselves from predators and adapt to their environment. Humans have also taken advantage of the therapeutic properties of natural products for millennia to prevent and treat a variety of ailments. A nexus is forming between traditional medicine and modern R&D, as it becomes increasingly clear the extent to which natural products are a source of novel, lifesaving treatments. As long as humans have walked the Earth, natural products have played a vital role in the treatment of diseases. The seemingly unending structural diversity found in plants represents a wealth of untapped therapeutic potential. Dr. Edmund Ekuadzi, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Famous Commercialized Natural Products Aspirin, commercialized in the 1800s, is a derivative of a natural product called salicin, isolated from Salix alba, or white willow Paclitaxel, a cancer drug, is derived from Taxus brevifolia, or the Pacific yew, a conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America Artemisinin, used to combat multidrug- resistant malaria, is derived from the traditional Chinese plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwoodWIPO Re:Search Investigators Pursue Natural Product Drug Discovery Leishmaniasis is an emergent public health problem with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and a more expansive geographical reach than ever before. Migration, climate change, deforestation, and urbanization are all contributing to the spread of leishmaniasis. Newer treatments are superior to older medicines but can still be highly toxic. Dr. Edmund Ekuadzi at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Central Laboratory in Ghana, a former Novartis Next Generation Scientist Program Fellow, is exploring the anti-leishmanial properties of Ghanaian plants used in traditional medicines. The Next Generation Scientist Program helps scientists and physicians from low- and middle-income countries further develop technical skills to be used in their research in their home countries. As part of WIPO Re:Search's collaborative work with Novartis, BVGH shares applicable opportunities, 20 resources, and partnership connections with former Next Generation Scientist Fellows. Upon learning that Dr. Ekuadzi was seeking advanced training in natural product isolation and fractionation, BVGH connected him with a fellowship opportunity at the Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research at the University of Dundee. There, he will be trained in bioassay-guided fractionation, a technique that will enable him to isolate anti-leishmanial compounds from his plant extracts. Through this experience, Dr. Ekuadzi will acquire the expertise necessary to continue his drug discovery program. KNUST U Dundee Former Novartis Fellow Seeking to Unleash the Medicinal Power of Ghanaian Plants Dr. Edmund Ekuadzi outside the School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, which hosts the Wellcome Centre for Anti-Infectives Research laboratories 21Catalyzing Global Public-Private Partnerships Indigenous Cameroonian Flora and an Ingenious Research Project USF University of Yaound\u00e9 I Prof. Fabrice Boyom, University of Yaound\u00e9 I Dr. Bill Baker, University of South Florida Over three billion people worldwide are at risk for malaria. The most common and effective treatment options - quinine and artemisinin - are derived from natural products: quinine from cinchona wormwood (Artemisia annua). However, the emergence of drug-resistant parasites has rendered such therapies ineffective in some regions and stimulated research into new natural product-derived antimalarial agents. Prof. Fabrice Boyom at the University of Yaound\u00e9 I in Cameroon\u2014a country rich in diverse flora\u2014previously identified indigenous fungi and medicinal plants with promising antimalarial activity. He asked BVGH for help in finding a natural product drug development expert to move his project forward. After much searching through the WIPO Re:Search consortium for a partner who could provide the precise expertise that Prof. Boyom needed, BVGH found Dr. Bill Baker, a chemist at the University of South Florida. Dr. Baker had the know-how to develop natural products into potential drugs by isolating, characterizing, and elucidating the chemical structures. The collaborators determined that the natural product extracts had good antiplasmodial activity and are now isolating the active compounds. BVGH continues to support the collaboration by identifying relevant funding opportunities. The researchers co-published their findings in May 2018 in the Journal of Parasitology Research\u2014a significant accomplishment that helps provide the scientific validation needed to attract funders and partners. This Cameroonian-American partnership not only showcases WIPO Re:Search's robust and far-reaching global network, but also exemplifies the benefits of breaking down geographic silos. 22 A Powerful New Tool in Diagnostics Shared Through WIPO Re:Search MIT Dr. Jose Gomez-Marquez at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli at the University of Massachusetts, Boston are transforming the standard approach to diagnostic development with their Ampli Blocks\u2014a set of 40 building blocks that researchers around the world can easily assemble in a multitude of configurations to produce diagnostic devices. By engineering a multi-purpose platform for diagnostic development, Ampli Blocks allow researchers to focus on the biochemistry of detection and promote independent development of diagnostic devices. Further removing barriers for their use, the blocks are inexpensive (costing only about six cents for four blocks), do not require refrigeration or special handling, and can be sterilized and reused. At the request of Dr. Gomez-Marquez and Dr. Hamad-Schifferli, BVGH has established collaborations that are leveraging the pragmatic and versatile Ampli Block technology to improve disease diagnosis in low-resource settings. While drugs and vaccines are vital for eliminating neglected infectious diseases, so too are low- cost, high-quality diagnostics. Diagnostics are essential for accurately identifying the cause of a patient's illness, enabling appropriate care, and tracking infection levels over time to guide public health interventions. BVGH facilitates partnerships around the world with researchers dedicated to developing better diagnostics for neglected infectious diseases.WIPO Re:Search Drives Point-of-Care Diagnostic UBC U Diagnosis of schistosomiasis is limited to two methods. Microscopy cannot be used in field settings due to the need for electricity, while point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen testing has only 60% sensitivity in detecting one common worm species. Due to the shortcomings of current diagnostics, entire communities are often treated with the drug praziquantel for both prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, without first identifying which individuals are actually infected. Dr. Chiaka Anumudu at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria has identified 54 human proteins as potential biomarkers of schistosomiasis infection and, through WIPO Re:Search, is using Ampli Blocks to develop a device to detect those proteins in blood samples. An eye and skin disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, onchocerciasis is the second leading cause of infection-related blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 25 million people are infected with O. volvulus and an additional 123 million people are at risk for infection.Onchocerciasis is currently treated using the microfilaricide ivermectin, which has little effect on the adult worm. As a result, in high-risk areas such as Cameroon, patients may take the drug for over ten years, depending on the lifespan of the adult worm. There are no diagnostic tests sensitive enough to determine if a patient is completely \"adult worm-free. \" The development of sensitive diagnostic tools to detect adult worms and thus define treatment endpoints for onchocerciasis is therefore imperative. Dr. Stephen Ghogomu at the University of Buea in Cameroon has identified two antigens that are produced specifically by adult O. volvulus and released into the bloodstream of infected human hosts. He aims to create point-of-care diagnostic tests that can accurately detect the presence of the two proteins in bodily fluids and thus indicate whether a person is infected with adult O. volvulus. Individuals who are infected can then continue treatment, while those who are no longer infected can discontinue therapy. BVGH introduced Dr. Ghogomu to Dr. Horacio Bach at the University of British Columbia, an antibody engineering expert who is developing antibodies that bind to the two adult O. volvulus proteins with high affinity. Dr. Ghogomu will next incorporate the antibodies into the Ampli Block platform to create prototype diagnostic tests. The collaboration between Dr. Ghogomu and Dr. Bach, and the follow- on partnership between Dr. Ghogomu and the Ampli Block developers, exemplify BVGH's strategic support for WIPO Re:Search product R&D programs across multiple stages of development.

Yaws (endemic treponematoses) Through WIPO Re:Search, companies can complement their internal R&D and bolster their portfolios with promising collaborations to address antimicrobial resistance and other unmet medical needs for neglected infectious diseases. 33 Optimizing Collaborative R&DDiversifying Disease Portfolios Rabies is invariably fatal without intervention. Due to lack of affordability, there is a scarcity of rabies vaccines in the countries that need them most. Further, current rabies vaccines require cold storage \u2014 making distribution to field locations without refrigeration difficult, if not impossible. BVGH connected Dr. H\u00e9la Kallel at the Institut Pasteur Tunis with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to help overcome these challenges. Dr. Kallel utilized NIAID's suite of preclinical services for the development of a thermostable formulation, and she is adapting this formulation to her more affordable and more accessible vaccine. Adapting a Rabies Vaccine for Tropical Heat Once clinical symptoms appear in a person, rabies is almost always fatal. Did you know? WIPO Re:Search opens new opportunities for companies and researchers around neglected infectious diseases. With a unique model that encourages promising research across geographic and institutional borders, BVGH targets and connects the experts who are driving innovation in these disease areas. The result: new pathways to solving otherwise neglected diseases. The vast network of research collaborations fostered by BVGH yields centers of expertise, assets, and excellence that WIPO Re:Search Members can draw from. For companies, this means savings in time and funding in gaining access to expert collaborators in specialized or remote locations. For researchers, this means gaining access to valuable resources that will spur their work forward. NIH IP T unis 34 Not caught early, Chagas disease can lead to serious heart, neurological, and digestive tract complications. Dr. Momar Ndao at McGill University identified a novel biomarker that could facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis as well as assessment of cure after treatment. Dr. Ndao joined forces with Dr. Horacio Bach at the University of British Columbia through a BVGH-coordinated WIPO Re:Search partnership to develop antibodies against the biomarkers that could potentially be incorporated into a simplified point-of-care diagnostic assay. In treating Buruli ulcer, antibiotics are a vast improvement over former options, which involved surgery, skin grafting, hospitalization, higher costs, and a higher reoccurrence rate. Yet current medications can cause serious side effects such as hearing loss. BVGH linked Dr. Tianyu Zhang at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health to Prof. Fabrice Boyom at the University of Yaound\u00e9 I to test Dr. Zhang's late-stage antibiotic candidate TB47 against Buruli ulcer strains from infected patients from multiple parts of Cameroon. By facilitating the testing of these additional strains, WIPO Re:Search is helping to advance a new treatment through preclinical assessments in preparation for moving into clinical trials.Partnering on a Novel Biomarker for Chagas Disease Accessing Ndao, McGill University Buruli ulcer is in the same family of organisms that cause leprosy and tuberculosis.

UBC/McGill U U Yaound\u00e9 I/GIBH 35 Optimizing Collaborative R&DDiversifying Collaboration Strategies Leveraging Assets to Fuel Antimalarial Drug Discovery As resistance emerges to frontline antimalarials, the development of novel therapies is urgently required. When creating new antimalarials, researchers may target specific stages of the malaria parasite's lifecycle. One such stage, and a trademark of malaria infection, involves the parasite invading and replicating within human red blood cells. Plasmepsin V (PMV), a Plasmodium aspartyl protease enzyme that plays a key role in the parasite's evasion of the human immune response, is a promising drug target. Importantly, PMV has been validated as a drug target for both P. falciparum and P. vivax \u2014 the two most virulent malaria parasites capable of infecting humans. MSD* was interested in identifying collaborators who could evaluate its chemical libraries of protease inhibitors for antimalarial drug discovery. With assistance from BVGH, MSD identified Prof. Alan Cowman, Dr. Justin Boddey, and Dr. Brad Sleebs at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Australia. Having worked on the validation of PMV as an antimalarial drug target, the team was well positioned to screen MSD's aspartyl protease inhibitor libraries to identify compounds that target plasmepsins in both P. falciparum and P. vivax . Established through WIPO Re:Search, this collaboration has now identified novel drug-like hit compounds that are active against the malaria parasite. Dr. Paola Favuzza, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchMSD WEHI Dr. Manuel de Lera Ruiz, MSD Working on a WIPO Re:Search-enabled public-private collaboration to discover drug candidates for malaria is an amazing experience. The teamwork, energy, and inventive spirit within the program are infectious. Alan Cowman and his team are dedicated discovery scientists that make breakthrough science exciting. Dr. Manuel de Lera Ruiz, Associate Principal Scientist, Medicinal Chemistry Lead, MSD 36Diversifying funding sources BVGH encouraged the MSD and WEHI team to pursue funding opportunities from the Wellcome Trust aimed at stimulating promising public-private partnerships such as theirs. Of the two Wellcome Trust awards the team has received, the most recent endowed the team with over US $3.5 million to accelerate their collaborative research program. Having met ambitious first-year milestones, the team will continue their work in year two toward increasing drug potency and selectivity against malaria parasites. The MSD/WEHI collaboration has made some great progress identifying potent chemical matter that has also provided useful tools to decipher some important malaria biology. We are hopeful that our research will lead to a drug that will benefit those who suffer from the deadly effects of this horrible parasite. Prof. Alan Cowman, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research Prof. Alan Cowman, Dr. Justin Boddey, and Dr. Brad Sleebs, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research 37 Optimizing Collaborative R&DMSD WEHI *MSD is a trademark of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USARepurposing to Reduce Time, Cost, and Risk One of the key ways WIPO Re:Search accelerates the drug discovery process is by promoting the repurposing of existing drug compounds. Throughout history, drugs intended for one purpose have been found \u2014 often through serendipity and side effects \u2014 to have efficacy in other areas. Because such drugs have undergone safety testing, the potential time to market for new purposes can be shortened on the order of years, saving considerable development costs and resources. BVGH maintains the WIPO Re:Search Asset Repurposing Database, which tracks hundreds of compound classes available on a case-by-case basis from company Members with repurposing potential for neglected infectious diseases. Through WIPO Re:Search, BVGH facilitates the sharing of company compounds to drive drug discovery for those diseases. Excerpts from the WIPO Re:Search Asset Repurposing Database Compound Class Original Indication Potential for Repurposing Alzheimer's, urinary incontinence Angina, hypertension, insomnia Cancer, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, Human channel reductase inhibitors 38 Repurposing Compounds to Target Onchocerciasis Current treatments for onchocerciasis are ineffective against adult Onchocerca volvulus worms and can lead to the death of patients co-infected with Loa loa, a parasite commonly found in West and Central Africa. Through WIPO Re:Search, BVGH connected Prof. Fidelis Cho-Ngwa at the University of Buea with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany \u2014 a company committed to fostering Global North/South collaborations to accelerate neglected infectious disease R&D \u2014 to develop a medication with activity against both adult and juvenile O. volvulus but not Loa loa. With support from BVGH, the team received a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder Award for US $184,000 to support the initial screening. Prof. Cho-Ngwa identified several promising hits in a screen of over 5,500 company compounds. BVGH assisted the partners in identifying a medicinal chemistry expert to collaborate on hit-to-lead optimization, and they are co-preparing a grant proposal to fund this work. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany will contribute corporate affairs, patents, global health, and medicinal chemistry expertise to support the advancement of this drug development program. Prof. Fidelis Cho-Ngwa, University of Merck KGaA, Through our Open Innovation Initiative, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany is committed to addressing access challenges around affordability by sharing our proprietary knowledge to accelerate early discovery for disease areas where we do not have competencies or expertise, such as onchocerciasis or Buruli ulcer. Our aim is to contribute to a vibrant pipeline for these diseases as well as capacity building and health system strengthening in the countries where many of these diseases are endemic. Dr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Santerre, Global Head, Access to Health, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany 39 Optimizing Collaborative R&DRepurposing Compounds to Target Parasites Drs. Alexis Kaushansky and Bart Staker at the Seattle Children's Research Institute (SCRI) are working to further anti-parasitic drug discovery. They have previously demonstrated the efficacy of cancer drugs \u2014 specifically Bcl-2 family inhibitors \u2014 in parasitic infections such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Through WIPO Re:Search and BVGH, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited provided the investigators with compounds of this class to support the expansion of their screening efforts to include other neglected parasitic infections. The SCRI researchers are currently screening the compounds to identify strong candidates for further development. Prof. Fabrice Boyom at the University of Yaound\u00e9 I aims to develop novel drugs for human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and malaria by targeting critical parasite metabolic pathways. With assistance from BVGH, Prof. Boyom applied for funding from Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and the African Academy of Sciences' Grand Challenges Africa. After he expressed interest in obtaining compounds that may inhibit metabolic pathways of interest, BVGH connected him through WIPO Re:Search to Eisai Co., Ltd., which supported his funding proposals by sharing dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors and potassium channel blockers. As a result, Prof. Boyom received both the MMV and the Grand Challenges Africa awards. He has since identified promising hits and is working with collaborators to conduct further tests. Dr. Alexis Kaushansky, Seattle Children's Research Institute Prof. Fabrice Boyom, University Through WIPO Re:Search, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at NIH have entered into a research collaboration to examine the feasibility of using Takeda's microneedle patch technology to administer a transmission-blocking malaria vaccine developed by Dr. Patrick Duffy and Dr. Puthupparampil Scaria at NIAID's Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology. Transmission-blocking vaccines are novel among malaria vaccine approaches, targeting the parasite's life cycle in the mosquito vector, rather than preventing infection within the human host. While transmission-blocking vaccines do not directly prevent infection, they rely on herd immunity to interrupt continued transmission of parasites, thereby reducing infections across the community with the ultimate goal to eliminate malaria. As its name suggests, microneedle patches comprise a series of minute needles much smaller than the needles used to administer standard vaccines. The patches are composed of materials that can help improve the encased vaccine's stability in hot climates such as those found in malaria-endemic regions. If NIAID's studies of the patch prove successful, this collaboration has the strong potential to result in a malaria vaccine that is truly suited to the healthcare needs of malaria-endemic low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the patches could eliminate the need for vaccine storage in freezers or refrigerators; healthcare professionals trained on the proper use of needles; and control of contaminated needle disposal. Since children comprise the majority of malaria illnesses and deaths globally, microneedle patches could also improve coverage in this population by offering a less-painful alternative to conventional, injectable vaccines.

More than just a buzzword, open innovation represents a company's commitment to sharing its greatest strengths\u2014its intellectual property, technologies, and expertise\u2014outside its walls to drive the development of life-changing products. Open innovation is particularly important for neglected infectious diseases, which affect one-seventh of the world's population but benefit from only a small fraction of global research and development (R&D) resources. Through WIPO Re:Search, BVGH connects academic and non-profit global health researchers to industry assets that they might not otherwise have been aware of, or been able to access. This section showcases the combined power of BVGH's strategic partnering approach (described on pages 12-15) and industry open innovation to advance neglected infectious disease R&D around the world. Technologies Intellectual property Expertise Diagnostics Vaccines Drugs Transforming Company Assets into Life-Changing Products 43 Harnessing Open Innovation\"Jump-stARt\"ing Drug Development for Deadly Diseases Sharing Molecular Libraries to Fight Neglected Infectious Diseases and Pandemic Threats As part of Johnson & Johnson's global public health commitment, Janssen has made available its Jump- stARter library through WIPO Re:Search. Johnson & Johnson medicinal chemists reviewed millions of proprietary molecules and voted on those with the greatest potential for drug development. This resulted in a diverse collection of 80,000 high-quality drug-like small molecules and compound fragments created to \"jump-start\" collaborations with a broad array of drug discovery researchers to identify and advance promising drug candidates. To help get those compounds into scientists' hands as quickly as possible, the company created a material transfer agreement template to expedite negotiations with recipients and established processes for efficient preparation and shipment of the library. When drug discovery researchers identify compounds (or hits) within the library that have interesting activity in their assay systems, Johnson & Johnson divulges the structures of those hits to inform and enable follow-on R&D. On a case-by-case basis, Johnson & Johnson also provides in-kind support to help move particularly promising compounds closer to the clinic. # Through WIPO Re:Search, BVGH has connected us with outstanding scientific partners around the world, uniting their expertise and Johnson & Johnson's resources to catalyze neglected infectious disease R&D with the aim of creating new drugs. Without the Consortium, we would not have had the opportunity to share our Jump-stARter library and other assets so broadly, to potentially develop better solutions for these devastating diseases. Dr. Paul Jackson, S cient ific Director, Johnson & Johnson J&J 44 BVGH has coordinated the sharing of the Jump-stARter library across the WIPO Re:Search network to combat diseases that cause millions of deaths each year and for which better drugs are urgently needed. Those diseases include: The World Health Organization sounded an alarm in its World Malaria Report 2018, noting that progress against the disease has stalled after years of unprecedented successes. The Report called parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines a major threat to malaria control. Through WIPO Re:Search, Prof. Alan Cowman and Dr. Brad Sleebs at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) are partnering with Johnson & Johnson to develop a new drug that attacks malaria parasites in a different way than existing therapies, in order to bypass resistance mechanisms. The WEHI team identified several hit compounds in their initial screens that not only had excellent antimalarial activity, but also appeared to kill the parasites through novel molecular pathways. Building on those exciting results, the WEHI researchers and Johnson & Johnson are chemically modifying the hits to improve their potency and drug-like properties in preparation for preclinical testing. Prof. Alan Cowman and Dr. Brad Sleebs, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical ResearchMalaria J&J Jump-stARter library WEHI screening platform Identification of hit compounds with novel antimalarial activityJ&J WEHI 45 Harnessing Open InnovationTuberculosis Dr. Christina Stallings and research scientist Sthefany Chavez, Washington University in St. Louis After identifying multiple hits in her first set of screens, Dr. Stallings is now testing the inhibitory activity of additional Johnson & Johnson compounds with similar chemical structures. The results of those studies will help company scientists chemically modify the initial hits to produce lead compounds with better activity for further development and testing. I am grateful to BVGH for introducing me to Johnson & Johnson who might not otherwise have returned my calls! to take my tuberculosis drug discovery research to the next level. We have received not only high-quality compound libraries for screening, but also scientific expertise and logistical support for our ongoing development of the most promising compounds. I am energized by our successes to date and by the prospect of improving tuberculosis treatment for millions of people worldwide. Dr. Christina Stallings, Washington University in St. Louis J&J WUSTL Multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) strikes over 550,000 people each year. Nearly half of patients are treated unsuccessfully with existing agents, potentially leaving them both ill and able to transmit the disease to others. Through WIPO Re:Search, BVGH connected Dr. Christina Stallings at Washington University in St. Louis to Johnson & Johnson to develop an inhibitor of an enzyme critical for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth and virulence. A drug targeting this enzyme could potentially be a safe and effective treatment for MDR/RR-TB, given that the enzyme is not found in humans (reducing the risk of serious side effects) and is not inhibited by current antitubercular medicines (decreasing the likelihood that M. tuberculosis has already acquired resistance). 46 Similarly, Prof. Tanya Parish, a drug discovery scientist at the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI), was connected with Johnson & Johnson through WIPO Re:Search and BVGH to target M. tuberculosis residing within human macrophages. Her team's novel high-content imaging system permits the identification of compounds that kill M. tuberculosis in macrophages without harming the macrophages. Results from the Jump-stARter library screening are expected by the end of 2019. Prof. Tanya Parish, Infectious Disease Research Institute Dr. Clif Barry and Dr. Helena Boshoff, National Institutes of Health While the burden of tuberculosis is widely recognized by the global health community, leishmaniasis \u2014 which afflicts more than 12 million people worldwide \u2014 is often given less attention. The most common form, cutaneous leishmaniasis, causes skin lesions and ulcers leading to scarring, disability, and stigma. Although newer treatments are superior to older medicines, life-threatening side effects are still a major concern. In parallel with their WIPO Re:Search tuberculosis drug discovery activities, Prof. Parish and her group at IDRI are using their high-content imaging system to find Jump-stARter compounds with selective activity against Leishmania donovani within human cells. They anticipate completing the initial screens by the end of 2019.LeishmaniasisJ&J NIH IDRI BVGH is facilitating a WIPO Re:Search collaboration between Johnson & Johnson and tuberculosis researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). M. tuberculosis can survive and reproduce inside human macrophages, eventually killing the cells and suppressing the body's immune response to the infection. Dr. Clif Barry and Dr. Helena Boshoff at NIH found several Jump-stARter compounds that inhibited M. tuberculosis growth under conditions similar to those within infected macrophages. Using those data, along with the results of ongoing studies of structurally similar compounds, Johnson & Johnson will chemically optimize the most active compounds. The partners will then validate the resultant lead candidates in laboratory and preclinical studies. 47 Harnessing Open InnovationTreating Malaria by Sugar Deprivation GSK established the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation in 2010 as a demonstration of its commitment to open innovation and creation of new medicines for diseases of the developing world (including Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, and tuberculosis). The Open Lab is an incubator that provides selected researchers with funding and access to GSK facilities, resources, and expertise to help them advance their own drug discovery projects. By introducing GSK to WIPO Re:Search investigators with whom they might not otherwise have engaged, BVGH is supporting corporate objectives while also stimulating neglected infectious disease R&D through broader access to the company's assets. Those assets include the Tres Cantos Antimalarial Set (TCAMS), a library of over 13,000 compounds with activity against the blood-stage form of Plasmodium falciparum. Over 80 percent of the compounds were new to the malaria research community when GSK compiled the library in 2010. GSK has been active in WIPO Re:Search since its inception, as well as in its predecessor, the Pool for Open Innovation against Neglected Tropical Diseases (POINT) program. It has enabled opportunities for GSK scientists to connect with talented and innovative scientists across the globe to advance our research and partnership goals. Dr. Mike Strange, Head, Global Catalyst, GSK GSK 48 Dr. Audrey Odom John, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia GSK WUSTL Dr. Paul Hruz, Washington University in St. Louis Libraries such as TCAMS, particularly when accompanied by chemical structures and data, are excellent starting points for drug discovery programs - including the work of Dr. Audrey Odom John and Dr. Paul Hruz at Washington University in St. Louis.* In response to growing concern about antimalarial resistance, Dr. Odom John and Dr. Hruz aim to develop a drug that acts through a novel mechanism to which P. falciparum remains susceptible. Malaria parasites within the human host rely on sugars taken up from the host's blood to produce energy, suggesting that depriving the parasites of such sugars may be lethal. The researchers have developed a high-throughput screening assay system to identify compounds that prevent P. falciparum hexose transporter from importing sugars from the blood, without affecting the activity of similar human transporters. BVGH connected the team to GSK, who agreed to share TCAMS through WIPO Re:Search. Dr. Odom John and Dr. Hruz found several hits in their initial screens, and validation of hit activity is ongoing. * Dr. Odom John is now at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 49 Harnessing Open Innovation Fighting Buruli Ulcer through Global North/South Collaborations Buruli ulcer, a bacterial disease found mostly in Central and West Africa, destroys skin and soft tissue, resulting in large necrotic ulcers. Primarily affecting children, the disease causes significant long-term functional disability and permanent deformity unless diagnosed and treated early. In addition to requiring frequent visits to health clinics over a period of several weeks \u2014 which is not always practical in remote areas \u2014 current medicines can also cause severe side effects such as hearing loss. BVGH recently coordinated a WIPO Re:Search collaboration between Prof. Fabrice Boyom of the University of Yaound\u00e9 I in Cameroon and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany to develop a safer Buruli ulcer drug that can be administered over a shorter time frame. Prof. Boyom will screen the company's Mini Library \u2014 a diverse set of drug-like compounds with a broad range of molecular targets \u2014 for activity against Mycobacterium ulcerans, with an eye on the ultimate goal of reducing the suffering caused by Buruli ulcer. \"Through WIPO Re:Search, I am collaborating with leading international companies and scientists to repurpose pharmaceutical compounds and Cameroonian medicinal plants as new drugs for Buruli ulcer, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and malaria. Thanks to the Consortium and the partnerships that BVGH has facilitated, I have new scientific publications, additional grant funding to pursue neglected infectious disease R&D, and increased visibility of my research, \" said Prof. Boyom. Prof. Fabrice Boyom, University Germany The WIPO Re:Search platform provides a great network and excellent opportunities for collaborations in the neglected tropical disease space. We have supported this initiative for many years and were able to start new exciting projects, alongside our existing collaborations, through the use of our Mini Library. This open-source approach contributes a lot to addressing Access to Health (A2H) challenges. Dr. Arno Hartmann, Vice President, Head, Patents Healthcare, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany 50 Combatting Chagas Disease, a Significant Public Health Problem in Latin America Novartis partners to support drug discovery for neglected diseases and to help foster research capabilities in low- and middle-income countries. Novartis' partnership with Dr. Artur Cordeiro at de Bioci\u00eancias (LNBio) \u2014 the first WIPO Re:Search collaboration for the Brazilian institute \u2014 merged those interests to conduct collaborative research focused on Chagas disease. Also known as American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease affects an estimated eight million people, mainly in Latin America. Dr. Cordeiro previously discovered compounds that inhibit two key Trypanosoma cruzi enzymes and are active against the parasite within human cells. To assist Dr. Cordeiro in identifying additional active compounds to move his drug discovery work forward, BVGH introduced him to Novartis. After securing a grant from S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) to cover his expenses, Dr. Cordeiro traveled to Cambridge, USA, where he screened thousands of proprietary Novartis compounds through the company's Facilitated Access to Screening Technologies (FAST) Lab program. In addition to having access to Novartis' facilities, he also benefited from technical support and mentorship from scientists at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. Dr. Cordeiro returned to LNBio with data for both drug targets and new chemical structures with good activity. Drs. Gustavo Fernando Mercaldi of Novartis.
