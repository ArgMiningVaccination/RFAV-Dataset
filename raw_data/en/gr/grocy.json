Her laboratory's re search program explores relation ships between biological organisms and their responses a fter exposure to environmental c ontaminants with a specific focus on the immune system and its interactions with the nervou s system during development and adulthood. A particular focus of the research program is on emerging aquatic contaminants, especially per- and po lyflouroalkyl substances (PFAS). Dr. DeWi tt has published extensively on their toxicity as well as e diting a book on their toxicity. She has served as an e xternal reviewer for the U.S. Environmental Prot ection Agency health effects ass essment of perfluorooctanoic Program's immune effects assessment of PFOA and PFOS, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry toxicological p rofile for PFASs, and was a mem ber of the Inter national Agency for Research on Cancer working gro up for the assessment of the carcinogenicity of PFOA. Her laboratory is currently assessi ng the immunotox icity of emergin g PFAS that have been designed to replace those that have been phased out of production and th at are of concern in North Carolina. Dr. DeWitt double-majo red in Environmental Science an d Biology for her bachelor's degree from Michigan State Uni versity and has doctoral degrees in Environmental Science and Neural Science from Indiana Univ ersity- Bloomington. She comple ted postdoctoral training in Indiana Univ ersity- Bloomington and in immunot oxicology at the US Environmental Protection Agency i n partnership with the Univers ity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Jamie C.
