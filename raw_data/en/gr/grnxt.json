Keeping Our Community Healthy Hillsborough Pharmacy and Nutrition was opened in 2011 and is an independent, full-service pharmacy. From day one, providing excellent customer service has been the top priority. We understand our customers are busy people, therefore we believe it is possible, no matter how busy we are, to accurately fill prescriptions in 15 minutes or less. Unlike the big chains, we take the time to get to know our customers and their needs accepting all types of insurance. Whether it is a prescription or non-prescription item, the professional caring staff at Hillsborough Pharmacy will always take the time to answer your questions or ease your concerns. Our Beliefs Being an independently owned pharmacy gives us the freedom to be creative in finding new ways to meet our customers' needs. We do not subscribe to the \"one size fits all\" philosophy. To the contrary, we believe our success comes from our willingness and ability to go out of our way to find those hard-to-find items our customers are looking for. Whether it is an old-time remedy or a new product that's not as common, our staff will exhaust all resources in trying to find whatever our customers desire. As a member of the community, Hillsborough Pharmacy is a regular contributor to the local schools, churches, booster clubs and civic organizations. We do everything that big box pharmacies do, just faster and with better service.
