Here are four ways a juice cleanse will benefit your health and help you feel better.", "sitename": "Z.E.N. Foods", "date": "2020-03-05", "cleaned_text": "4 Ways a Juice Cleanse Will Benefit Your Health There are many different plant-based diets around today. One of these is the juice cleanse. A juice cleanse is a diet that typically lasts three to ten days during which you only consume natural juices. There are many different juice cleanse recipes and potential benefits of drinking the juices from one fruit or vegetable over another. Here are four ways that a juice cleanse may enhance your health according to Medical News Today. 1. Juice cleanse recipes are high in nutrients. Fruits and vegetables are high in many different vitamins and minerals. For example, many types of produce contain potassium, dietary fiber, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin C. Doing a cleanse could increase the number of beneficial nutrients in the body. This may increase your overall health. 2. A juice cleanse is anti-inflammatory. Many people know the feeling - you ate too much salty, sugary junk food, and now you feel bloated and gross. You will feel the opposite when doing a juice cleanse. Fruit and veggie juices are high in anti-inflammatory compounds. These can help boost your immune system, prevent common diseases like the cold, and make you feel more energetic and clear. 3. Juice cleanses are great for detoxing. Not only are juices anti-inflammatory and immune system boosting, but they also flush toxins from the body. Doing a cleanse can rid your body of excess waste and help \"clean out\" your digestive tract. Detoxing with a juice cleanse can be just the thing to get your body back on track for living a healthy lifestyle. Cleanses may also support weight loss. Since toxins are being pushed out of the body, it makes sense that you would lose a little weight. However, juice cleanses are not an effective long-term weight-loss strategy, as they only last for a short period of time. Doing a juice cleanse before starting a new healthy diet may be a good way to jumpstart your weight loss. 4. A juice cleanse can help improve digestion. Juices don't just flush toxins out of the digestive system. They also bring in healthy enzymes that can help improve your digestion in the future. This makes the entire digestive process run more efficiently and effectively. Juice cleanse results are different for everyone. It would be wise to talk to your doctor before doing a cleanse to discuss any possible health risks to the diet. Have you been searching \" find a juice cleanse near me\"?
