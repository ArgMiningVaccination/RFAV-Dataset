Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5) days prior to the hearing. For ar rangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure that the state rules are consistent with federal regulations and to update federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2015. This rulemaking reconciles Idaho's state rules with federal regulations by making three minor revisions: 1.The greenhouse gas definition of major source at Section 008 is now obsolete after the federal definition was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. This definition is being removed. 2.The federal regulations incorporated by reference are updated by capturing revisions as of July 1, 2015 (Section107) and by removing two federal provisions that are no longer required (Sections107.03.q. and 564). 3.The permit to construct section (Section 200) is clarified to define a major source to include both the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and nona ttainment new source review definitions. The current rule implies that only the PSD definition applies. Idaho is required by federal law to implement both as appropriate. Members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules, special interest groups, public officials, and members of the public who have an interest in the regulation of air emissions from sources in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2015 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2016 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. DEQ will submit the final rule to EPA for approval. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Incorporation by reference is necessary to ensure that the state rules are consistent with federal regulations. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule.NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. DEQ determined that negotiated rulemaking is not feasible due to the simple nature of this rulemaking and because DEQ has no discretion with respect to adopting federal regulations that are necessary for EPA approval of Idah o's Title V Operating Permit Program and state primacy of Clean Air Act programs. When ever possible, DEQ incorporates federal regulations by reference to ensure that the state rules are consistent with federal regulations.Wednesday, September 9, 2015, 3:00 p.m. Department of Environmental Quality Conference Room A 1410 N.

If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held.THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED WITH THE PROPOSED RULEDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0105-1501 Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste PENDING RULE S - HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 366 2016 PENDING RULE BOOKDESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY : Idaho's Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). This proposed rule updates federal regulations incorporated by re ference to include those revised as of July 1, 2015. In addition, this rulemaking also denotes areas of the rules th at are non-delegable to the states and must be implemented by EPA. In those instances, \"EPA\" will be defined as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Groups interested in hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2015 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2016 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: Idaho has historically adopted both required and optiona l federal regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows DEQ to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current. Adoption by referen ce also simplifies compliance for the regulated community. Information for obtaining a copy of the federal regulations is included in the rule. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. DEQ determined that negotiated rulemaking is not feasible due to the simple nature of this rulemaking and because DEQ has no discretion with respect to adopting EPA's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA). Whenever possible, DEQ incorporates federal regulations by reference to ensure that the stat e rules are consistent with federal regulations. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Not applicable. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on questions concerning the proposed rulemaking, contact Matt Alvarado at matt.alvarado@deq.idaho.gov or (208)373-0554. Anyone can submit written comments by mail, fax or e-mail at the address below regarding this proposed rule. The Department will consider all written comments received by the undersigned on or before September 2, 2015. Dated this 5th Day of August, 2015.

The Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the RTCR on February 13, 2013. The RTCR is intended to increase public health protection through the reduction of potential pathways of entry for fecal contamination into public water distribution systems. To maintain primary enforcement authority, Idaho is required to adopt the RTCR by April 2016. The RTCR contains some options to negotiate. The RTCR establishes a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for E.coli and uses E.coli and total coliform positive results to initiate or trigger assessments and follow up corrections as a \"find and fix\" approach to address fecal contamination that could enter into the distributi on system. The rule removes the total coliform MCL and replaces it with a trigger level under which to perform an as sessment. This rule also requires systems that operate seasonally to follow start-up procedures unless the system qualifies for an exemption from these procedures. Most of the substantive changes in the rule include performin g assessments and changes in monitoring requirements. DEQ proposes to incorporate most of the RTCR by refere nce from 40 CFR 141, Subpart Y, which addresses the definitions, sample siting plans, MCLs, assessment triggers and requirements, as well as monitoring and reporting requirements. Incorporation by reference simplifies the ov erall rule and reduces agency costs for rulemaking. The negotiated rulemaking committee did discuss portions of the rule where options exist, which include reduced monitoring provisions, qualifications of assessors for Level 2 Assessments, criteria for waiving seasonal system start-up requirements, methods for consulting with the state, and types of sanitary defects. Additionally, there are some changes DEQ proposes to make to the Idaho Rules for Public Drinking Water Systems that are not associated with the RTCR. These changes should provide clarification and remove unnecessary requirements and include removing the lower temperature flow criteria for slow-sand filters, adding flushing as an adequate means to remove contamination following depres surization, and providing clarifying language for the types of chemicals allowed in performing tracer studies to demonstrate disinfection contact time. Drinking water system owners and operators, developers, consultants, engineers, cities, counties, industry, drinking water professional organizations, and the public at large may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. La nguage the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in the fall of 2015 for adoption of a pe nding rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon adjournment of the 2016 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: This proposed rule incorporates federal regulations by reference. Incorporation by reference is necessary to ensure that the state rules are consistent with federal re gulations. An electronic copy of the federal regulations incorporated by reference can be obtained at www.gpoaccess.gov/ecfr . NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5220 and IDAPA 58.01.23.810-815. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the April 2015 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 15-4 , and a preliminary draft rule was made available for public review. A meeting was held on April 22, 2015. Several members of the public participated in this negotiated rulemaking process by attending the meeting. The negotiated rulemaking record, which includes the negotiated rule drafts, and documents distributed during the negotiated rulemaking process, is available at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0108-1501. All comments received during the negotiated rulemaki ng process were considered by DEQ when making decisions that resulted in drafting the proposed rule. At the conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking process, DEQ formatted the final rule draft for publication as a proposed rule. DEQ is now seeking public comment on the proposed rule.DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0108-1501 Idaho Rules for Public Drinki ng Water Systems PENDING RULE S - HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE PAGE 375 2016 PENDING RULE BOOKIDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more stringent than federal regulations.

Material Modification . Those modifications of an existing pu blic water system that are intended to increase system capacity or alter the methods or pro cesses employed. Any project that adds source water to a system, increases the pumping capacity of a system, increases the potential population served by the system or the number of service connections within the system, adds new or alters existing drinking water system components, or affects the water demand of the system is considered to be in creasing system capacity or altering the methods or processes employed. Maintenance and repair performed on th e system and the replacement of valves, pumps, or other similar items with new items of the same size and type are not considered a material modification.

A level of a disinfectant added for water treatment that may not be exceeded at the consumer's ta p without an unacceptable possi bility of adverse health effects. For chlorine and chloramines, a public water sy stem is in compliance with the MRDL, when the running annual average of monthly averages of samples taken in the distribution system, computed quarterly, is less than or equal to the MRDL. For chlorine dioxide, a public water sy stem is in compliance with the MRDL when daily samples are taken at the entrance to the distribution system and no two (2) consecutive daily samples exceed the MRDL. MRDLs are enforceable in the same manner as maximum contaminant levels under Section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. There is convincing evidence that ad dition of a disinfectant is necessary for control of waterborne microbial contaminants. Notwithstanding the MRDLs listed in 40 CFR 141.65, operators may increase residual disinfectant levels of chlorine or chloramines (but not chlorine dioxide) in the distribution system to a level and for a time necessary to protect public health to ad dress specific microbiological contamination problems caused by circumstances such as distribution line breaks, st orm runoff events, source water contamination, or cross- connections. (4-4-13) 757. Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level Goal (MRDLG) . The maximum level of a disinfectant added for water treatment at which no known or anticipated adverse effect on the health of persons would occur, and which allows an adequate margin of safety. MRDLGs are nonenforceable health goals and do not reflect the benefit of the addition of the chemical for control of waterborne microbial contaminants. (4-5-00) 768. Membrane Filtration .

(12-10-92) (ii) Step 2: Add the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values for all sequences. The result is the total inactivation ratio. (12-10-92) (2) If the system uses more than one point of disinfect ant application at or before the first customer, the system must determine the CT value of each disinfection se quence immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application during peak hour demand. The sum of the (CTcalc/CT99.9) values from all sequences is the total inactivation ratio. (CTcalc/CT99.9) must be determined by the methods described in 40 CFR 141.74(b)(4)(i)(B). (5-8-09) v. Log removal credit for disinfection shall be determined by multiplying the total inactivation ratio by three (3). (12-10-92) vi. The Department may reduce the CT monitoring requirements specified under Section 300, for any system which demonstrates that the required inactivation levels are consistently exceed ed. Reduced CT monitoring shall be allowed only where the reduction in monitoring will not endanger the health of consumers served by the water system.

The minimum capacity of eight hundred (800) gallons per day shall be the design maximum day demand rate exclusive of irrigation and fire flow requirements. (5-8-09) ii. The minimum capacity of eight hundred (800) gallons per day is only acceptable if the public drinking water system has equalization storage of finished water in sufficient quantity to compensate for the difference between a water system's maximum pu mping capacity and peak hour demand. (5-8-09) iii. The design capacity of a public drinking water system for material modifications may be less than eight hundred (800) gallons per day per residence if the water system owner provides information that demonstrates to the Department's satisfaction the maximum day demand fo r the system, exclusive of irrigation and fire flows, is less than eight hundred (800) gallons per day per residence. (5-8-09) b.Pressure. All public water systems shall meet the following requirements: (4-7-11) i. Any public water system shall be capable of providing sufficient water during maximum day demand conditions, including fire flow where provided, to maintain a minimum pressure of twenty (20) psi throughout the distribution system, at ground level, as measured at the service connection or along the property line adjacent to the consumer's premises. (4-7-11) ii. Public Notification. (4-4-13) (1) During unplanned or emergency situations, when water pressure within the system is known to have fallen below twenty (20) psi, the water supplier must notify the Department, provide public notice to the affected customers within twenty-four (24) hours, and disinfect or flush the system as appropriate . When sampling and corrective procedures have been conducted and after determination by the Department that the water is safe, the water supplier may re-notify the affected customers that the water is safe for consumption. The water supplier shall notify the affected customers if the water is not safe for consumption. (4-4-13)( ) (2) During planned maintenance or repair situations, when water pressure within the system is expected to fall below twenty (20) psi, the water supplier mu st provide public notice to th e affected customers prior to the planned maintenance or repair activity and shall ensure that the water is safe for consumption. (4-4-13) iii. If an initial investigation by the water supplier fails to discover the causes of inadequate or excessive pressure, the Department may require the water supplier to conduct a local pressure monitoring study to diagnose and correct pressure problems. Compliance with these requirements by water systems that do not have a meter vault or other point of access at the service connecti on or along the property line adjacent to the consumer's premises where pressure in the distribution system can be reliably measured shall be determined by measurements within the consumer's premises, or at another repr esentative location acceptable to the Department. (4-4-13) iv. Copies of pressure monitoring study reports required under Subsection 552.01.b.iii. detailing study results and any resulting corrective actions planned or performed by the public water system shall be submitted to the Department in accordance with these rules. (4-7-11) v. The following public water systems or service areas of public water systems shall maintain a minimum pressure of forty (40) psi throughout the distribution system, during peak hour demand conditions, excluding fire flow, measured at the service connection or along the property line adjacent to the consumer's premises.

Any public water system shall keep static pres sure within the distribution system below one hundred (100) psi and should ordinarily keep static pressure below eighty (80) psi. Pressures above one hundred (100) psi shall be controlled by pressure reducing valve sta tions installed in the distribution main. In areas where failure of installed pressure reducing valve stations would result in extremely high pressure, pressure relief valves may be required. The Department may approve the use of pr essure reducing devices at i ndividual service connections on a case by case basis, if it can be demonstrated that higher pressures in portions of the distribution system are required for efficient system operation. If system modificatio n will cause pressure to rou tinely exceed eighty (80) psi, or if a check valve or an individual pressure reducing devi ce is added to the service line, the water system owner shall notify affected customers. Notification may include reasons for the elevated pressure , problems or damage that elevated pressure can inflict on appliances or plumbing systems, and suggested procedures or mitigation efforts affected property owners may initiate to minimize problems or damage. (4-4-13) vii. The Department may allow the installation of booster pump systems at individual service connections on a case by case basis. However, such an in stallation may only occur with the full knowledge and agreement of the public water system, including assurance by the water system that the individual booster pump will cause no adverse effects on system operation. (4-11-06) viii. For elevated storage tanks, pressure calculations during peak hour demand shall be based on the lowest water level after both operational storage and equali zation storage have been exhausted. Pressure calculations during fire flow demands shall be based on the lowest water level after operational storage, equalization storage, and fire suppression storage have been exhausted. (4-4-13) ix. For hydropneumatic tanks, pressure calculations shall be based on the lowest pressure of the pressure cycle and this requirement shall be noted in the operation and maintenance manual. (4-4-13) c.Fire Flows.

(5-3-03) (1) The Department must concur with assumptions regarding the acreage to be irrigated. In general, an assumption that no outside watering will occur is considered unsound and is unlikely to be approved. (5-3-03) (2) An assumption of minimal outside watering, as in recreational subdivisio ns, may be acceptable if design flows are adequate for maintenance of \"green zones\" for protection against wildland fire. (5-3-03) ii. The requirement of Subsection 552.01.d.i. may be modified by the Department if: (5-3-03) (1) A separate irrigation system is provided; or (12-10-92) (2) The supplier of water can regulate the rate of irrigation through its police powers, and the water system is designed to accommodate a regulated rate of irrigation flow.
