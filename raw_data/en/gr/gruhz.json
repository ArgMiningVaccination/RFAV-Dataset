A great deal of pharmaceutical research done in technologically advanced countries like USA, Germany, France, Japan and China has considerably improved quality of the herbal medicines used in the treatment of cancer. With advanced knowledge of molecular science and refinement in isolation & structure elucidation techniques, we are in a much better position to identify various anticancer herbs and develop the remedy that might cure cancer. The therapeutic effect of anticancer herbs is executed by inhibiting cancer-activating enzymes, stimulating DNA repair mechanism, promoting production of protective enzymes, inducing antioxidant action and by enhancing activity of the immune cells. Some herbs protect the body from cancer by enhancing detoxification functions of the body. Certain biological response modifiers derived from herbs are known to inhibit growth of cancer by modulating the activity of specific ho... Integrative Cancer Therapies 2006 An integrative approach for managing a patient with cancer should target the multiple biochemical and physiological pathways that support tumor development while minimizing normal tissue toxicity. Angiogenesis is a key process in the promotion of cancer. Many natural health products that inhibit angiogenesis also manifest other anticancer activities. The authors will focus on natural health products (NHPs) that have a high degree of antiangiogenic activity but also describe some of their many other interactions that can inhibit tumor progression and reduce the risk of metastasis. NHPs target various molecular pathways besides angiogenesis, including epidermal factor receptor (EGFR), the HER-2/neu gene, the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme, the NF-kB the protein kinases, Bcl-2 protein, and coagulation pathways. The herbalist has access to hundreds of years of observational data on the anticancer activity of many herbs. Laboratory studies are confirming the knowled... Journal of Cancer Research Updates About 60% of chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of cancer diseases today have been derived from natural products. While some of these agents are identical to the natural molecules found in plants; the others are semisynthetic derivative of the foundational molecule found naturally in the raw sources. Cancers have been reported to express 10 specific hallmark which are used as the key points or steps for targeted therapy against these cancers. Extending the number of these hallmarks to 12 this review article throws light on 44 natural products classifying them according to their target of action. Further, the natural products under consideration are categorized according to the level of evidence present for their anticancer activities. Integrative Cancer Therapies 2002 Oxidative Stress and Disease 2011 Ayurvedic Science of Food and Nutrition 2013 Molecules Cancer is one of the main causes of death globally and considered as a major challenge for the public health system. The high toxicity and the lack of selectivity of conventional anticancer therapies make the search for alternative treatments a priority. In this review, we describe the main plant-derived natural products used as anticancer agents. Natural sources, extraction methods, anticancer mechanisms, clinical studies, and pharmaceutical formulation are discussed in this review. Studies covered by this review should provide a solid foundation for researchers and physicians to enhance basic and clinical research on developing alternative anticancer therapies.
