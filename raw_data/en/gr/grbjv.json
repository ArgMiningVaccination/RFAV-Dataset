Amy obtained her doctorate in naturopathic medicine in 2013 from an accredited naturopathic medical school, National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon. Although she graduated from LSU with a bachelor's degree in pre-med/dietetics, it would be seven years before she stumbled upon naturopathic medicine. During that time, she lived a \"reverse retirement\" in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, working and enjoying the epic beauty. As many people do, she worked an array of jobs while living the mountain lifestyle centered around outdoor activity and exercise. The longer she was there and the more she read about the reality of conventional medicine, the more she realized that would not be her path. Eventually, she attended a wellness conference hosted at the ski resort in downtown Jackson Hole. It was there that she was introduced to naturopathic medicine and started exploring her options. She knew immediately this was the type of healthcare she wanted to learn. You might be wondering what naturopathic medicine means and how it is different from an M.D. (medical/allopathic doctor) or D.O. (osteopathic doctor). The rigorous training integrates modern medicine and evidence-based research with traditional natural healing that has been used for centuries. Naturopathic medicine extensively integrates therapeutic nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, naturopathic manipulation/ orthopedics, and biochemistry in addition to basic medical school course work such as anatomy, physiology, cardiology, gynecology, pharmacology, etc. The six principles of naturopathic medicine illustrate our philosophy best: In the doctoral program, students begin treating patients under the supervision of their attending doctor during years 3 and 4, so upon graduation they are well equipped to help patients reach their natural health goals. Some students choose to complete residencies in their area of focus although they are not required to obtain a license. Currently, the United States has 26 jurisdictions that license or certify naturopathic doctors, allowing them to practice within a specific scope with varying limitations by state. It is important to note that in states that do not certify or license NDs, anyone that obtains a \"degree or certification\" online may use the term: naturopath, naturopathic doctor or naturopathic practitioner. It is important to research any provider you are considering to fully understand their qualifications. After spending 15 years out west, Amy moved back in Mississippi. She had three children under three and needed all the help she could get. While she and her family loved living in beautiful Bend, Oregon, the time came to be closer to her extended family, all the cousins that are the same age as her children, and day to day help with her own little ones. Amy, her husband, and their 3 children, ages 8, 6 and 5, have enjoyed all the perks of small-town life, especially riding to school in their golf cart. Beach life is an easy life with little ones, enjoying nature as their playground year-round. After moving back home to Mississippi, Amy transferred her license to Vermont as it is the closest state to the deep South that offers licensure. Over the past four years she has built a naturopathic wellness consulting business focusing on holistic women's health, especially in the area of natural hormonal balance.
