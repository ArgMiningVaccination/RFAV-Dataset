They are like tiny little soldiers waging war on the things that invade and make us sick. Many people think having a healthy immune system will prevent you from getting sick, and it could... but, the real purpose of your immune system is to prevent bacteria and viruses from escalating to dangerous levels in the body. *Note: When you click the links in this post, we may receive a commission at no extra cost to you. Luckily, we can all care for our bodies and feed those tiny little warriors inside us to help them function optimally. The best part? It doesn't have to cost a penny! By implementing these tips and lifestyle changes, you can be sure you are giving your immune system (and your family's) the best chance possible no matter what comes your way.

Evidence suggests balance and wellness in the body can [make your immune system stronger](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/what-can-you-do-to-improve-your-immune-system) and help you fight off the invaders.

It is an entire system with many parts that work in conjunction with many other parts of the body. By maintaining a healthy lifestyle all around, over time, you will give your body and your immune system the BEST fighting chance... literally! While it may sound daunting, it's simple. We'll show you how! HOW TO BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM NATURALLY There are many ways to change your lifestyle to a more balanced one.

We love it, and we hate it all at the same time. As much as our bodies tell us we need this sweet, irresistible substance, it really is terrible for our bodies! Sugar causes a direct and immediate decrease in your immune system cells' effectiveness. It basically puts your soldiers in a temporary coma! NOT good! This effect can last for hours after sugar consumption, depending on how much you consume. Instead of the sugary drink or snack, [drink more water](https://funcheaporfree.com/water-only-week/) and reach for some fruit.

Get these nutrients in the form of a vitamin supplement OR simply include more vitamin-rich foods in your diet. It does NOT have to cost anything extra to give your body all it needs! There are many other natural and holistic \"immune-boosting\" herbs and supplements on the market. Just remember, don't take any new supplements without checking with your doctor first!
