This guide is a summary of the average user experience, psilocybin will affect everyone differently in their body's processing time, trip experiences, and effect durations. Beginners are recommend to start small until they are confident in increasing their dose. Microdose 0.175 - 0.35g (0.5 - 1 square) Microdosing is the act of consuming imperceptible amounts of psilocybin. Zero to minimal hallucinogenic effects will be felt, but there are various health benefits to incorporating microdosing into your wellness routine. Microdosing effects will vary with each individual, so start with the smallest dose if you don't want to have a full-on trip! Effects - Increased creativity - Improved mood - Better focus & attention to detail - Mild euphoria - Existential thoughts, introspection Moderate Dose 0.70 - 2.45g (2 - 7 squares) A moderate dose will induce a full-on psychedelic psilocybin trip. In this state there may be spiritual, healing or life-changing experiences. This dose may be too strong for beginners. Always start with a smaller dose if unsure of your body's reaction to psilocybin. Effects - Psychedelic trip - Heightened physical sensations - Time and sound distortion - Strong visual effects - Feelings of peace - Deep emotions Megadose 2.80 - 4.20g (8 - 12 squares) A megadose will induce a major trip. All previously listed effects will increase in potency and strength. Not to be taken casually, at this stage supervision is recommended. Effects - Major psychedelic trip - Euphoria - Dissociation from the physical body - Intense visuals with eyes closed - Memory retrieval - Ego-death Hero Dose 5g+ This stage should only be attempted after years of experimentation with dosing psilocybin. This experience is unpredictable and can possibly result in very negative and long-lasting effects if unprepared. Do not do this casually. Effects - Life-changing psychedelic trip - Inability to differentiate between thought and physical reality - Deep spiritual journey - Sense of nothingness - Loss of identity - New dimensions, parallel realities, alternate universes, aliens "}
