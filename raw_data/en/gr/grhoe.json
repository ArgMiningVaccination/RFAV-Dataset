I'm close to that milestone, but nearing it made me realize what I was giving up to be one. At the top of this list were authentic Ayurvedic body treatments. I used to get them regularly in my previous life in Mumbai and even made sure to book multiple treatments on my annual visits there after I moved away. Since the pandemic, however, I haven't been to my home country in more than three years, and I've been jonesing hard for Ayurvedic massages and the [brusque vibe](https://www.vogue.com/article/ayurvedic-massage-guide) that accompanies them. I realized that being a New Yorker was all well and good, but in order to survive another decade in this great city, I needed to find therapists a little closer to home who could fill the massage void. Armed with this mission, I tapped a network of New Yorkers to find masseuses who practiced Ayurveda that was as authentic as possible, and it led me to these therapists and spas. Misa Kubo spent years training under Naina Marballi, a renowned New York-based Ayurvedic physician, and offers treatments in a cozy, tranquil room in Murray Hill. Kubo's gentle and reassuring energy was diametrically opposite to my past Ayurvedic encounters, and I reveled in her calm as she performed a pulse check and asked a few health questions. My vata was high and dominating that day, so she picked sesame and grapeseed oils for my abhyanga and added a Shirodhara treatment with frankincense and a dry head massage. We started with the latter, and it was the best 10 minutes of my session. She massaged my scalp with sharp, powerful movements followed by strong, invigorating taps (a.k.a. smacks). Though it was not her intention, I took them as a physical manifestation of the verbal chiding I've received from Ayurvedic therapists in India, so I instantly felt at home. By the end, I was refreshed and alert, and the stress I was holding in the back of my head had receded. When I was belly down on the table, Kubo started with a genius opener: A heavy gong was placed on my back and struck. This is the ritual that signals the start of the treatment, and the physical vibrations from the gong were a mini sound bath pulsing through my body in waves. To be honest, I would have paid good money for a half hour of that alone. The abhyanga itself was solid and functional. We ended with a 10-minute Shirodhara treatment, in which a steady stream of warm oil was dripped on my forehead, an ancient stress-busting technique. I felt the effects only later at night when I slept like an unfussy baby who's been optimally moisturized from split ends to toe. Marie Viellard went from being a lawyer in Paris to a yoga teacher in Mexico to a student of Ayurveda in Nagpur, India, and is now an Ayurvedic practitioner based in New York and Paris. Viellard came highly recommended by [Divya Viswanathan](https://www.vogue.com/article/taza-ayurvedic-beauty-brand-skincare-health-digestion-wellness), the founder of supplement brand [Taza Ayurveda](https://tazaayurveda.com/), who consulted Viellard postpartum. \"Marie's treatments helped ground me, were instrumental to my recovery, and gave me the strength to care for myself and my baby,\" she said. Viellard specializes in helping women achieve digestive and hormonal balance at different stages of their life through a combination of nutritional consultations, Ayurvedic herbs, and bodywork. She accepts clients like me who only want a massage but would prefer to do a consultation so she can really target the individual's needs during the treatment. Before my abhyanga, we chatted about my health issues, but in the absence of a full consultation, Viellard had pre-chosen a vata-balancing oil. \"People's lifestyles in large cities are stressful. Since vata needs regularity, peace and quiet, and easy-to-digest home-cooked meals, it's hard to maintain a replenishing routine. That's why vata is easily aggravated in NYC,\" she says, explaining her choice of oil. The massage was one of the better ones I've had\u2014not to put too woo-woo a point on it, but I felt Viellard's grounding energy through the treatment. Though the strokes were those of a classic abhyanga, she also performed some zigzag movements on my legs that were from a kapha protocol. \"Just to give you more lightness in the legs and get the lymph moving,\" she explained. That move, and the massage in general, made me relaxed yet invigorated at the same time, and I left her studio feeling vibrant and renewed. [New York Ayurveda and Panchakarma Center](https://nyayurveda.com/) This center offers an array of Ayurvedic therapies, including the panchakarma cleanse, as well as abhyanga and other massages. I picked abhyanga and elakizhi, a massage with warm cloth bundles stuffed with medicinal herbs to relieve musculoskeletal and joint issues and chronic pain. (I have a toddler, in case you're wondering why I need this treatment.) It's available only as a series of seven, and to prepare for it, I filled in a form to determine my dosha and gave a detailed health history to Nisha Saini, a holistic health practitioner and New York Ayurveda's founder, a few days before I went in. For the massage, Saini chose dhanwantram oil for me, to help balance the vata and pitta doshas. It promises antioxidant effects with its cocktail of roots, flowers, herbs, oils, and spices, as well as cow's milk. My therapist, Constance Nicolas, used confident, medium-to-firm strokes to work the oil in and then pressed the oiled elakizhi bundles into my back. My elakhizi contained a cooked mixture of fresh Moringa and fenugreek leaves, lemon slices, turmeric, rock salt, and grated coconut and were ingeniously nestled in a Crock-Pot, where they lay warming in dhanwantram oil. The aromatic vibe was more Indian restaurant than spa, and the bundles felt warm and squishy as they were pressed into my skin. They squelched and frankly felt a bit unappealing but worked almost instantly. I floated off into that space between sleep and wakefulness, where I remained till my treatment ended. My muscles felt less tense, and a sore spot on my shoulder had vanished, so you wouldn't have caught me caring about the fact that I smelled a bit fenugreek-y on the way out. I'll start by saying [The Well](https://www.vogue.com/article/how-the-well-has-reimagined-their-spa-for-2021) is the exact opposite of a traditional Ayurvedic spa\u2014the minimalist, modern retreat in Manhattan's Union Square is a luxe oasis offering a variety of wellness modalities. The treatment I got wasn't strictly Ayurvedic either. It was, in fact, a Swedish massage, but what drew me in was the Marma Point Scalp Treatment, a 10-minute experience that can be added on to any bodywork treatment. Similar to acupuncture points, the 107 Marma points are key spots on the body, and Ayurvedic medicine believes activating them can benefit the body and mind. Head massages, both with and without oil, are vital therapies in the South Asian beauty and wellness canon, and I wanted to see how The Well would interpret them. Really well, it turns out. My therapist, Krystel Laudante, started with the Swedish massage using sesame oil, and by the time my hour was up, my hunched shoulders that had rigor mortised in the vicinity of my ears had descended to their anatomically correct position. The head massage was just as restoring. With warmed coconut oil, Laudante gently massaged my head and worked on several points on my forehead, face, and scalp. It was a gentle touch with no more pressure than a caress, but at the end of 10 short minutes, I was floaty. My experience here might not have been truly Ayurvedic in practice, but it definitely was in spirit. By the end of my massage odyssey, I felt I had got everything that I value in Ayurvedic treatments in India\u2014the firm, invigorating bodywork; grounding, calming energy; and skin and wellness benefits. The only thing New York therapists couldn't really provide was that bossy, brusque vibe. (I know, that surprised me too! This city has gone too soft.) If you're an Ayurvedic practitioner specializing in that specific brand of tough love, call me. "}
