I felt Dr. Rodriguez was very thorough during my visit, especially when discussing my symptoms in order to move forward with treatment. I could barely walk, let alone sit when I arrived and I left feeling alot better physically and satisfied with the service I received. - Erick PBest chiropractor in Riverside. Can't say enough good things about him. Cares about his clients like family! Ever since my I messed up my back at my good-for-nothing company I work for, Dr. Rodriguez has been taking care of my back and I go every once in awhile to get an \"adjustment\" and feel good. Highly recommend him. - Mindy GAfter my car accident I started going to the Chiropractic Center. I found them to always be professional and have time to work into my busy schedule. I believe it is primarily seeing this doctor that made it possible for me to return to work. I highly recommend going to Energy Chiropractic Center. |Mon:||9:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 3:00 - 7:00 PM| |Tue:||Closed| |Wed:||9:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 3:00 - 7:00 PM| |Thu:||Closed| |Fri:||9:00 AM - 1:00 "}
