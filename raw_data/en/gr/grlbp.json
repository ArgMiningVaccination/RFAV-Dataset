At SokukoJi, you are asked to remove your shoes before entering the zendo or meditation hall. There is no specific dress code, but dark, non-descript clothing is encouraged. If desired, you are welcome to put on one of the samues or meditation jackets that we provide. In the zendo, most meditators sit on zafus or meditation cushions, but we have chairs available as well. During the Sunday morning and Wednesday evening sutra chanting, you are asked to stand. Your level of involvement in the forms observed at SokukoJi beyond these protocols are at your discretion. On-Line Treat your space as an extension of the Zendo and follow the same protocols. Position your camera so we can see you (a side profile works best). Please mute your microphone, and if you need to get up and/or move around, we request that you mute your camera also. Your donations are greatly appreciated. *Second Saturday: Monk Training *Saturdays that are not Monk Training or All-Day Retreat: 8 - 12 pm - Block Sit 1:20 - 2:30 pm - Sitting Meditation 2:30 -3:30 pm - Book Study **Last Saturday: Sokuzan's Dharma Talk at 11:00 am.
