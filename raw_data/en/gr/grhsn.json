Any visitors that are caught using or in possession of drugs could face severe consequences, including the death penalty. Do not bring illicit substances to China or buy them while visiting the country. If trekking to isolated or lesser populated places, be sure to travel in a group. This will reduce the risk of safety threats brought on by criminals. As an extra precaution, always leave the itinerary, mobile number, and the estimated time of return with a third party. How to Travel While in China Due to the high population of people in China, traveling may be more difficult than expected. Traffic is unregulated and chaotic, causing high rates of automobile accidents. Take one of the many methods of public transportation to get around.
