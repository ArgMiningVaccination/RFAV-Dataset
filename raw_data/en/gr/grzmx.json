But the post-vaccination pains are distressing and debilitating for your little one to put up with. However, there is a lot you can do to comfort your baby post-vaccination. Try these: Apply ice pack on the injection site: Soon after your baby gets a vaccination shot, the site of the injection might swell and get inflamed causing immense pain and discomfort. To ease the pain, apply ice-packs gently on the site. This will help her counter the pain and soothe the inflammation. To do it the right way, take an ice-cube and rub it over your palms. Apply the cold icy water on the affected area by gently patting on the injection site. Remember directly rubbing an ice-cube on your baby's skin which is already inflamed can make the experience more painful than providing any relief. When your baby feels a little comfortable with the cold sensation, wrap an ice-cube in a clean cloth and apply it over the area. Do this at least twice or thrice during the day. Don't fret over fever: It is common for newborns and infants to fall sick after a vaccination shot. Fever soon after vaccination is normal and it subsides within a day or two. If this happens talk to your doctor and give your baby the right medication. On the other hand, if your baby doesn't develop a fever after the shot, know that the vaccine would be still effective on her.

But do this after consulting your doctor. In most cases the doctor would prescribe paracetamol drops to ease the pains. But remember not to overdo it or exceed the amount of dose prescribed by your doctor. Give more attention: At least for a day or two after the vaccination, your baby might keep vying for your attention and need more warmth and comfort from you. Keep calm and make yourself available for your baby. If your baby is too young or under six months of age your can also try to give her more skin-to-skin contact to make her feel comfortable.

But keeping her off meals at this time isn't a good idea either. Remember dehydration along with low grade fever after the vaccination will not do her any good. Offer her more breastfeeds. This act will satiate her, keep her hydrated and also soothe her from the impending pains. If you have weaned her off breast milk then give her enough liquids to keep her hydrated along with some light meals.

She might not be in a mood for other physical activities after the shot, these simple tricks can help you to distract her from the pain. Don't force her to walk or move: Most of the vaccination shots are usually given on the thigh, except the BCG shot that is given on the arm. This will make the area on her upper thigh swell with pain and make it difficult to move. Don't force her to walk or move the leg in an attempt to mobilize the limb and ease the pain. In this way you might be hurting your baby more. In fact you should worry about mobility if you notice that she isn't able to move around like before even after two days of the vaccination. Until then pat her and keep her on your lap which will comfort her more. Opt for painless injections or combination shorts: Before the vaccination, talk to your doctor about those new-age painless pricks. Some of the vaccines also come as combination shots.
