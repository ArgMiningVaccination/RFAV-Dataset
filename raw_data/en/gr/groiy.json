Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing officialrulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and forpublishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conven-tions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of generalinterest. It is published weekly and may be obtained from theSuperintendent of Documents on a subscription basis. Bulletincontents are compiled semiannually into Cumulative Bulletins,which are sold on a single-copy basis. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all sub- stantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application ofthe tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke, mod-ify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin.All published rulings apply retroactively unless otherwise indi-cated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internal man-agement are not published; however, statements of internalpractices and procedures that affect the rights and duties oftaxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in the revenueruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings to taxpayersor technical advice to Service field offices, identifying detailsand information of a confidential nature are deleted to preventunwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutoryrequirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but theymay be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not berelied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel inthe disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings andprocedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations,court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered, and Service personnel and others concerned are cautionedagainst reaching the same conclusions in other cases unlessthe facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:Part I.\u201419 86 Code. This part i ncludes rulings and decisions based on provisions of the Intern al Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.\u2014Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A,Tax Conventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Leg-islation and Related Committee Reports. Part III.\u2014Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to thesesubjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Alsoincluded in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rul-ings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued bythe Department of the Treasury's Office of the Assistant Secre-tary (Enforcement). Part IV .\u2014Items of General Interest. This par t includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbar- ment an d suspension lists, and announcements. The last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. Thesemonthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and arepublished in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:I. Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), Pub.L. 111-148, was enacted on March 23,2010; the Health Care and Education Rec-onciliation Act (the Reconciliation Act),Pub. L. 111-152, was enacted on March30, 2010. The Affordable Care Act andthe Reconciliation Act reorganize, amend,and add to the provisions of part A of titleXXVII of the Public Health Service Act(PHS Act) relating to group health plansand health insurance issuers in the groupand individual markets. The term \"grouphealth plan\" includes both insured andself-insured group health plans. 1The Af- fordable Care Act adds section 715(a)(1)to the Employee Retirement Income Secu-rity Act (ERISA) an d section 9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (the Code)to incorporate the provisions of part A oftitle XXVII of the PHS Act into ERISAand the Code, and make them applicableto group health plans, and health insuranceissuers providing health insurance cover-age in connection with group health plans.The PHS Act sections incorporated by thisreference are sections 2701 through 2728.PHS Act sections 2701 through 2719A aresubstantially new, though they incorporatesome provisions of prior law. PHS Actsections 2722 through 2728 are sections ofprior law renumbered, with some, mostlyminor, changes. Subtitles A and C of title I of the Af- fordable Care Act amend the requirementsof title XXVII of the PHS Act (changesto which are incorporated into ERISAsection 715). The preemption provi-sions ERISA Act 1The term \"group health plan\" is used in title XXVII of the PHS Act, part 7 of ERISA, and chapter 100 of the Code, and is distinct from the term \"health plan,\" as used in other provisions of title I of the Affordable Care Act. The term \"health plan\" does not include self-insured group health plans. August 30, 2010 274 2010-35 I.R.B.section in 29 CFR 2590.731(a) and 45 CFR ap-ply so that the requirements of part 7 ofERISA and title XXVII of the PHS Act,as amended by the Affordable Care Act,are not to be \"construed to supersede anyprovision of State law which establishes,implements, or continues in effect anystandard or requirement solely relatingto health insurance issuers in connectionwith group or individual health insur-ance coverage except to the extent thatsuch standard or requirement preventsthe application of a requirement\" of theAffordable Care Act. Accordingly, State laws that impose on health insurance is-suers requirements t hat are stricter than those imposed by the Affordable Care Actwill not be superseded by the AffordableCare Act. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (the De-partments) are issuing regulations in sev-eral phases implementing the revised PHSAct sections 2701 through 2719A and re-lated provisions of the Affordable CareAct. The first phase in this series was thepublication of a Request for Informationrelating to the medical loss ratio provisionsof PHS Act section 2718, published in theFederal Register on April 14, 2010 (75 FR 19297). The second phase was interimfinal regulations implementing PHS Actsection 2714 (requiring dependent cover-age of children to age 26), published intheFederal Register on May 13, 2010 (75 FR 27122). The third phase was in-terim final regulations implementing sec-tion 1251 of the Affordable Care Act (re-lating to status as a grandfathered healthplan), published in the Federal Register on June 17, (T.D. 9489, 2010-29I.R.B. 55 [75 FR 34538]). The Act sections 2704 (pro-hibiting preexisting condition exclusions),2711 (regarding lifetime and annual dollarlimits benefits), 2712 (regarding restric-tions on rescissions), and 2719A (regard-ing patient protections), published in theFederal Register on (T.D. 9491, 2010-32 I.R.B. 186 [75 FR 37188]).These interim final regulations are being published to implement PHS Act section2713 (relating to coverage for preventiveservices). PHS Act section 2713 is gen-erally effective for plan years (in the indi-vidual market, policy years) beginning onor after September 23, 2010, which is sixmonths after the March 23, 2010 date ofenactment of the Affordable Care Act. Theimplementation of other provisions of PHSAct sections 2701 through 2719A will beaddressed in future regulations. II. Overview of the Regulations: PHS Act Section 2713, Coverage ofPreventive Health 29 CFR 2590.715-2713,45 CFR 147.130) Section 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act, and theseinterim final regulations require that agroup health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual healthinsurance coverage provide benefits forand prohibit the imposition of cost-sharingrequirements with respect to: \u0081Evidence-based items or services thathave in effect a rating of A or B inthe current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce (Task Force) with respect to theindividual involved. 3 \u0081Immunizations for routine use in chil-dren, adolescents, and adults that havein effect a recommendation from theAdvisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (AdvisoryCommittee) with respect to the indi-vidual involved. A recommendationof the Advisory Committee is consid-ered to be \"in effect\" after it has beenadopted by the Director of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention. Arecommendation is considered to befor routine use if it appears on the Im-munization Schedules of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention. \u0081With respect to infants, children, andadolescents, evidence-informed pre-ventive care and screenings providedfor in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA). \u0081With respect to women, evidence-in-formed preventive care and screeningprovided for in comprehensive guide-lines supported by HRSA (not other-wise addressed by the recommenda-tions of the Task Force). The De-partment of HHS is developing theseguidelines and expects to issue them nolater than August 1, 2011. The complete list of recommendations and guidelines that are required to becovered under these interim final regula-tions can be found at http://www.Health- Care.gov/center/regulations/preven-tion.html . Together, the items and services described in these recommendations andguidelines are referred to in this preambleas \"recommended preventive services.\" These interim final regulations clar- ify the cost-sharing requirements when arecommended preventive service is pro-vided during an office visit. First, if arecommended preventive service is billedseparately (or is tracked as individual en-counter data separately) from an officevisit, then a plan or issuer may imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. Second, if a recommendedpreventive service is not billed separately (or is not tracked as individual encounterdata separately) from an office visit andthe primary purpose of the office visit isthe delivery of such an item or service,then a plan or issuer may not imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. Finally, if a recommendedpreventive service is not billed separately (or is not tracked as individual encounterdata separately) from an office visit andthe primary purpose of the office visit isnot the delivery of such an item or ser-vice, then a plan or issuer may imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tot h eo f f i c ev i s i t . T h er e f e r e n c et ot r a c k i n gindividual encounte r data was included to provide guidance with respect to plansand issuers that use capitation or similar 2Code section 9815 incorporates the preemption pr ovisions of PHS Act section 2724. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, there were no express preemption p rovisions in chapter 100 of the Code. 3Under PHS Act section 2713(a)(5), the Task Force recommendations regardi ng breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention issued in or aroun d November of 2009 are not to be considered current recommendations on this subject for purposes of any l aw. Thus, the recommendations regarding breast cancer screening, mammog raphy, and prevention issued by the Task Force prior to those issued in or around November of 2009 (i.e., those i ssued in 2002) will be considered current until new recommendations in this area are issued by the Task Force or appear in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources an d Services Administration concerning preventive care and screenings for wo men. 2010-35 I.R.B. 275 August 30, 2010payment arrangements that do not bill in- dividually for items and services. Examples in these interim final regula- tions illustrate these provisions. In one ex-ample, an individual receives a cholesterolscreening test, a recommended preventiveservice, during a routine office visit. Theplan or issuer may impose cost-sharing re-quirements for the office visit because therecommended preventive service is billedas a separate charge. A second exam-ple illustrates that treatment resulting froma preventive screen ing can be subject to cost-sharing requirements if the treatmentis not itself a recommended preventive ser-vice. In another example, an individual re-ceives a recommended preventive servicethat is not billed as a separate charge. Inthis example, the primary purpose for theoffice visit is recurring abdominal pain andnot the delivery of a recommended preven-tive service; therefore the plan or issuermay impose cost-sharing requirements forthe office visit. In the final example, an in-dividual receives a recommended preven-tive service that is not billed as a sepa-rate charge, and the delivery of that serviceis the primary purpose of the office visit.Therefore, the plan or issuer may not im-pose cost-sharing requirements for the of-fice visit. With respect to a plan or health in- surance coverage that has a network ofproviders, these inter im final regulations make clear that a plan or issuer is notrequired to provide coverage for recom-mended preventive services delivered byan out-of-network provider. Such a plano ri s s u e rm a ya l s oi m p o s ec o s t - s h a r i n gr e -quirements for recommended preventiveservices delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. These interim final regulations provide that if a recommendation or guideline for arecommended preventive service does notspecify the frequency, method, treatment,or setting for the provision of that service,the plan or issuer can use reasonable med-ical management techniques to determineany coverage limitations. The use of rea-sonable medical management techniques allows plans and issuers to adapt these rec-ommendations and guidelines to coverageof specific items and services where costsharing must be waived. Thus, under theseinterim final regulations, a plan or issuermay rely on established techniques and therelevant evidence base to determine thefrequency, method, treatment, or settingfor which a recommended preventive ser-vice will be available without cost-sharingrequirements to the extent not specified ina recommendation or guideline. The statute and these interim final reg- ulations clarify tha t a plan or issuer con- tinues to have the option to cover preven-tive services in addition to those requiredto be covered by PHS Act section 2713.For such additional preventive services, aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharing re-quirements at its discretion. Moreover, aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharing re-quirements for a treatment that is not arecommended preventive service, even ifthe treatment results from a recommendedpreventive service. The statute requires the Departments to establish an interval of not less than oneyear between when recommendations orguidelines under PHS Act section 2713(a) 4 are issued, and the plan year (in the in-dividual market, policy year) for whichcoverage of the services addressed in suchrecommendations or guidelines must be ineffect. These interim final regulations pro-vide that such coverage must be providedfor plan years (in the individual market,policy years) beginning on or after the laterof September 23, 2010, or one year afterthe date the recommendation or guidelineis issued. Thus, recommendations andguidelines issued prior to September 23,2009 must be provided for plan years (inthe individual market, policy years) begin-ning on or after September 23, 2010. Forthe purpose of these interim final regula-tions, a recommendation or guideline ofthe Task Force is considered to be issuedon the last day of the month on which theTask Force publishes or otherwise releasesthe recommendation; a recommendation or guideline of the Advisory Committeeis considered to be issued on the date onwhich it is adopted by the Director of theCenters for Disease Control and Preven-tion; and a recommendation or guidelinein the comprehensive guidelines supportedby HRSA is considered to be issued onthe date on which it is accepted by theAdministrator of HRSA or, if applicable,adopted by the Secretary of HHS. Forrecommendations and guidelines adoptedafter September 23, 2009, information athttp://www.HealthCare.gov/center/regu-lations/prevention.html will be updated on an ongoing basis and will include the dateon which the recommendation or guide-line was accepted or adopted. Finally, these interim final regulations make clear that a plan or issuer is not re-quired to provide coverage or waive cost-sharing requirements for any item or ser-vice that has ceased to be a recommendedpreventive service. 5Other requirements of Federal or State law may apply in con-nection with ceasing to provide coverageor changing cost-sharing requirements forany such item or service. For example,PHS Act section 2715(d)(4) requires a planor issuer to give 60 days advance notice toan enrollee before any material modifica-tion will become effective. Recommendations or guidelines in ef- fect as of July 13, 2010 are described insection V later in this preamble. Anychange to a recommendation or guidelinethat has \u2014 at any point since September23, 2009 \u2014 been included in the recom-mended preventive services will be notedathttp://www.HealthCare.gov/center/reg- ulations/prevention.html . As described above, new recommendations and guide-lines will also be noted at this site andplans and issuers need not make changesto coverage and cost-sharing require-ments based on a new recommendation orguideline until the first plan year (in theindividual market, p olicy year) beginning on or after the date that is one year after thenew recommendation or guideline went 4Section 2713(b)(1) refers to an interval between \"the date on which a recomme ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or a guideline under sub section (a)(3) is issued and the plan year with respect to which the requirement described in subsection (a) is effective with respect to the service described in such recommendation or gu ideline.\" While the first part of this statement does not mention guidelines under subsection (a)(4), it would mak e no sense to treat the services covered under (a)(4) any differently than those in (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). First, the same sentence refers to \"the requirement described in subsection (a),\" w hich would include a requirement under (a)(4). Secondly, the guidelines under (a)(4) are from the same source as those under (a)(3), except with respect to women rather than infants, child ren and adolescents; and other preven tive services involving women are ad dressed in (a)(1), so there is no plausible policy rationale for treating them differently. Third, without this clarif ication, it would be unclear when such services would have to be covered. T hese interim final regulations accordingly apply the intervals established therei n to services under section 2713(a)(4). 5For example, if a recommendation of the United States Preventive Services Ta sk Force is downgraded from a rating of A or B to a rating of C or D, or if a recom mendation or guideline no longer includes a parti cular item or service.

Therefore, by visiting this site once per year, plans or issuers will havestraightforward access to all the informa-tion necessary to determine any additionalitems or services that must be coveredwithout cost-sharing requirements, or todetermine any items or services that areno longer required to be covered. The Affordable Care Act gives author- ity to the Departments to develop guide-lines for group health plans and healthinsurance issuers offering group or indi-vidual health insurance coverage to uti-lize value-based insurance designs as partof their offering of preventive health ser-vices. Value-based insurance designs in-clude the provision of information and in-centives for consume rs that promote ac- cess to and use of higher value providers,treatments, and servi ces. The Departments recognize the important role that value-based insurance design can play in pro-moting the use of appropriate preventiveservices. These interim final regulations,for example, permit plans and issuers toimplement designs that seek to foster bet-ter quality and efficiency by allowing cost-sharing for recommended preventive ser-vices delivered on an out-of-network basiswhile eliminating cost-sharing for recom-mended preventive heal th services deliv- ered on an in-network basis. The Depart-ments are developing additional guidelinesregarding the utilization of value-based in-surance designs by group health plans andhealth insurance issuers with respect topreventive benefits. The Departments areseeking comments related to the develop-ment of such guidelines for value-basedinsurance designs that promote consumerchoice of providers or services that offerthe best value and quality, while ensuringaccess to critical, evidence-based preven-tive services. The requirements to cover recom- mended preventive services without anycost-sharing requirements do not June17, 2010). III. Interim Final Regulations and Request for Comments Section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHSAct authorize the Secretaries of the Trea-sury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to promulgate any interim fi-nal rules that they determine are appropri-ate to carry out the provisions of chapter100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B of ti-tle I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVII ofthe PHS Act, which include PHS Act sec-tions 2701 through 2728 and the incorpo-ration of those sections into ERISA section715 and Code section 9815. In addition, under Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. ) a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required whenan agency, for good cause, finds that noticeand public comment th ereon are imprac- ticable, unnecessary, or contrary to thepublic interest. The provisions of the APAthat ordinarily require a notice of proposedrulemaking do not apply here because oft h es p e c i f i ca u t h o r i ty granted by section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA,and section 2792 of the PHS Act. How-ever, even if the APA were applicable, theSecretaries have determined that it wouldbe impracticable and contrary to the pub-lic interest to delay putting the provisionsin these interim final regulations in placeuntil a full public notice and commentprocess was completed. As noted above,the preventive health service provisions ofthe Affordable Care Act are applicable forplan years (in the individual market, policyyears) beginning on or after September 23,2010, six months after date of enactment.Had the Departments published a noticeof proposed rulemaking, provided for a60-day comment period, and only thenprepared final regul ations, which would be subject to a 60-day delay in effectivedate, it is unlikely that it would have beenpossible to have final regulations in effectbefore late September, when these require-ments could be in effect for some plans orpolicies. Moreover, the requirements inthese interim final regulations require sig-nificant lead time in order to implement.These interim final regulations requireplans and issuers to provide coveragefor preventive servi ces listed in certain recommendations and guidelines withoutimposing any cost-sharing requirements.Preparations presum ably would have to be made to identify these preventive services. With respect to the changes that would berequired to be made under these interimfinal regulations, group health plans andhealth insurance issuers subject to theseprovisions have to be able to take these changes into account in establishing theirpremiums, and in making other changesto the designs of plan or policy benefits,and these premiums and plan or policychanges would have to receive necessaryapprovals in advance of the plan or policyyear in question. Accordingly, in order to allow plans and health insurance coverage to be designedand implemented on a timely basis, regu-lations must be published and available tothe public well in advance of the effectivedate of the requirements of the AffordableCare Act. It is not possible to have a fullnotice and comment process and to publishfinal regulations in the brief time betweenenactment of the Affordable Care Act andthe date regulations are needed. The Secretaries further find that is- suance of proposed regulations would notbe sufficient because the provisions of theAffordable Care Act protect significantrights of plan participants and beneficia-ries and individuals covered by individualhealth insurance policies and it is essentialthat participants, beneficiaries, insureds,plan sponsors, and issuers have certaintyabout their rights and responsibilities.Proposed regulations are not binding andcannot provide the necessary certainty.By contrast, the interim final regulationsprovide the public with an opportunity forcomment, but without delaying the effec-tive date of the regulations. For the foregoing reasons, the Depart- ments have determined that it is imprac-ticable and contrary to the public interestto engage in full notice and comment rule-making before putting these interim finalregulations into effect, and that it is in thepublic interest to promulgate interim finalregulations. I V .E c o n o m i cI m p a c t Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735), a \"significant\" regulatory action issubject to review by the Office of Manage-ment and Budget (OMB). Section 3(f) ofthe Executive Order de fines a \"significant regulatory action\" as an action that is likelyto result in a rule (1) having an annual ef-fect on the economy of $100 million ormore in any one year, or adversely and ma-terially affecting a sector of the economy,productivity, competition, jobs, the envi-ronment, public health or safety, or State, 2010-35 I.R.B. 277 August 30, 2010local or tribal governments or communi- ties (also referred to as \"economically sig-nificant\"); (2) creating a serious inconsis-tency or otherwise interfering with an ac-tion taken or planned by another agency;(3) materially altering the budgetary im-pacts of entitlement grants, user fees, orloan programs or the rights and obligationsof recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legalmandates, the President's priorities, or theprinciples set forth in the Executive Order.OMB has determined that this regulation iseconomically signifi cant within the mean- ing of section 3(f)(1) of the Executive Or-der, because it is likely to have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million in any one year. Accordingly, OMB has re-viewed these rules pursuant to the Exec-utive Order. The Departments provide anassessment of the potential costs, benefits,and transfers associated with these interimfinal regulations, summarized in the fol-lowing table. TABLE 1.\u2014 Accounting Table (2011-2013) Benefits Qualitative: By expanding coverage and eliminating cost sharin g for the recommended preventive services, the Departments expect access and utilization of these services to increase. To the extent that individuals increase their use of these services the Departments anticipate several benefits: (1) prevention and redu ction in transmission of illnesses as a result of immunization and screening of transmissible diseases; (2) delayed onset, earlier treatment, and reduction in morbidity and mortality as a result of early detection, screening, and counsel ing; (3) increased productivity and fewer sick days; and (4) savings from lower health care costs. Another benefit of these i nterim final regulations will be to distribute the cost of preventive services more equitably across the broad insured population. CostsQualitative: New costs to the health care system result when benef iciaries increase their use of preventive services in response to the changes in coverage and cost-sharing requirements of prev entive services. The magnitude of this effect on utilization depends on the price elasticity of demand and the percentage ch ange in prices facing those with reduced cost sharing or newly gaining coverage. TransfersQualitative: Transfers will occur to the extent that costs that wer e previously paid out-of-pocket for certain preventive services will now be covered by group health plans and issuers under these interim final regulations. Risk pooling in the group market will result in sharing expected cost increases across an entir e plan or employee group as higher average premiums for all enrollees. However, not all of those covered will utilize preventive s ervices to an equivalent extent. A s a result, these interim final regulations create a small transfer from those paying premium s in the group market utilizing less than the average volume of preventive services in their risk pool to those whose utilization i s greater than average. To the ext ent there is risk pooling in the individual market, a similar transfer will occur. A.The Need for Federal Regulatory Action As discussed later in this preamble, there is current underutilization of preven-tive services, which stems from three mainfactors. First, due to turnover in the healthinsurance market, health insurance issuersdo not currently have incentives to coverpreventive services, whose benefits mayonly be realized in the future when an indi-vidual may no longer be enrolled. Second,many preventive services generate bene-fits that do not accrue immediately to theindividual that receives the services, mak-ing the individual le ss likely to take-up, especially in the face of direct, imme-diate costs. Third, some of the benefitsof preventive services accrue to societyas a whole, and thus do not get factoredinto an individual's decision-making overwhether to obtain such services. These interim final regulations ad- dress these market failures through twoavenues. First, they require coverage of recommended preventive services bynon-grandfathered group health plans andhealth insurance issuers in the group andindividual markets, thereby overcom-ing plans' lack of incentive to invest inthese services. Second, they eliminatecost-sharing requirements, thereby remov-ing a barrier that could otherwise leadan individual to not obtain such services,given the long-term and partially externalnature of benefits. These interim final regulations are nec- essary in order to provide rules that plansponsors and issuers can use to determinehow to provide coverage for certain pre-ventive health care services without theimposition of cost sharing in connectionwith these services. B.PHS Act Section 2713, Coverage of Preventive Services (26 CFR54.9815-2713T, 29 CFR 2590.715-2713,45 CFR 147.130)1.Summary Asdiscussed earlier in this preamble, PHS Act section 2713, as added by the Af- fordable Care Act, and these interim final regulations require a group health plan and ahealth insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage to provide benefits for and prohibit the im- position of cost-sharing requirements with respect to the following preventive health services: \u0081Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B inthe current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce (Task Force). While these guide-lines will change over time, for thepurposes of this impact analysis, theDepartments utilized currently avail-able guidelines, which include bloodpressure and cholesterol screening,diabetes screening for hypertensive August 30, 2010 278 2010-35 I.R.B.patients, various cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings, andcounseling related to aspirin use, to-bacco cessation, obesity, and othertopics. \u0081Immunizations for routine use in chil- dren, adolescents, and adults that havein effect a recommendation from theAdvisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (AdvisoryCommittee) with respect to the indi-vidual involved. \u0081With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evide nce-informed pre- ventive care and screenings providedfor in the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA). \u0081With respect to women, evidence-in- formed preventive care and screeningprovided for in comprehensive guide-lines supported by HRSA (not other-wise addressed by the recommenda-tions of the Task Force). The De-partment of HHS is developing theseguidelines and expects to issue them nolater than August 1, 2011. 2.Preventive Services For the purposes of this analysis, the Departments used the relevant recommen-dations of the Task Force and AdvisoryCommittee and current HRSA guidelinesas described in section V later in this pre-amble. In addition to covering immu-nizations, these lists include such servicesas blood pressure and cholesterol screen-ing, diabetes screening for hypertensivepatients, various cancer and sexually trans-mitted infection screenings, genetic testingfor the BRCA gene, adolescent depressionscreening, lead testing, autism testing, andoral health screening and counseling re-lated to aspirin use, tobacco cessation, and obesity. 3.Estimated Number of Affected Entities For purposes of the new requirements in the Affordable Care Act that apply togroup health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual mar-kets, the Departments have defined a largegroup health plan as an employer plan with100 or more workers and a small groupplan as an employer plan with less than100 workers. The Departments estimatedthat there are approximately 72,000 largeand 2.8 million small ERISA-coveredgroup health plans with an estimated 97.0million participants in large group plansand 40.9 million participants in smallgroup plans. 6The Departments estimate that there are 126,000 governmental planswith 36.1 million participants in largeplans and 2.3 million participants in smallplans. 7The Departments estimate there are 16.7 million individuals under age 65covered by individual health insurancepolicies. 8 As described in the Departments' in- terim final regulations relating to statusas a grandfathered health plan, 9the Af- fordable Care Act preserves the abilityof individuals to retain coverage under agroup health plan or health insurance cov-erage in which the individual was enrolledon March 23, 2010 (a grandfathered healthplan). Group health pl ans, and group and individual health insurance coverage, thatare grandfathered health plans do not haveto meet the requirements of these interimfinal regulations. Therefore, only plansand issuers offering group and individualhealth insurance coverage that are notgrandfathered health plans will be affectedby these interim fi nal regulations.Plans can choose to relinquish their grandfather status in order to make certainotherwise permissible changes to theirplans. 10The Affordable Care Act pro- vides plans with the ability to maintaingrandfathered status in order to promotestability for consumers while allowingplans and sponsors to make reasonableadjustments to lower costs and encouragethe efficient use of services. Based on ananalysis of the changes plans have madeover the past few years, the Departmentsexpect that more plans will choose to makethese changes over time and therefore thenumber of grandfathered health plans isexpected to decrease. Correspondingly,the number of plans and policies affectedby these interim final regulations is likelyto increase over time. In addition, thenumber of individuals receiving the ben-efits of the Affordable Care Act is likelyto increase over time. The Departments'mid-range estimate is that 18 percent oflarge employer plans and 30 percent ofsmall employer plans would relinquishgrandfather status in 2011, increasingover time to 45 percent and 66 percentrespectively by 2013, although there issubstantial uncertainty surrounding theseestimates. 11 Using the mid-range assumptions, the Departments estimate that in 2011,roughly 31 million people will be enrolledin group health plans subject to the pre-vention provisions in these interim finalregulations, growing to approximately 78million in 2013. 12The mid-range esti- mates suggest that approximately 98 mil-lion individuals will be enrolled in grand-fathered group health plans in 2013, manyof which already cover preventive services (see discussion of the extent of preventiveservices coverage in employer-sponsoredplans later in this preamble). 6All participant counts and the estimates of individual policies are from t he U.S. Department of Labor, EBSA calculations using the March 2008 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement and the 2008 M edical Expenditure Panel Survey. 7Estimate is from the 2007 Census of Government. 8US Census Bureau, Current Po pulation Survey, March 2009. 975 FR 34538 (June 17, 2010). 10See 75 FR 34538 (June 17, 2010). 11See 75 Fed. Reg. 34538 (June 17, 2010) for a detailed description of the deri vation of the estimates for the percentages of grandfathered health plans. In brief, the Departments used data from the 2008 and 2009 Kaiser Family Foundations/Health Research and Edu cational Trust survey of employers to estimate the proportion of plans t hat made changes in cost-sharing requirements that would have caused them to relinquish grandfather status i f those same changes were made in 2011, and then applied a set of assumption s about how employer behavior might change in response to the incentives created by the grandfather regulations to estimate the proportion of plans likely to relinquish grandfath er status. The estimates of changes in 2012 a n d2 0 1 3w e r ec a l c u l a t e db yu s i n gt h e2 0 1 1c a l c u l a t i o n sa n da s s u m i n gt h a ta ni dentical percentage of plan sponsors w ill relinquish grandfather statu si ne a c hy e a r . 12To estimate the number of individuals covered in grandfathered health plans , the Departments extended the analysis described in 75 Fed. Reg. 34538, a nd estimated a weighted average of the number of employees in grandfathered health plans in the large employ er and small employer markets separat ely, weighting by the number of emplo yees in each employer's plan. Estimates for the large employer and small employer markets were then combined, using the estimates supplied above that there are 133.1 million cover ed lives in the large group market, and 43.2 million in the small group market. 2010-35 I.R.B. 279 August 30, 2010In the individual market, one study estimated that 40 percent to 67 percent ofindividual policies terminate each year.Because all newly purchased individualpolicies are not grandfathered, the De-partments expect that a large proportionof individual policies will not be grand-fathered, covering up to and perhapsexceeding 10 million individuals. 13 However, not all of the individuals potentially affected by these interim fi-nal regulations will di rectly benefit given the prevalence and variation in insurancecoverage today. State laws will affect thenumber of entities affected by all or someprovision of these interim final regula-tions, since plans, policies, and enrolleesin States that already have certain re-quirements will be affected to differentdegrees. 14For instance, 29 States require that health insurance issuers cover mostor all recommended immunizations forchildren. 15Of these 29 States, 18 States require first-dollar coverage of immu-nizations so that the insurers pay forimmunizations without a deductible and12 States exempt coinsurance ( e.g., 10 percent or 20 percent of charges). State laws alsorequire coverage of certain other preven-tive health services. Every State exceptUtah mandates coverage for some typeof breast cancer screening for women.Twenty-eight States mandate coverage forsome cervical cancer screening and 13States mandate coverage for osteoporosisscreening. 16 Estimation of the number of entities immediately affected by some or all pro-visions of these interim final regulations is further complicated by the fact that,although not all States require insurancecoverage for certain preventive services,many health plans have already chosento cover these services. For example,most health plans cover most childhoodand some adult immunizations containedin the recommendations from the Ad-visory Committee. A survey of small,medium and large employers showed that78 percent to 80 percent of their pointof service, preferred provider organi-zation (PPO), and health maintenanceorganization (HMO) health plans coveredchildhood immunizat ions and 57 percent to 66 percent covered influenza vaccinesin 2001. 17All 61 health plans (HMOs and PPOs) responding to a 2005 America'sHealth Insurance Plans (AHIP) surveycovered childhood immunizations 18in their best-selling products and almost allhealth plans (60 out of 61) covered diph-theria-tetanus-per tussis vaccines and in- fluenza vaccines for adults. 19As u r v e yo f private and public employer health plansfound that 84 percent covered influenzavaccines in 2002-2003. 20 Similarly, many health plans already cover preventive services today, but thereare differences in the coverage of these ser-vices in the group and individual markets.According to a 2009 survey of employerhealth benefits, over 85 percent of em-ployer-sponsored health insurance planscovered preventive services without hav-ing to meet a deductible. 21Coverage of preventive services does vary slightly byemployer size, with large employers beingmore likely to cover such services thansmall employers. 22In contrast, coverage of preventive services is less prevalent andvaries more significantly in the individualmarket. 23For PPOs, only 66.2 percent of single policies purchased covered adultphysicals, while 94.1 percent covered can-cer screenings. 24 In summary, the number of affected en- tities depends on several factors, such aswhether a health plan retains its grandfa-ther status, the number of new health plans,whether State benefit requirements for pre-ventive services apply, and whether plansor issuers voluntarily offer coverage and/orno cost sharing for recommended preven-tive services. In addition, participants,beneficiaries, and enrollees in such plansor health insurance coverage will be af-fected in different ways: some will newlygain coverage for recommended preven-tive services, while others will have thecost sharing that they now pay for such ser-vices eliminated. As such, there is consid-erable uncertainty surrounding estimationof the number of entities affected by theseinterim final regulations. 4.Benefits The Departments anticipate that four types of benefits will result from these in-terim final regulations. First, individualswill experience impr oved health as a result of reduced transmission, prevention or de-layed onset, and earlier treatment of dis-ease. Second, healthie r workers and chil- dren will be more productive with fewermissed days of work or school. Third,some of the recommended preventive ser-vices will result in savings due to lowerhealth care costs. Fourth, the cost of pre- 13Adele M. Kirk.

By expanding coverage and eliminating cost sharing for recommended preventiveservices, these interim final regulationscould be expected to increase access toand utilization of these services, which arenot used at optimal levels today. Nation-wide, almost 38 percent of adult residentsover 50 have never had a colorectal can-cer screening (such as a sigmoidoscopyor a colonoscopy) 25a n da l m o s t1 8p e r - cent of women over age 18 have not beenscreened for cervical cancer in the pastthree years. 26Vaccination rates for child- hood vaccines are generally high due toState laws requiring certain vaccinationsfor children to enter school, but recom-mended childhood vaccines that are notsubject to State laws and adult vaccineshave lower vaccination rates ( e.g., the meningococcal vaccination rate amongteenagers is 42 percent). 27Studies have shown that improved coverage of preven-tive services leads to expanded utilizationof these services, 28which would lead to substantial benefits as discussed furtherbelow.In addition, these interim final regu- lations limit preventive service coverageunder this provision to services recom-mended by the Task Force, Advisory Com-mittee, and HRSA. The preventive ser-vices given a grade of A or B by the TaskForce have been determined by the TaskForce to have at least fair or good 29evi- dence that the preventive service improvesimportant health outcomes and that bene-fits outweigh harms in the judgment of anindependent panel of private sector expertsin primary care and prevention. 30Simi- larly, the mission of the Advisory Com-mittee is to provide advice that will leadto a reduction in the incidence of vac-cine preventable diseases in the UnitedStates, and an increase in the safe useof vaccines and related biological prod-ucts. The comprehensive guidelines for in-fants, children, and adolescents supportedby HRSA are developed by multidisci-plinary professionals in the relevant fieldsto provide a framework for improving chil-dren's health and reducing morbidity andmortality based on a review of the rele-vant evidence. The statute and interimfinal regulations limit the preventive ser-vices covered to those recommended by the Task Force, Advisory Committee, andHRSA because the benefits of these pre-ventive services will be higher than othersthat may be popular but unproven. Research suggests significant health benefits from a number of the preventiveservices that would be newly covered withno cost sharing by plans and issuers underthe statute and these interim final regu-lations. A recent article in JAMA stated, \"By one account, increasing delivery ofjust five clinical preventive services wouldavert 100,000 deaths per year.\" 31These five services are all items and services rec-ommended by the Task Force, AdvisoryCommittee, and/or the comprehensiveguidelines supported by HRSA. The Na-tional Council on Prevention Priorities(NCPP) estimated that almost 150,000lives could potentially be saved by in-creasing the 2005 rate of utilization to 90percent for eight of the preventive servicesrecommended by the Task Force or Advi-sory Committee. 32Table 2 shows eight of the services and the number of lives po- tentially saved if utilization of preventiveservices were to increase to 90 percent. 25This differs from the Task Force recommendation that individuals aged 5 0-75 receive fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or c olonoscopy scre ening for colorectal cancer. 26For Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Numbers see e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This paper examines an experiment in which copays r andomly vary across several thousand individuals . The author finds that individuals are sensitive to prices for health services- i.e.as copays decline, more services are demanded. See e.g., Sharon Long, \"On the Road to Universal Coverage: Impacts of Ref orm in Massachusetts At One Year,\" Health Affairs, V olume 27, Number 4 (June 2008). The au thor investigated the case of Massachusetts, where coverage of preventive services became a r equirement in 2007, and found that for individuals under 300 percent of the poverty line, doctor visits for preventive care increased by 6.1 percentage points in the year after adoption, even after controlling f or observable characteristics. Additionally, the incidence of individuals citing cost as the rea son for not receiving preventive screenings decl ined by 2.8 percentage points from 2006 to 2007. In the Massachusetts case, these preventive care services were not necessarily free; therefore, economists would expect a higher differential under these int erim final rules because of the pri ce sensitivity of health care usage. 29The Task Force defines good and fair evidence as fo llows. Good: Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative populations that directly assess effects on health outcomes. Fair: Evidence is sufficient to determ ine effects on health outcomes, but the s trength of the evidence is limited b y the number, quality or consistency of the individual studies, generalizability to routine practic e or indirect nature of the evidence on health outcomes.

Currentutilization of preve ntive services among insured populations varies widely, but theDepartments expect that utilization willincrease among those individuals in plansaffected by the regulation because the pro-visions eliminate cost sharing and requirecoverage for these services. These interim final regulations are expected to increase the take-up rate ofpreventive services and are likely, overtime, to lead physicians to increase theiruse of these services knowing that theywill be covered, and covered with zerocopayment. In the absence of data onthe elasticity of demand for these specificservices, it is difficult to know preciselyhow many more patients will use theseservices. Evidence from studies compar-ing the utilization of preventive servicessuch as blood pressure and cholesterolscreening between insured and uninsuredindividuals with relatively high incomes suggests that coverage increases usagerates in a wide range between three and30 percentage points, even among thoselikely to be able to afford basic preventiveservices out-of-pocket. 33A reasonable assumption is that the average increasein utilization of these services will bemodest, perhaps on the order of 5 to 10percentage points for some of them. Forservices that are generally covered withoutcost sharing in the current market, the De-partments would expect minimal changein utilization. Preventive services' benefits have also been evaluated individually. Effectivecancer screening, early treatment, andsustained risk reduction could reduce thedeath rate due to cancer by 29 percent. 34 Improved blood sugar control could re-duce the risk for eye disease, kidneydisease and nerve disease by 40 percent inpeople with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. 35 Some recommended preventive ser- vices have both individual and publichealth value. Vaccines have reduced oreliminated serious diseases that, prior tovaccination, routinel y caused serious ill- nesses or deaths. Maintaining high levelsof immunization in the general populationprotects the un-immunized from exposureto the vaccine-prevent able disease, so that individuals who ca nnot receive the vaccine or who do not have a sufficient immuneresponse to the vaccine to protect againstthe disease are indirectly protected. 36 A second type of benefit from these interim final regulations is improvedworkplace produc tivity and decreased absenteeism for school children. Numer-ous studies confirm that ill health com-promises worker output and that healthprevention efforts can improve workerproductivity. For example, one studyfound that 69 million workers reportedmissing days due to illness and 55 millionw o r k e r sr e p o r t e dat i m ew h e nt h e yw e r eunable to concentrate at work because oftheir own illness or a family member'sillness. 37Together, labor time lost due to health reasons represents lost economicoutput totaling $260 billion per year. 38 Prevention efforts can help prevent thesetypes of losses.

Illnesses also contribute to increased absenteeism among school children, whichcould be avoided with recommended pre-ventive services. In 2006, 56 percent ofstudents missed between one and five daysof school due to illness, 10 percent missedbetween six and ten days and five percentm i s s e d1 1o rm o r ed a y s . 41Obesity in par- ticular contributes to missed school days:one study from the University of Pennsyl-vania found that overweight children wereabsent on average 20 percent more thantheir normal-weight peers. 42Studies also show that influenza contributes to schoolabsenteeism, and vaccination can reducemissed school days and indirectly improvecommunity health. 43These interim final regulations will ensure that children haveaccess to preventive services, thus decreas-ing the number of days missed due to ill-ness. 44Similarly, regular pediatric care, including care by physicians specializingin pediatrics, can improve child health out-comes and avert preventable health care costs. For example, one study of Medic-aid enrolled children found that when chil-dren were up to date for their age on theirschedule of well-child visits, they wereless likely to have an avoidable hospital-ization at a later time. 45 A third type of benefit from some pre- ventive services is cost savings. Increasingthe provision of preventive services is ex-pected to reduce the incidence or severityof illness, and, as a result, reduce expendi-tures on treatment of illness. For example,childhood vaccinations have generally been found to reduce such expendituresby more than the cost of the vaccinationsthemselves and generate considerable ben-efits to society. Researchers at the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)studying the economic impact of DTaP(diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acel-lular Pertussis), Td (tetanus and diphtheriatoxoids), Hib varicella routin e childhood vaccines found that every dollar spent on immuniza-t i o n si n2 0 0 1w a se s t i m a t e dt os a v e$ 5 . 3 0on direct health care costs and $16.50 ontotal societal costs of the diseases as theyare prevented or reduced (direct healthcare associated with the diseases avertedwere $12.1 billion and total societal costsaverted were $33.9 billion). 46A review of preventive services by the National Committee on Prevention Prior-ities found that, in addition to childhoodimmunizations, two of the recommendedpreventive services \u2014 discussing aspirinuse with high-risk ad ults and tobacco use screening and brief intervention \u2014 arecost-saving on net. 47By itself, tobacco use screening with a brief interventionwas found to save more than $500 persmoker. 48 Another area where prevention could achieve savings is obesity prevention andreduction. Obesity is widely recognizedas an important driver of higher healthcare expenditures. 49The Task Force rec- ommends children over age six and adultsbe screened for obesity and be offered orreferred to counseling to improve weightstatus or promote wei ght loss. Increasing obesity screening and referrals to counsel-ing should decrease obesity and its relatedcosts. If providers are able to proactivelyidentify and monitor obesity in child pa-tients, they may reduce the incidence ofadult health conditions that can be expen-sive to treat, such as diabetes, hyperten-sion, and adult obesity. 50One recent study estimated that a one-percentage-point re-duction in obesity among twelve-year-olds 39See e.g. , RAND, The Health Insurance Experiment: A Classic RAND Study Speaks to the Current Health Care Reform Debate , Rand Research Brief, Number 9174 (2006), at http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/2006/RAND_RB9174.pdf and Janet Currie et. al., \"Has Public Health Insurance for Older Children Reduced Disparities in Access to Care and Health Outcomes?\", J o u r n a lo fH e a l t hE c o n o m i c s , Volume 27, Issue 6, pages 1567-1581 (Dec. 2008). With early childhood interventions, there appear to be improved health outcomes in later childhood. Analogously, health interventions in ea rly adulthood could have benefits for future productivity. 40In a RAND policy brief, the authors cite results from the RAND Health Insuranc e Experiment in which cost-sharing is found to correspond with workers ha ving fewer restricted-activity days-evidence that free care for certain se rvices may be productivity enhancing.

According to the CDC, in 2008,34.2 percent of U.S. adults and 16.9 per-cent of children were obese (defined ashaving a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0or greater). 52Obesity is associated with in- creased risk for coronary heart disease, hy-pertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, severaltypes of cancer, diminished mobility, andsocial stigmatization. 53As a result, obesity is widely recognized as an important driverof higher health care expenditures on an in-dividual 54and national level.55 As described below, the Departments' analysis assumes that the utilization ofpreventive services will increase whenthey are covered with zero copayment,and these interim final regulations areexpected to increase utilization of dietarycounseling services both among people who currently have the service coveredwith a copayment and among people forwhom the service is not currently coveredat all. Data from the 2009 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health BenefitsSurvey shows that 73 percent of employ-ees with employer-sponsored insurancefrom a small (< 200 employees) employerdo not currently have coverage for weightl o s sp r o g r a m s ,c o m p a r e dt o3 8p e r c e n ta tlarge firms. 56In the illustrative analysis below, the share of individuals withoutweight loss coverage in the individualmarket is assumed to be equal to the share in the small group market. The size of the increase in the number of individuals receiving di etary counseling or other weight loss services will be limitedby current physician practice patterns, in which relatively few individuals who areobese receive physician recommendationsfor dietary counseling. In one study of pa-tients at an internal medicine clinic in theBronx, NY, approximately 15 percent ofobese patients received a recommendationfor dietary counseling. 57Similarly, among overweight and obese patients enrolled inthe Cholesterol Education and ResearchTrial, approximately 15 to 20 percent werereferred to nutrition counseling. 58 These interim final regulations are ex- pected to increase the take-up rate of coun-seling among patients who are referred toit, and may, over time, lead physicians toincrease their referral to such counseling,knowing that it will be covered, and cov-ered without cost sharing. The effect ofthese interim final re gulations is expected to be magnified because of the many otherpublic and private sector initiatives dedi-cated to combating the obesity epidemic. In the absence of data on take-up of counseling among patients who are re-ferred by their physicians, it is difficultto know what fraction of the estimated15 percent to 20 percent of patients whoare currently referred to counseling fol-low through on that referral, or how thatfraction will change after coverage ofthese services is expanded. A reasonableassumption is that utilization of dietarycounseling among patients who are obesemight increase by five to 10 percentagepoints as a result of these interim finalregulations. If physicians change their behavior and increase the rate at whichthey refer to counseling, the effect mightbe substantially larger. The share of obese individuals with- out weight loss coverage is estimated tobe 29 percent. 59It is assumed that obese individuals have health care costs 39 per-cent above average, based on a McKinseyGlobal Institute analysis. 60The Task Force noted that counseling interventions led tosustained weight loss ranging from fourpercent to eight percent of body weight,although there is subst antial heterogeneity in results across interventions, with manyinterventions having little long-term ef-fect. 61Assuming midpoint reduction of six percent of body weight, the BMI foran individual taking up such an interven-tion would fall by six percent as well, asheight would remain constant. Based onthe aforementioned McKinsey Global In-stitute analysis, a six percent reduction inBMI for an obese individual (from 32 toaround 30, for example) would result in areduction in health care costs of approx-imately five percent. This parameter forcost reduction is sub ject to considerable uncertainty, given the wide range of po-tential weight loss strategies with varyingdegrees of impact on BMI, and their inter-connectedness with changes in individualhealth care costs. Multiplying the percentage reduction in health care costs by the total premiums ofobese individuals newly gaining obesityprevention coverage allows for an illustra-tive calculation of the total dollar reductionin premiums, and dividing by total premi-ums for the affected population allows foran estimate of the reduction in average pre- 51Ibid. 52Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Obesity and Overweight.\" 2010. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/overwt.htm . 53Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Obesity in Adults.\" December 2003. http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/obesity/obesrr.pdf . 54Thorpe, Kenneth E. \"The Future Costs of Obesity: National and State Estimat es of the Impact of Obesity on Direct Health Care Expenses.\" November 2009; McKinsey Global Institute. \"Sample data suggest that obese adults can incur nearly twice the annual health car e costs of normal-we ight adults.\" 2007. 55Congressional Budget Office. \"Technological Change and the Gr owth of Health Care Spending.\" January 2008.

Doing so results in a potential pri-vate premium reduction of 0.05 percent to0.1 percent from lower health care costsdue to a reduction in obesity for enrolleesin non-grandfathered plans. This does notaccount for potential savings in Medicaid,Medicare, or other health programs. A fourth benefit of these interim fi- nal regulations will be to distribute thecost of preventive services more equitablyacross the broad insured population. SomeAmericans in plans affected by these reg-ulations currently have no coverage ofcertain recommended preventive services,and pay for them entirely out-of-pocket.For some individuals who currently haveno coverage of certain recommendedpreventive services, these interim finalregulations will result in a large savingsin out-of-pocket payments, and only asmall increase in premiums. Many otherAmericans have limite d coverage of cer- tain recommended preventive services,with large coinsurance or deductibles,and also make substantial out-of-pocketpayments to obtain preventive services.Some with limited coverage of preventiveservices will also experience large savingsas a result of these interim final regula-tions. Reductions in out-of-pocket costsare expected to be largest among people inage groups in which relatively expensivepreventive services are most likely to be recommended. 5.Costs and Transfers The changes in how plans and is- suers cover the recommended preventiveservices resulting from these interim fi-nal regulations will result in changes incovered benefits and premiums for in-dividuals in plans and health insurancecoverage subject to these interim final reg-ulations. New costs to the health systemresult when beneficiaries increase theiruse of preventive services in response tothe changes in coverage of preventiveservices. Cost sharing, including coin-surance, deductibles, and copayments,divides the costs of health services be-tween the insurer and the beneficiaries. The removal of cost sharing increases thequantity of services demanded by loweringthe direct cost of the service to consumers.Therefore, the Departments expect that thestatute and these inter im final regulations will increase utilization of the coveredpreventive services. The magnitude of thiseffect on utilization depends on the priceelasticity of demand. Several studies have found that individ- uals are sensitive to prices for health ser-vices. 62Evidence that consumers change their utilization of preventive services isavailable from CDC researchers who stud-ied out-of-pocket costs of immunizationsfor privately insured children up to age 5in families in Georgia in 2003, to find thata one percent increase in out-of-pocketcosts for routine immunizations (DTaP,IPV, MMR, Hib, and Hep B) was asso-ciated with a 0.07 percent decrease inutilization. 63 Along with new costs of induced uti- lization, there are transfers associated withthese interim final re gulations. A transfer is a change in who pays for the services,where there is not an actual change in thelevel of resources used. For example, coststhat were previously paid out-of-pocket forcertain preventive services will now becovered by plans and issuers under theseinterim final regulations. Such a transferof costs could be expected to lead to an in-crease in premiums. a.Estimate of average changes in health insurance premiums The Departments assessed the impact of eliminating cost sharing, increases inservices covered, an d induced utilization on the average insurance premium using amodel to evaluate private health insuranceplans against a nationally representativepopulation. The model is based on theMedical Expenditure Panel Survey datafrom 2004, 2005, and 2006 on house-hold spending on health care, which arescaled to levels consistent with the CMSprojections of the National Health Expen-diture Accounts. 64This data is combinedwith data from the Employer Health Ben- efits Surveys conducted by the KaiserFamily Foundation and Health Researchand Education Trust to model a \"typicalPPO coverage\" plan. The model thenallows the user to assess changes in cov-ered expenses, benefits, premiums, andinduced utilization o f services resulting from changes in the ch aracteristics of the plan. The analysis of changes in cover-age is based on the average per-personcovered expenses and insurance benefits.The average covered expense is the totalcharge for covered services; insurancebenefits are the part of the covered ex-penses covered by the insurer. The effecton the average premium is then estimatedbased on the percentage changes in theinsurance benefits and the distributionof the individuals across individual andgroup markets in non-grandfathered plans.The Departments assume that the percentincrease for insuranc e benefits and premi- ums will be the same. This is based on twoassumptions: (1) that administrative costsincluded in the premium will increase pro-portionally with the increase in insurancebenefits; and (2) that the increases in in-surance benefits will be directly passedon to the consumer in the form of higherpremiums. These assumptions bias the es-timates of premium changes upward. Us-ing this model, the Departments assessed:(1) changes in cost-sharing for currentlycovered and utilized services, (2) changesin services covered, and (3) induced uti-lization of preventive services. There areseveral additional sources of uncertaintyconcerning these estimates. First, thereis no accurate, granular data on exactlywhat baseline coverage is for the particu-lar preventive services addressed in theseinterim final regulations. Second, there isuncertainty over behavioral assumptionsrelated to additional utilization that resultsfrom reduced cost-sharing. Therefore,after providing initial estimates, the De-partments provide a sensitivity analysis tocapture the potential range of impacts ofthese interim final regulations. From the Departments' analysis of the Medical Expend iture Panel Survey 62See e.g. , Jonathan Gruber, The Role of Consumer Copayments for Health Care: Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment and Beyond , Kaiser Family Foundation (Oct. 2006). This paper examines an experiment in which copays ra ndomly vary across several thousand individuals. The author finds that individuals are sensitiv e to prices for health services- i.e.,a s copays decline, more services are , Noelle-Angelique Molinari et. al. , \"Out-of-Pocket Costs of Childhood Immunizations: A Comparison by Type Insurance Plan,\" Pediatrics , 120(5) pp. 148-156 (2006). 64The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) are the official estimate s of total health care spending in the United States. See http://www.cms.g ov/NationalHealthExpendData/02_Na- tionalHealthAccountsHistorical.asp. 2010-35 I.R.B. 285 August 30, 2010(MEPS) data, controlled to be consistent with projections of the National HealthExpenditure Accounts , the average person with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI)has $264 in covered expenses for preven-tive services, of which $240 is paid byinsurance, and $24 is paid out-of-pocket. 65 When preventive services are covered withzero copayment, the Departments expectthe average preventive benefit (holdingutilization constant) will increase by $24.This is a 0.6 percent increase in insurancebenefits and premiums for plans that haverelinquished their grandfather status. Asimilar, but larger effect is expected inthe individual market because existingevidence suggests that individual healthinsurance policies generally have less gen-erous benefits for prev entive services than group health plans. However, the evidencebase for current coverage and cost shar-ing for preventive services in individualhealth insurance policies is weaker thanfor group health plans, making estimationof the increase in average benefits andpremiums in the individual market highlyuncertain. For analyses of changes in covered services, the Departments used the BlueCross/Blue Shield Standard (BC/BS) planoffered through the Federal EmployeesHealth Benefits Program as an averageplan. 66Other analyses have used the BC/BS standard option as an averageplan as it was designed to reflect stan-dard practice within employer-sponsoredhealth insurance plans. 67BC/BS covers most of the preventive services listed inthe Task Force and Advisory Commit-tee recommendations, and most of thepreventive services listed in the compre-hensive guidelines for infants, children,and adolescents supported by HRSA. Notcovered by the BC/BS Standard plan arethe recommendations for genetic testingfor the BRCA gene, adolescent depressionscreening, 68lead testing, autism testing, and oral health screening.69 The Departments estimated the increase in benefits from newly covered services byestimating the number of new services thatwould be provided times the cost of pro-viding the services, and then spread thesenew costs across the total insured popu-lation. The Departments estimated thatadding coverage for genetic screening anddepression screening would increase insur-ance benefits an estimated 0.10 percent.Adding lead testing, autism testing, andoral health screening would increase in-surance benefits by an estimated 0.02 per-cent. This results in a total average in-crease in insurance benefits on these ser-vices of 0.12 percent, or just over $4 perinsured person. This increase represents amixture of new costs and transfers, depen-dent on whether beneficiaries previouslywould have purchased these services ontheir own. It is also important to remem-ber that actual plan impacts will vary de-pending on baseline benefit levels, and thatgrandfathered health plans will not experi- ence any impact from these interim finalregulations. The Departments expect theincrease to be larger in the individual mar-ket because coverage of preventive ser-vices in the individual market is less com-plete than coverage in the group market,but as noted previously, the evidence basefor the individual market is weaker thanthat of the group market, making detailedestimates of the size of this effect difficultand highly uncertain. Actuaries use an \"induction formula\" to estimate the behavioral change in responseto changes in the relative levels of cover-age for health services. For this analysis,the Departments used the model to esti-mate the induced demand (the increaseduse of preventive services). The modeluses a standard actuarial formula for in-duction 1/(1+alpha*P), where alpha is the\"induction parameter\" and P is the aver-age fraction of the cost of services paid by the consumer. The induction parameter forphysician services is 0.7, derived by thestandard actuarial formula that is generallyconsistent with the estimates of price elas-ticity of demand from the RAND HealthInsurance Experiment and other economicstudies. 70Removing cost sharing for pre- ventive services lowers the direct cost toconsumers of using pr eventive services, which induces addition al utilization, esti- mated with the model above to increasecovered expenses and benefits by approx-imately $17, or 0.44 percent in insurancebenefits in group health plans. The Depart-ments expect a similar but larger effect inthe individual market, although these esti-mates are highly uncertain. The Departments calculated an estimate of the average impact using the informa-tion from the analyses described above,using estimates of the number of individ-uals in non-grandfathered health plans inthe group and individual markets in 2011.The Departments estimate that premiumswill increase by approximately 1.5 percenton average for enrollees in non-grandfa-thered plans. This estimate assumes thatany changes in insurance benefits will bedirectly passed on to the consumer in theform of changes in premiums. As men-tioned earlier, this assumption biases theestimates of premium change upward. b.Sensitivity analysis As discussed previously, there is sub- stantial uncertainty associated with the es-timates presented above. To address theuncertainty in the group market, the De-partments first varied the estimated changeto underlying benefits, to address the par-ticular uncertainty behind the estimate ofbaseline coverage of preventive services inthe group market. The estimate for the perperson annual increase in insurance ben-efits from adding coverage for new ser- 65The model does not distinguish between recommended and non-recommended pre ventive services, and so this likely represents an overestimate of the in surance benefits for preventive services. 66The Blue Cross Blue Shield standard option plan documentation is available online at http://fepblue.org/benefitplans/standard-option/index.html . 67Frey A, Mika S, Nuzum R, and Schoen C. \"Setting a National Minimum Standard for Health Benefits: How do State Benefit Mandates Compare with Benefits in L arge-Group Plans?\" Issue Brief.

August 30, 286 2010-35 I.R.B.vices is approximately $4. The Depart- ments considered the impact of a smallerand larger addition in benefits of approxi-mately $2 and $6 per person. To considerthe impact of uncertainty around the size ofthe behavioral change (that is, the utiliza-tion of more services when cost sharing iseliminated), the Departments analyzed theimpact on insurance benefits if the behav-ioral change were 15 percent smaller and15 percent larger. In the individual market, to accommo- date the greater uncertainty relative to thegroup market, the Departments consideredthe impact of varying the increase in ben-efits resulting from cost shifting due to theelimination of cost sharing, in addition tovarying the cost of newly covered servicesand behavioral change. Combining results in the group and individual markets for enrollees innon-grandfathered plans, the Depart-ments' low-end is a few tenths of a percentlower than the mid-range estimate of ap-proximately 1.5 percent, and the high-endestimate is a few tenths of a percent higher.Grandfathered health plans are not sub-ject to these interim final regulations andtherefore would not experience this pre-mium change. 6.Alternatives considered Several provisions in these interim final regulations involved policy choices. Onewas whether to allow a plan or issuer to im-pose cost sharing for an office visit whena recommended preventive service is pro-vided in that visit. Sometimes a recom-mended preventive service is billed sepa-rately from the office visit; sometimes it isnot. The Departments decided that the costsharing prohibition of these interim finalregulations applies to the specific preven-tive service as recommended by the guide-lines. Therefore, if the preventive serviceis billed separately from the office visit, itis the preventive service that has cost shar-ing waived, not the entire office visit. A second policy choice was if the pre- ventive service is not billed separatelyfrom the office visit, whether these in-terim final regulations should prohibit costsharing for any office visit in which anyrecommended preventive service was ad-ministered, or whether cost sharing shouldbe prohibited only when the preventiveservice is the primary purpose of the officevisit. Prohibiting cost sharing for office visits when any recommended preventiveservice is provided, regardless of the pri-mary purpose of the visit, could lead to anoverly broad application of these interimfinal regulations; for example, a personwho sees a specialist for a particular con-dition could end up with a zero copaymentsimply because his or her blood pressurewas taken as part of the office visit. Thiscould create financi al incentives for con- sumers to request preventive services atoffice visits that are intended for otherpurposes in order to avoid copayments anddeductibles. The increased prevalence ofthe application of zero cost sharing wouldlead to increased prem iums compared with the chosen option, without a meaningfuladditional gain in access to preventiveservices. A third issue involves health plans that have differential cost sharing for servicesprovided by providers who are in and outof their networks. Thes e interim final reg- ulations provide that a plan or issuer is notrequired to provide coverage for recom-mended preventive services delivered byan out-of-network provider. The plan or is-suer may also impose cost sharing for rec-ommended preventive services deliveredby an out-of-network provider. The De-partments considered that requiring cover-age by out-of-network providers at no costsharing would result in higher premiumsfor these interim final regulations. Plansand issuers negotiate allowed charges within-network providers as a way to promoteeffective, efficient health care, and allow-ing differences in cost sharing in- and out-of-network enables plans to encourage useof in-network providers. Allowing zerocost sharing for out of network providerscould reduce providers' incentives to par-ticipate in insurer networks. The Depart-ments decided that permitting cost shar-ing for recommended preventive servicesprovided by out-of-network providers isthe appropriate option to preserve choiceof providers for individuals, while avoid-ing potentially larger increases in costs andtransfers as well as potentially lower qual-ity care.C.Regulatory Flexibility Act\u2014Department of Labor andDepartment of Health and HumanServices The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) (RFA) imposes cer- tain requirements with respect to Federalrules that are subject to the notice andcomment requirements of section 553(b)of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq .) and that are likely to have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of smallentities. Section 9833 of the Code, section734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of thePHS Act authorize the Secretaries to pro-mulgate any interim final rules that theydetermine are appropriate to carry out theprovisions of chapter 100 of the Code, part7 of subtitle B or title I of ERISA, and partA of title XXVII of the PHS Act, whichinclude PHS Act sections 2701 through2728 and the incorporation of those sec-tions into ERISA section 715 and Codesection 9815. Moreover, under Section 553(b) of the APA, a general notice of proposed rule-making is not required when an agency,for good cause, finds that notice and pub-lic comment thereon are impracticable, un-necessary, or contrary to the public inter-est. These interim final regulations are ex-empt from APA, because the Departmentsmade a good cause finding that a generalnotice of proposed rulemaking is not nec-essary earlier in this preamble. Therefore,the RFA does not apply and the Depart-ments are not required to either certify thatthe rule would not have a significant eco-nomic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities or conduct a regulatory flex-ibility analysis. Nevertheless, the Departments care- fully considered the likely impact of therule on small entities in connection withtheir assessment under Executive Order12866. Consistent with the policy ofthe RFA, the Departments encourage thepublic to submit comments that suggestalternative rules that accomplish the statedpurpose of the Affordable Care Act andminimize the impact on small entities. D.Special Analyses-Department of the Treasury Notwithstanding the determinations of the Department of Labor and Department 2010-35 I.R.B. 287 August 30, 2010of Health and Human Services, for pur- poses of the Department of the Treasury, ithas been determined that this Treasury de-cision is not a signifi cant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866.Therefore, a regulat ory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the APA (5 U.S.C. chap-ter 5) does not apply to these interim fi-nal regulations. For the applicability of theRFA, refer to the Special Analyses sectionin the preamble to the cross-referencingnotice of proposed rulemaking publishedelsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin. Pur-suant to section 7805(f) of the Code, thesetemporary regulations have been submit-ted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacyof the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small busi-nesses. E.Paperwork Reduction Act: Department of Labor, Department of the Treasury,and Department of Health and HumanServices These interim final regulations are not subject to the requirements of the Paper-work Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 et seq. ) because it does not contain a of information\" as defined in44 U.S.C. 3502 (11). F.Congressional Review Act These interim final regulations are subject to the Congressional Review Actprovisions of the Small Business Regula-tory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5U.S.C. 801 et seq .) and have been trans- mitted to Congress and the ComptrollerGeneral for review. G.Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) requires agen-cies to prepare several analytic statementsbefore proposing any rules that may resultin annual expenditures of $100 million (asadjusted for inflation) by State, local andtribal governments or the private sector.These interim final regulations are not sub-ject to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Actbecause they are being issued as interim fi-nal regulations. However, consistent witht h ep o l i c ye m b o d i e di nt h eU n f u n d e dM a n -dates Reform Act, these interim final reg-ulations have been designed to be the leastburdensome alternative for State, local and tribal governments, and the private sector,while achieving the objectives of the Af-fordable Care Act. HFederalism Statement\u2014Department of Labor and Department of Health andHuman Services Executive Order 1 3132 outlines fun- damental principles of federalism, andrequires the adherence to specific criteriaby Federal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on the States, the relationship between thenational government and States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government.Federal agencies promulgating regulationsthat have these federalism implicationsmust consult with State and local officials,and describe the exte nt of their consulta- tion and the nature of the concerns of Stateand local officials in the preamble to theregulation. In the Departments' view, these interim final regulations have federalism impli-cations, because they have direct effectson the States, the relationship betweenthe national government and States, or onthe distribution of power and responsibili-ties among various levels of government.However, in the Departments' view, thefederalism implications of these interim fi-nal regulations are substantially mitigatedbecause, with respect to health insuranceissuers, the Departments expect that themajority of States will enact laws or takeother appropriate action resulting in theirmeeting or exceeding the Federal stan-dards. In general, through section 514, ERISA supersedes State laws to the extent thatthey relate to any covered employee ben-efit plan, and preserves State laws thatregulate insurance, banking, or securities.While ERISA prohibits States from regu-lating a plan as an insurance or investmentcompany or bank, the preemption provi-sions of section 731 of ERISA and section2724 of the PHS Act (implemented in 29CFR 2590.731(a) and 45 CFR 146.143(a))apply so that the HIPAA requirements (in-cluding those of the Affordable Care Act)are not to be ''construed to supersede anyprovision of State law which establishes,implements, or continues in effect anystandard or requirement solely relating to health insurance issuers in connectionwith group health insurance coverage ex-cept to the extent that such standard orrequirement prevents the application of arequirement\" of a Federal standard. Theconference report accompanying HIPAAindicates that this is intended to be the''narrowest'' preemption of State laws.(See House Conf. Rep. No. 104-736, at205, reprinted in 1996 U.S. Code Cong. &Admin. News 2018.) States may continueto apply State law requirements except tothe extent that such requirements preventthe application of the Affordable CareAct requirements that are the subject ofthis rulemaking. State insurance lawsthat are more stringent than the Federalrequirements are unlikely to ''prevent theapplication of'' the Affordable Care Act,and be preempted. Accordingly, Stateshave significant latitude to impose require-ments on health insurance issuers that aremore restrictive than the Federal law. In compliance with the requirement of Executive Order 13132 that agencies ex- amine closely any policies that may havefederalism implications or limit the policymaking discretion of the States, the De-partments have engaged in efforts to con-s u l tw i t ha n dw o r kc o o p e r a t i v e l yw i t ha f -fected State and local of ficials, including attending conferences of the National As- sociation of Insurance Commissioners andconsulting with State i nsurance officials on an individual basis. It is expected that theDepartments will act in a similar fashion inenforcing the Affordable Care Act require-ments. Throughout the process of devel-oping these interim final regulations, to theextent feasible within the specific preemp-tion provisions of HIPAA as it applies tothe Affordable Care Act, the Departmentshave attempted to balance the States' in-terests in regulating health insurance is-suers, and Congress' intent to provide uni-form minimum protections to consumersin every State. By doing so, it is the De-partments' view that they have compliedwith the requirements of Executive Order13132. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in section 8(a) of Executive Order 13132,and by the signatures affixed to these in-terim final regulations, the Departmentscertify that the Employee Benefits Secu-rity Administration and the Centers forMedicare & Medicaid S ervices have com- August 30, 2010 288 2010-35 I.R.B.plied with the requirements of Executive Order 13132 for the attached regulations ina meaningful and timely manner. V . Recommended Preventive Services as of July 14, 2010. The materials that follow list recom- mended preventive services, current as ofJuly 14, 2010, that will have to be coveredwithout cost-sharing when delivered byan in-network provider. In many cases,the recommendations or guidelines wentinto effect before September 23, 2009;therefore the recommended services mustbe covered under these interim final reg-ulations in plan years (in the individualmarket, policy years) that begin on or afterSeptember 23, 2010. However, there aresome services that appear in the figure thatare based on recommendations or guide-lines that went into effect at some pointlater than September 23, 2009. Those ser-vices do not have to be covered under theseinterim final regulations until plan years(in the individual market, policy years)that begin at some point later than Septem-ber 23, 2010. In addition, there are afew recommendations and guidelines thatwent into effect after September 23, 2009and are not included in the figure. In bothcases, information at http://www.Health- Care.gov/center/regulations/preven-tion.html specifically identifies those ser- vices and the relevant dates. The materialsathttp://www.HealthCare.gov/center/reg- ulations/prevention.html will be updated on an ongoing basis, and will contain themost current recommended preventiveservices. A.Recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (TaskForce) Recommendations of the Task Force appear in a chart that follows. This chartincludes a description of the topic, the textof the Task Force recommendation, thegrade the recommendation received (A orB), and the date that the recommendationwent into effect. B.Recommendations of the Advisory Committee On Immunization Practices(Advisory Committ ee) That Have Been Adopted by the Director of the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention Recommendations of the Advisory Committee appear in four immunizationschedules that follow: a schedule forchildren age 0 to 6 years, a schedule for children age 7 to 18 years, a \"catch-up\"schedule for children, and a schedule foradults. Immunization schedules are is-sued every year, and the schedules thatappear here are the 2010 schedules. Theschedules contain graphics that provideinformation about the recommended agefor vaccination, number of doses needed,interval between the doses, and (for adults)recommendations asso ciated with partic- ular health conditions. In addition to thegraphics, the schedul es contain detailed footnotes that provide further informationon each immunization in the schedule. C.Comprehensive Guidelines Supported by the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration (HRSA) for Infants,Children, and Adolescents Comprehensive guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents supported byHRSA appear in two charts that follow:the Periodicity Schedule of the BrightFutures Recommendations for PediatricPreventive Health Care, and the UniformPanel of the Secretary's Advisory on Heritable Children. 2010-35 August 30, 2010August 30, 2010 300 2010-35 I.R.B.2010-35 I.R.B. 301 August 30, 2010August 30, 2010 302 2010-35 I.R.B.2010-35 I.R.B. 303 August 30, 2010VI.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service26 CFR Chapter 1 Accordingly, 26 CFR Part 54 is amended as follows: PART 54\u2014PENSION EXCISE TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 54 is amended by adding an entryfor \u00a754.9815-2713T in numerical order toread in part 26 U.S.C. 7805. * *Section 54.9815-2713T also issued un- der 26 U.S.C. 9833. * * * Par. 2. Section 54.9815-2713T is added to read as follows: \u00a754.9815-2713T Coverage of preventive health services (temporary) . (a)Services \u2014(1) In general .B e g i n - ning at the time described in paragraph(b) of this section, a group health plan,or a health insurance issuer offering grouphealth insurance coverage, must providecoverage for all of the following items andservices, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copay-ment, coinsurance, or deductible) with re-spect to those items or services: (i) Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B in thecurrent recommenda tions of the United States Preventive Serv ices Task Force with respect to the individual involved (exceptas otherwise provided in paragraph (c) ofthis section); (ii) Immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents , and adults that have in effect a recommendation from the Ad-visory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices of the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention with respect to the individ-ual involved (for this purpose, a recom-mendation from the Advisory Committeeon Immunization Practices of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention is con-sidered in effect after it has been adoptedby the Director of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, and a recommen-dation is considered to be for routine use ifit is listed on the Immunization Schedulesof the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention); (iii) With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evi dence-informed pre- ventive care and scr eenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Admin-istration; and (iv) With respect to women, to the ex- tent not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) ofthis section, evidence-informed preven-tive care and screenings provided for incomprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration. (2)Office visits \u2014 (i) If an item or ser- vice described in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection is billed separately (or is tracked asindividual encounter data separately) froman office visit, then a plan or issuer mayimpose cost-sharing requirements with re-spect to the office visit. (ii) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is the delivery of such an item or ser-vice, then a plan or issuer may not imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. ( i i i )I fa ni t e mo rs e r v i c ed e s c r i b e di n paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is not the delivery of such an item orservice, then a plan or issuer may imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. (iv) The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits an in-network health care provider. While visiting the provider, the individual is screened for cholesterol abnormalities, which hasin effect a rating of A or B in the current recommen- dations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force with respect to the individual. The providerbills the plan for an office visit and for the laboratory work of the cholesterol screening test. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 1 , the plan may not impose any cost-sharing requirements with re- spect to the separately-billed laboratory work of the cholesterol screening test. Because the office visit isbilled separately from the cholesterol screening test, the plan may impose cost-sharing requirements for the office visit. Example 2 .( i ) Facts . Same facts as Example 1 . As the result of the screening, the individual is diag- nosed with hyperlipidemia and is prescribed a course August 30, 2010 304 2010-35 I.R.B.of treatment that is not included in the recommenda- tions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 2 , because the treatment is not included in the recommendations un- der paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the plan is notprohibited from imposing cost-sharing requirements with respect to the treatment. Example 3 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits an in-network health care provider to discuss recurring abdominal pain. During the visit, the individual has a blood pressure screen-i n g ,w h i c hh a si ne f f e c tar a t i n go fAo rBi nt h ec u r - rent recommendations of the United States Preven- tive Services Task Force with respect to the individ-ual. The provider bills the plan for an office visit. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 3 , the blood pres- sure screening is provided as part of an office visit forwhich the primary purpose was not to deliver items or services described in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec- tion. Therefore, the plan may impose a cost-sharingrequirement for the office visit charge. Example 4 .( i )Facts . A child covered by a group health plan visits an in-network pediatrician to re-ceive an annual physical exam described as part of the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. During theoffice visit, the child receives additional items and services that are not described in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources andServices Administration, nor otherwise described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The provider bills the plan for an office visit. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 4 ,t h es e r v i c e was not billed as a separate charge and was billed as part of an office visit. Moreover, the primary pur-pose for the visit was to deliver items and services described as part of the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration. Therefore, the plan may not impose a cost-sharing requirement with respect to the office visit. (3)Out-of-network providers .N o t h - ing in this section requires a plan or is-suer that has a network of providers toprovide benefits for items or services de-scribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sectionthat are delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. Moreover, nothing in this sec-tion precludes a plan or issuer that has anetwork of providers from imposing cost-sharing requirement s for items or services described in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion that are delivered by an out-of-net-work provider. (4)Reasonable medical management . Nothing prevents a plan or issuer fromusing reasonable medical managementtechniques to determine the frequency,method, treatment, or setting for an itemor service described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section to the extent not specified inthe recommendation or guideline. (5)Services not described . Nothing in this section prohibits a plan or issuerfrom providing coverage for items and services in addition to those recommendedby the United States Preventive ServicesTask Force or the Advisory Committeeon Immunization Practices of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, orprovided for by guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration, or from denying coveragefor items and services that are not recom-mended by that task force or that advisorycommittee, or under those guidelines. Aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharingrequirements for a treatment not describedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section, evenif the treatment results from an item orservice described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. (b)Timing \u2014(1) In general . A plan or issuer must provide coverage pursuant toparagraph (a)(1) of this section for planyears that begin on or after September 23,2010, or, if later, for plan years that beginon or after the date that is one year afterthe date the recommendation or guidelineis issued. (2)Changes in recommendations or guidelines . A plan or issuer is not required under this section to provide coverage forany items and services specified in anyrecommendation or gu ideline described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section afterthe recommendation or guideline is nolonger described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. Other requirements of Fed-eral or State law may a pply in connection with a plan or issuer ceasing to providecoverage for any such items or services,including PHS Act section 2715(d)(4),which requires a plan or issuer to give 60days advance notice to an enrollee beforeany material modification will becomeeffective. (c)Recommendations not current .F o r purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of thissection, and for purposes of any otherprovision of law, recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce regarding breast cancer screening,mammography, and prevention issued inor around November 2009 are not consid-ered to be current. (d)Effective/applicability date .T h e provisions of this section apply for planyears beginning on or after September23, 2010. See\u00a754.9815-1251T for de- termining the application of this sectionto grandfathered health plans (providingthat these rules regarding coverage of pre- ventive health services do not apply tograndfathered health plans). (e)Expiration date . This section ex- pires on July 12, 2013 or on such earlierd a t ea sm a yb ep r o v i d e di nf i n a lr e g u l a -tions or other action published in the Fed- eral Register .

(a)Services \u2014(1) In general .B e g i n - ning at the time described in paragraph(b) of this section, a group health plan,or a health insurance issuer offering grouphealth insurance coverage, must providecoverage for all of the following items andservices, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copay-ment, coinsurance, or deductible) with re-spect to those items or services: (i) Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B in thecurrent recommendations of the United 2010-35 I.R.B. 305 August 30, 2010States Preventive Services Task Force with respect to the individual involved (exceptas otherwise provided in paragraph (c) ofthis section); (ii) Immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents , and adults that have in effect a recommendation from the Ad-visory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices of the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention with respect to the individ-ual involved (for this purpose, a recom-mendation from the Advisory Committeeon Immunization Prac tices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is con-sidered in effect after it has been adoptedby the Director of the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, and a recommen-dation is considered to be for routine use ifit is listed on the Immunization Schedulesof the Centers for Dis ease Control and Pre- vention); (iii) With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed pre-ventive care and screenings provided forin comprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Admin-istration; and (iv) With respect to women, to the ex- tent not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) ofthis section, evidence-informed preven-tive care and screenings provided for incomprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration. (2)Office visits \u2014 (i) If an item or ser- vice described in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection is billed separately (or is tracked asindividual encounter d ata separately) from an office visit, then a plan or issuer mayimpose cost-sharing requirements with re-spect to the office visit. (ii) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is the delivery of such an item or ser-vice, then a plan or issuer may not imposecost-sharing requir ements with respect to the office visit. ( i i i )I fa ni t e mo rs e r v i c ed e s c r i b e di n paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is not the delivery of such an item orservice, then a plan or issuer may imposecost-sharing requirements with respect to the office visit. (iv) The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits anin-network health care provider. Whilevisiting the provider, the individual isscreened for cholesterol abnormalities,which has in effect a rating of A or Bin the current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce with respect to the individual. Theprovider bills the plan for an office visitand for the laboratory work of the choles-terol screening test. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 1 ,t h e plan may not impose any cost-sharing re-quirements with respect to the separately-billed laboratory work of the cholesterolscreening test. Because the office visitis billed separately f rom the cholesterol screening test, the plan may impose cost-sharing requirements for the office visit. Example 2 .( i )Facts . Same facts as Ex- ample 1 . As the result of the screening, the individual is diagnosed with hyperlipi-demia and is prescribed a course of treat-ment that is not included in the recommen-dations under paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 2 ,b e - cause the treatment is not included in therecommendations under paragraph (a)(1)of this section, the plan is not prohibitedfrom imposing cost-sharing requirementswith respect to the treatment. Example 3 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits anin-network health care provider to discussrecurring abdominal pain. During the visit,the individual has a blood pressure screen-ing, which has in effect a rating of A or B inthe current recommendations of the UnitedStates Preventive Serv ices Task Force with respect to the individual. The providerbills the plan for an office visit. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 3 ,t h e blood pressure screening is provided aspart of an office visit for which the pri-mary purpose was not to deliver items orservices described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. Therefore, the plan may im-pose a cost-sharing requirement for the of-fice visit charge. Example 4 .( i ) Facts . A child covered by a group health plan visits an in-networkpediatrician to receive an annual physicalexam described as part of the comprehen- sive guidelines supported by the HealthResources and Services Administration.During the office visit, the child receivesadditional items and services that are notdescribed in the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resources andServices Administration, nor otherwisedescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion. The provider bills the plan for anoffice visit. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 4 ,t h e service was not billed as a separate chargeand was billed as part of an office visit.Moreover, the primary purpose for the visitwas to deliver items and services describedas part of the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resources andServices Administration. Therefore, theplan may not impose a cost-sharing re-quirement with respect to the office visit. (3)Out-of-network providers .N o t h - ing in this section requires a plan or is-suer that has a network of providers toprovide benefits for items or services de-scribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sectionthat are delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. Moreover, nothing in this sec-tion precludes a plan or issuer that has anetwork of providers from imposing cost-sharing requirements for items or servicesdescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion that are delivered by an out-of-net-work provider. (4)Reasonable medical management . Nothing prevents a plan or issuer fromusing reasonable medical managementtechniques to determine the frequency,method, treatment, or setting for an itemor service described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section to the extent not specified inthe recommendation or guideline. (5)Services not described . Nothing in this section prohibits a plan or issuerfrom providing coverage for items andservices in addition to those recommended by the United States Preventive ServicesTask Force or the Advisory Committeeon Immunization Practices of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, orprovided for by guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration, or from denying coveragefor items and services that are not recom-mended by that task force or that advisorycommittee, or under those guidelines. Aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharingrequirements for a treatment not described August 30, 2010 306 2010-35 I.R.B.in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, even if the treatment results from an item orservice described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. (b)Timing \u2014(1) In general .A p l a n o r issuer must provide coverage pursuant toparagraph (a)(1) of t his section for plan years that begin on or after September 23,2010, or, if later, for plan years that beginon or after the date that is one year afterthe date the recommendation or guidelineis issued. (2)Changes in recommendations or guidelines . A plan or issuer is not required under this section to provide coverage forany items and services specified in anyrecommendation or guideline describedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section afterthe recommendation or guideline is nolonger described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. Other requirements of Fed-eral or State law may apply in connectionwith a plan or issuer ceasing to providecoverage for any such items or services,including PHS Act s ection 2715(d)(4), which requires a plan or issuer to give 60days advance notice to an enrollee beforeany material modification will becomeeffective.

(ii) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is the delivery of such an item or ser-vice, then a plan or issuer may not imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. ( i i i )I fa ni t e mo rs e r v i c ed e s c r i b e di n paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not billedseparately (or is not tracked as individualencounter data separately) from an officevisit and the primary purpose of the officevisit is not the delivery of such an item orservice, then a plan or issuer may imposecost-sharing requirements with respect tothe office visit. (iv) The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits anin-network h ealth care provider. While visiting the provider, the individual isscreened for cholesterol abnormalities,which has in effect a rating of A or Bin the current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce with respect to the individual. Theprovider bills the plan for an office visitand for the laboratory work of the choles-terol screening test. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 1 ,t h e plan may not impose any cost-sharing re-quirements with resp ect to the separately- billed laboratory work of the cholesterolscreening test. Because the office visitis billed separately from the cholesterolscreening test, the plan may impose cost-sharing requirements for the office visit. Example 2 .( i )Facts . Same facts as Ex- ample 1 . As the result of the screening, the individual is diagnosed with hyperlipi-demia and is prescribed a course of treat- 2010-35 I.R.B. 307 August 30, 2010ment that is not included in the recommen- dations under paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 2 ,b e - cause the treatment is not included in therecommendations under paragraph (a)(1)of this section, the plan is not prohibitedfrom imposing cost-sharing requirementswith respect to the treatment. Example 3 .( i ) Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits anin-network health care provider to discussrecurring abdominal pain. During the visit,the individual has a blood pressure screen-ing, which has in effect a rating of A or B inthe current recommendations of the UnitedStates Preventive Services Task Force withrespect to the individual. The providerbills the plan for an office visit. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 3 ,t h e blood pressure screening is provided aspart of an office visit for which the pri-mary purpose was not to deliver items orservices described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. Therefore, the plan may im-pose a cost-sharing requirement for the of-fice visit charge. Example 4 .( i ) Facts . A child covered by a group health plan visits an in-networkpediatrician to receive an annual physicalexam described as part of the comprehen-sive guidelines supported by the HealthResources and Services Administration.During the office visit, the child receivesadditional items and services that are notdescribed in the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resources andServices Administration, nor otherwisedescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion. The provider bills the plan for anoffice visit. (ii)Conclusion .I n t h i s Example 4 ,t h e service was not billed as a separate chargeand was billed as part of an office visit.Moreover, the primary purpose for the visitwas to deliver items and services describedas part of the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Therefore, theplan may not impose a cost-sharing re-quirement for the office visit charge. (3)Out-of-network providers. Noth- ing in this section requires a plan or is-suer that has a network of providers toprovide benefits for items or services de- scribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sectionthat are delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. Moreover, nothing in this sec-tion precludes a plan or issuer that has anetwork of providers from imposing cost-sharing requirements for items or servicesdescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion that are deliver ed by an out-of-net- work provider. (4)Reasonable medical management . Nothing prevents a plan or issuer fromusing reasonable medical managementtechniques to determine the frequency,method, treatment, or setting for an itemor service described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section to the extent not specified inthe recommendation or guideline. (5)Services not described . Nothing in this section prohibits a plan or issuerfrom providing coverage for items andservices in addition to those recommendedby the United States Preventive ServicesTask Force or the Advisory Committeeon Immunization Practices of the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention, orprovided for by guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration, or from denying coveragefor items and services that are not recom-mended by that task force or that advisorycommittee, or under those guidelines. Aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharingrequirements for a treatment not describedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section, evenif the treatment results from an item orservice described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. (b)Timing \u2014(1) In general . A plan or issuer must provide coverage pursuant toparagraph (a)(1) of this section for plan years (in the individual market, policyyears) that begin on or after September23, 2010, or, if later, for plan years (in theindividual market, policy years) that beginon or after the date that is one year afterthe date the recommendation or guidelineis issued. (2)Changes in recommendations or guidelines . A plan or issuer is not required under this section to provide coverage forany items and services specified in anyrecommendation or guideline describedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section afterthe recommendation or guideline is nolonger described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section. Other requirements of Fed-eral or State law may apply in connectionwith a plan or issuer ceasing to providecoverage for any such items or services,including PHS Act section 2715(d)(4),which requires a plan or issuer to give 60days advance notice to an enrollee beforeany material modification will becomeeffective. (c)Recommendations not current .F o r purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of thissection, and for purposes of any otherprovision of law, recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce regarding breast cancer screening,mammography, and prevention issued inor around November 2009 are not consid-ered to be current. (d)Applicability date . The provisions of this section apply for plan years (in theindividual market, for policy years) begin-ning on or after September 23, 2010. See \u00a7147.140 of this Part for determining theapplication of this section to grandfatheredhealth plans (providing that these rules re-garding coverage of preventive health ser-vices do not apply to grandfathered healthplans).

Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous 26 CFR 601.105: Examination of returns and claims for refund, credit, or abatement; determination of taxliability. Rev. Proc. 2010-29 SECTION 1. PURPOSE This revenue procedure provides the domestic asset/liability percentages anddomestic investment yields needed by for-eign life insurance companies and foreignproperty and liability insurance compa-nies to compute their minimum effectivelyconnected net investment income undersection 842(b) of the Internal RevenueCode for taxable years beginning afterDecember 31, 2008. Inst ructions are pro- vided for computing foreign insurancecompanies' liabilities for the estimated taxand installment payments of estimated taxfor taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2008. For more specific guidanceregarding the computation of the amountof net investment income to be included bya foreign insurance company on its U.S. in-come tax return, see Notice 89-96, 1989-2C.B. 417. For the domestic asset/liabilitypercentage and domestic investment yield,as well as instructions for computing for-eign insurance companies' liabilities forestimated tax and installment payments ofestimated tax for taxable years beginningafter December 31, 2007, see Rev. Proc.2009-34, 2009-34 I.R.B. 258. SECTION 2. CHANGES DOMESTIC ASSET/LIABILITY PERCENTAGES FOR 2009. The Secre-tary determines the domestic asset/liabilitypercentage separately for life insurancecompanies and property and liability in- surance companies. For the first taxableyear beginning after December 31, 2008,the relevant domestic asset/liability per-centages are: 138.5 percent for foreign life insurance companies, and 193.4 percent for foreign property and liability insurance companies. .02 DOMESTIC INVESTMENT YIELDS FOR 2009. The Secretary isrequired to prescribe separate domestic in-vestment yields for foreign life insurancecompanies and for foreign property andliability insurance companies. For the firsttaxable year beginning after December 31,2008, the relevant domestic investmentyields are: 5.2 percent for foreign life insurance companies, and 4.2 percent for foreign property and li- ability insurance companies. .03 SOURCE OF DATA FOR 2009. The section 842(b) percentages to be usedfor the 2009 tax year are based on tax re-turn data following the same methodologyused for the 2008 year. SECTION 3. APPLICATION\u2014ESTIMATED TAXES To compute estimated tax and the in- stallment payments of estimated tax duefor taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2008, a foreign insurance com-pany must compute its estimated tax pay-ments by adding to its income other thannet investment income the greater of (i) itsnet investment income as determined un-der section 842(b)(5), that is actually ef-fectively connected with the conduct of atrade or business within the United Statesfor the relevant period, or (ii) the mini- mum effectively connected net investmentincome under section 842(b) that would re-sult from using the most recently availabledomestic asset/liability percentage and do-mestic investment yield. Thus, for install-ment payments due after the publication ofthis revenue procedure, the domestic as-set/liability percentages and the domesticinvestment yields provided in this revenueprocedure must be used to compute theminimum effectively connected net invest-ment income. However, if the due date ofan installment is less than 20 days after thedate this revenue procedure is publishedin the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the as-set/liability percentages and domestic in-vestment yields provided in Rev. Proc.2009-34 may be used to compute the mini-mum effectively connected net investmentincome for such installment. For furtherguidance in computing estimated tax, seeNotice 89-96. SECTION 4.

SUMMARY: Elsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin , the IRS is issuing temporary reg- ulations (T.D. 9493) under the provisions of the Pa tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) regard- ing prev entive health services. The IRS is issui ng the temporary regulations at the same tim e that the Employee Benefits Se- curity Administration of the U.S. Depart- ment of Labor and the Office of Consumer Inform ation and Insurance Oversight of the U.S . Department of Health and Hu- man Ser vices are issuing substantially sim- ilar i nterim final regulations with respect to gro up health plans and health insur- ance c overage offered in connection with a group health plan under the Employee Re- tirem ent Income Security Act of 1974 and the P ublic Health Service Act. The tempo- rary regulations provide guidance to em- ployers, group health plans, and health in- surance issuers providing group health in- surance coverage. The text of those tem- porary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations. DAT ES: Written or electronic comments andrequests for a public hearing must be received by October 18, 2010. ADD RESSES: Send submissions to: 7604, B e nF r a n k l i nS t a - tion, Washing ton, DC 20044.

SUPPLEMEN TARY INFORMATION: Backgroun d and Provision s The tempor ary regulations published elsewher e in this issue of the Bulletin add \u00a754.9815 -2713T to the Miscellaneous Ex- cise Tax R egulations. The proposed and temporar y regulations are being published as part o f a joint rulemaking with the De- partmen t of Labor and the Department of Healt h and Human Services (the joint rulemak ing). The text of those temporary regulat ions also serves as the text of these propos ed regulations. The preamble to the tem porary regulations explains the tempor ary regulations and these proposed regula tions. Specia lA n a l y s e s It has b een determined that this notice of prop osed rulemaking is not a signifi- cant re gulatory action as defined in Exec- utive Order 12866. Therefore, a regula- tory a ssessment is not required. It has also been d etermined that section 553(b) of the Admin istrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapt er 5) does not apply to these regu- lations, and because the regulation does not impose a collection of information re- quirement on small entities, the Regula- tory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f)of the Interna l Revenue Code, this regula- tion has been s ubmitted to the Chief Coun- sel for Advoca cy of the Small Business Administrati on for comment on its impact on small busin ess. Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, considerationwill be given to any written comments(a signed original and eight (8) copies)or electronic comments that are submittedtimely to the IRS. Comments are specifi-cally requested on the clarity of the pro-posed regulations and how they may bemade easier to understand. All commentswill be available for public inspection andcopying. A public hearing may be sched-uled if requested in writing by a personthat timely submits written comments. Ifa public hearing is scheduled, notice of thedate, time, and place for the hearing willbe published in the Federal Register. Draftin g Information The principal author of these proposed regulations is Karen Levin, Office of theDivision Counsel/Associate Chief Coun-sel (Tax Exempt and Government Enti-ties), IRS. The proposed regulations, aswell as the temporary regulations, havebeen developed in coordination with per-sonnel from the U.S. Department of Laborand the U.S. Department of Health and Hu-man Services. ***** Propo sed Amendments to the Regul ations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 54 is pro- posed to be amended as follows: PART 54\u2014PENSION EXCISE TAXES Paragraph 1.

Section 54.9815-2713 is added to read as follows: \u00a754.9815-2713 Coverage of preventive health services . [The text of proposed \u00a754.9815-2713 is the same as the text of paragraphs (a)through (c) of \u00a754.9815-2713T published elsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin]. Steven T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement.(Filed by the Office of the Federal Register on July 14, 2010, 11:15 a.m., and published in the issue of the Federal Register for July 19, 2010, 75 F.R. 41787) 2010-35 I.R.B. 311 August 30, 2010Denition of Terms Revenue rulings and revenue procedures (hereinafter referred to as \"rulings\") thathave an effect on previous rulings use thefollowing defined terms to describe the ef-fect: Amplified describes a situation where no change is being made in a prior pub-lished position, but the prior position is be-i n ge x t e n d e dt oa p p l yt oav a r i a t i o no ft h efact situation set forth therein. Thus, ifan earlier ruling held that a principle ap-plied to A, and the new ruling holds that thesame principle also applies to B, the earlierruling is amplified. (Compare with modi- fied,b e l o w ) . Clarified is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling is be-ing made clear because the language hascaused, or may cause, some confusion.It is not used where a position in a priorruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously pub-lished ruling and points out an essentialdifference between them. Modified is used where the substance of a previously published position is beingchanged. Thus, if a prior ruling held that aprinciple applied to A but not to B, and thenew ruling holds that it applies to both Aand B, the prior ruling is modified because it corrects a published position. (Comparewith amplified andclarified , above). Obsoleted describes a previously pub- lished ruling that is n ot considered deter- minative with respect to future transac-tions. This term is most commonly used ina ruling that lists previously published rul-ings that are obsoleted because of changesin laws or regulations. A ruling may alsobe obsoleted because the substance hasbeen included in regula tions subsequently adopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published rulingis not correct and the correct position isb e i n gs t a t e di nan e wr u l i n g . Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more than re-state the substance and situation of a previ-ously published ruling (or rulings). Thus,the term is used to republish under the1986 Code and regulations the same po-sition published under the 1939 Code andregulations. The term is also used whenit is desired to republish in a single rul-ing a series of situations, names, etc., thatwere previously published over a period oftime in separate rulings. If the new rul-ing does more than restate the substanceof a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modified andsu- perseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published rulingis being changed in part and is continuedwithout change in part and it is desired torestate the valid portion of the previouslypublished ruling in a new ruling that is selfcontained. In this case, the previously pub-lished ruling is first modified and then, asmodified, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names ofcountries, is published in a ruling and thatlist is expanded by adding further names insubsequent rulings. After the original rul-ing has been supplemented several times, anew ruling may be published that includesthe list in the original ruling and the ad-ditions, and supersedes all prior rulings inthe series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulingswill not be applied pending some futureaction such as the issuance of new oramended regulations, the outcome of casesin litigation, or the outcome of a Servicestudy.
