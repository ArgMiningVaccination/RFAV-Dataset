Transcript [00:00:00] [00:00:54] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: So welcome everyone to the 22nd general assembly of the World Council for Health. And if you haven't wished to yet a very happy, healthy, and informed new year to global affiliates family all around the world. [00:01:08] And of course, our speakers, we've got a brilliant program, which we'll tell you about in a second. My very capable and charming co-host for this session is Jennifer Hibbard. And if you don't know her yet, she's from Canada and you'll see her smiling at you with the World Council for Health banner, right there behind the thanks, Jen, looking forward to working with you today. [00:01:28] I want to set the tone for our gathering today by quoting someone you may know, and that would be former president Nelson Mandela, and one of his many inspiring quotes. He said, \"Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great. You can be that generation. Let your greatness blossom\". That of course reminds me ever so eloquently of the work we've been doing at the World Council for Health and the work our affiliates have been doing around the world. [00:01:57] With that being said, let's take you to a brief outline of our program for this session of the world health general assembly. So the disclaimer, of course, as usual, we're delighted to be hosting speakers and people from around the world with different perspectives, of course the opinions of our guest speakers and not necessarily the opinions of the World Council for Health. [00:02:17] The meeting is live, not rehearsed, and therefore errors and omissions are possible. As we are live, if you don't want to appear, please turn off your camera. And if you can, your mic as well. Friendly reminders, please keep yourself on mute during the meeting, as I mentioned, and of course the code of conduct is very simple. [00:02:34] We are respectful and engaging with each other. If you've got a question for our speakers or our affiliates today, please begin your question with a Q at the beginning. So Jennifer can spot it very easily. Keep them short, sharp, and interesting. If you're watching through the World Council for Health website newsroom, please be aware that you won't see the chat for now. [00:02:55] This is only for participants. [00:02:56] And of course this beautiful slide, always such a joy to see about a hundred affiliates from around the world, our coalition partners, in other words, and of course the World Council for Health is a worldwide coalition of autonomous little society groups from around the world. From Australia to Zimbabwe. All thanks to the really hard work by our steering committee, as well as you affiliates to keep inviting amazing organizations on board. [00:03:20] Here's a lovely steering committee, tirelessly, resilient, creative, and committed, such a joy to be working with all of you. [00:03:26] Meeting proceedings. Of course. The guest speakers, as I mentioned will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from the U S talking about his best selling book. And we're looking forward to hearing more about that. It took some time to arrive in South Africa, but I can't tell you how happy I was to receive this book \"The Real Anthony Fauci\". Followed by Dr. [00:03:45] Stephanie Seneff. And she'll be talking about Vaccines and Neurodegenerative diseases. And our affiliate introduction: Doctor John O'Malley from New Zealand talking about evolving health. And Andy Knowles, from The Bahamas, the organization called Optimist. And we'll be hearing more about that organization. As well as of course, as always, Matters Arising: issues and ideas you'd like to talk about or issues happening in your part of the world. [00:04:11] So to Tess Lawrie, a few words from you, I know you would love to express the message of gratitude, to our wonderful affiliates and partners around the world. [00:04:19] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Thanks very much, Shabnam. At this very first meeting of 2022, I'd really like to take the opportunity to thank everyone affiliates, our supporters, and the subscribers for your participation in WCH last year. We launched WCH just over three months ago. And with your collaborative support, we are experiencing exponential growth, both in terms of our new international partners, as well as the website, traffic and public engagement. [00:04:49] Over the past three months, we've actively addressed urgent and emerging health and social issues with health legal and advocacy measures, resources, scientific conferences and meetings and international country outreach and support. 2022 is a really important year for humanity. It's the year in which we must stand up full and stand firm on matters of our rights, our freedom, and our health. [00:05:17] Your participation with WCH is essential, to enabled us to jointly affect positive change for the world. So thank you for continuing to show your appreciation for our work, through your generous donations. As a nonprofit organization, we raised over 30,000 pounds in the past three months, which has helped build a dedicated and resilient team of staff members and volunteers. [00:05:40] I believe we've demonstrated what we can do with very little. And on behalf of the World Council for Health team and our hundred international partners, I now how many request and hope to receive donations of several hundreds of thousands of pounds over the next few months to support our essential humanitarian, worldwide activities and campaigns in 2022. I promise you that your donations small and large will be used wisely. [00:06:08] And next week we will provide an outline of what we hope to do and achieve this year. Thank you in advance for your response to this request and rest assured that we will continue to act in the best interest of every man, woman, and child of this world for as long as you need us to do. [00:06:25] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much. [00:06:26] Tess Lawrie for that message of gratitude and a call to action going into 2022 positively and looking to make that difference. Thanks, Tess Lawrie. [00:06:36] Moving on then to our first speak of this general assembly. And he is of course, Robert F. Kennedy. He is the founder of Water Keeper Alliance, as well as founder and chairman of the board and chief legal counsel for Children's Health Defense. [00:06:51] He's also counseled to Morgan and Morgan, a nationwide personal injury practice. Mr. Kennedy is an esteemed author. The long list of published books, including the New York times bestseller \"Crimes Against Nature\". He was named one of time magazine's heroes for the planet. His reputation as a resolute defender of the environment, and children's health stems from a litany of successful legal actions. He received recognition for his role in the landmark victory against Monsanto, as well as in the DuPont case that inspired the movie doc Watson. Here today to tell us about his latest book, \"the Real Anthony Fauci\" let's warmly welcome Robert F. Kennedy. The mic is yours. [00:07:30] Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.: Thank you. Thank you all for being here and for your commitment to this issue within a democracy and all of the human rights, civil rights, all of that input is I want to particularly thank Tess Lawrie for her leadership, which has been really inspiring and really important. [00:07:53] I think in my book, one of the things that has attracted tremendous attention, it's her transcript of her, conversation, which she provided me with. [00:08:04] It's shocking transcript for most people. But, for me, I've been around for 40 years, and I've seen, I take agency capture as part of the landscape as part of the ecosystem. But I think most people are extremely idealistic and are shocked when they see it. [00:08:25] And that was really, I think, a bracing interview. I say one thing because I love that little animation you did on ivermectin. I did a short piece recently. And one of the, I think interesting comparisons and everybody talks a lot about Japan, and some of the other places where Ivermectin is used and encouraged. [00:08:48] But Nigeria, I think is one of, to me, one of the most convincing example is because Nigeria has a population fatality rate from COVID of, I believe now, 14 per million, and compare that to the United States, which has around 2300 per millions. We have a thousand times what Nigeria has. [00:09:14] And of course there's a lot of reasons. Nigeria would have a low death rate. They have a much younger population and that's a really important factor, but clearly that doesn't account for the huge Delta between what we experienced in the United States. And one of the key factors I'm sure is that Nigeria also has the world's highest burden of malaria. [00:09:41] 27% of the malaria cases on earth are in Nigeria. And so hydroxychloroquine, it is very widespread in the population, and also has one of the highest burdens of river blindness. And so Ivermectin was also very widely and those were things, that public health already very least should be required to explain why are we getting these huge huge disparities between certain nation death rate. [00:10:12] The average death rate in Africa is 168 per million. Those countries didn't have a pandemic. Those deaths would have gone completely unnoticed and reported. It's something that think about, I'm going to just talk about a broad overview and really all the specifics in my book. [00:10:34] I think one of the most interesting chapters in the book that kind of came as a shock to me when I was writing it. Was the deep level of the intelligence, the global intelligence agencies in planning for the pandemic and, and managing the pandemic and in guiding the public health technocracy a part from the tried and true and known consensus about what you do during pandemics, which is not to do global lockdowns, but to protect the vulnerable. [00:11:10] And we didn't do that for some reason in this pandemic. And if you look at that last chapter of my book, it shows that for 20 years, the CIA has been working with the public health agencies in the United States, but also in Canada and Australia, Europe, to normalize a militarized response to pandemics rather than a public health response. [00:11:39] Witnessed by, all of you. I'm sure have seen it Event 201, and Event 201 was this event that happened and in New York city at the Pierre hotel in October of 2019, And we, now, we now have a pretty good idea that the Chinese knew by the September 12th, 2019, that they had a problem that something had escaped from the Wuhan lab on September 12th. [00:12:13] And they knew it that night. We know that from the national security agency has had the parking lot, the satellite photos. There was internet chat chatter, in Wuhan, with people desperate to get masks, people to get medicines for people. That night, the Chinese military went into the lab and confiscated 2200 coronavirus samples that have never been seen again. [00:12:40] And they changed the public facing websites to erase a lot of the data function occupants, including a lot of the NIH funding traceable to the inner function studies that they've been doing. And they replaced the director of the lab with a military biowarfare high level military, bio warfare officer. [00:13:07] And so it's pretty clear. So a month later they're in New York at 2 0 1 and who is hosting Event 201? We all know that bill gates hosted it, but the other hosts are a strange group. It is George Gao of the Chinese CDC who cleared the, we know that the Wuhan CDC, which is a subsidiary of the Chinese CDC is deeply involved in September 12th. [00:13:37] And, essentially the Chinese cover up. So we have to assume that George Gao, who is the reigning infectious disease expert in China and the head of the Chinese CDC, that he must have been aware of what was happening. So he is taking part in Event 201. And who is the other person? It is April Haines, who is the deputy director of the CIA, a former deputy director. [00:14:05] She is now the number one spy in America. She is head of the DCI, the national security agency. She is, or she is president Biden's chief advisor on the management of the coronavirus pandemic and she made her bones that the CIA incidentally by she was chief counsel during the upgrade scandal and then CIA secretly bug the, the central intelligence committee, which is completely illegal. [00:14:40] And she's the one who authorized the destruction of the torture tapes and the destruction of the transcripts of the tapes of the CIA's surveillance of the United States senate. She began by committing illegal acts and that justified torture. And she's now managing the coronavirus, pandemic in our country. [00:15:04] And if you look at what happened in that 201, that thing, that it was really shocking to people and who else is there? There's people from the social media companies, there's people from the pharmaceutical industry, including the largest pharmaceutical company, Johnson and Johnson, there's people from the mainstream media, high level people, and Bloomberg, and the Washington post, et cetera, which was controlled. [00:15:27] Jeffrey Bezos and they're taught that the odd thing about it, is they're not, there's no discussion of public health. They don't talk about quarantining the sick, about protecting the vulnerable, about creating that international grids. Don't link the 11 million frontline physicians across the globe to try, destill and develop and collect the protocols from Zambia and from Bangladesh, from Argentina, the stuff that frontline doctors are finding out; are working to develop international protocols for treating the disease. [00:16:09] There's nothing like that. They don't talk about how do we distribute vitamin D to the population? How do we distribute Zinc to the population? How do we get people to [give] up drinking sugar drinks, and chemical residues, and lose weight and get an extra there's nothing like that. There's no interest in it. The only thing they talk about is how do we use the pandemic? [00:16:32] As a pretense to clamp down to help generate new controls and to execute what essentially is a coup d'etat against democracy globally, and against human rights and civil rights and constitutional rights, and I just started researching Event 201. I just bought the fact that It was not a unique, one off event. They've been conducting these ever since 1999. They began just before the anthrax attacks and they were modeling an anthrax epidemic. As you may [00:17:07] know, maybe many of you do not know, three weeks after 9/11, there was an anthrax attack that killed seven people in our country. And it was on uncertain newspapers, but also on two United States senators. Who were those two? Patrick Leahy and Eric Hart. And what is significant about those two? They were the two biggest opponents of the Patriot act, which is the act that began the clamp down of totallitarian controls. [00:17:40] And after those attacks, the Patriot act, those attacks were used to justify the passage of the Patriot act and to justify our invasion of Iraq, which is what the CIA wanted. And it was not until later at the FBI investigation disclose the anthrax, had not come from Iraq, which everybody believed. It had come from one of three us military labs. [00:18:12] So it was somebody associated with intelligence agencies or the pentagon, that had orchestrated these anthrax attacks. And by the way, immediately before the anthrax attacks, they did the first of these simulations, which was called dark winter and the dark winter simulation simulated an anthrax attack on the United States. [00:18:38] It was at a high level. There were 20 other simulations, and I document about a dozen of them in the book. And each one they have all the hundreds of thousands of people, not just in the us, but Canada and all across Europe. Were frontline workers, police, FBI, intelligence agencies, public utilities hospital systems and frontline workers, police, firefighters were all involved. [00:19:05] Some of them involved 20, 30,000 people, a hundred thousand people over time. And they were always telling them, here's what you do in a pandemic. Each one had a famous person who gave the premature legitimacy to it. Senator Sam Nunn or Bill Gates or some other Senator. They were teaching and training, frontline leaders, local heirs, local governors, et cetera. [00:19:32] Here's what you do in a pandemic. You clamp down totalitarian controls you end free speech. Impose censorship. Locked down society. Close businesses. It had nothing. And if you look at event 2 0 1 and you look at the fourth simulation, which was the last one and most important. It's George Gao, sitting there, and they were simulating a coronavirus pandemic, a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. [00:20:01] This October it's already circulating. We don't know until December 31st, the Chinese don't admit it. It's already circulating. You have handed the Chinese CDC there, and his main thrust is we've gotta be able to stop the social media companies. I'm talking about the fact that the rumor that this is a lab created coronavirus. [00:20:29] This is what he is saying on October 12th, you can go right now and look at that event and hear him saying this. And that's what they talk about. It was simulation is how do we stop people from talking about this? We're doing this for 20 years in the anthrax attacks. It was such a powerful and important simulation at the us Senate that and held the hearings. [00:20:54] What did we do if there is an anthrax pandemic? Which either way is impossible because the anthrax does not spread person to person in order to have anthrax attack, you have to drop it onto each city and have an ALA. No, you can't. So it's basically, it's not going to happen and so they simulating this attack. [00:21:20] It's so powerful. The United States Senate has hearings on it. And the real anthrax attacks happen. Those hearings are in session at that moment. That's how exquisitely timed that was. After that, all of these other simulations and collectively they're called Operation Lock Step. What does that mean? It means that you are teaching all of these governments in Europe, United States, Canada, north America. [00:21:51] How to pivot these liberal democracies pivot and suddenly impose totalitarian controls and enact a coup d'etat against democracy. How to use a pandemic to do that. That's what they're training them. All, if you put yourself in the position of these frontline workers who are mystified, Hey, why aren't we working on repurpose medicines? [00:22:15] Why aren't we doing healthcare here? Either we have an, a healthcare and make this the beliefs problem. What is the CIA doing it? Public health, the CIA does not do public health. CIA does coup d'etat against democracy between 1947 and 2003 that the CIA was involved in 73 coup d'etats or attempted coup d'etats almost all of them against democracies. [00:22:42] A third of the countries on the earth. So, what are they doing in public health? As it turns out, every one of these simulations was designed and orchestrated by the CIA. And there were a high level intelligence officials at every single one of them that it was a one consistency. I was in Colorado. [00:23:04] I was just getting on a plane and I, a baggage handler came out this big brawny guy and he hugs me and he says, thank you for what you're doing. And he said, why? And he's a liberal Democrat working class. And he said \"Why isn't it that people don't recognize that this is not a public health issue. This is about power it's about centralizing power and it's, oh, you know, some people are awake and if you're awake, it's clear that nothing to do with public health\". [00:23:34] What I said, what's happening today I call it is turnkey totalitarianism. And what that means is. Our history, the ambition of every totalitarian regime has been a complete control over every human expression and including facial expressions, art, literature, poetry, every human interaction, every transaction. None of them have ever succeeded. In Germany in 1939, it was possible to escape over the Alps into Switzerland. You can hide in an attic like Anne Frank. You could have a hammer radio in your basement. And there was ways of not getting caught. Even when I was a kid, I went to to Germany, to East Berlin. I met people who had escaped up with a wall. Letting people die trying, of course many people also escaped. [00:24:27] It was always possible to get away from it for at least a few people. Today because of technology that you have, the capacity, Bill Gates has his satellite fleet alone, he'll be able to look at every square inch of the earth, 24 hours a day. You have all these devices now that are spying on you. [00:24:48] Even those a digital thermometer in your house have the capacity to be read remotely. Oh, if you think Siri is working for you, you're wrong. She isn't, because they've had the capacity with your apple watch and your Siri and your garage door opener, and your, all of these devices that are, your GPS in your car, harvest our data for a decade. [00:25:18] The problem is they've never been able to transport it. And the 5g system, which is making imposed, coterminous with the pandemic, is designed to do that. 5g is not there for your benefit. It has nothing to do with benefitting you. It has everything to do with allowing your devices, to spy on you, to talk to each other and to give your data, which is it's like oil at the very beginning, when were no rules, [00:25:50] and the oil was just sitting there free under the crown for anybody who gets drill. It's free money, that data and the government wants it so they can control it. And, Microsoft, Watson, all these other companies, Apple wants it, so they can monetize it and sell it. [00:26:07] Now they have the capacity to do that. So everything that you do is now being watched and surveilled and the capacity for the monotypes to tax every transaction. They're going to have to also at the same time, digitalize currency. They're getting rid of the cash economy. [00:26:27] It's meaning that you cannot hide any transaction. The government's going to know about it. The financial institutions are going to be able to make money on a friction of every transaction and the government will be able to attack and use it against you. [00:26:42] They will have that information in your data file in case you ever cause trouble. And at the same time, the worst thing is digitalized passports, transforming every right that you have. You have a right today. As imperfect as government is, you have a right to go to a party. You have a right to go to a bar. [00:27:03] You have a right to go to a play or a sporting event, or get on a plane and travel or go to a polling out. These are all just rights that people assume. And the minute you have a digitalized passport all of those rights become privileges that are contingent upon your obedience with governments dictates, and with the digitalized currency, they have absolute total control. [00:27:28] Because for example, let's say that they have a if there was a two week social distancing mandate, everybody has to wear a mask and everybody has to social distance. And you're only allowed to leave your house for necessities. And you violate that. You get too close to your girlfriend. You go outside without a mask. [00:27:53] They're going to know it because you're going to be seeing on facial recognition. They know where your GPS is. Now they can tell you, okay, you are on probation. And you have to say two weeks at home, and guess what your credit card is only going to work in grocery stores that are half a radius from your house. [00:28:14] You can't buy a plane tickets. You can't buy gasoline. You can't drive from LA to San Francisco. Your money won't work there. Well the capacity from that have total control over every aspect of your life is now within reaching distance of these totalitarian elements. And it's turnkey totalitarianism, and they've created. It is so powerful that when they do go, all of the pieces in place and switch on, it will obliterate all human rights. [00:28:48] You guys know, Queensland Australia is essentially in a civil war right now. You have hundreds of thousands of people lining up in the streets in Vienna, Austria. You've seen nothing about that in the mainstream media. Nothing. We all know that because we see these underground video clips and none of my friends, liberal friends in Hollywood know any of this is going on. [00:29:15] So that is the level of control it will have. And ultimately, when they put all of these mechanisms in place, even if there's a hundred percent of us opposing it, we will not be able to fight them because the level of control that they'll have, and I'll give you three rules that everybody needs to understand. [00:29:36] One government acquires a power. It will never relinquish it without confrontation. Oh, they tell you, oh, we just want two lock down. And we gave them that power and what did they do? They extended it two years. And now they're giving it back to us, but are they really giving it back because no, they still have the power to do it again to us anytime they feel like it. [00:30:06] So they will never give it up. Number two: every power they take they will ultimately abuse to the maximum extent possible. So a two-week lock down that we gave them, they abused it into two years and that is like the law of gravity. Anytime they take a power. Yeah, that power will ultimately be utterly abused. [00:30:33] Number three, no one in history has ever complied their way out of totalitarianism. You think you have the illusion that if we just do what they tell us to do, we'll all go back to normal. No, it's the opposite. If you comply, if you obey, you are sending them a signal about what to do next. That's why the hill you're on today is the hill you need to die on. [00:31:05] Because if you give up that position, you're only going to get weaker and how do we win this battle? We win at all through conversion, by persuading people who are now part of this mad psychosis, who are subsumed in the orthodoxy to pursuade them to come to our side. The good news is at a hundred percent of the conversions go from their side to our side. [00:31:34] Nobody goes from our side back into the matrix. They all come. Once they get out of the matrix, they stay. How do you do that? And you do it one person at a time. And that's what we all have to do. Three civil disobedience is a day that are all bent on converting people. So you see a mom with their baby, like I, the other day on an airplane, I said don't vaccinate that baby until you've done your own research, you can't believe your doctor. [00:32:04] You can't believe the government. I didn't tell her not to vaccinate I told her, do your own research. Or you go, to a store owner who has vax only. And just say, listen, I'm going to tell, I'm not going to patronize you anymore. And I'm going to tell my friends not to patronize you. [00:32:23] And you talk to people, the way that propaganda works, Goebbels outline this. He said, here's what you do. You always tell them the big lie, why the big lie? Because once you swallow a big lie, you can never, it's very hard for you to disgorge it. And Mark Twain explained to how that works. He said, [00:32:48] it's easier to fool a person than to persuade them that they've been fooled. Once they've been fooled, they do not want to go back and nourish what will stop them from ever believing you. So bigger of a lie they swallow, less likely they are to relinquish it. And so how do you make them relinquish? Well Goebbels that to, he said the way that you make them believe a lie. [00:33:14] Is you tell it to them five times. The first four times they'll dismiss it. The fifth time they'll believe it. And so they have CNN telling them the big lie, five times, and of course they're all in mass psychosis. You know, it's formulaic. Advertising is a trillion dollar industry. And the reason it is because propaganda works. You can persuade people to act against their own interests. [00:33:40] You keep repeating it to them. That's what you want to do. How do we counter that? We have to help them the counter narrative five times. And stopping the person on the street, having a conversation that you don't want to have because you know the ferocity of the resistance, but if they hear it from you and they hear it from four other people, they're going to come across, it's going to open their mind. [00:34:06] And let day light back in. We have the stickers, we have a sticker templated children's health defense. You download that template and you go to Kinko's or FedEx and you buy that paper with the sticky on one side of, the sticky glue. And then you can run off for free our stickers, our information, all the stickers. [00:34:30] They're stickers with memes on them that are designed to wake people up every day. When you leave your house, take one of those sheets and take all of the stickers on that sheet and put it up somewhere. In high pedestrian areas, what we need to do, our mission is to tell people on the other side, to subject them, to expose them to the counter narrative five times each and on the fifth time they come over to our side. [00:34:56] Oh, I am being given a signal. And I want to thank Tess and everybody else for being part of this for your leadership of the resistance. Thank you. [00:35:09] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much. Robert F. Kennedy for joining us at the general assembly of the World Council for Health, we appreciate your time and your energy and your commitment to democracy and freedom. [00:35:20] Hopefully the next time, we'll have a little more time to share with us because we have lots of questions for you in the Q and A section and some really good ones as well. I want to say thank you from all of us at the World Council for Health, for you, indefatigable energy. And of course, for ending this amazing book on the quote of Martin Luther King, Jr. really powerful quote that you ended on. So thank you very much for your solidarity. [00:35:44] All right. And from Robert F. Kennedy, and I'm sure they lots of amazing questions in the Q and A Jennifer, perhaps our affiliates can engage with each other and solve those topics. I know that many of them are us are very clued up on those topics and we'll be able to engage them. Your thoughts, Jennifer. [00:36:03] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Absolutely. Okay. The first question that came up, which is very interesting, and I think we all questioned this is that our medical field, how the doctors, really, the majority of them seem to have drank the Kool-Aid and are not are not behind the talks of Robert Kennedy. And they're more following the mainstream mandate. [00:36:24] Now the question was, are the retired physicians more comfortable and more willing to come forward to wake people up? Or are there issues there? And most definitely we see there are issues even there. Svetlana? You're here right? [00:36:41] Svetlana: Yeah, we're here can you hear me? [00:36:42] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Okay. Did you two have an interview with Robert Kennedy, this morning? [00:36:48] Okay. All right. That's fine. Thanks Svetlana, what it was regarding is Dr. Mel Boucher, you see here he stood up outside of hospital and defended what was going on and was telling about all of the stillbirths that have been happening at the Lionsgate hospital in BC. And a short time after that he was approached by the RCMP, cuffed and taken into a psych ward in the hospital where he has been been kept for several weeks and Svetlana just managed to help him get out of there. [00:37:28] And they're actually in a safe house now. The RCMP have been calling Daniel Lagacy to find out where he is. They've been looking around trying to find him so you can see here everybody's affected by this, but you really just have to be brave and step up because we really need to save our children and most of all, so thank you for showing your faces here and you guys and I'll go on to further questions. [00:37:53] The next question was regarding, basically a lot was answered by Robert Kennedy is, how do we get through to people? He did point out basically, you've got to talk to them five times over and reinforce it. It's a difficult conversation. We all know we're going to get up against opposition, talking to people, even within our families. [00:38:15] We all know it's very difficult to approach family members too. That basically covered most of the questions. There were several questions in that same area. So back to you. Thank you. [00:38:27] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks, Jen. Zoe is going to stand some of those questions, perhaps all of them over to Robert I'm showing he has a moment he'll be able to engage them. [00:38:36] But [00:38:36] before we move on to Stephanie Seneff, I'm really looking forward to hearing from as are many of our affiliates. I just want to read this quote at the end of this book \"The Real Anthony Fauci\" and it's because it's Martin Luther King Jr. And it's from his majestic \"I have a dream\" speech and he said, \"But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that they are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity for this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice. We've also come to this hallowed spot to remind America the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make the real promises of democracy\". [00:39:27] Such an inspiring quote, and one that certainly holds true, not only in America, but certainly around the world. And on that note, we want to introduce to this 22nd and very momentous, World Council for Health gathering, Dr. Stephanie Seneff. And I'm going to introduce her with the great honor and great pleasure. I've reading about your work for a really long time. [00:39:53] Dr. Stephanie Seneff is senior research scientist at MIT's computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She has a BS degree from MIT in biology and MS, EE and PhD degrees from MIT in electrical engineering and computer science. Her recent interests are focused on the role of toxic chemicals and micronutrient deficiencies in health and disease with a special emphasis on the pervasive herbicide glyphosate and the mineral sulfur. [00:40:24] Since 2008, she has authored over three dozen peer reviewed journal papers on these topics. She's the author of a book on glyphosate titled, \"Toxic Legacy\", how the weed killer glyphosate is destroying our health and the environment, which was released by Chelsea green publishers in 2021. And of course these issues are very much close to our heart in Africa as well on the issues of GMO and and healthy food. [00:40:51] So Dr. Stephanie Seneff, it is indeed a great honor and a pleasure to welcome you to this gathering, to talk to us about the COVID-19 vaccines and neurodegenerative diseases. You're warmly welcomed. The mic is yours. [00:41:05] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Thank you so much for having me. I'm so thrilled to be here and thank all of you. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the work you were doing, it is so important and it's very difficult to follow Bobby Kennedy because he's such an inspiring speaker, but I will be talking about a different topic, but very closely tied to our situation. [00:41:22] So let me share the screen and get my slides, pop them up. Okay, great. So my topic is COVID 19 vaccines and neurodegenerative disease and happy to be here to talk about this. And I think some of you may be aware the paper that I wrote to together that was Dr. Greg Nigh. It was published in IJV TPR last May. We titled it \"Worse than the disease\" question mark. Reviewing some possible unintended consequences of the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. And I have to say that I thought glyphosate was the worst chemical I would ever encounter in my lifetime. And now I've met my match with the messenger RNA vaccines. [00:42:00] They are extremely dangerous in my opinion, and the technology is novel and untested and has many unknowns. And so in that paper, we looked at theoretically, what could be some consequences that we were anticipating could be happening in the future with these vaccines. And some of them are very slow acting. [00:42:18] So we listed several things. I'm just itemizing here. We've talked about each one of these in different it's a long paper over 40 pages long. Pathogenic priming multi-system inflammatory disease. Auto-immune disease, allergic reactions anaphylaxis because of the polyethylene glycol, probably. Antibody dependent enhancement, meaning that over time the vaccines could actually backfire and make your disease worse. [00:42:40] Activation of latent viral infections in the course there's Bell's palsy and shingles. These are all viruses that normally stay quiescent. It become alive again after the vaccine. Neurodegeneration and prion disease. The emergence of novel variants. I think the vaccines are driving the emergence of novel variants and the potential for the integration of spike protein gene into human DNA and passing it on to future generations. [00:43:03] Now, today I want to focus on neurodegenerative and prion diseases. And we have a long section in our paper on that. So I can refer you back to it. For you to read it, if you want to know more. So I want to just show here a picture. This is a nice picture of the messenger RNA in the vaccine. [00:43:17] These vaccines contain messenger RNA that has the genetic code for the spike protein right here in the middle. And then it's pegylated with all this polyethylene glycol to keep it away from enzyme, it would break it down. All of the uridines in the entire sequence. There's four things in the code and one of them is uridine. All of them are replaced with something called one methyl, pseudo uridine and that's all these guys up here. [00:43:37] Every single uridine is replaced. That's extremely unusual, never occurs in nature. It's incorporated into a lipid particle that looks like a human LDL particle, which means that cells can take it up under natural methods that they already have in place to take up LDL. There's a synthetic cat ionic liquid, a very unusual untested catatonic lipid. [00:43:56] That's added as to act as an adjutant to draw in the immune cells. And that's been shown to be very toxic to cells. So the RNA is then humanized. It's got this five prime cap. It's got this three prime UTR, five-prime UTR, poly ATL. All of these things are human. Making this, mRNA look like human RNA, which gives it a stealth entry. [00:44:14] The cells are fooled and not aware that this is a viral protein that's being made. And this gives it a stealth entry system for massive production, spike protein. So I want to give the big picture first and then I'll have a bunch of slides to support it. And natural infection starts in the nose and the lungs. [00:44:29] And usually won't even get into general circulation if you have a healthy, innate immune system, and that's the most important thing you need to fight this virus, is a healthy innate immune system. The spike protein nanoparticles are ininjected, messenger RNA nano-particless are injected into the deltoid muscle in the arm, bypassing not only the mucosal barriers, but also the vascular barriers. [00:44:48] So the immune cells come into the arm, take up this message. Also take up these particles and they start making spike protein because they can't stop themselves from doing it's all designed to so that it cannot even be controlled to be shut down. And then they carry these spike proteins into the lymph system and they ultimately gathering in the spleen where they continue to make spike protein. [00:45:07] So these immune cells in the spleen release large quantities of spike protein, and they release them inside exosomes. And these are liquid bodies that cells release when they're under stress. And so those exosomes contain the spike protein displayed on their surface. And that's probably what causes tremendous [00:45:23] reaction antibody response. The vaccines are very successful in their goal of producing a huge antibody response. The kind of response, you would only get in severe disease. People who recover from the disease without many symptoms only produce very small numbers of antibodies. So these exosomes are dispersed throughout the body, but they travel, especially along neuro fibers to the brain and they deliver the prion like spike protein to the neurons, and then an inflammatory response in the brain induces neurological damage. [00:45:52] So here's a paper, \"Is COVID-19 a perfect storm for Parkinson's disease\". So this is looking at the disease and this, these authors noted this loss of smell, which is a very common symptom, very interesting and unusual common symptom of this disease, which means that the the virus is capable of going into the nose, going along the olfactory nerve and along the olfactory nerve, it can gain access to the brain stem nuclei. [00:46:15] It can go along the olfactory nerve. It can travel on the Vegus nerve, which is another nerve system that connects the gut and many of the organs to the brain. And then it gets to the brain and it can update. When it does that. It upregulates a protein called alpha-synuclein, which is one of the proteins. [00:46:32] It's a protein that misfolds in association with Parkinson's disease. That's well known. And so this alpha-synuclein when there's too much of it, it folds the wrong way and becomes toxic. And now in the substantia nigra, which is the center of Parkinson's disease symptoms, dopaminogenic neuron, sorry, that's a hard word to say. [00:46:53] The neurons that make dopamine in the substantia nigra, they express high levels of this HT receptor, which allows it to get in. So three independent case reports have described the development of Parkinson's disease following COVID-19 disease. Now I think the same thing can happen in spades with respect to the vaccine because Parkinson's disease has been well studied and has been shown that it begins in the gut. [00:47:14] And it's from prion proteins that prion-like proteins that are produced by pathogens in the gut. And then the spike protein itself is a prion-like protein. And I've studied prions for a long time. And they're quite interesting because they have a characteristic signature motif, which is this G X, G motif glycine zipper. [00:47:33] And that motif is present in the human prion protein. There's 15 of them. Most proteins have zero. Just to be, have a backdrop. Most proteins have zero. The prion protein that humans produce has 15. Amyloid beta, which people probably know is linked to Alzheimer's disease. Another protein that is false, it has only four. [00:47:52] The spike protein has six. So it's worse than amyloid beta in the sense of it's prion-like character, but not as bad as the human prion protein. So stress immune cells in the digestive tract, in the spleen up regulate alpha-synuclein and they release it packaged up in exosomes, along with this foreign misfolded proteins. [00:48:09] This is what is known to happen in the association with Parkinson's disease. And then those exosomes travel along the vagus nerve to the brainstem nuclei and this damages. Then it reaches the substantia nigra damages that organ, and that's the source of the Parkinson's disease. And the process over time can take decades, a slow process over decades before symptoms appear. [00:48:29] This is an amazing paper by some people in India. I recommend everybody read this paper because it's quite extraordinary. It actually transfected cells with the DNA code to make their own, to make the spike protein. So it's a similar model to what's going on with these messenger RNA vaccines. [00:48:45] They made these cells produce the spike protein, and they determined that these cells then released exosomes. So they verified that cells exposed to the message to make spike protein will produce exosomes loaded with micro RNA. These micro RNA is have, are very strong, controlling signaling molecules that influence policy and particular will cause immune cells to induce an inflammatory response. [00:49:09] And so they get internalized by these microglia, which are immune cells in the brain. And this induces, this strong inflammatory response, which will lead to brain swelling, brain damage, all these bad things. And so they to quote them these results uncover a bystander pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mediate CNS and central nervous system damage through hyperactivation of human microglia. [00:49:33] And I just want to have, I just got this picture from this article, which is a nice example of these exosomes. I'm very fascinated by exosomes and I've been reading a lot about them lately. The donor cell can be very far away from the recipient cell and the donor would be [00:49:45] all these nuclei in the brain get exposed to these exosomes that are then taken up by the cells in the brain. And then those micro RNA that are released in them can cause holistic changes in the immune system, in the brain to induce this inflammatory response. So this is a fascinating paper, nucleoside modified messenger, RNA vaccines. [00:50:06] I'm sorry, the next paper is the one I'm thinking of, but this is interesting too. Induce potent T follicular helper in general center B-cell responses. So this is the paper that's showing that this nucleoside modification, which is this trick of changing all uridines into methyl pseudo uridines this was something they discovered would really work well to stabilize the RNA. Make it last a long time, and also make it produce a strong response in terms of making protein. [00:50:32] And that caused a very strong antibody response, which is what they're looking for. And it induced this formation of germinal centers in the spleen, which is where a lot of the action is taking place in the immune response. And then this other study showed that repeated exposure to foreign protein, to immunization resulted in increased susceptibility to prion protein exposure. [00:50:52] In other words, they showed that by giving vaccines to people or to animals they became increased more sensitive to the problems with prion proteins that can misfold. And of course, what you're giving with this vaccine is both at the same time, the expansion of the germinal centers and the delivery of a prion-like protein at the same time. [00:51:12] So here's a paper, an article, which is very interesting. J Patrick Wieland and he's MD-PhD so very highly qualified person. And he asked the question, is it possible the spike protein itself, causes a tissue damage associated with COVID-19? And he talks about a furin cleavage site, which is unique to the spike protein in this, SARS-cov-2 compared to .SARS-cov-1. This a furin cleavage site, which is part of why people think it's not a natural virus, it allows this S1, the spike protein gets chopped off into S1 and S2 and S1 gets released. [00:51:45] And so it goes into circulation. It can go anywhere. And in fact, they found that it goes to the vessels, the blood vessels, the small blood vessels in the mouse brain. And that it is a potent neurotoxin. So this is extremely dangerous. So here's a quote from them. The spike S one sub unit of SARS-CoV-2 alone is capable of being endocytosed by H two positive endothelia. [00:52:07] These are the cells lining the blood vessels in both the human and the mouse brain with a concomitant Palky cellular micro encephalitis. That may be the basis for the neurological complications. And they're talking about, of course, the long haul COVID, but I think the vaccines are also causing essentially a long haul COVID microencephalitis meaning the swelling of the brain. [00:52:25] SARS-COV-2 spike protein interactions with amyloid or genic proteins, potential clues to neuro degeneration. This is another very interesting paper where they found that the receptor binding domain of the spike protein also binds to heparin and to heparin binding proteins. And this is important because it's been shown in other studies that heparin binding accelerates the aggregation of these amyloid protein. [00:52:49] So there's these various proteins that are associated with various neurological diseases, amyloid beta, of course it's Alzheimer's alpha-synuclein is Parkinson's disease. And there's also Tao, which is linked to Parkinson's. They have probably on protein itself, which is Crisfield Jaco disease and TDP 43 is linked to ALS. [00:53:05] So all of these nasty neurodegenerative diseases can be induced by the spike protein going into the brain binding to happen, and then facilitating the misfolding of these other toxic proteins. So this is a paper with a nice diagram over here on the left that shows how foreign pro prion proteins, which I say could be spike coming in a prion protein. [00:53:27] They act [00:53:27] like crystals and they induced misfolding of all these susceptible human proteins, such as alpha-synuclein amyloid beta, et cetera. It causes it's proteins to change their shape from an alpha helix to a beta sheet. And the beta sheet is a soluble formation that then eventually they go home together and they form oligomers and fibrils. [00:53:45] And then finally they form these plaques that are characteristic features of these diseases. This is a very interesting paper. I would advise you to read this paper because it's quite shocking and it showed, first of all, that the spike protein actually goes into the nucleus. And this is actually very scary. [00:53:59] It goes into the nucleus and when it gets into the nucleus, it inhibits specific proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1. These proteins are known to be able to repair DNA damage. So when you prevent the repair of DNA damage and you induce inflammatory response, you're asking for trouble in terms of getting DNA mutations, which of course are linked to all kinds of diseases. [00:54:24] When the cells have become disabled because of mutations in their genes. COVID-19 vaccine associated Parkinson's disease, prion disease, signaling UK CA Yellowcard adverse event database. This is an article by Jay bar class. And I just want to give you a couple of quotes from this article. He has been talking a lot about the concept of prion as a spike as a prion-like protein. All the COVID-19 vaccines on the market, contain spike protein or it's nucleic acid sequence creating a possible catastrophic epidemic of prion disease in the future. [00:54:55] And then this analysis should serve as an urgent warning to those mindlessly. Following advice of politicians and public health officials regarding COVID. Now I want to take some time to look through this chart here, I've been rummaging through the various database. It's actually a really great resource. [00:55:12] And I think we should be using it more people always say it's not reliable. Anybody can report there's problems with it. But it's the best we have. And it's actually very good, I think, compared to what else we might have available. So you can go to the VARs database online at this website and you can actually just go look and see how many counts there are for various conditions across various co subclasses of the data. [00:55:37] And so what I did was I looked at a number of different conditions that are associated with neurological disease, memory impairment, amnesia. This is the prion disease, CJD mobility, decreased resistant indicator. Parkinson's Alzheimer's Parkinson's itself, dysphagia, which is difficulty swallowing and Anosomia loss of smell. [00:55:54] So I just looked at these and I counted how many counts were there in this database? I did this on December 4th of this year. So recently last year, sorry. And and I looked at all the counts for the COVID vaccines for less than a year versus all the counts for all the other vaccines over the history of the database. [00:56:11] So this is all 31 years, all the vaccines. How many camps? And so you can see just memory impairment significantly more one and a half times more than one and a half times as many reports for memory impairment for these vaccines, compared to all the other vaccines over the history of the database. And then you look at all of these things that I have here have more than one fall, more than more cases of these COVID vaccines and the cases associated with all the other vaccines over the history of the database. [00:56:39] And in fact, there's Anosomia is amazing because there's over 4,000 cases of loss of smell, only 122 for all the other vaccines. It's a 35 fold ratio between those two. And I want to just note these three. Prion disease. The numbers are small because this disease is very rare and people don't ever think the prion disease could be caused by the vaccine, but it's almost seven times as many cases of the prion disease with the COVID vaccines compared to all the other vaccines. [00:57:09] And then there's a four and a half times as many Alzheimer's cases. And then 35 times as many cases of this, which is a very strong indicator of future Parkinson's disease. And Parkinson's is over two times as many. So this is anecdotal evidence. It's actually got an email from someone who pointed this out to me, Mark who's in France. [00:57:28] He testified that his wife developed CGG about two weeks after her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. And he said, we must no longer speak of chance because when you develop a disease where it is said that there is one case in a million, which is true at one person in a million develops this disease in their lifetime and less than 60 cases per year. [00:57:47] And that you develop the first symptoms 15 days after the second injection of a vaccine that we do not know. We can no longer afford to speak of chance. And I want to just end on a positive note because this is a pretty depressing talk. There's a paper here shown here published in 2018 and it shows that these really special molecules that are produced by plants and especially by herbs and spices, so things like curcumin, quercetin resveratrol, these are almost like magic molecules. [00:58:17] And we know that they have a lot of health benefits. Ancient Chinese and ancient Indian herbs have been used, medicinal herbs, have been used for many years. And there's formulations that have been coming out of mainland China, Taiwan, and India that show tremendous promise in treating a COVID 19 disease or even preventing it. [00:58:36] And so all of these molecules shown here have been shown to basically drive this process of protein misfolding, which is going usually going this way towards finally these amyloid plaques drive it. Block it from happening and even drive it to reverse. These down here have been shown to convert these beta amyloid fibrils into oligomers. [00:58:55] So it looks like these would be very therapeutic to help prevent the possibility of ending up with a nasty neurodegenerative disease after you've gotten these vaccines, or of course from COVID itself. And I certainly think and Bobby Kennedy said this too. The government needs to be emphasizing our need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, to eat certified organic whole foods and to spice up our food, put lots of herbs and spices into our food, even the vegetables and fruits themselves also have these magic molecules that can really help to keep your immune system strong and also get out in the sunshine and get out in the sunlight without sunscreen, without sunglasses, get your vitamin D up. [00:59:33] These are such important messages to try to keep us from getting sick from the disease. And even I think from the vaccine as well. I think it's the same approach to try to protect yourself if you're forced to get the vaccine, keep yourself extremely healthy through these methods. So in summary, the message RNA vaccines are carefully crafted to induce immune cells to produce large quantities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. [00:59:56] This protein is neurotoxic and it has prion-like characteristics. Whereas our SARS cov two infection is localized in the lungs. The vaccine induces immune response, primarily in the spleen. Exosomes traveling from the spleen to the brain may play a decisive role. The vaccines produce a very strong antibody response in spleen by activated germinal centers. [01:00:15] And this increases susceptibility to prion disease. Spike causes an inflammatory response in the brain by activating microglia. And there's much evidence from VARS of messenger RNA vaccines causing neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Parkinson's and CJD. Anecdotally CJD can be induced within 15 days of mRNA vaccination. Herbs and spices [01:00:36] rich in polyphenols may have therapeutic value and thank you for your time. [01:00:40] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much, Dr. Stephanie Seneff for that a science-based doctor driven, informative, and of course empowering presentation. I think what you shared with us at the end is equally as important as everything you shared before us. [01:00:54] And of course we all about knowledge and taking action, with compassion and wisdom. Let's have a look at some of the questions, Jennifer. [01:01:00] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yes, we have a number of interesting questions here. Okay. The first question is from Anne McCloskey. \"Dr. Seneff in your opinion, are there things those already injected can do and attempt to mitigate these neurological problems?\" [01:01:14] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Yeah, that's a big question. Isn't it? I do have friends who are working on protocols to help people to recover. And I think it actually overlaps tremendously with, in my opinion, just the basic search for good health. Live a lifestyle that's based on optimizing your health. And to me, that includes really being careful to avoid toxic chemicals eating certified organic food, eating whole foods, staying away from processed foods, getting out in the sunlight. [01:01:37] These are all the things that I recommend as a general policy. As far as specific things you might take, I would imagine you could take some of these. Like in my last slide I talked about all of these special nutraceuticals that come from plants and from herbs and spices, I think even possibly just taking these Chinese herbs, that there's a formulation coming out of Taiwan that my husband found, and he's been taking it as preventative for anticipation of a COVID infection. [01:02:03] And so I think those kinds of things could be very therapeutic and just the usual thing of zinc and vitamin C and vitamin D and B vitamins are also very important. Just keeping all your vitamins and minerals up and and getting that sunlight exposure for the vitamin D that's what I would recommend. [01:02:19] And you could hope that your body, you need to improve your, I should say, also sulfur. I'm always, I'm a big fan of sulfur, as you saw from your introduction, eating a sulfur containing foods and even possibly taking some sulfur containing a nutrients such as methylsulfonylmethane or conjoint with sulfate or N-acetylcysteine. [01:02:37] These are all sources of sulfur that can help you to boost your self or supply, because I think sulfur is very important for the immune system. You want to have a strong immune system, and I think that's critical for good health in general, when your immune system becomes weak your general health, but you become very susceptible to these influences from toxic exposures. [01:02:56] And the really important thing is to make your innate immune system strong. [01:02:59] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you very much. Now, the next question is from Meg. \"What is the spike protein burden of the SARS cov two virus versus the vaccine?\" In other words, what is the comparison of the risk between the virus and the vaccine for misfitting and inflammation. [01:03:17] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: So what I believe in of course, we don't have enough science, we don't have enough science. Yeah. But what I believe is that if you have a healthy immune system, the virus won't affect you at all, because you will clear it before it gets past the barrier. So it's staying in the lungs and not even getting into the circulation. [01:03:33] The vaccine starts already passed the lungs past the circulation in the muscle. It's already a huge step towards a place where it can cause trouble. And then the immune cells come in and carry it into the spleen. And from the spleen, that's when you start to get into really big problems with it traveling, [01:03:49] so conveniently, along that vagus nerve up to the brainstem. And in fact I've been looking at that VARs database reports, and there's a huge number of reports of headache and migraine headache. Huge numbers. And, I think that's because of the spike protein has traveled up the vagus nerve to the trigeminal nerve and it's caused inflammation, trigeminal nerve, which is linked to migraine headaches. [01:04:11] So I think it's actually inflaming all the nerves coming out of that pathway. That's charged with the vagus nerve, goes to the brainstem and then goes to the olfactory nerve. And then the eyes, the optic nerve is getting inflamed. And we were getting all of these evidence. And of course the facial Bell's palsy, that's also neurological inflammation in the face. [01:04:28] I think all of those things are connected to a spike protein infiltrated in the brain. And it will happen with the disease. If you have a really weak immune system, it breaks past the lung barrier breaks past the vascular barrier. And finally it gets to the brain, but that's a much later step for the disease [01:04:43] so it's [01:04:43] many fewer cases associated with the disease I suspect. And of course you also have all this problems with the heart. I didn't talk about myocarditis and that's probably also a Vegas nerve, just traveling to the heart, to the brain from the spleen. And the spike protein response and inflammation in the heart, just like inflammation in the brain. [01:05:02] It's the same thing. Really. It's just different order in the skin, attacked by the spike protein arriving, packaged up inside those exosomes. That's just something that happens much later in the disease process. And if you've got a healthy immune system, you'd never get to that stage. [01:05:16] That's encouraging to hear that's good. Now from Shabnam. [01:05:20] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Our Shabnam here. \"Given the reality of self spreading vaccines and shedding, how likely it is that prion disease is transmissible and how can its impact be mitigated?\" [01:05:31] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Transmissible from a vaccinated person to an unvaccinated person? Is that what she's saying? [01:05:36] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yeah, I think it basically the incidence of getting prion disease. I think Shabnam, you're asking more about the prion disease itself or the spike proteins. [01:05:47] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: The prion specific case, because self spreading vaccines are the reality and shedding. There's emerging evidence on shedding or transmission as well. [01:05:56] So based on that, how transmissible is prions and how can we mitigate that? [01:06:00] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: I do think I started hearing about shedding and at first I was very skeptical, but then when I started seeing these exosomes situation, it becomes very easy for shedding to happen because it's been shown. [01:06:10] And we talked about that in our paper. Actually, we had quite a large section on the prion diseases in our paper, and we talked about the possibility of the exosomes getting released into the lungs and then out into the air, or even shedding through the skin. So I think it is someone who's not vaccinated could pick up spike protein and possibly even the code to make spike protein because the messenger RNA itself has been found that the spike protein messager RNA has been found to be able to be completely kept intact and shipped out inside an exome, which is really quite frightening because that means that someone could convey the machinery to make the spike protein, not just the protein itself, but the machinery to make [01:06:48] it could be conveyed via exosomes that are shed and picked up by somebody else. But I think that the numbers would have to be much smaller. That secondary effect would have to be much smaller. And I doubt that it would get, you would get prion disease from picking up the vaccine secondhand. And I don't think it would be likely that would end up with a prion disease. [01:07:07] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Okay. Another question from Meg. \"Is white matter inflammation at target for recovery? To the drugs, such as ivermectin hydroxychloroquine work through mitigating this?\" [01:07:16] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Yeah. Now I'm actually not an expert on that. So someone else might know the answer to that. Can ivermectin actually reduce the inflammation in the brain, I think is what you're asking. Whether it might be a good treatment option for the vaccine. Which I suspect that the same things that treat the disease would treat the vaccine injury. [01:07:34] I would guess that could be true, but I'm not a doctor. Anybody else want to comment on that? [01:07:40] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: We've heard cases where people with at that are having seizures that are taking it intermittently that it's decreased the seizure activity, but I don't think there's been anything written up about it. [01:07:51] Dr. Tess Lawrie: Yeah, I can. [01:07:53] I can say that Sydney from doctors experiences and feedback, Ivermectin's one of the, one or top of the list of a bunch of medicines that are being used to help people with post jab injuries and symptoms. And as Dr. Siena says, it actually does tend to the same group of combination therapies that are being used to treat COVID are also being used in the first instance with post jab injuries. [01:08:19] We really need more research on this, but there's not going to be time for randomized controlled trials. This is going to be evidence based on doctor's experiences. Which is probably how it should be. [01:08:29] Phil Oldfield: I think when it comes to Parkinson's disease, it's well known that you've got trauma and inflammation that can then trigger the [inaudible]. That causes it. And so anything that would mitigate that and Ivermectin does act as an anti-inflammatory. So does [inaudible], targeted to the brain. The other thing of course is that it's interesting when I saw the figures that there was a symptoms of Parkinsonism on December the fourth and which could be the fact that you've got an accelerated build up. [01:09:12] But, we mustn't forget that even if a headache and I've known people, who've had headaches for about three days, really severe headaches, and some that might be milder that in itself could trigger the cascade. And you might find that in about 10, 20 years, that would turn into either Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. [01:09:38] And of course, mustn't forget that that's been proved for the SARS-CoV as well, where that's been shown and [01:09:47] I can guarantee that someone's going to say, oh no, that can't possibly be the vaccine it's due to COVID and I want to make it very clear that I don't know. I think Stephanie made a good point that, when the vaccine is given it's in the blood, although do, although you do get some back, virus in the blood as well, but and also the number of people who have been vaccinated, those people who have got COVID and I think we have to be, there's the lots of papers in BMJ where they been linking, COVID-19 to Parkinson's disease, very few papers linking the vaccine to Parkinson's disease. [01:10:35] And as that's due to the fact that journals are very reluctant to published this sort of work, right? [01:10:42] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yes. We certainly had that experience. I'd like to introduce everybody to Dr. Phil Oldfield. He's an expert in prion disease and just published a paper with him and Byron bridal and myself on prion disease and vaccines journal. [01:10:56] And yeah, we had some interesting experiences with BMG rejecting our paper telling us that it was getting screened by the WHO, or WHO like to beforehand and then rejected. [01:11:08] Phil Oldfield: I can explain it. Basically this, I was really disheartened. We submitted the paper before that buying them had submitted the paper to one of the editors at the BMJ one space sympathetic to our cause. [01:11:23] And he said, this is just a sort of paper that BMJ needs. And of course, you've got a lot of articles from the British medical journal, very balanced. Anyway, we submitted the paper efficiently and we were told that the, any paper from that journal that that is submitted also gets submitted the same time to the WHO to the world health organization. [01:11:51] But a few weeks after that happened we then got an email that said, I'm afraid we can't go any further with this. Now we're not talking about it being peer review. This is even before it's been peer reviewed. So we can't go any further with this. We've got so many papers to publish that, this one wasn't considered to be significant. [01:12:16] And so at that point I contacted Nature who also, send their articles, to the BMJ, to the WHO. I think I actually sent them the article itself. I said, would you be prepared to publish this? Got an answer back the following day saying unfortunately, because of our workload, we're not accepting unsolicited papers at this present moment in time. [01:12:44] I was disgusted and eventually we'd got it published in Vaccines. [01:12:50] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yes. And there we go. I have one last question. And this is actually a good closing question. \"Why don't we see more adverse events in the large population, the large portion of the population who has taken the vaccine?\" [01:13:03] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Why do most of the people...? [01:13:05] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: We do not see a lot as many adverse events... [01:13:08] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: I think one thing is that people don't realize the vaccines causing their problems. I actually know speaking personally, people who got the vaccine and then shortly thereafter had something really flare up something else. They were dealing with flared up, and they had to go get treated and aches and pains just much worse than they were before. [01:13:24] These kinds of anecdotal things that people don't think the vaccines causing it. I think many times they're feeling bad after they got the vaccine. Maybe a couple of months later, And they just don't realize. Cause I think the vaccine basically makes everything else you have, cancer flares up. [01:13:38] I have friends who treat cancer and they've been saying they're cancer patients that had been in remission are showing up with, new growth of the cancer, these kinds of things. It's all anecdotal. And I think people only report to VAERS if they feel very confident that the vaccine was the thing that caused their problem for the most part, and so I think that many cases of, and, just, and even something like a headache after the vaccine, it could be very serious and it could lead to serious consequences down the road, but they like, oh yeah, the vaccine causes headaches. That's fine. That's part of what's normal. We've been told that we should expect to have some nasty symptoms after the vaccine and that's normal, but don't worry. [01:14:13] That's shows that the vaccine is working. So people don't report those things. So I think everything goes way under reported. The numbers are, people are trying to figure out exactly how are under reported. The number that Steve Kirsch has come up with is 41 fold for every report. [01:14:26] There's 41 unreported, 40 others that are unreported is a, an estimate based on a number of different ways to look at it. [01:14:33] Svetlana: Can I just comment on that? This is Svetlana from Ezra [Wellness Clinic]. I think Stephanie, you have such a great point. If people don't have the the space to report a vaccine injury, we're not going to be collecting that data. [01:14:45] So currently, in the mainstream healthcare system, they're not accepting it. They don't want to hear Vaccine injury. So if you're not heard, how can you heal? But for example, at Ezra, we are welcoming vaccine injury, testimonies stories, and injuries, right? So we're starting to collect our data. [01:15:01] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: We do have different facts, reporting systems, just the official ones may have limitations and make it difficult for the doctors to report. But on a number of our alliances, we actually have VAX checker and a few others. So I'm glad to hear that you guys are doing it, too. [01:15:18] Because I think everybody needs to offer some access for people where they don't know where to turn, because I know that it hasn't been made that easy for them. Back to Shabnam. Thank you very much, everybody. This has been really interesting. [01:15:32] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks very much, much, Jen. [01:15:34] I just want to to share that on the SAVAERS system here in South Africa which is independent and alternative. People are reporting memory issues, dementia, amnesia, Alzheimer's and very frightening comments. Like he turned into a zombie, obviously they mean cognitively. And so I think it is really a wake up for us to understand the science of what's going on so that together we can find a way to help people who are having these kinds of experiences. [01:15:59] And that's why we're here because the World Council for Health is creating a better way together. Before we, and thank you very much, Dr. Stephanie Seneff. I want to say goodbye to you for now with a quote also from Nelson Mandela, \"Everyone can rise above the circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do.\" [01:16:19] Thank you for your time. Thank you for your service. [01:16:22] Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Thank you so much for having me. It's been my pleasure. [01:16:24] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: All right. And moving on then to the next part of our meeting and our gathering today, which is of course, an introduction to two brilliant affiliates. And we're going to be talking to Dr. John O'Malley. He's from New Zealand, from an organization called Evolving Health. [01:16:41] And let's tell you a little bit about Dr. John O'Malley. [01:16:45] Dr. John, O'Malley has been in practice over 30 years. He's an internationally certified chiropractic sports practitioner and is a fellow of the Royal college of chiropractic. John is published in the areas of chiropractic and medical anthropology, and he's focused and giving the profession new insights into how to expand chiropractic practice. [01:17:08] John's academic area of interest is the way its clinical model distort deception. Since the middle of last year, he's changed his focus to concentrate on developing ways to interpret the motivations behind the various plays that make up the discordant symphony of action that is the COVID response. [01:17:26] John is going to present a short PowerPoint on two classical philosophical tools that can work as a framework to deconstructing and thereby anticipating government and industry player actions. Dr. John O'Malley you're warmly. Welcome. The mic is yours. [01:17:42] Dr. John O'Malley: Thank you very much, Shabnam. [01:17:45] Okay. What this is about is making sense at all. If we go to currently what we look at, a lot of people say it just doesn't make sense. Why would you, for instance, ignore them. [01:17:55] They're the precepts of standard biology and immunology by vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic, for instance. Why are we promoting just the vaccines? We're putting children at risk, to protect the elderly, delaying critical treatment. Spending a huge amount of money on a questionable program. Uncritical support for the whole process from the media. [01:18:15] This I think is a really important point. Ignoring the science in favor of supporting scientific ideology. I'm going to look at four different tools that turn up in classical philosophy. [01:18:27] Aristotle's four causes. Dialectics, which is how the push and pull of two different ideas. How one gets strength over the other and ends up being the dominant idea and the problem of truth and correctness. Most of us think of something that is correct as being truth. In fact, a deeper look at that actually shows that near correctness can in fact hide what is behind it. [01:18:50] And then I want to look at the problem of form verse content. This is a bridge actually in South Korea that we're looking at that look pretty good right until it collapsed and ended up in the water. It had the form, but clearly not the content. So if we look at Aristotle's four causes, this is an idea that's been around for two and a half thousand years, and it is still totally valid today. [01:19:09] In fact, it's quite illuminating and we're looking at what's going on in the dynamics between the various players in pandemic response. So we start the material cause. In the case of our table, it's the wood. But before you got to the cabinet, to make the table, you'll go this is what I would want it to look like. [01:19:27] So that was the formal cause, the plan. The efficient cause is the, cabinet maker and the cabinet maker's tools. And of course the purpose, the reason we made it as the final cause. Now Aristotle said that particularly in relation to almost all human activity, you will find these four causes and an interplay between them. [01:19:46] So the pharmaceutical companies pandemic response, right? The material cause is probably our legislature and the other players. But we're just looking at this one for the moment. So we look at the legislature, how does the legislature how did we end up with that decision to go that way? My suspicion is a group of people at the very top of it all said, this is an ideal opportunity to make a truckload of money. [01:20:11] And they got together and we look at the SARS 2003 epidemic. There was an attempt then to declare a pandemic, but it never succeeded. And part of the reason it didn't succeed was that an independent media asked good critical questions. And as a consequence of the world health organization denied about it being a pandemic. [01:20:30] And then they pulled, it, pulled the plug on it by now I think the people who had done the planning realized that if you are not controlling the narrative, then there's a very reasonable chance that you won't get the outcome you want. So the formal cause, the efficient cause in the case of New Zealand, we had lockdowns, we had a special acts passed so that the government could impose lockdowns, mandates, abolish the bill of rights. [01:20:55] Like in New Zealand, it is not legal for someone to have an experimental treatment. It is not legal to have some medication against their will, but if you take away a person's right to work, I haven't worked since the 15th of January when my profession became mandated. And then in effect, you are using collusion and to do that, they had to abolish the bill of rights. [01:21:17] They didn't abolish it. They simply passed a bill to supersede it. And the final cause is I don't think anyone would look at that and say that Pfizer is in it primarily for the love of humanity. And so when you're looking at it, the final cause is of course the cash. Now, the four causes, there's a relationship between them and that's worth looking at. [01:21:36] So we'll start with the final cause because that actually determines how the others are set. So then we've got the efficient cause, material cause and the formal cause. This is old fashioned language, so I'll change it a bit. So I was to make it a little more accessible to people. So the final objective, right? [01:21:51] The plan, the process of manipulation, and the object of manipulation. Now all of these three are all focused on getting the final objective. This is just classical philosophical discussion, but they also relate to each other, depending on the object, that depends on the plan, the process, it depends on the object as well, and that's therefore modifies the plan, but always, [01:22:15] always that is the final focus. So how does pharma go about it? So we start with the plan, establish an argument for vaccination, make sure that the media promoted, squash all opposition and just create a competing options. Because if you're going to put one idea forward with the idea of making a lot of money, you can't have someone getting in the road and you do actually need the public on side. [01:22:40] If you can't buy the politicians, then intimidate them. This was done in New Zealand. This was done by using medical experts within our equivalent of Anthony Fauci, who is Ashley Bloomfield. He and a group of epidemiologists, people that we'd never heard of it before, but are now like nightly rockstars on the television news, telling us just how dreadful this thing is. [01:23:03] And one statistic that hit me is we're roughly 5 million people. Let's say for the sake of mathematics, we live a hundred years. And we'll say this 50 weeks in a year, that means effectively a thousand people die a week to maintain that statistic. Right now, we got really excited around about 49 [01:23:22] people have died from the infection. And so in terms of controlling the narrative. We are not seeing any information about who those people are. We don't know what their obesity status is. We don't know their age and we don't know what co-morbidities that we're suffering from. But the language used by the media is very clear. [01:23:40] They talk about the deadly Delta variants. They talk about, the highly infectious Omnicron variant. And all of that is about scaring the population. If we look at that, if we look at say the English philosopher, John Stuart Mill on the question of the tyranny of the majority, he said the tyranny of the majority is far more dangerous than the tyranny of government because an uninformed majority can act preciously and can suppress all opposition. [01:24:07] And we saw that in in Nazi Germany, the key element was just to convince the average German the Jews were dangerous and suddenly it was legitimate to lock them up in camp and deny them human rights and ultimately eliminate them. Part of the plan, part of the action behind the plan was to scare the population. And who was the targets? [01:24:24] The government, the media, and of course the populace, because without the populace, you don't have the government. How did you get the media involved? A bit of it was to do with how the circumstances evolved. We had a situation here where the media in New Zealand. If you've locked down all economics, then what's the point of advertising on television. [01:24:43] So the media basically ran out of money and the government said look, we'll fund you and you run our media campaign. You will promote our idea of what needs to be done. And so that part of that was just straight advertisement, but of course it came through in the journalism, and I use the word journalism very loosely. [01:25:01] If we talk about endangered species in New Zealand, we have a few and the journalist has to be high on the endangered species list because they've been pretty much replaced by cooperative sycophants, running the line. I don't watch the news anymore. I haven't watched it for months now, but what is the final purpose, to safely make obscene amounts of money. [01:25:21] And I think it's quite critical to understand that safely is a key component to this. There's no point in making money if they take it all off of you, which is why all of the deals done between governments and pharma have been kept confidential. And have I suspect very high penalty clauses on them, if there's any disclosure. [01:25:40] And that also, probably there would be other parts to those agreements. This is purely speculative on my part, but things like, for instance, you will not allow this type of treatment to interfere with it. And it will be justified in terms of things like we need to know the scientific outcome and if you allow this to happen, we won't know really whether or not the vaccine probably worked. [01:26:00] And so you'll be interfering with our science. And so these are the sort of justifications which brings us nicely into the next component. Dialectics. Started with Plato hit its Zenith with the work of Hagle at the end of the 18 hundreds, 19th century. And it starts with this argument that there is an idea or an objective called the Thesis. [01:26:21] And against this. And this can happen both within your own mind. That's going to happen within an academic debate or it can happen within the political system, but you have it comes up against some alternative idea or objective the antithesis and the interaction of the two. One modifies the other to other the synthesis. [01:26:39] But when looking at this, it is really critical to remember the importance of power, particularly when you're not looking at it from the perspective of truth, but from the perspective of attempting to create outcomes. So we go back to Aristotle's four causes. The outcome, being to get the vaccination before everybody and get everybody vaccinated. [01:26:59] And my truck loads of money safely. By safely, I don't mean safe for the public. Safe for the people making truck loads of money, So the dialectical power relationship, when we start the larger objective, a thesis that is powerfully supportive. And so we look here, at the idea that the media has strongly promoted this vaccination campaign worldwide, right? [01:27:19] But then it comes up against an antithesis which comes up against an alternative idea the antithesis, which has relatively little power. Then the synthesis pretty much reflects that power relationships. It will largely go against one side versus the other. And this, these could equally be swapped into this. [01:27:35] This could be a very powerful argument and therefore supplants the thesis. Let's see how that relates to our situation. Their thesis, this disease will kill millions. The results from this statistics support this. And in the media, when we looked at the early stages of the pandemic in Brazil, the UK and the US we did in fact, see large numbers of deaths. [01:28:00] And these were probably a combination of the speed with which the moved and the failure of governments to engage in appropriate infrastructure. But there were also certain population characteristics of those countries that made them more vulnerable. One would be, I think, morbid obesity and overall general ill health. [01:28:19] And. So this did actually cause that and therefore it became easy for the media to promote the idea that the government, if they failed to act will have blood on their hands. Of course, vaccinate children. There's no justification for that, but this language can be used to push it. The media exclusively promotes this agenda. [01:28:39] Our antithesis, we look at here, someone like Robert Malone and others call this false science and the science if looked at objectively supports them. And how did the media handle that? Robert Malone's Twitter account is canceled. And then we get to understand that more of this, we have to understand the superstructure of the relationships the social media is controlled largley by a few players and those players have made these public companies and those companies have been bought up by large investment companies that have a very broad reach. If we look at groups like BlackRock and Vanguard, they have their fingers in just about every pie. And so the directors of those companies realized that keeping the key shareholders happy is what keeps them in a job. [01:29:23] So the synthesis of all, this is the popular support for vaccinating, even though the facts suggest it is dangerous and useless, so dangerous and useless down here, but a very strong voice for here. And that's where the popular support comes in and went back to John Stuart Mill's idea that a population that strongly pushes an idea. [01:29:43] A majority, the strongly pushes an idea is decided to be dangerous, particularly if that population is uninformed. So Pharma 1, Malone 0. The problem of truth and correctness. This is our third philosophical appointment going to look at most of us think of a correct statement as being true, which is therefore the truth. [01:30:03] If we take that further and we use an example here, and we said, fire engines are red, for the sake of our discussion, we will assume that all fire engines are red and you got, is that true? That's the truth, but let's consider another proposition. And that is the fire engines are appliances that move personnel, equipment and retardant to fires for the purposes of extinguishing them. [01:30:27] Right? Incidentally, they're often red. The point of it is that when we are looking at how we accept truth, we have reduced truth to these points of correctness and we've failed to look at what is the essence. This is actually out of Martin Heidegger's the question concerning technology written in the early fifties. The way nature presents itself, can indeed permit, correct determinations, but precisely through these successes, the danger may remain that in the midst of all, that is correct. [01:30:58] The truth will withdraw. So this is about focus. If we create an argument and we put the focus on a point, we, in fact, in that narrow view, lose all the periphery and facts, maybe the essence. So for both Aristotle and Heidegger, truth is the essence of the thing. Not just correct statement about aspects of it. [01:31:18] We see this turning up totally in this debate so in the pandemic correctness with alpha and perhaps Delta ICU deaths were reduced by vaccination. I think there's reasonable data to support that argument, but when the focus is totally put onto that, and therefore, when this is then used as a justification to vaccinate children who are at no risk and it is also questionable whether or not the vaccine will have any real impact in with emerging [01:31:45] variants. We see this already with Omicron, but then we look at the essence truth. These are the people, the essence behind it, the genuine truth. These are the things that are actually ignored because of that process of truth and correctness, and that brings me to the last of our points, the issue of form versus content. [01:32:05] Now, I just want to show this is the Sampoong department store. It's in South Korea, right? It was meant to have 80 centimeter columns that were actually 60 centimeters. It was meant to have 16 bars in each column. They had on the 8. The concrete should have been made with fresh water and with a high grade was made with salt water and was on a low grade. [01:32:25] The owner changed the design at one point because it was going to be originally a residential building, but he decided he'd rather have a department store and needed to put an escalator. So that impacted on the columns. And that was the consequence: it collapsed killing 502 people. And today, if you don't commit a crime while let's do it in Korea, he got eight years for that. [01:32:44] If he'd been in Texas, it had been executed 503 times. Form versus content, where does it come from? We naturally accept that form effects content, and that's because our major evolutionary exposure to it has been in the form of nature. This is this little beasty is the Asian Hornets. And I've been chased off the end of the pier in Hawaii by one of these things, jumping 30 feet into the water look like a better option. They are about the size of your thumb. Positively fierce. Now in science, form should reflect content. When you're doing scientific research, the content behind it should be good. We are seeing a dialectical debate now within the journals between what will and won't be published. [01:33:26] And this was just raised by Phil. Now we go into the role of media to dig into the form and see the content that's what it should be doing. And in fact, that's what happened in the SARS 2003 epidemic. Where they looked at it and said it's not really any epidemic. It hasn't affected that many people. [01:33:44] And so as a consequence, Pharma didn't manage to get to promote the idea out there that this was going to need a vaccination program and the opportunity to make money was lost. So when the four causes, when they came up for another opportunity, they said the next time this one arises, we better have the world health organization under their control. [01:34:05] And we need to make sure that the media is working with us rather than doing its job. And propaganda is the deliberate distortion of form to create an illusion about content. So let's have a look at the players that's their champ, he's the head, Elba Borla, he's the head of Pfizer on the eye watering salary. [01:34:25] These are two of new Zealand's media personalities. This is Ashley Bloomfield. He is our equivalent of Tony Fauci. And this is our beloved prime minister who said, \"of course the unvaccinated will be discriminated against\". Now, if we go to the next thing and we look at how this works, and we just say, look at the final objective, rather than go through the whole process. [01:34:46] You can see how the dialect that truth and correctness, form and content come into it. But if we look at the final objective, his final objective is to make a lot of money for his company. Their final objective is to keep a job because media. Basically lost its income with the pandemic establishing and also with media advertising income has moved away from things like press and television and radio to the internet. [01:35:13] And so the big internet players are taking the coin and paying no tax on it. His concern was that for years he had looked at the question of our health infrastructure and his problem was that there was going to be a whole lot of potentially dead people. If we look at New Zealand, the risk to most of the population isn't that bad, but in one particular part of Oakland, we have a very high Polynesian population on average [01:35:41] they are very poor health outcomes because they're largely poor people. And as we know, one of the biggest determinants of health outcomes is poverty. You've got overcrowding, which means viral loads within households should append the epidemic. Movement will be much higher. And there are Polynesian population living in a temporate country, which means rugging up, they're staying inside and they're avoiding the sun because it's cold out here. [01:36:04] And so we are potentially looking at low vitamin D levels. So you put all those together and you actually do have a bit of a perfect storm in that part of the country. He was advising the prime minister and the prime minister advise them. How they're going to put the idea, did a deal with this guy, which is secret and he had the whole thing come out and we see a turning up as those three areas. [01:36:27] I just want to finish off with the new children's commissioner because my area of personal activism has been along the lines of trying to get the children's commissioner to do their job. The previous one, I haven't, that's one that's just newly appointed and I haven't yet worked with her. But under the children's commissioners act, the children's commissioner must put children's welfare first must take into account the views of children, which is quite interesting because one of the campaigns we are pushing is to get [01:36:56] in contact with children who have had a vaccine injury and have them ask the commissioner to investigate. That way we can sidestep the medical players. Now, the commissioner will, I suspect as did the previous commissioner, attempt to step outside her area of responsibility. When I first raised it with her predecessor, I said, why are we promoting this idea of an experimental vaccine to children, the healthy children, who are largely at absolutely no risk from the virus. Denying them the opportunity to get that native response, which will give them a far more lasting and durable immune response. [01:37:34] And they came back with the argument that there's two things, reasons we're doing it. We're concerned about this dreadful condition called long COVID. And also we see children within the context of family. And so therefore protecting the rest of the family is important. That second argument is [01:37:51] clearly rubbish because you could use exactly the same argument to have them defend the beaches against an invading army. Or you could use the same argument to send them down a coal mine to support family incomes. In both cases, the more appropriate things to have a proper standing only of adults and to pay everyone a reasonable wage. [01:38:09] So you can live off the parents' wages and you don't have to deal with the kids. At the same thing, you need a proper health system and you need to be engaging in other activities that will protect the family, not vaccinating children. So we are going to push this further. They also must take into account the UN rights of the child. [01:38:26] And one of those, one of those, those rights talk around things like access to health, access to education. So if we're talking about mandates as a prerequisite to going to school, we're going to see that as a going to be challenged. And also, one of the advantage of us taking on the children's commission of this is the bill of rights is that the children's commissioners act cannot be as easily ignored. [01:38:49] So what I do want to do is I actually wanted to get a hold of Tess because I'd like to be able to touch base with Robert Malone. Do all the background work, write up the documentation and all of that, but I'd love him to seem to lift to the children's commissioner. And perhaps some of the other key players in In that group to put the children's commissioner on notice and the allow an alternative voice to the ones coming only for the ministry of health. [01:39:14] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks very much to Dr. John O'Malley for that. Very interesting analytical presentation that our audience, and affiliates very much enjoyed. And if you could perhaps engage with some of them in the chat section of the comments, we'd really appreciate that. [01:39:29] And of course our marketing and communications team is brilliant. They're also going to share your slides in your presentations. If people want to have a closer look and try and apply those models, in your own country, you're very welcome to do so, but thank you very much for your contribution and for your time. [01:39:43] All right. And with that being said, [01:39:45] we are now about to introduce our final affiliate for this evening, with us today, depending where you are again. That's Andy Knowles from the Bahamas and the organization that he's from is called Optimist. Andy Knowles is a world-class Olympic athlete and coach. He's very involved with competitive swimming in the Bahamas for over 40 years. As a proud Bahamian, and he believes in giving back to his community and his country, and he's dedicated over 33 years to coaching the next generation of Bahamian swimmers. His desire is to see every Bahamian learn to swim and led to the development program to teach government primary school children, to swim using private facilities. [01:40:26] Andy Knowles, you're very warmly welcome. We'd love to hear more about the organization as you walk this path towards health and wellness. [01:40:33] Andy Knowles: Thank you very much for the opportunity. I truly enjoyed this evening. Listened to all the presentations and I've felt like I've really been educated and encouraged. As interest in just listening and hearing the fact that, we all try to push exercise and eating properly and all of that. [01:40:54] And I've been involved with, swim efforts, I'm 60 years coaching and as a athlete and do master swimming now. I'm out in the sun a whole lot and doing a lot of exercise. I've been an elder with our church here in The Bahamas. This year makes 24 years. And I'm just going to share a little bit about Optimist, how we got started, what we are doing. [01:41:15] I made a few notes concerning what I heard some of the previous presentations and maybe one or two ideas of how we could help get the word out and help people be educated, but Optimist, [01:41:28] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: We don't see you on the screen. [01:41:31] Andy Knowles: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. My camera's not working right now, so you got to see the let's spin Bahamas and you'll just have to hear me rather than see me. [01:41:40] So I'm sorry about that. [01:41:40] Okay. Yeah, as you see, Optimist is an acronym, meaning offering preventative therapeutic interventional medicines thereby increasing safety and trust. And we do have a webpage it's called optimistbahamas.com and it has a link to your, the world council on health as well and a lot of the things that you're hearing I guess I've heard today, is some of those things are on the webpage and people can listen to. Optimist is a committed group of doctors, medical professionals, pastors, lawyers, and concerned citizens. [01:42:20] Back when we banded together to promote an expanded protocol on the COVID 19 fight, which includes the use of ivermectin and other therapeutics to save more lives. So that's one of our main pillars. The group exists to educate the public about the preventive measures and treatment strategies, which will help fight against the SARS cov two virus and optimize the recovery of those afflicted with the COVID-19 disease. Strategically targeting each phase of the COVID 19 disease, which is the contraction, incubation, the acute illness and recovery. All being vital. [01:43:02] The group has no intention of being political or labeled as anti-vax, but it's certain doctors and citizens who believe greater measures are being called for than the liberate vaccine only strategy, which is something we just continually seem to be hearing about. Without the education of other options. The impetus to start such a group came about due to these things. [01:43:32] First the seeming imminent threat of a mandatory vaccination program here in The Bahamas, the inadequacy of education on preventative measures and early treatment, the bullying of non-compliant doctors supposedly offering misinformation about therapeutics. So we first met I guess in back in September at my house. [01:43:55] And then from there we've had many meetings basically every week as our group is truly grown. And there's a lot more people feel, oh man, this makes sense. And I want to be a part of it. The three factors working together led to a nucleus of persons banding together. We are pro additional strategies in order to save lives. [01:44:14] The goals are our pillars of purpose points that we put out as first of all, to save more lives and keep more people out of the hospital. To educate on preventative measures and therapeutic medicines that will help fight. Against getting the SARS CoV virus and optimize recovery of those who have developed a COVID-19 illness. [01:44:37] To encourage the government to offer a preventive SARS-CoV-2 package. Households and including vitamin supplements and medicines to bolster the immune system and ward off infection. And another goal is to encourage the government to offer a therapeutic COVID 19 package to households and treat the disease in the early phases before it progresses to acute illness phase. To share with the public, the results of scientific medical evidence on the virus and the vaccine. [01:45:10] And then finally to take a stand against a mandatory vaccination program that will lead to further, loss of religious and constitutional liberties. And as I listened earlier and look in to those goals, one of the things that we've been able to do because like you guys have said, it's just all a one vaccine only approach. And it just seems like nobody else is talking about any of the other side effects and things that are coming out. [01:45:39] One of the things we have done is we printed flyers. We did 5,000 flyers, which basically has a preventive medicines as such and a link to our webpage. And we stand on the most busy corners and just give them out in the traffic. So people encourage people that look at the webpage because that's one of the only ways they're going to be able to see and get some of the information. [01:46:03] We have met with the minister of health for The Bahamas and they are all sympathetic and what we're doing. They don't say no. They give a lot of lip service to the fact that we want to offer preventative and therapeutic medicines to help in this fight. But then everything in the press seems to be none of that seems to be coming forward. [01:46:21] We met with, through a zoom. For the last several months, we've met with different unions, some of the bigger umbrella unions. And again, they agree with us that this should not be something mandated because people need the right to make their own decisions and be able to look at all the evidence themselves and decide. And so we've had buy-in from them. [01:46:40] We met with the nurses, union and others. We have other meetings planned moving forward and we've just wanted to continue to be able to educate and let people know that we're out there. There's this Optimist group that wants to try and help. One of the things that we are going to be looking at doing now early in the new year is to gather with the churches, meet the churches and start to get the churches and the members, because that's a large part of the population here in The Bahamas, getting them to look at the preventive packages for their congregation. [01:47:11] So we have all the different plans moving forward, and we feel as an optimist group, rather than trying to fight the media and argue as such and get into a, more of a fight with who's got the right medicine. We just want to be out there in the grassroots and start truly helping people and helping them get well. [01:47:33] And so that's one of our approaches. [01:47:35] Myself and my wife had COVID back in July and I can share, honestly, that we had, we were on top of it. Our doctors dealt with us on a daily basis. We had the ivermectin, zinc, vitamin D and both of us were covered very well. So I know personally that it works and it's something that we know that if we can push this to the public and help, help them be a part of what we're doing. [01:48:01] It's going to just help that much. So that's one of all that is one of our reasons and existing. We know that we can truly help a lot of people. As I was listening earlier to one of the things that crossed my mind is there have been a big increase that we have folks in our group. We're looking at a big increase in deaths, since the vaccine has been started. [01:48:23] And of course you can't link things directly. But when this thing, the COVID thing first started some 18, 19, 20 months ago. And you had friends and people who had died, my question back then was, wow, did they die of COVID? I have friends and people that I know now, and I see them in the obituary column and I go to their funerals and question now is honestly not, did they have COVID. [01:48:44] Were they vaccinated? Because there've been increase in blood clots had been an increase in heart attacks. So there's a lot of things that like one of the doctors shared earlier, it just does not get out there. And so our thrust is to get the word out, how people check the webpage by doing that, they will be checking your webpage and to just keep the public is educated as we can, while we offer all the preventative and the therapeutic medicines to help save our people. [01:49:13] So that's what we're about. I honestly appreciate the opportunity to be able to share with you guys. Yeah. I feel way out of my league, but I really felt like I learned a whole lot today and I know that we have a group. There's been Kim and Alison and Damian and Misty who have been a part of your group last couple of months, every week, zooming in. [01:49:30] And now I can see why they've been very excited and I'm so glad that now Optimist is a recognized group within the WCH so I appreciate the opportunity just to be able to share today. And I've been very encouraged by everything. [01:49:45] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you very much. Andy Knowles from Optimist. It's been a wonderful experience learning about your organization and strategies that you've been using. A values-based approach to educate people and to empower them with the skills they need to become well and to become free. [01:50:02] So thank you very much for that presentation. And of course, once this is all over, we look forward to visiting you, hopefully in The Bahamas. Thanks very much. [01:50:10] Andy Knowles: Yeah we do have the sunshine that really helps with that. That's great. Thank you. [01:50:13] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Absolutely. And if you can please engage in the the text section of our chat with some people who may have some questions for you, some thoughts and ideas. [01:50:22] We'd really appreciate that. [01:50:23] All right. Thanks very much for that. [01:50:26] And as we start rounding up this general assembly gathering, we are at the part of our meeting where we speak to matters arising. If there's an urgent matter happening in your country or an issue that you would like to raise in this particular platform we can of course do. [01:50:42] Jennifer, would you like to keep an eye on the chat section? Let's have a look and see if anyone would like to talk about anything in particular, if there's something urgent. [01:50:51] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Everybody's just thanking both of the affiliates for their wonderful talks. Not saying anything else that's coming up. [01:50:59] Is anybody, would anyone like to free speak right now about what's going on in any country? Susan. [01:51:05] Susan: Can you hear me all right? [01:51:07] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yes, we can. [01:51:09] Susan: Thank you. I just want to give you, this is a little bit of a case study, just anecdotal, but it raised a lot of questions. We know someone who in a family eating all organically, living in Florida, lots of vitamin D outdoors, good exercise, very aware, no injection in the family of a couple and three children. [01:51:34] The the wife of the couple brought in her extended family considerably to the house very frequently. They're from central America and they were all injected for COVID. And after that, after the first time that these new injectees came to the home, suddenly all three females in the family had such excessive menstrual bleeding, including the youngest who should not even have had any menstrual bleeding that they couldn't go anywhere. [01:52:10] There was no product sanitary product. For example, that could pull, that could take care of this. And this was entirely irregular. At the same time, the husband of the family, a new irregular heart condition, he went to cardiologists, he did an MRI, nothing would solve the problem. This went on for months. [01:52:34] He was fainting. He was in a lot of pain, always tired, completely fatigued. He had been formerly very healthy, energetic and this happened just at the time immediately after exposure to multiple people who had just been injected. Last week, he was found dead with a heart attack. [01:52:56] I think that we need to sadly be warning people that if they are not injected, they really need to avoid people who are, it's a terrible thing to say and suggest it on a certain level. But I think that it may be the reality, as a public health scientist, I cannot refrain from saying this and of course [01:53:24] there are many people who are in the field, medical doctors, frontline people, Christina Northrop, and others who have been looking at these anecdotal cases for months now. Is this something that we need to warn people. [01:53:39] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Susan, that's a really difficult position to take. And I think you can talk, probably get the majority of us have family members, including my children, a number of us, and I'm not going to be avoiding them. [01:53:53] So I would take nutraceuticals and everything that we are working on it, it's definitely, we're playing catch up with, what's already been orchestrated and put out there and exposed to us. We're a little bit behind the eight ball, but we are going to catch up and we are going to figure out ways to be able to tolerate ameliorate and hopefully at some point we can neutralize effects of some of these. What you're talking about is a big concern that came up during our talks today to our speakers brought that up and, in the prion discussion and everything related to that, and it is a big concern that just being aware of it, I think is important. [01:54:32] And I think just being careful, but I think. To separate ourselves from them. Yeah. I, it's definitely too tall in order for me. And even as a caregiver, I'm still seeing patients and I'll see them vaxxed or non-vaxxed they all need help and care. Your concern is valid. [01:54:48] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Tess, do you have any other comment to make on that? [01:54:50] Susan: I do. I didn't give you a matter of concern. I gave you a matter of facts as fast as I could give to you. And not just for me, but obviously from other experts as a public health scientist, I would say from the beginning of the COVID program, people who are colleagues of mine have been giving very presumptive recommendations to the public that are also absolutely extreme and unprecedented, you know, stay in doors, quarantine, locked down, masks, all of these things are completely unprecedented and I believe they were completely unwarranted by the evidence. Now, by contrast, we have some evidence, but because of the impracticality of this public health recommendation, we are shy about recommending it. [01:55:40] And yet it might be from a realistic point of view, what we need to state. It's a terrible thing. I agree with you. It's a terrible thing. [01:55:49] Dr. Tess Lawrie: As evidence emerges, we'll get a clearer picture of what the potential health issues are associated with the jabs for individuals and for the collective. But I think key to our progress through, to our existence now is a recognition that we work together. [01:56:07] We are relearning what what being a human being is all about. And it's not about dividing and discriminating. So whatever happens, we solve this problem together and not in different camps. [01:56:19] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: As Robert Kennedy said, too, this is about, this is not about health, this whole rollout. [01:56:25] So if we divide up, we will lose. So we do have to work together. And as evidence comes forward, as Tess said, we will put out effective information to help guide people and help them stay safe, whatever, if they have single vax, double vax, triple vax. [01:56:43] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: May I suggest Susan perhaps consider joining the science and medical committee because clearly she's got an important perspective to share. [01:56:51] And I certainly think everyone would benefit from that knowledge sharing experience and developing plans to help support and empower people. [01:56:59] Dr. Tess Lawrie: I agree. [01:57:00] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Great idea. Yeah, that'd be really Go ahead. [01:57:05] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: [01:57:08] Dr. Nathi Medalla: Yeah, I don't know. It was just a reaction to Susan message and then general first comments as well. [01:57:15] And I think it's mainly just based on where we come from and how we've all, probably people on this platform, especially the world council for health affiliates have approached COVID and is that at the beginning, we had something that you did not understand. And we tried to find solutions around it. [01:57:32] We never ran away from anybody. We never stopped treating anybody. And it's probably raised over time to where we are now with vaccines and so on and so forth. And at the same time we not walk away from members of our families, friends, patients, and so on. Who've decided under duress and demands pressure to probably take these injections and find themselves in trouble. [01:57:54] A lot of us have got kids, as Jennifer said, some of us got partners. Some of us see patients who've actually gone ahead and actually done this. And the one thing that we could not do, we haven't done as members of the world council for health is walk away from these people. You find solutions, you find ways to work around it. [01:58:12] A lot of the activities have been suggested here on how to get around issues, if you're concerned about either being infected and so on and so forth, being exposed as by protein remaining of the issues. And I think we should keep up what we've been doing. We should stick with all the time, appreciating that what you're doing is a risk every time it's a risk, but we will not walk away from anybody and we'll find ways and means to actually deal with what we're facing. [01:58:40] And we learn from each other in combating the disease. And I think today a lot of information has been shared in that respect. And I just wanted to actually just echo the sentiments from Jennifer and other people that have spoken. Thanks. [01:58:51] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thanks very much Dr. Nathi Medalla for that beautiful reminder of how far we've come. [01:58:56] And the fact that together, as we increased our footprint and our solidarity around the world, we can only move forward in a positive direction. The awakening is here. It's happening. The World Council for Health we believe that we are going to get to that state of health and freedom that we want we need, and we deserve. Jennifer, are there any other matters arising? [01:59:15] There's some exciting events I want to talk about before we start closing up. [01:59:18] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: No, go ahead Shabnam. We'd love to hear what you have to say. [01:59:21] Shabnam Palesa Mohamed: Thank you. Thanks very much Jen. Thank you to the reminder from my steering committee colleague on the 23rd of January, there is going to be what looks like a march in Washington, let's double check the place, but it's essentially about the COVID vaccine mandates. [01:59:38] And I've interviewed Dr. David Weissman a couple of days ago, and he calls them quasi vaccines. In terms of this letter that him, Jessica Rose, and two other people have Richard just on that topic of what do we call them. But this defendant is called \"Defeat the Mandate\", and it is going to be in the DC, possibly other states as well in the US on the 23rd of January. [01:59:58] And essentially it says. \" United we stand in peace. We march.\" You can go to the website, defeatthemandatedc.com. And it's about being free to work, travel, learn, question, speak, pray and free to say no. Have a look at the website. And if you are in DC or you're able to make the, I believe it's at 11:30 am, January 23rd, make your voice heard and remember to raise your flags and banners for the World Council for Health, the more affiliates we have, the more we can create the kind of future that we actually want. [02:00:31] And then there is another very exciting event from the 26th to the 30th of January, and it's called the Greater Reset, and it features amongst others, our very own doctor Tess Lawrie, Robert Kennedy in an excellent lineup. I believe 30 speakers and live music. And you'll be able to find more information if you can go to Texas or Mexico at the website, thegreaterreset.org. [02:01:00] So those are the two events that that I wanted to share. And of course, Jennifer, as more events come to surface and brought to our attention that are happening around the world, we'll be very excited and happy to share that information at our Monday general assemblies. And then on that note, that brings us to the very end of a stimulating informative, inspiring, and robust general assembly gathering. [02:01:24] And I'd like to to remind you that you can save the chat if you'd like, and I do believe they do get sent out as well. But there's some very useful links and information there. And I'd also like to remind our affiliates to please, if you can, at least once a week invite a new affiliate to grow to join the World Council for Health. [02:01:41] That's how we continue to grow. That's how we continue to flourish. They want to end with a quote again by Nelson Mandela. And what he said is what counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead. [02:02:02] And then that note, thank you very much, Jennifer Hibbett. My co-host the steering committee of World Council for Health, and of course, all of our wonderful affiliates around the world. Love and solidarity. See you next Monday. Take care. Goodbye. [02:02:15] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Bye everybody. Thank you. Thank you "}
