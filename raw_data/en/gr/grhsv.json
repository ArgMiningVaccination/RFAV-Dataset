Now this book will not be for everyone, but for some people, it will be a positive, inspiring read. It's written by an American Clairvoyant called Walter Makichen who is sadly no longer with us. He spent a large part of his career helping couples who were struggling to conceive by communicating with their spirit babies. He was able to see if there was a baby waiting to come through for a couple and he was able to find out what the potential blocks were as to why they hadn't put in an appearance yet. Its a really fascinating read and I highly recommend it if it appeals to you. He has a chapter on Miscarriage and Abortion that give an interesting take on the subject. Throughout the book he shares meditations that help people to open up communication with their spirit babies. I thought I would share one here as I think meditation is such a wonderful tool when trying to conceive. Also, the idea of opening up communication with your spirit baby made so much sense to me and so if this resonates with you I recommend you give it a try. Walter particularly recommends the following mediation as a daily practice to those whose energy systems are depleted by overwork, stress, or difficult emotional circumstances but anyone can do it. The meditation Sit with your back straight and your feet flat on the floor Close your eyes and take a few moments to listen to your breath Place the palm of your left hand on your first chakra, located at the base of your spine. Focus your attention there for three breaths. A breath is one inhalation and exhalation. Place the palm of the right hand on your abdomen about two inches below your navel. Focus your attention there for three breaths. Place the palm of your left hand on your stomach. Focus your attention there for three breaths Place the palm of your right hand on the center of your chest. Focus your attention there for three breaths. Place the palm of your left hand on your throat. Focus your attention there for three breaths Place the palm of your right hand on the centre of your forehead. Focus your attention there for three breaths. Place the palm of your left hand on top of your head. Focus your attention there for three breaths Place your left hand palm-up on your left thigh and your right hand palm-up on your right thigh As you inhale, imagine a gold and orange energy being drawn up your spine from the base to the top of your head As you exhale, visualise the energy flowing through the top of your head and into the air above you. Continue inhaling the colourful energy up your spine and exhaling it through the top of your head for five to ten minutes. This meditation removes blocks from the chakra system and frees up the kundalini energy so it can form the conception cradle which is where your baby comes in according to Walter. There are many other great meditations in his book but this a great starting point.
