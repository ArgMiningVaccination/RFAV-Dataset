To Request an Action Plan to Address Headaches [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) A Headache is defined as a pain in the head or upper neck. It is one of the most common locations of pain in the body and has many causes. How are Headaches Classified? Headaches have numerous causes, and in 2007 the International Headache Society agreed upon an updated classification system for headache. Because so many people suffer from headaches and because treatment sometimes is difficult, it is hoped that the new classification system will allow health care practitioners come to a specific diagnosis as to the type of headache and to provide better and more effective treatment. There are three major categories of headaches: Primary Headaches, Secondary Headaches, and Cranial Neuralgias, Facial pain, and other Headaches What are Primary Headaches? Primary headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, as well as a variety of other less common types of headache. These are always associated with misalignments of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae in the neck and how the skull sits on the spine. Primary headaches can affect the quality of life. Some people have occasional headaches that resolve quickly while others are debilitated. While these headaches are not life-threatening, they may be associated with symptoms that can mimic strokes or intracerebral bleeding. What are Secondary Headaches? Secondary headaches are those that are due to an underlying structural problem in the head or neck. There are numerous causes of this type of headache ranging from bleeding in the brain, tumor, or meningitis and encephalitis, as well as others. What are Cranial Neuralgias, Facial pain, and other Headaches? Neuralgia means nerve pain (neur= nerve + algia=pain). What are the Symptoms of Tension Headaches? The pain symptoms of a tension headache are: What are the Symptoms of Migraines? The symptoms of migraine headaches can occur in various combinations and include several characteristics: The pain of a migraine can be described as a pounding or throbbing. The headache often begins as a dull ache and develops into throbbing pain. The pain is usually aggravated by physical activity. The pain of a migraine can be described as mild, moderate, or severe. Untreated the headache will become moderate to severe The pain can shift from one side of the head to the other, or it can affect the front of the head or feel like it's affecting the whole head. Most migraines last about 4 hours, although severe ones can last up to a week. The frequency of migraines varies widely among individuals. It is common for a migraine sufferer to get 2-4 headaches per month. Some people, however, may get headaches every few days, while others only get a migraine once or twice a year. Associated symptoms: Warning Signs Symptoms that signal the onset of What are the Symptoms of Migraines with Aura? Migraines with auras occur in about 15-20% of migraine sufferers. An aura can occur before, during, or after the pain occurs and last from 15 to 60 minutes. The symptoms always last less than one hour. Visual auras include: There are also auras that can affect the other senses. These auras can be described simply as having a \"funny feeling,\" or the person may not be able to describe the aura. Other auras may include ringing in the ears (tinnitus Rare Migraine Conditions Include These Types of Neurological Auras: What are the Symptoms of Migraines Without Aura? Migraines without auras are more common, occurring in 80 to 85 percent of migraine sufferers. Several hours before the onset of the headache, the person can experience vague symptoms, including: Cluster Headache Symptoms A cluster headache strikes quickly, usually without warning. Common signs and symptoms include: The pain of a cluster headache is often described as sharp, penetrating or burning. People with this condition say that the pain feels like a hot poker being stuck in the eye or that the eye is being pushed out of its socket. People with cluster headache appear restless. They may pace or sit through the attack. In contrast to people with migraine, people with cluster headache usually avoid lying down during an attack because this position seems to increase the pain. Some migraine-like symptoms \u2014 including nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and aura \u2014 may occur with a cluster headache, though usually on one side. Cluster Period Characteristics A cluster period generally lasts from six to 12 weeks. The starting date and the duration of each cluster period may be consistent from period to period. For example, cluster periods may occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall. Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the cluster headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period that may last as long as 12 months before another cluster headache develops. Chronic cluster periods may continue for more than a year, or pain-free periods may last less than one month. During a Cluster Period: What Causes Tension Headaches? While tension headaches are the most frequently occurring type of headache, their cause is not known from a Traditional Allopathic Medicine perspective. They feel the most likely cause is There is little research to confirm the exact cause of tension headaches from a medical perspective. Tension headaches occur because of physical or emotional stress placed on the body. These stressors can cause the muscles surrounding the skull to clench the teeth and go into spasm. Physical stressors include difficult and prolonged manual What Causes a Migraine? The exact causes of migraines are unknown from a medical perspective, although the current story is they are related to changes in the brain as well as to genetic causes. People with migraines may inherit the tendency to be affected by certain migraine triggers, such as fatigue, bright lights, weather changes For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the expanding (dilation) and constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels on the brain's surface. However, it is now believed that migraine is caused by inherited abnormalities in certain areas of the brain. This is still a theory without any supportive science to confirm. There is a migraine \"pain center\" or generator in the mid-brain area. A migraine begins when hyperactive nerve cells send out impulses to the blood vessels leading to the dilation of these vessels and the release of prostaglandins, serotonin Certain brain cells that use serotonin as a messenger are involved in controlling mood, attention, sleep, and pain. Therefore, chronic changes in serotonin can lead to anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. Causes of Cluster Headaches The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but abnormalities in the hypothalamus likely play a role. This is the best working theory now that has not been substantiated with research. From an Alternative Perspective, these headaches are caused by an imbalance in the [gallbladder](gall-bladder-condition.asp)/liver system related to repressed/unexpressed negative emotion. Cluster attacks usually occur with clocklike regularity during a 24-hour day, and the cycle of cluster periods often follows the seasons of the year. These patterns suggest that the body's biological clock is involved. In humans, the biological clock is located in the hypothalamus, which lies deep in the center of your brain. Abnormalities of the hypothalamus may explain the timing and cyclical nature of cluster headache. Imaging studies have detected increased activity in the hypothalamus during the course of a cluster headache. Unlike migraine and tension headache, cluster headache generally isn't associated with triggers, such as foods, hormonal changes or stress. Some people experience an aura or nausea similar to those experienced with migraine headaches. Once a cluster period begins, however, consumption of alcohol can quickly trigger a splitting headache. For this reason, many people with cluster headache avoid alcohol for the duration of a cluster period. Other possible triggers include the use of medications such as nitroglycerin, a drug used to treat heart disease. How are Tension Headaches Diagnosed? The key to making the diagnosis of any headache is the history given by the patient. The health care practitioner will ask questions to understand when the headache began, learn about the quality, quantity, and duration of the pain, and ask about any associated symptoms. The history of tension headache will include pain that is mild to moderate, located on both sides of the head, described as a tightness that is not throbbing, and not made worse with activity. There will be no associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity. The physical examination, particularly the neurologic portion of the examination, is important in tension headaches because it should be normal to make the diagnosis. The only exception is that there may be some tenderness of the scalp or neck muscles. If the health care practitioner finds an abnormality, then the diagnosis of tension headache would not be considered until the potential for other types of headaches How are Tension Headaches Treated? Tension headaches are painful, and patients may be upset that the diagnosis is \"only\" a tension headache. Even though it is not life-threatening, a tension headache can affect the activities of daily life. Medical Treatment for Tension Headaches Most people successfully treat the symptoms with The following As with any medication, there If these fail, other supportive treatments are available. Recurrent headaches should be a signal to seek medical help. Massage, biofeedback, and stress management can all be used as adjuncts to help with control of tension headaches. Over The Counter Concerns It is important to remember that OTC medications, while generally recognized as safe, are medications and may have side-effects and potential interactions with prescription medications. It always is wise to ask your health care practitioner or pharmacist if you have questions about OTC medications and their use. This is especially important with OTC pain It is important to read the listing of ingredients in OTC pain medications. Often an OTC medication is a combination of ingredients, and the second or third ingredient may have the potential for drug interaction or contraindication with medications a patient is currently taking. For example: Some OTC medications include caffeine, which may trigger rapid heartbeats in some patients. In night time preparations, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be added. This may cause drowsiness, and driving or using heavy machinery may not be appropriate when taking the medication. Other examples where Caution Should be Used Include the Following: One cause of chronic tension headaches is [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Medical Treatment for Migraine Headaches Many medications are available to treat migraines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these, as having an understanding of what to expect is warranted before starting any medication. Symptomatic relief: Symptomatic relief medications are used to relieve symptoms associated with headaches, including the pain of a headache or Over-the-counter medications are effective for some people with migraines. The main ingredients in pain-relieving medications are ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen, and caffeine. Be cautious when taking over-the-counter pain-relieving medications, because sometimes they can contribute to a headache, or their overuse can cause analgesic-rebound headaches or a dependency problem. If you are taking any over-the-counter pain medications more than three times a week or daily, it's time to see your health care provider, who can suggest prescription medications that may be more effective. Anti-nauseants are often needed to relieve nausea that accompanies migraines. Abortive medications are most effective when used at the first sign of a migraine to stop the process that causes the headache pain. By stopping the headache process, abortive medications help prevent the symptoms of migraines including pain, nausea, light-sensitivity, etc. Abortive medications work by constricting the blood vessels, bringing them back to normal and relieving the throbbing pain. Preventive (prophylactic) medications may be prescribed when the headaches are severe, occur more than two or three times a month and are significantly interfering with normal activities. Preventive medications reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches and are generally taken on a regular, daily basis. All of these treatments should be used under the direction of a headache specialist or physician familiar with migraine therapy. As with any medication, it is important to carefully follow the label instructions and your physician's advice. Biofeedback Biofeedback training can also help. People can learn to recognize stressful situations that trigger migraines so they can learn to control these situations. If the migraine begins slowly, many people can use biofeedback to stop the attack before it becomes full blown. [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Medical Treatment for Cluster Headaches There's no cure for cluster headaches from a medical perspective. The goal of treatment is to decrease the severity of pain, shorten the headache period and prevent the attacks. And this will be ongoing for, possibly, the rest of your life. Because the pain of a cluster headache comes on suddenly and may subside within a short time, cluster headache can be difficult to evaluate and treat, as it requires fast-acting medications. Some types of acute medication can provide some pain relief quickly. Based on the latest studies, the therapies listed below have proved to be most effective for acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache. Acute treatments Fast-acting treatments available from your doctor include: The major drawback of oxygen is the need to carry an oxygen cylinder and regulator with you, which can make the treatment inconvenient and inaccessible at times. Small, portable units are available, but some people still find them impractical. The first injection may be given while under medical observation. Some people may benefit from using sumatriptan in nasal spray form, but for most Another triptan medication, zolmitriptan (Zomig), can be taken in nasal spray or tablet form for relief of cluster headache. This medication may be an option if you can't tolerate other forms of fast-acting treatments. To have the medication administered through a vein (intravenously), you'll need to go to a hospital or doctor's office to have the medication administered through a vein (intravenously). [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You The TRUE Cause From an Alternative Perspective, ALL Headaches are caused by an imbalance in the [gallbladder](gall-bladder-condition.asp)/liver system related to repressed/unexpressed negative emotion. Appreciating that the Gallbladder Meridian circles back and forth across both sides of the head, before going down through the body (affecting digestion) and then traveling down the thigh, through the knee and out through the foot. And when the upper part of the meridian is affected by stress, the circuit blows and the meridian becomes out of balance resulting in a headache. And this will result in any of the headaches a person experiences (Tension, Migraine, Cluster, Hormonal). Each Type of Headache will have its associated contributors that are addressed on a person by person basis using [the 7 Pillars of Health Protocols.](OurUniqueApproach.asp) Cluster attacks usually occur with clock-like regularity during a 24-hour day, and the cycle of cluster periods often follows the seasons of the year.

Ultimately, it may affect your interaction with friends and family, your productivity at work, and the overall quality of your life. Talking to a counselor or therapist can help you cope with the effects of cluster headache. Or you may find encouragement and understanding in a headache support group.

You may also find support groups are a good place for you to share your experiences and hear other group members' experiences. If you're interested, your doctor may be able to recommend a group in your area. Your doctor will likely ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on later.
