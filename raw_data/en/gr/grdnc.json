One of the dominant ancient civilizations to harvest the understanding of natural healing began in India. Presenting in Sanskrit in 2nd Century B.C., [Ayurveda](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198827/) was born out of Hindu philosophical teachings and remains amongst the most celebrated traditional systems of medicine in the world today. The term \"ayurveda\" can be translated from Sanskrit to mean \"the science of life\" (\"ayu\" meaning life and \"Veda\" meaning knowledge). It is based on the goal of creating balance through diet, herbal remedies, and yogic breathing. If all disease is the results of stress or imbalance, Ayurvedic medicine seeks to restore [equilibrium](https://www.ayurveda.com/ayurveda-a-brief-introduction-and-guide/) among a person's mind, body, spirit, and environment. Thus, strongly promoting the idea that the human body is designed to heal it's self, allowing for a self-monitoring immune system, when given the proper elements. Ayurveda recognizes that everyone and everything possesses three fundamental types of energy: Vata, Pitta, and Khapa. Vata = The Energy of Movement Pitta = Energy of Digestion/Metabolism Khapa = The Energy of Lubrication and Structure According to The Ayurvedic Institute, \"energy is required to create movement so that fluids and nutrients get to the cells, enabling the body to function. Energy is also required to metabolize the nutrients in the cells, and is called for to lubricate and maintain the structure of the cell.\" This truth is what drives the understanding of all disease and ailment. In Ayurvedic science, people become sick or unwell because of there is a lack of proper cellular function due to an excess or deficiency of vata, pitta or kapha. So, how do you maintain a balance of Vata, Pitta, and Khapa and heal? This is where Western and Eastern medicine start to sector off from one another. Western medicine tends to be more focused on symptomatology and how it can most easily and quickly numb the symptoms of disease\u2014typically with the use of synthetic, pharmaceutical medications or surgery. Whereas Eastern medicine tends to focus more on the root cause of disease and why the body's immune system is failing itself. It is important to note that western medicine saves countless of lives and is, undeniably, a pivotal character in the world of healing. It has advanced the human lifespan by decades and either prevented or eliminated numerous forms of potentially-fatal diagnoses. Therefore, it should be equally respected and used in conjunction with more homeopathic remedies whenever necessary. However, lab-created drugs do contain a toxicity level that, especially if taken long-term, can weaken the body. And surgery can absolutely eliminate diseased tissue and organs, but it does not necessarily change the body's functioning that created the illness in the first place. While it takes years of training to fully understand the practice of Ayurvedic medicine, there are a few basic behaviors that can help you implement healing practices into your life right now.
