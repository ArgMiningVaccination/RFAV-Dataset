Its main function is to secrete an alkaline fluid that constitutes about 30% of the semen volume. However, prostate problems are one of the most common health problems in men. The fact that one man in seven will be diagnosed with prostate cancer is simply surprising. This extremely serious disease is the third leading cause of cancer death in the US. These statistics suggest that taking care of your reproductive health and recognizing the symptoms of prostate problems is vital for preventing these complications. The most common symptoms of prostate problems and cancer include urination abnormalities, pain, painful ejaculation, pelvic or abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, extremity swelling, and blood in urine or semen. Although not all of these symptoms indicate prostate cancer, they might be a sign of some serious medical conditions that require an immediate medical intervention. Prostate cancer can only be diagnosed by tissue biopsy. The question is what can you do to prevent prostate cancer? The answer lies in a proper diet. Our body is a truly fantastic organism that has the ability to defend and cure itself. This is why it's crucial to help your immune system to get stronger and boost your overall health. Eating the right amounts of fruits and vegetables will definitely reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The recommended daily amount of fresh fruits and vegetables is about 4-5 cups. Most people have busy schedules and that is why I definitely believe that juicing is a great option. Although many kind of fruits and vegetables are extremely healthy, knowing which ones to combine to get the most benefit is the key. Green, red and orange fruits and vegetables are loaded with carotenoids which are especially beneficial for prostate cancer. Some of the best juice ingredients include: spinach, kale, dandelion greens, oranges, grapefruits, berries, carrots, and tomatoes. These tasty fruits and vegetables are the basis of juice recipes in this book. Most of these ingredients have a relatively neutral taste and can easily be combined with different herbs and spices for a superb taste. These juices are powerful enough to boost up your immune system within a couple of days and help you prevent prostate cancer. "}
