AIM is Using Personalized and Innovative Care to Empower people on their Journey toward Optimal Health and Longevity It's well documented that the United States' prevailing diet and healthcare system is designed to keep you unhealthy, and in chronic disease states, so that you are forced to buy costly pharmaceuticals that only offer symptomatic fixes, and don't address the root causes of your health issues. In order to break out of this pattern, you have to educate yourself, and take action by making choices that promote your health and wellness. But where do you start, and how do you know what to do? Dr. Brooke Azie-Rentz created AIM as a Concierge Clinic so that we can take the personal time with each and every patient to really get to know them, and their health needs.
