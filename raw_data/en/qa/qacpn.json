Protecting yourself and your family from unnecessary and potentially serious illness is always in the best interests of good health. For this reason, seasonal flu shots are recommen ded every fall. This year the seasonal flu is not the only viral threat, as COVID -19 continues to infect thousands of people . Getting a flu shot has never been more important. Di d you know that it is possible to have the flu and COVID- 19 at the same time? Medical evidence suggests that those suffering from both viruses are twice as likely to die as people who have only COVID -19. While there is not yet a vaccine for the coronavirus, the seasonal flu vaccine is widely available and can greatly reduce your ri sk of the seasonal flu. Why is the flu vaccine so important this year? Flu and COVID-19 share manysymptoms. You may need COVID-19testing for an accurate diagnosis. The seasonal flu and COVID-19 are highly contagious. With both virusescirculating at the same time, the risk ofillness is correspondingly high.Bot h the flu and COVID-19 pose a risk of serious complications, with COVID-19 including some not associated withthe seasonal flu. The most vulnerable parties to flu and COVID -19 are not alwa ys the same. Protecting yourself from the flu alsohelps protect your loved ones.

While they share some characteristics, there are also key differences between the two. Although current data suggests that COVID -19 is deadl ier than the seasonal flu, more evidence is needed to draw conclusions. Who should get a flu vaccine? With rare exceptions, an annual flu vaccine is recommended for everyone aged 6 months or olde r. The risk of serious complications from the flu is especiall y high for: Adults 65 years and older Pregnant women Children younger than 5 years Children with neurologic conditions People who are obese and/or individuals with: Diabetes Heart disease and stroke Cancer HIV/AIDS Asthma Chronic lung disease Kidney disease Liver disorders Metabolic disorders Flu vaccines are reformulated each year to protect against the specific viruses likely to be most common during the flu season. When is flu season? While the exact timing of flu season varies from year to year, flu activity generally accelerates in October and peaks between December and February. The season often extends into May. When should I get the flu vaccine? To maintain good immunity through the entire flu season, September or October are among the best t imes for vaccination. Remember that it takes up to two weeks for the vaccine to become effective. Nevertheless, missing the October target should not mean skipping the vaccine. It is important to pursue vaccination as long as the virus remains in circulation. VaccineFinder.org can point you to vaccination locations.
