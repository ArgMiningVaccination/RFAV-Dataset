We were also both engaged in challenging the claims of a link between [the MMR vaccine and autism](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577644/MMR-vaccine-doesnt-cause-autism-says-study.html), one of the controversies that led to the foundation of the SMC some 20 years ago. In the course of the Covid pandemic, there has been much criticism of the media for scaremongering with mathematical models, for uncritically endorsing government policies and for neglecting (or even suppressing) dissident scientists. From my perspective as a jobbing GP who has observed the impact in the surgery of scientific controversies from HIV/Aids to swine flu, the treatment of Covid in the media has marked a dramatic improvement, one for which the SMC can take some credit. As Fox argues, there has been, over the past two decades, \"a quiet revolution\" in the culture of science \"as scientists have been transformed from remote figures hidden away in their ivory towers to become accessible experts central to our national life\". One example. In 1998, scientist Arpad Pusztai claimed on television that genetically modified potatoes caused immunological defects and growth retardation in rats, provoking public alarm over the potential danger of GM foods. A distinguished group of scientists comprehensively rebutted these findings, but their response was published some 12 months later, while Pusztai's claims continued to circulate, causing unwarranted anxieties. It was the same story over Andrew Wakefield's claims about the MMR vaccine, as, in the public realm, reputable science lagged behind unsubstantiated theories. Since the start of the pandemic, the SMC has responded briskly to scientific developments by organising briefings, bringing together scientists and journalists. It advises scientists on presenting the results of their research to a popular audience, reminding them of the importance of defining the limits of their expertise, notably in relation to policy. It provides rapid appraisals of new publications by relevant experts - a particularly important service as many recent papers have been published as 'pre-prints' before peer review. Over 20 years the SMC's staff have covered an extraordinary range of controversies, including animal research, chronic fatigue syndrome, the genetics of cloning, climate change and nuclear power. In response to pressures to curtail debate and manage 'the message', Fox remains committed to openness and to trusting the public. I believe she is right that, despite all the difficulties of the past two years, improvements in the relations between science and the media offer 'some cause for celebration and hope'. A poignant retirement Another retirement party, this one marking the departure, after 30 years' service, of the last of the group that established our north London group practice in its modern form. It was a great pleasure to meet old colleagues and friends, many for the first time since the relaxation of pandemic restrictions, though sad to reminisce about the end of an era. I recalled meeting our new partner when he dropped into a Saturday morning surgery, then a routine service, now being rediscovered by the Government as a drastic measure to relieve the shortage of GP appointments. The procedure then was to begin with coffee and croissants, read the newspaper, share the week's gossip with the receptionists and then deal with a handful of patients and an occasional visit before adjourning for an early lunch. Those were the days! In response to the latest plans, many GPs wearily anticipate a weekend influx of patients angry and distressed over their inability to get appointments during the week. While few applicants have emerged to replace my former partner, a young GP told me that he has recently taken over a neighbouring practice from his father who has retired after 40 years.
