PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\" EEA \"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or both) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \" EU MiFID II \"); or (ii) a iv customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the \" EU Insurance Distribution Directive \") , where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \" EU PRIIPs Regulation \") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation. PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (\" UK\").

The risk factors considered to be the most important, based on the probability of their occurrence and the expected magnitude of their negative impact and after consideration of the effects of the measures implemented by Sanofi in order to manage these risk factors, are mentioned first in their respective category and followed by an asterisk. Investors are invited to read carefully the information provided in the risk factors before investing in Sanofi's securities. Investors' attention is drawn to the fact that other risks, not identified as at the date of this Prospectus or whose realization is not considered likely to have, as at this same date, a significant negative impact on Sanofi's business, financial situation and results, its perspectives, its development and/or on Sanofi's securities, may exist or occur. A. Risks Relating to Legal and regulatory matters Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition* Product liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company and the Group's product liability exposure could increase, given that liability claims relating to its businesses may differ with regard to their nature, scope and level, from the types of product liability claims that Sanofi has handled in the past. Substantial damages have been awarded by some jurisdictions and/or settlements agreed - notably in the United States and other common law jurisdictions - against pharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also lead to products recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, and/or be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers, third-party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of the product and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions. Sanofi is currently defending a number of product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F) notably with respect to Taxotere\u00ae, Zantac\u00ae and Depakine\u00ae and there can be no assurance that the Group will be successful in defending these claims, or that it will not face additional claims in the future. Establishing the full side effect profile of a pharmaceutical drug goes beyond data derived from preapproval clinical studies which may only involve several hundred to several thousand patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing body of post- marketing safety data, and clinical trials provide additional information - for example, potential evidence of rare, population-specific or long-term adverse events or of drug interactions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies. This causes product labeling to evolve over time, following interactions with regulatory authorities, which may include restrictions of therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions and occasionally even the suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization. Following any of these events, pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). Furthermore, Sanofi commercializes several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause unexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see \" Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm \" below). Although Sanofi continues to insure a portion of its product liability with third-party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the United States. In the future, it is possible that self-insurance may become the sole commercially reasonable means available for managing the financial risk associated with product liability in Sanofi's pharmaceuticals and vaccines businesses (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). In cases where Sanofi self-insures, the legal costs that Sanofi would bear for handling such claims and potential damage awards to be paid to claimants, could have a negative impact on its financial condition. Due to insurance conditions, even when the Group has insurance coverage, recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful due to market-driven insurance limitations and exclusions. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect Sanofi's ability to recover claims on policies for which Sanofi has already paid a premium. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of the Group's defense, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm Sanofi's reputation and can impact the demand for its products. Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. - 2 - Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition Sanofi's industry is heavily regulated and legal requirements vary from country to country, and new requirements are imposed on Sanofi's industry from time to time. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengthening implementation and enforcement activities in recent years, including in relation to anti-bribery, anti-corruption and ethical requirements with respect to medical and scientific research, interactions with healthcare professionals and payers, respect of the human rights of workers and data protection legislation. Sanofi also operates in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, and the operation of its business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous countries. Sanofi has adopted a Code of Ethics that requires employees to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the specific principles and rules of conduct set forth in the Code. Sanofi also has policies and procedures designed to help ensure that Sanofi, its officers, employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\" FCPA \"), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the French Anti-Corruption measures law (\" Sapin II \") and the French duty of vigilance law and other anti-bribery laws and regulations). Notwithstanding these efforts, failure to comply with laws and regulations (including as a result of a business partner's breach) may occur and could result in liabilities for Sanofi and/or its management. With respect to data protection legislation, violations of the European General Data Protection Regulation (\" GDPR \"), which came into force in 2018, or other significant new privacy legislation, including in the United States the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA \") among others, could carry financial sanctions and may also harm Sanofi's reputation and those of its activities that rely on personal data processing. Violations of the GDPR carry financial risks due to penalties for data breach or improper processing of personal data (including a possible fine of up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious infringements). In addition, some uncertainty remains with respect to the legal and regulatory environment for these evolving privacy and data protection laws in the absence of clear guidance or case law. Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries could become the subject of investigations or proceedings by various government entities or could face audits and/or litigation, including allegations of corruption, claims related to employment matters, patent and intellectual property disputes, consumer law claims and tax audits. Sanofi is currently defending itself in a number of lawsuits relating to pricing and marketing practices (including, for example, \"whistleblower\" litigation in the United States). With respect to tax issues, the complexity of the fiscal environment, is such that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments that are greater or less than the amounts Sanofi has accrued. See \" Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings \" and Note D.22. to Sanofi's consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. In addition, responding to such investigations is costly and may divert management's attention from its business. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters that may arise in the future, could preclude the commercialization of its products, harm its reputation, negatively affect the profitability of existing products and subject Sanofi to substantial fines, punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentially leading to the imposition of additional regulatory controls, monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs or markets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. The unpredictability of these proceedings could lead Sanofi, after consideration of all relevant factors, to enter into settlement agreements to settle certain claims. Such settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or potential criminal penalties, and may include admissions of wrongdoing and may require entering into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (\" CIA\") or a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (in the United States), which is intended to regulate company behavior for a specified number of years. For example, on 28 February 2020, Sanofi US entered into a civil settlement with the United States Department of Justice and agreed to pay approximately $11.85 million to resolve allegations regarding certain charitable donations Sanofi US made to an independent patient assistance foundation that assisted patients being treated for Multiple Sclerosis. In connection with this settlement, Sanofi US also entered into a CIA with the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services effective the same day which will require the Company to meet and maintain certain compliance requirements in the United States. - 3 - Sanofi's activities (including its products and manufacturing activities) are subject to significant government regulations and regulatory approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to its business if Sanofi fails to anticipate the regulations, comply with them, maintain the required approvals, and/or adapt to changes in applicable regulations Obtaining a marketing authorization for a product is a long and highly regulated process requiring Sanofi to present extensive documentation and data to the relevant regulatory authorities either at the time of the filing of the application for a marketing authorization or later during its review. Each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements which can evolve over time. Each regulatory authority may also delay or refuse to grant approval even though a product has already been approved in another country. Regulatory authorities are increasingly strengthening their requirements on product safety and risk/benefit profile. All of these requirements, including post-marketing requirements, have increased the costs associated with maintaining marketing authorizations. Moreover, to monitor Sanofi's compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, EMA, WHO and comparable national agencies in other jurisdictions routinely conduct regulatory inspections of the Group facilities, distribution centers, commercial activities and development centers and may identify potential deficiencies. For example, in November 2020, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sutimlimab, an investigational monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment of hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease, referring to certain deficiencies identified by the agency during a pre-license inspection of a third-party facility responsible for manufacturing. More generally, if Sanofi fails to adequately respond to regulatory inspection observations identified during an inspection, or fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted timeline, it could be subject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA (such as a Warning Letter, injunction or seizure cease and desist order), the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, Sanofi has an obligation to monitor and report adverse events and safety signals. In order to comply with its duty to report adverse events and safety signals, Sanofi must regularly train its employees and certain third parties (such as external sales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters, including on pharmacovigilance. If Sanofi fails to train these people, or fails to train them appropriately, or if they do not comply with contractual requirements, it may be exposed to the risk that safety events are not reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of its reporting obligations. In addition, all aspects of its business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, reimbursement, pricing and sales, are subject to extensive legislation and governmental regulation. Changes in applicable laws and the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on its business. For example, in response to the new European Union regulations for Medical Devices (EU MDR), the entry into force of which was postponed from May 2020 to May 2021, Sanofi created the EU MDR task force. This task force was commissioned to address the risk of potential delays in approvals (for new drug-device combination products, for substantial changes to the design or intended purpose of the device component of already approved drug-device combination products, and for Medical Devices) and of product discontinuation (for some legacy medical devices), as well as compliance risks for existing products due to increased requirements for post-marketing surveillance, clinical evaluations, traceability and transparency. A similar task force was set up in the first quarter of 2021 to examine risks related to the new regulations for In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) due to be implemented in May 2022. For information about risks related to changes: in proprietary rights rules and regulations, see \" Sanofi relies on its patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its products. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, Sanofi's financial results could be adversely affected \" below; and in environmental rules and regulations, see \" Management of the historical contamination related to Sanofi's past industrial activities may have a significant adverse effect on its results of operations \" below . Sanofi relies on its patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of its products. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, Sanofi's financial results could be adversely affected Through patent and other proprietary rights, such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Europe, Sanofi holds exclusivity rights for a number of its research-based products. However, the protection that Sanofi is able to obtain varies in its duration and scope. Furthermore, patents and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective protection for its products. For example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition for existing products through new regulatory proposals intended to achieve, or resulting in, changes to the scope of patent or data exclusivity rights and through the use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products more difficult and time consuming or could adversely affect the exclusivity period for Sanofi's products. - 4 - Moreover, manufacturers of generic products or biosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage before the patents expire, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their version of the product approved before the exclusivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third-party, Sanofi may not prevail and the decision rendered may not conclude that its patent or other proprietary rights are valid, enforceable or infringed. Its competitors may also successfully avoid its patents. Even in cases where Sanofi ultimately prevails in an infringement claim, legal remedies available for harm caused to Sanofi by infringing products may be inadequate to make Sanofi whole. Moreover, a successful result against a competing product for a given patent or in a specific country is not necessarily predictive of its future success against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws. In addition, if Sanofi loses patent protection as a result of an adverse court decision or a settlement, it faces the risk that government and private third-party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over-reimbursed or overpaid for a drug. For example, in Australia, Sanofi's patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid. Following this decision, the Australian Government sought damages for its alleged over-reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due to the preliminary injunction Sanofi had secured against the sale of generic clopidogrel during the course of the litigation. The Australian Government's claim was dismissed following a decision of the Federal Court of Australia on 28 April 2020. Sanofi is awaiting the judgment to be delivered by the Federal Court of Australia, following the appeal of the first instance decision by the Australian Government on 26 May 2020. In certain cases, to terminate or avoid patent litigation, Sanofi or its collaboration partners may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of third-party intellectual property rights. Any payments under these licenses may reduce Sanofi's profits from such products and Sanofi may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all. Third parties may also request a preliminary or permanent injunction in a country from a court of law to prevent Sanofi from marketing a product if they consider that Sanofi infringes their patent rights in that country. For example, Sanofi is or was party to patent infringement proceedings in several countries initiated against it and Regeneron by Amgen relating to Praluent\u00ae in which Amgen requested injunctive relief (see Note D.22.b) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F for more information). If third parties obtain a preliminary or permanent injunction or if Sanofi fails to obtain a required license for a country where valid third-party intellectual property rights as confirmed by a court of law exist, or if Sanofi is unable to alter the design of its technology to fall outside the scope of third-party intellectual property rights, Sanofi may be unable to market some of its products in certain countries, which may limit its profitability. Furthermore, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third-party to use patents protecting an innovator's product, which limits the value of the patent protection granted to such products. Sanofi has increased the proportion of biological therapeutics in its pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical products. Typically, the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of biological therapeutics is complicated by third-party intellectual property rights (otherwise known as freedom to operate (FTO) issues), to a greater extent than for the small molecule therapeutics, because of the types of patents allowed by national patent offices. Further, its ability to successfully challenge third- party patent rights is dependent on the legal interpretation and case law of national courts. In addition, Sanofi expects to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regulatory pathways provided in the United States and Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusivity of any biological therapeutics Sanofi sells or may market in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described above. If a biosimilar version of one of Sanofi's products were to be approved, it could reduce its sales and/or profitability of that product. If Sanofi's patents and/or proprietary rights to its products were limited or circumvented, its financial results could be adversely affected. B. Risks relating to Sanofi's business The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is increasingly affected by cost containment pressures and decisions of governments and other third parties* The commercial success of Sanofi's existing products and its product candidates depends in part on their pricing and the conditions under which they are reimbursed. At a time of intense scrutiny over drug prices, its products continue to be negatively affected by downward pressure due, inter alia, to: stricter price and access controls imposed by governments and other payers in most countries: o requirements for greater transparency around of drug pricing and drug development costs, o widespread use of international reference pricing and therapeutic reference pricing, among other pricing methodologies and caps, - 5 - o mandatory price cuts, renegotiations, industry payback and rebates, o shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher copayments and co-pay accumulator programs, o delisting from reimbursement and restrictions on the label population, o access restrictions for high-priced innovative medicines, o tighter formulary management (including stepped therapy, strict prior authorization criteria; formulary exclusions) mainly by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (\" PBMs \") in the United States, o prescribing guidelines and binding medicine utilization controls, o greater use of tendering and centralized procurement (national/regional/class-wide level), o cross-country cooperation in price negotiations, contracting or procurement, already occurring to some extent (for example COVAX initiative, the BeNeLuxA alliance in Europe; South America/PAHO arrangements), o discriminatory and non-transparent pricing and procurement policies (e.g. government procurement restrictions, import bans) in favor of domestic pharmaceutical companies, and o additional complexity in the access environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in budget constraints; widespread use of health technology assessment (\" HTA \") to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions: o more stringent evidence and value requirements (e.g. comparative effectiveness, patient preferences, real-world evidence, health economic modelling) by payers and HTA authorities, raising the bar for market entry, o unreasonable thresholds for cost-effectiveness, and o increasingly restrictive HTA decisions with significant variation across markets; loss of exclusivity, and generic and biosimilar competition, accelerating price erosion: o increasing penetration of generics globally (e.g. nearly 90% of prescription drugs dispensed in the US in 2020), o next generation of biosimilars coming to the market across major therapeutic areas, o savings potential from increased biosimilar use (expected to be a cumulative $285 billion globally through 2025 according to the IQVIA Institute), and o evolving regulatory landscapes to support interchangeability (e.g. US) and pharmacy substitution (e.g. EU Nordics, Germany). In the United States, which accounted for 38.1% of Sanofi's net sales in 2021, the government's focus remains on handling the COVID-19 pandemic. There remains a significant risk that the US Congress could enact substantial policy reforms in 2022, or that the Administration could use its executive authority to pass drug pricing legislation, with a potentially detrimental impact on pharmaceutical innovation and pricing. Other risks include the increasing focus on price transparency, and the growing interest in \"Buy American\" procurement rules. Finally, there are persistent supply chain challenges due to high dependency on API imports from China and India. If Sanofi had to source API from the US where they are more expensive, the current cost containments would not allow Sanofi to reflect the corresponding increase on its prices which would impact the margins of its products. In addition, the continued consolidation of the US pharmacy benefits management market exposes Sanofi to greater pricing pressure. With the largest three PBMs/Group Purchasing Organizations - OptumRx (Emisar), CVS/Caremark (Zinc), and Express Scripts (Ascent) now covering over 85% of the US prescription claims, consolidation has led to more aggressive formulary management of specialty medicines and larger rebates in return for access. The rise of drug formulary exclusions, in favor of lower-cost therapeutic alternatives, may result in a significant reduction in sales. In China, Sanofi continues to face increasingly fierce local competition in a market that is highly fragmented and dominated by multiple stakeholders. The National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) plays an increasing role in centralizing drug procurement and pursuing aggressive pricing policies, forcing Sanofi to drastically reduce prices to gain access to China's pharmaceutical market. Sanofi expects competitive and pricing pressure to intensify across its portfolio as a growing number of its products are subject to national reimbursement drug list (NRDL) price negotiations and national volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders, with the lowest price prevailing. Oncology products, in particular, are experiencing greater price cuts due to increased competition from domestic manufacturers in NRDL negotiations, especially in the PD-1 inhibitor space. In 2020, only Chinese PD-1 inhibitors were added to the NRDL (while imported drugs in the therapeutic class failed to pass the negotiation phase), signaling additional access challenges for innovative oncology therapies in China. Further expansion of the VBP policy to biologics and biosimilars also poses a major and growing threat to Sanofi's key established products moving forward. Although there is still uncertainty around the mechanism for the inclusion of the insulin class in the sixth national VBP round, Sanofi expects its diabetes sales will be impacted in 2022. - 6 - Due to these competitive pressures on its prices, Sanofi's revenues and margins are, and could continue to be, negatively affected. In Europe, in November 2020, the European Commission adopted a new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe that may result in higher constraints and lower innovation rewards, posing downside risks across Sanofi's pipeline portfolio. The European Commission's most concerning proposals relate to revamping incentives in unmet need areas such as rare and pediatric diseases, allowing earlier market entry of generics and biosimilars, promoting greater transparency around pricing and drug development costs, and cross-border collaboration on pricing and procurement. Sanofi's research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing its product portfolio* Discovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. To be successful in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, Sanofi must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop new products to compensate for decreasing sales of products facing patent expiration and termination of regulatory data exclusivity, introduction of lower-priced generics, or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superior or equivalent to Sanofi products. Sanofi must pursue both early-stage research and early and late development stages in order to propose a sustainable and well-balanced portfolio of products. In 2021, Sanofi spent \u20ac5,692 million on research and development, amounting to 15.1% of its net sales. Failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of Sanofi's pipeline. Sanofi prioritizes six potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet patient need: tolebrutinib (multiple sclerosis). Sanofi also announced its decision to discontinue its research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and refocus its R&D strategy on oncology, immunology and inflammation, multiple sclerosis and neurology and rare diseases and rare blood disorders. In 2021, Sanofi acquired Translate Bio to accelerate the deployment of mRNA technology for the development of new vaccines, including for seasonal influenza, and beyond vaccines, therapeutics where there is a strong unmet medical need. However, mRNA technology is still in its very early days and the ability of this technology to demonstrate strong results and safety still remains to be asserted. Sanofi may also fail to improve its development productivity sufficiently to sustain its pipeline (see also \" Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strategic investments or divestments \" below). In addition, the competitive landscape includes a high level of uncertainty as numerous companies are working on or may be evaluating similar targets and a product considered as promising at the beginning of its development may become less attractive if a competitor addressing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. There can be no assurance that any of Sanofi's product candidates will be proven safe or effective (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.5. Global Research & Development \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). Over these research and development cycles usually spanning several years, there is a substantial risk at each stage of development including pre-clinical activities and clinical trials - that Sanofi will not achieve its goals of safety and/or efficacy and that Sanofi will have to abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of money and human resources. More and more trials are designed with clinical endpoints of superiority; failure to achieve those endpoints could damage the product's outlook and Sanofi's overall development program. Decisions concerning the studies to be carried out can have a significant impact on the marketing strategy for a given product. Multiple in-depth studies can demonstrate that a product has additional benefits, facilitating the product's marketing, but such studies are expensive and time consuming and may delay the product's submission to regulatory authorities for approval. In addition, following (or in some cases contemporaneously with) the marketing authorization, the dossier is also submitted to governmental agencies and/or national or regional third-party payers HTA bodies) for review. These HTA bodies evaluate evidence on the value of the new product, assess the medical need it serves and provide recommendations on the corresponding reimbursement. Such analyses may require additional studies, including comparative studies, which may effectively delay marketing, change the population which the new product treats, and add costs to its development. Sanofi's continuous investments in research and development for future products and for the launches of newly registered molecules could therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which would negatively affect Sanofi's operating results and profitability. Lastly, there can be no assurance that all the products approved or launched will achieve commercial success. - 7 - Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm* Sanofi's business depends heavily on the use of interdependent information technology systems including internet-based systems and digital tools. Certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on Sanofi information systems (including cloud-based computing) or those of third-party providers (including for the storage and transfer of critical, confidential, sensitive or personal information regarding its patients, clinical trials, vendors, customers, employees, collaborators and others). Sanofi is therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents and misuse or manipulation of any of these IT systems could result in exposure of confidential information or the modification of critical data. Sanofi and its third-party service providers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors or other contracting third parties use, to the best of its ability, secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. Like many companies, Sanofi may experience certain of the following events which pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Sanofi's sensitive data: breakdown, outages, service disruption or impairment, data loss or deterioration in the event of a system malfunction, or increasing threat of data theft or corruption in the event of a cyber-attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks, insider threat attacks, cybercrimes, including state-sponsored cybercrimes, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. The pandemic has both exacerbated attacks related to competitive intelligence by criminal organizations targeting information related to COVID-19 research, development, and production and increased the opportunity for such attacks as remote working has become more widely used, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. Also, in the event of an attack, US and European legislation related to the financing of terrorism imposes increasing restrictions on payments of ransom. As a result, Sanofi's ability to recover the data might be limited. Therefore, its business continuity could be at risk if Sanofi is unable to recover data through back-ups and restorations. Each of these events could negatively impact important processes, such as scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of outcomes to health authorities for marketing authorizations, the functioning of production processes and the supply chain, compliance with legal requirements, trade secrets, security strategies and other key activities, including Sanofi's employees' ability to communicate between themselves as well as with third parties (see also \" Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). This could result in material financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm. Although Sanofi maintains insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficiently available in the future to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of its systems. For example, certain types of cyber-attacks could be considered as an Act of War subject to insurance exclusion. The manufacture of Sanofi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact its image* Many of Sanofi's products are manufactured using technically complex processes with production constraints, including the need for specialized facilities, trained and certified employees, and highly specific raw materials. Sanofi must ensure that all manufacturing processes comply with (i) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), (ii) other applicable regulations issued by governmental health authorities around the world, as well as (iii) Sanofi's own quality standards. Third parties supply Sanofi with a portion of its raw materials, active ingredients and medical devices, which exposes Sanofi to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption in the event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture its products in line with quality standards or if they experience financial difficulties. For example, in 2021 Genzyme sold a manufacturing facility located in Allston Landing in the United States to a third party, which is in particular involved in the production of Cerezyme\u00ae. Sanofi now relies on that third party for certain manufacturing and testing operations pursuant to the terms and conditions of relevant contractual agreements with such third party. The manufacturing and testing operations performed on Genzyme's behalf at the Allston Landing facility are subject to the terms of a consent decree requiring ongoing compliance therewith, which was entered into between Genzyme and the US government in 2010. Sanofi now relies on the third party that acquired the Allston Landing site to perform manufacturing and testing services on its behalf and to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the aforementioned consent decree. Sanofi could be subject to product supply risk if the third party is unable to supply product to it and to regulatory action if the third-party acquirer of the Allston Landing site fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including cGMP, when performing the relevant services. Epidemics and other public health crises, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, expose Sanofi to risks of a slowdown or temporary suspension in the production of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), raw materials and some of its products. Any prolonged restrictive measures put in place in order to control an outbreak of contagious disease or other adverse public health development, in any of its principal production sites, may have a material and adverse effect on its manufacturing operations. Any - 8 - of these factors could adversely affect Sanofi's business, operating results or financial condition (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Production and Raw Materials \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F for a description of these outsourcing arrangements and \" The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may impact Sanofi's business, operations and financial performance is highly uncertain and difficult to predict \" below). Sanofi's business may require the transformation and adaptation of its plants in order to ensure the continuity of production of its products in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand. This may be necessary to meet the need for the production of new products, including biologics, or to ensure the scaling up production of products under development once approved. This need may also result from new regulatory requirements; for example, the fact that insulin is no longer regulated by the FDA as a drug but rather as a biologic requires significant transformation and adaptation of Sanofi's insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, with no guarantee that Sanofi will manage to complete that plan within the expected time. Furthermore, Sanofi's biological products, in particular, are subject to the risk of manufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory because of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological materials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequate amounts of raw materials meeting required standards. In addition, specific storage and distribution conditions are required for many biological products (for example, cold storage is required for certain vaccines, insulin-based products and some hemophilia products). These production difficulties may also be encountered during testing, which is a mandatory requirement prior to drug products being released. For example, in 2018 in China, Sanofi encountered supply constraints of Pentaxim\u00ae vaccine due to problems with the supplier of a raw material used in the formulation of this vaccine in China. As a result, Sanofi had to find an alternative raw material to meet Chinese requirements. Some of Sanofi's production sites, and some of its suppliers' and/or contractors' sites are located in areas exposed to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes. Such disasters could be exacerbated by climate change. In the event of a major disaster, Sanofi could experience severe destruction or interruption of its operations and production capacity at these sites. The complexity of these processes, as well as standards required for the manufacture of its products, subject Sanofi to risks because the investigation and remediation of any identified or suspected problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, product recalls or lost sales and inventories, and delay the launch of new products; this could adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see - \" Product liability claims could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). When manufacturing disruptions occur, Sanofi may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In the event of manufacturing disruptions, Sanofi's ability to use backup facilities or set up new facilities is more limited because biologics are more complex to manufacture and generally require dedicated facilities. Even though Sanofi aims to have backup sources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of its principal active ingredients at additional facilities when practicable, Sanofi cannot be certain they will be sufficient if its principal sources become unavailable. Switching sources and manufacturing facilities requires significant time and prior approval by health authorities. Supply shortages generate even greater negative reactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or no viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of specific products can have a negative impact on the confidence of patients, customers and professional healthcare providers and the image of the Group and may lead to lower product revenues. A substantial share of the revenue and income of Sanofi depends on the performance of certain flagship products* As part of the presentation of its strategy in December 2019 Sanofi announced its intent to prioritize its activities on growth drivers including Dupixent\u00ae and its Vaccines operations, which have been identified as key growth drivers. Nevertheless market expansion and new launches of medicines and vaccines may not deliver the expected benefits. Sanofi may also encounter failures or delays in its launch strategy (in terms of timing, pricing, market access, marketing efforts and dedicated sales forces), such that Sanofi's products that may not deliver the expected benefits. The competitive environment for a given product may also have changed by the time of the actual launch, modifying Sanofi's initial expectations. The need to prioritize the allocation of resources may also cause delays in or hamper the launch or expansion of some of Sanofi's products. Also Sanofi currently generates a substantial share of its net sales from certain key products (see \" Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A.2. Results of Operations - Year ended 31 December 2021 compared with year ended 31 December 2020 - A.2.1.3/Net Sales - Pharmaceuticals segment \"). For example, Dupixent\u00ae generated net sales of \u20ac5,249 million in 2021 representing 13.9% of Sanofi's net sales for the year and is the Group's biggest product in terms of sale. Among its flagship products, Lantus\u00ae, Lovenox\u00ae and Plavix\u00ae already face generic competition on the market. Lantus\u00ae is particularly important; it was one of Sanofi's leading products in 2021 with net sales of \u20ac2,494 million. Aubagio\u00ae, another leading product, is - 9 - expected to face generic competition in the US starting from March 2023, following a settlement agreement entered into in 2017. Jevtana\u00ae faces generic competition since September 2021 in the U.S. and the end of March 2021 in Europe. More generally, an expiration of effective intellectual property protections for its products typically results in the market entry of one or more lower-priced generic competitors, often leading to a rapid and significant decline in revenues on those products (for information regarding ongoing patent litigation see Note D.22.b) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). The introduction of a generic product results in adverse price and volume effects for the branded, or genericized products. For example, although Sanofi does not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition, a comparison of its consolidated net sales for 2021 and 2020 for the main products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of \u20ac231 million of net sales on a reported basis (see \" Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A.1.2. Impacts of Competition from Generics and Biosimilars \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). However, other parameters may have contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average price of certain products (e.g. Lantus\u00ae). Furthermore, in general, if one or more of its flagship products were to encounter problems (such as material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, product recalls, non-approval by the health authorities of a new indication for a marketed product, pricing pressure and manufacturing or supply issues), the adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition could be significant. Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of its products Sanofi's industry is both highly collaborative and competitive, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in- licensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. Sanofi expects that it will continue to rely on third parties for key aspects of its business and Sanofi needs to ensure its attractiveness as a potential partner. Sanofi conducts a number of significant research and development programs and market some of its products in collaboration with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, Sanofi currently has a global strategic collaboration with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies for the development and commercialization of Dupixent\u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae (sarilumab) and SAR440340 (REGN3500- itepekimab). Further, in April 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their antibody collaboration related to Praluent\u00ae (alirocumab) (see \" Item 5. Financial Presentation of Alliances \u2014 A.1.7.1/ Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc \"). Sanofi relies upon Regeneron to successfully carry out their responsibilities with regard to the manufacture and supply of these collaboration antibodies. In immuno-oncology, Sanofi has a global collaboration with Regeneron for the joint development and commercialization of cemiplimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor antibody (Libtayo\u00ae). (see \" Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). Finally, Sanofi may also rely on partners to design and manufacture medical devices, notably for the administration of its products. As regards products recently launched or under development for which Sanofi has a collaboration agreement with partners, the terms of the applicable alliance agreement may require Sanofi to share profits and losses arising from commercialization of such products with its partners. This differs from the treatment of revenue and costs generated by other products for which Sanofi has no alliance agreement, and such profit sharing may deliver a lower contribution to its financial results. Sanofi could also be subject to the risk that it may not properly manage the decision-making process with its partners. Decisions may also be under the control of or subject to the approval of its collaboration partners, who may have views that differ from Sanofi's. Sanofi is also subject to the risk that its partners may not perform effectively, which could have a detrimental effect when our collaboration partners are responsible for the performance of certain key tasks or functions, for example related to manufacturing. Any such failures in the development process or differing priorities may adversely affect Sanofi's business including the activities conducted through the collaboration arrangements. Sanofi also cannot guarantee that third-party manufacturers will be able to meet its near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. Subject to the completion of its initial public offering in the first half of 2022 including obtaining required market authority approvals, EUROAPI will also become a third-party manufacturer and will continue to manufacture a certain number of APIs for Sanofi. Sanofi is also subject to the risk that contract research organizations or other vendors (for instance regarding digital activities) retained by it or its collaboration partners may not perform effectively. Sanofi could face conflicts or difficulties with its partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or renegotiation. All of these events may affect the development, manufacturing, launch and/or marketing of certain of its products or product candidates and may cause a decline in its revenues or otherwise negatively affect its results of operations. - 10 - The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact Sanofi's business, operations and financial performance is highly uncertain and difficult to predict Sanofi is unable to predict the extent to which the rapidly changing pandemic and related developments, including the duration and long-term magnitude of the disruption, may adversely impact its business, operations and financial performance, including lower sales and reduced patient demand and usage of certain of its products. While economies around the world have sought or will begin to seek to fully reopen their economies, the degree to which COVID- 19 adversely impacts Sanofi's results in the future is outside Sanofi's knowledge or control or will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its mutation, its severity, the actions taken by government authorities to contain the virus or mitigate its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new constraints and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. In an increasingly budget-constrained healthcare environment as economic disruption continues due to the pandemic, we expect to see a higher pressure on drug prices worldwide and, in the longer term, a reallocation of funding across therapeutic areas, driven in particular by evolving public health priorities, which could negatively impact our business operations (see \"- The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is increasingly affected by cost reduction initiatives and decisions of governments and other third parties \" above). For example, the pandemic may reduce Sanofi's sales in targeted markets due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities. If the pandemic is further prolonged, Sanofi may face delays in its clinical trials due to restrictions imposed on clinical trial sites and/or delays in the initiation and enrollment of patients in its clinical trials and/or disruptions related to regulatory approvals and/or delays in label expansions for existing products. Sanofi may not be able to fully mitigate these delays, which could negatively impact the timing of Sanofi's pipeline development programs and may have a negative impact on its product development and launches and hence, on future product sales, business and results of operations. The global COVID-19 pandemic also exposes Sanofi to a slowdown or temporary suspension in production of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), raw materials and some of its other products. Extension of the restrictive measures put in place in order to control the pandemic may lead to manufacturing delays or disruptions and supply chain interruptions (including to the extent those measures apply to its third-party suppliers) and may have an adverse effect on Sanofi's business (see \"- The manufacture of Sanofi's products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect its operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact its image \" above). Also, a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products could result in short-term unavailability or shortages of raw materials. In addition, it is not certain that Sanofi will successfully develop its vaccine for COVID-19, nor that the vaccine candidate, if approved, would be commercially successful, nor that demand for such a vaccine or product would still exist. Post marketing clinical data and analysis of existing clinical data could also give rise to unexpected safety, quality or manufacturing issues. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sanofi has implemented proactive measures in order to protect its employees, including restricting employee travel and adopting a work-from-home policy. However, the pandemic could continue to pose risks to the health and safety of Sanofi's employees, especially when employees may elect to return to the office in jurisdictions where both local requirements and its own health and safety standards have been met. Meanwhile, remote work could affect the employees engagement vis-\u00e0-vis Sanofi. Finally, Sanofi cannot predict or reasonably estimate the impact of any potential long-term changes to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could precipitate or amplify the other risk factors that Sanofi identifies in this \" Risk Factors \" section, which could adversely affect its business, operations and financial conditions and results. If the pandemic is further prolonged, Sanofi's operations could also be adversely impacted by the work-from-home, lockdown and other restrictions that have been adopted in response to the pandemic. Any of these risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those described elsewhere in this report (see \" Item 3.D. Risk Factors \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F and \"- Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business \" below). - 11 - Sanofi is subject to the risk of non-payment by its customers1 Sanofi runs the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by its customers, which consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among distributors and retailers, as well as by uncertainties around global credit and economic conditions, in particular in emerging markets. As a result, Sanofi may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. The United States poses particular customer credit risk issues because of the concentrated distribution system: Sanofi's three main customers represented respectively 10%, 7% and 6% of its consolidated net sales in 2021. Sanofi is also exposed to large wholesalers in other markets, particularly in Europe. An inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to Sanofi could adversely affect its financial condition (see Note D.34. to Sanofi's consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). In some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these countries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable or the ability to collect 100% of receivables outstanding. Because of this context, Sanofi may need to reassess the recoverable amount of its debts in these countries during future financial years. Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business2 Over the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic growth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, major national economies or emerging markets could negatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect Sanofi's business. For example, unpredictable political conditions that currently exist in various parts of the world, including Eastern Europe, could have a material negative impact on its business. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and difficulties of international transactions. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sources of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerity measures including heightened pressure on drug prices, increased substitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain products from formularies among others (see \"- The pricing and reimbursement of Sanofi's products is increasingly affected by cost containment pressures and decisions of governments and other third parties \" above). Further, Sanofi's net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as high unemployment, increases in cost-sharing, and lack of developed third-party payer systems in certain regions may lead some patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use other treatments to reduce their costs. In the United States there has been a significant increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many US states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including Sanofi's. Also, employers may seek to transfer a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees due to rising costs, which could lead to further downward price pressure and/or lower demand. Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare business could also be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions that limit the financial resources of its customers. If economic conditions worsen, or in the event of default or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers financed by insolvent states, the financial situation of the Group, the profitability and results of its operations and the distribution channels of its products may be adversely affected. See also \" Sanofi is subject to the risk of non-payment by its customers \" above. The increasing use of social media platforms and new technologies present risks and challenges for Sanofi's business and reputation Sanofi increasingly relies on social media, new technologies and digital tools to communicate about its products and about diseases or to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderation of comments. Political and market pressures may be generated by social media because of rapid news cycles. This may result in commercial harm, overly restrictive regulatory actions and erratic share price performance. In addition, unauthorized communications, such as press releases or posts on social media, purported to be issued by Sanofi, may contain information that is false or otherwise damaging and 1 The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Notes B.8.7., D.10. and D.34. to the consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. 2 The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to the consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. - 12 - could have an adverse impact on its image and reputation and on its stock price. Negative or inaccurate posts or comments about Sanofi, its business, directors or officers on any social networking website could seriously damage its reputation. In addition, its employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability for the Group, or which could lead to breaches of data security, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have an adverse effect on Sanofi's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. C. Risks relating to Sanofi's structure and strategy Sanofi may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from its strategic investments or divestments* Sanofi pursues a strategy of selective acquisitions, in-licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce its pipeline and portfolio. Sanofi is also proceeding to selective divestments to focus on key business areas. The implementation of this strategy depends on the Group's ability to identify transaction opportunities, mobilize the appropriate resources in order to enter into agreements in a timely manner and execute these transactions on acceptable economic terms. Moreover, entering into in-licensing or collaboration agreements generally requires the payment of significant \" milestones \" well before the relevant products reach the market, without any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F and \" Sanofi relies on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of its products \" above). For newly acquired activities or businesses Sanofi's growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected synergies could be adversely impacted if, for example: Sanofi is unable to quickly or efficiently integrate those activities or businesses; key employees leave; or Sanofi has higher than anticipated integration costs. For instance, in 2019 Sanofi had to book a \u20ac2.8 billion impairment on Eloctate\u00ae acquired through the Bioverativ acquisition completed in 2018 due to revisions of previous sales projections. As another example, the Translate Bio acquisition referred to above which was completed in 2021 may not generate the expected results in terms of developing new mRNA-based products to meet existing or future needs, and the potential of Translate Bio's mRNA platform may not be realized to its full extent or because of the difficulty of integrating the activity quickly and efficiently into the Group. Sanofi may also miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or may lack the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate such risks properly, including with regard to the potential of research and development pipelines, manufacturing issues, tax or accounting issues, compliance issues, or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of time and be difficult to implement a risk analysis and risk mitigation plan after the acquisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of historical data. Acquired businesses may not always be in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Sanofi standards, including, for example, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), which can be costly and time consuming to remedy. As a result, risk management and coverage of such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove to be insufficient or ill-adapted. With respect to divestments, their financial benefit could be impacted if Sanofi faces significant financial claims or significant post- closing price adjustments. Furthermore, the value of the assets to be divested may deteriorate while Sanofi is in the process of executing its divestment strategy, with the risk that Sanofi does not realize the anticipated benefits. For example, Sanofi announced in February 2020 a plan to create a future leading European company, now named EUROAPI, dedicated to the development, production and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to third parties as well as to Sanofi with a planned IPO on Euronext Paris in the first half of 2022, subject to market conditions and obtaining required market authority approvals. Given that market conditions can be volatile, Sanofi may not be able to realize the anticipated financial benefits of this transaction. Because of the active competition among pharmaceutical groups for business development opportunities, there can be no assurance of the Group's success in completing these transactions when such opportunities are identified. The globalization of the Group's business exposes it to increased risks in specific areas* As part of the presentation of its strategy in December 2019, Sanofi identified its strong presence in China among its core drivers with a revenue amounting to 7.2% of its net sales in 2021. - 13 - Nevertheless, the difficulties in operating in emerging markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate or an unfavorable movement of the exchange rates of currencies against the euro could impair Sanofi's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities and could adversely affect Sanofi's business, results of operations or financial condition. For instance, while it continues to be impossible as of the date of this report to predict the economic impact and the magnitude of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, if a long-lasting epidemic and prolonged or repeated restrictive measures to control the outbreak were to result in an economic slowdown in any of Sanofi's targeted markets, it would reduce its sales due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities, and could significantly impact its business operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict if or how the current health crisis will impact any particular affected jurisdiction, or to what extent. (see also \" Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for Sanofi's business \" and \" The extent to which the COVID- 19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may impact Sanofi's business, operations and financial performance is highly uncertain and difficult to predict \" above). Emerging markets also expose Sanofi to more volatile economic conditions, political instability (including a backlash in certain areas against free trade), competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already well established in these markets, the inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of emerging markets (particularly with respect to their underdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks), difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel or maintaining the necessary internal control systems, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels (particularly with respect to counterfeit products), and compliance issues including corruption and fraud (see particularly \" Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect the Group's business, results of operations and financial condition \" above). Sanofi may fail to develop or take advantage of digitalization* Sanofi has undertaken a number of digital initiatives (such as the opening in October 2019 of its Framingham digitally enabled manufacturing facility in the US, and its Darwin real-world data platform). Sanofi's success in these efforts will depend on many factors, including data quality, technology architecture, entering into successful partnerships and alliances with technology companies, a cultural change among its employees, attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills and mindsets, and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated Sanofi's digital transformation, including in the ways it engages and interacts with its stakeholders. However there is no guarantee that Sanofi's efforts toward a digital transformation will succeed. More generally, Sanofi may fail to capture the benefits of digitalization at an appropriate cost and/or in a timely manner and/or enter into appropriate partnerships. Competitors, including new entrants such as tech companies, may outpace Sanofi in this fast-moving area. If Sanofi fails to adequately integrate digitalization into its organization and business model, Sanofi could lose patients and market share. This could have an adverse impact on its business, prospects and results of operations. Sanofi may fail to accelerate its operational efficiency* As part of its strategy Sanofi has announced its intent to improve its operating efficiencies to fund growth and expand its business operating income margin. Sanofi has also announced savings initiatives to fund investment in its key growth drivers, to accelerate priority pipeline projects and to support the expansion of its BOI margin. Nevertheless there is no guarantee that Sanofi will be able to fully deliver these operating efficiencies within the targeted timeline or generate the expected benefits. Unsuccessful management of environmental, social and governance matters could adversely affect Sanofi's reputation and Sanofi may experience difficulties to meet the expectations of its stakeholders. Companies are increasingly expected to behave in a responsible manner on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, by governmental and regulatory authorities, counterparties such as vendors and suppliers, customers, investors, the public at large and others. This context, driven in part by a rapidly changing regulatory framework, is raising new challenges and influencing strategic decisions that companies must take if they wish to optimize their positive impact and mitigate their negative impact on ESG matters. Sanofi has adopted an ESG strategy that aims at ensuring global access and affordability, addressing unmet needs with transformative therapies, and minimizing the impact of Sanofi's activities and products on the climate and the environment. The strategy includes leveraging its personnel's experience and making societal impact a key driver of Sanofi employees' engagement. However, despite Sanofi's strong commitment Sanofi could be unable to meet its ESG or other strategic objectives in an efficient and timely manner, or at all. - 14 - Sanofi may also be unable to meet the ever more demanding criteria used by rating agencies in their ESG assessments process, leading to a downgrading in Sanofi's rating. Financial investments in companies which perform well in the ESG assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have made known their interest in investing in such companies. Depending on the ESG assessments and on the rapidly changing views on acceptable levels of action across a range of ESG topics from investors, Sanofi may be unable to meet society's or investors' expectations, its reputation may be harmed, it may face increased compliance or other costs and demand for securities issued by Sanofi and Sanofi's ability to participate in the debt and equity markets may decrease. Sanofi's success depends in part on its senior management team and other key employees and its ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals in the face of intense competition Sanofi's success depends on the expertise of its senior management team and other key employees. In 2021, there were 2,346 \" Senior Leaders \" within Sanofi. In addition, Sanofi relies heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help it meet its strategic objectives. Sanofi faces intense competition for qualified individuals for senior management positions, or in specific geographic regions or in specialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices, or digital and artificial intelligence. Sanofi's ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on Sanofi's ability to reward performance, incentivize its employees and to pay competitive compensation. Laws and regulations on executive compensation may restrict Sanofi's ability to attract, motivate and retain the required level of talented people. The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in particular those in leadership positions, may weaken the Group's succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of its strategy and its ability to meet its strategic objectives and could ultimately adversely impact its business or results of operations. D. Environmental and safety risks of Sanofi's industrial activities Risks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect Sanofi's results of operations* Manufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in the Group's products and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste, expose the Group to the risks of industrial accidents that may lead to discharges or releases of toxic or pathogenic substances or other events that, can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination, and may result in additional operational constraints, including the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the imposition of civil, administrative, criminal penalties and/or civil damages. The occurrence of an industrial accident may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and adversely affect Sanofi's operating results and reputation. Although Sanofi maintains property damage, business interruption and casualty insurance that it believes is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to Sanofi's business. Management of the historical contamination related to Sanofi's past industrial activities may have a significant adverse effect on its results of operations The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on Sanofi to manage and/or remediate contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites: that Sanofi currently owns or operates; that it formerly owned or operated; or where waste from its operations was disposed. These environmental remediation obligations could reduce Sanofi's operating results. Sanofi accrues provisions for remediation when its management believes the need is probable and that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. See \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.10. Health, Safety and Environment \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F for additional information regarding its environmental policies. In particular, Sanofi's provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying these provisions prove incorrect or if Sanofi is held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments and estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition. For more detailed information on environmental issues, see \" Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.10 Health, Safety and Environment \" and Notes B.12 and D.19.3 to the consolidated financial statements of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. - 15 - Sanofi is or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. Some current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as \" potentially responsible parties \" or the equivalent under the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as \" Superfund \"), and similar statutes or obligations in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. As a matter of statutory or contractual obligations, Sanofi and/or its subsidiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of its predecessor companies, or of subsidiaries that Sanofi demerged, divested or may divest. Sanofi has disputes outstanding regarding certain sites no longer owned or operated by the Group. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have an adverse effect on its operating results. See Note D.22.d) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F and section \" Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). Environmental regulations are evolving. For example, in Europe, new or evolving regulatory regimes include REACH, CLP/GHS, SEVESO, IPPC/IED, the Waste Framework Directive, the Emission Trading Scheme Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity and several other regulations aimed at preventing climate change. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Group and could subject its handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result in capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting the Group's business, results of operations or financial condition. E. Risks related to financial markets1 Counterparty risk Sanofi's financing and investing transactions, and our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading counterparties. Sanofi sets limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual financial institutions, depending on the rating of each institution. Compliance with these limits, which are based on the notional amounts of the investments and the fair value of the hedging instruments, is monitored on a daily basis. The table below shows our total exposure as of 31 December 2021 by rating and in terms of Sanofi's percentage exposure to the dominant counterparty.

(b) The notional amounts are translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate as of 31 December 2021. (c) Includes interest rate swaps hedging fixed-rate bonds of \u20ac99 million held in a Professional Specialized Investment Fund dedicated to Sanofi, recognized in \"Long- term loans, advances and other non-current receivables\" (see Note D.7. to consolidated financial statements of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). As of 31 December 2021, Sanofi held investments in euro and US dollar denominated money-market mutual funds. Those instruments have low volatility, low sensitivity to interest rate risk, and a very low probability of loss of principal. The depositary banks of the mutual funds, and of Sanofi itself, have a long-term rating of at least A. Realization of counterparty risk could impact Sanofi's liquidity in certain circumstances. 1 The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to the consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18. of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. - 16 - Foreign exchange risk Operating foreign exchange risk A substantial portion of Sanofi's net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is Sanofi's reporting currency, is not the functional currency. In 2021, for example, 38.1% of its net sales were generated in the United States; 25.8% in Europe; and 36.1% in the Rest of the World region (as defined in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F), including countries that are, or may in the future become, subject to exchange controls, of which 7.2% was generated in China and 4.4% in Japan. Although Sanofi also incurs expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is not enough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on its net sales. Consequently, Sanofi's operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. Sanofi operates a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of operating income to exchange rate movements. That policy involves regular assessments of Sanofi's worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Those transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements, Sanofi contracts hedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also foreign exchange swaps. The table below shows operating currency hedging instruments in place as of 31 December 2021, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F for the accounting classification of those instruments as of 31 December 2021). Operating foreign exchange derivatives as of 31 December 2021 (\u20ac million) Notional amount Fair value Forward currency sales 3,912 4 of which US dollar 1,392 5 of which Chinese yuan renminbi 665 (2) of which Singapore dollar 355 (1) of which Japanese yen 199 3 of which Mexican peso 122 (1) Forward currency purchases 2,374 6 of which US dollar 833 (2) of which Singapore dollar 696 7 of which Chinese yuan renminbi 255 \u2014 of which Russian rouble 77 \u2014 of which Japanese yen 72 (1) Total 6,286 10 The above positions mainly hedge future material foreign-currency cash flows arising after the end of the reporting period in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended 31 December 2021 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losses on hedging instruments (forward contracts) are calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the commercial foreign exchange profit or loss on these items (hedging instruments and hedged transactions) will be immaterial in 2022. Financial foreign exchange risk The cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone, and some of Sanofi's financing activities, expose certain Sanofi entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e. the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). That foreign exchange exposure is hedged using derivative instruments (foreign exchange swaps, forward contracts or currency swaps) that alter the currency split of Sanofi's net debt once those instruments are taken into account. The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of 31 December 2021, with the notional amounts translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see also Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2021). - 17 - Financial foreign exchange derivatives as of 31 December 2021 (\u20ac million) Notional amount Fair value Expiry Forward currency sales 7,655 15 of which US dollar 5,384 (a) 23 2022 of which Hungarian forint 756 (b) 4 2022 of which Brazilian real 95 (c) (3) 2022 Forward currency purchases 9,293 197 of which US dollar 4,816 (d) 128 2022 of which Singapore dollar 2,910 (f) 75 2022 of which Hungarian forint 865 (5) 2022 Total 16,948 212 (a) Includes forward sales with a notional amount of $3,615 million expiring in 2022, designated as a hedge of Sanofi's net investment in Bioverativ. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of these forward contracts represented an asset of \u20ac20 million; the opposite entry was recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\", with the impact on financial income and expense being immaterial. (b) Includes forward sales with a notional amount of HUF 279 billion expiring in 2022, designated as a hedge of Sanofi's net investment in Chinoin. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of these forward contracts represented an asset of \u20ac2 million; the opposite entry was recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\", with the impact on financial income and expense being immaterial. (c) Includes forward sales with a notional amount of BRL 600 million expiring in 2022, designated as a hedge of Sanofi's net investment in Medley Farmaceutica. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of these forward contracts represented a liability of \u20ac3 million; the opposite entry was recognized in \"Other comprehensive income\", with the impact on financial income and expense being immaterial. (d) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of $550 million expiring in 2022, designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of $550 million of bond issues to fluctuations in the EUR/USD spot rate. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of the contracts was an asset of \u20ac19 million, the opposite entry for \u20ac0.1 million of which was credited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under cost of hedging accounting treatment. (e) Includes currency swaps with a notional amount of $1,000 million receive 0.22% pay EUR -0.63% expiring in 2022, designated as a cash flow hedge of $1,000 million of bond issues. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of the swaps was an asset of \u20ac23 million. (f) Includes forward purchases with a notional amount of SGD1,000 million expiring in 2022, designated as a fair value hedge of the exposure of an equivalent amount of intragroup current accounts to fluctuations in the EUR/SGD spot rate. As of 31 December 2021, the fair value of the contracts was an asset of \u20ac20 million, the opposite entry for \u20ac1.5 million of which was debited to \"Other comprehensive income\" under cost of hedging accounting treatment. These hedging instruments generate a net financial gain or loss arising from the interest rate differential between the hedged currency and the euro, given that the foreign exchange gain or loss on the foreign-currency borrowing and loans is offset by the change in the intrinsic value of the hedging instruments. The interest rate differential is recognized within cost of net debt (see Note D.29. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). Sanofi may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows. Other foreign exchange risks A significant proportion of Sanofi's net assets is denominated in US dollars (see Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). As a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of Sanofi's equity as expressed in euros. In addition, Sanofi uses the euro as its reporting currency. Consequently, if one or more European Union Member States were to abandon the euro as a currency, the resulting economic upheavals - in particular, fluctuations in exchange rates - could have a significant impact on the terms under which Sanofi can obtain financing and on its financial results, the extent and consequences of which are not currently foreseeable. Liquidity risk Sanofi operates a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of its subsidiaries are invested with or funded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages its current and projected financing, and ensures that Sanofi is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and confirmed credit facilities for the size of its operations and the maturity of its debt (see Notes D.17.1.c and D.17.1.g to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). - 18 - Sanofi diversify our short-term investments with leading counterparties using money-market products with instant access or with a maturity of less than three months. As of 31 December 2021, cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac10,098 million, and short-term investments predominantly comprised: - collective investments in euro and US dollar denominated money-market mutual funds. All such funds can be traded on a daily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds; - amounts invested directly with banks and non-financial institutions in the form of instant access deposits, term deposits, and Negotiable European Commercial Paper with a maturity of no more than three months. In addition, to optimize the liquidity/return profile of Sanofi's short-term investments, Sanofi had \u20ac198 million invested in term deposits as of 31 December 2021, expiring in December 2021 and presented within \"Other current financial assets\" (see Note D.11. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F). As of 31 December 2021 Sanofi also had \u20ac8 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, half of which expires in December 2022 and half in December 2026. Those credit facilities are not subject to financial covenant ratios. Sanofi's policy is to diversify its sources of funding through public or private issuances of debt securities, in the United States (shelf registration statement) and Europe (Euro Medium Term Note program). In addition, its A-1+/P-1 short-term rating gives Sanofi access to commercial paper programs in the United States, and to Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. The average maturity of Sanofi's total debt was 5.05 years as of 31 December 2021, compared with 5.5 years as of 31 December 31, 2020. During 2021, Sanofi did not draw down on our Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. Average drawdowns under the US commercial paper program during 2021 were \u20ac2.0 billion (with a maximum of \u20ac3.6 billion); the average maturity of those drawdowns was two months. As of 31 December 2021, neither of those programs was being utilized. In the event of a liquidity crisis, Sanofi could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding including the above-mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage Sanofi's capacity to refinance its debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms. Interest rate risk Sanofi issues debt in two currencies, the euro and the US dollar, and also invests its cash and cash equivalents in those currencies. Sanofi also operates cash pooling arrangements to manage the surplus cash and short-term liquidity needs of foreign subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. To optimize the cost of debt or reduce the volatility of debt and manage its exposure to financial foreign exchange risk, Sanofi uses derivative instruments (interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts) that alter the fixed/floating rate split and the currency split of its net debt. The projected full-year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of Sanofi's debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 2022 is as follows: Change in short-term interest rates Impact on pre-tax net income (\u20ac million) Impact on pre-tax income/(expense) recognized directly +100 bp 74 - +25 bp 19 - -25 bp (19) - -100 bp (74) - Stock market risk It is Sanofi's policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes. During 2019, Sanofi contracted derivative instruments (collars) on 593,712 shares of Dexcom Inc; the collars were designated as fair value hedges of the Dexcom shares. As of 31 December 2021 they had a negative fair value of \u20ac16 million, recognized in full in \"Other comprehensive income\". - 19 - F. Risks relating to an investment in Sanofi's shares or ADSs Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the US dollar value of our ADSs and dividends (if any) Holders of ADSs face exchange rate risk. Sanofi's ADSs trade in US dollars and its shares trade in euros. The value of the ADSs and its shares could fluctuate as the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate. If and when Sanofi pays dividends, they would be denominated in euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will affect the US dollar amounts received by owners of ADSs upon conversion by the depositary of cash dividends, if any. Moreover, these fluctuations may affect the US dollar price of the ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) whether or not Sanofi pays dividends, in addition to any amounts that a holder would receive upon its liquidation or in the event of a sale of assets, merger, tender offer or similar transaction denominated in euros or any foreign currency other than US dollars. Persons holding ADSs rather than shares may have difficulty exercising certain rights as a shareholder Holders of ADSs may have more difficulty exercising their rights as a shareholder than if they directly held shares. For example, if Sanofi issues new shares and existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for a pro rata portion of the new issuance, the depositary is allowed, at its own discretion, to sell this right to subscribe for new shares for the benefit of the ADS holders instead of making that right available to such holders. In that case, ADS holders could be substantially diluted. Holders of ADSs must also instruct the depositary how to vote their shares. Because of this additional procedural step involving the depositary, the process for exercising voting rights will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of shares. ADSs for which the depositary does not receive timely voting instructions will not be voted at any meeting. US investors may have difficulty in serving process or enforcing a judgment against Sanofi or its directors or executive officers. Sales of Sanofi's shares may cause the market price of its shares or ADSs to decline. Sales of large numbers of Sanofi's shares, or a perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price for its shares and ADSs. To Sanofi's knowledge, L'Or\u00e9al, its largest shareholder, is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the sale of the shares it holds in the Company. L'Or\u00e9al does not consider its stake in the Company as strategic. Sanofi's largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of the share capital and voting rights of Sanofi As of 31 December 2021, L'Or\u00e9al held approximately 9.36% of the issued share capital, accounting for approximately 16.78% of the voting rights (excluding treasury shares) of Sanofi. See \" Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions - A. Major Shareholders \" of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F (as defined below). Affiliates of L'Or\u00e9al currently serve on Sanofi's Board of Directors. To the extent L'Or\u00e9al continues to hold a large percentage of its share capital and voting rights, it will remain in a position to exert greater influence in the appointment of the directors and officers of Sanofi and in other corporate actions that require shareholders' approval. - 20 - Risks related to the Notes Factors which the Issuer believes are specific to the Notes and material for an informed investment decision with respect to investing in the Notes are described below. In each category below, the Issuer sets out the material risks in descending order of importance, taking into account the adverse impact of such risks and the probability of their occurrence. Risks for the Noteholders as creditors of the Issuer Credit risk An investment in the Notes involves a credit risk on the Issuer. Since the Notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, benefiting from no direct recourse to any assets or guarantees as contemplated in Condition 2 (Status and Negative Pledge ), the Noteholders can only rely on the ability of the Issuer to pay any amount due under the Notes. The value of the Notes will depend on the creditworthiness of the Issuer (as may be impacted by the risks related to the Issuer as described above). As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer's long-term credit rating is (i) A1, with a stable outlook, by Moody's France SAS (\" Moody's \"), (ii) AA, with a stable outlook, by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (\" S&P \") and (iii) AA, with a positive outlook, by Scope Ratings GmbH (\" Scope \"). If the creditworthiness of the Issuer deteriorates, the potential impact on the Noteholders could be significant: a deterioration in creditworthiness could give rise to negative repercussions on the Noteholders because: (i) the Issuer may not be able to fulfil all or part of its payment obligations under the Notes, (ii) the value of the Notes may decrease and (iii) investors may lose all or part of their investment in the Notes. French insolvency law The Issuer is a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme with its corporate seat in France. In the event that the Issuer becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings will be generally governed by the insolvency laws of France to the extent that, where applicable, the \"centre of main interests\" (as construed under Regulation (EU) 2015/848, as amended) of the Issuer is located in France. The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 has been transposed into French law by the Ordonnance 2021-1193 dated 15 September 2021. Such ordonnance, applicable to proceedings opened as from 1 October 2021, amends French insolvency laws notably with regard to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under safeguard, accelerated safeguard and reorganization proceedings. According to this ordonnance, \"affected parties\" (including notably creditors, and therefore the Noteholders) may be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria for the purpose of adopting a restructuring plan. Classes shall be formed in such a way that each class comprises claims or interests with rights that reflect a sufficient commonality of economic interest based on objective and ascertainable criteria. Noteholders will no longer deliberate on the proposed restructuring plan(s) in a separate assembly, meaning that they will no longer benefit from a specific veto power on the proposed plan(s). Instead, as any other affected parties, the Noteholders will be grouped into classes of affected parties (with potentially other creditors) and their dissenting vote may possibly be overridden through the positive vote of the class(s) to which they belong or by a cross-class cram down sanctioned by the court. Although likely that Noteholders would be grouped within the same class for the purpose of proceedings affecting the Issuer, it cannot entirely be ruled out that Noteholders would be grouped into different classes based on objective and ascertainable criteria that would then prevail. The commencement of insolvency proceedings against the Issuer would have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Notes. As a consequence, any decisions taken by a class of affected parties could negatively and significantly impact the Noteholders and cause them to lose all or part of their investment, should they not be able to recover all or part of the amounts due to them from the Issuer. - 21 - Risks related to the market generally Risks related to the secondary market Application has been made to Euronext Paris for the Notes to be listed and admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. Nevertheless, the Notes may have no established trading market when issued. An active trading market for the Notes may not develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. This may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the Notes and result in low trading volumes. The degree of liquidity of the Notes may negatively impact the price at which an investor can dispose of the Notes where the investor is seeking to achieve a sale within a short timeframe. In such circumstances, the impact of this risk on the Noteholder would be high because the Notes would likely have to be resold at a discount to the nominal value of the Notes. Furthermore, if additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. The Issuer is entitled to buy the Notes, as described in Condition 4(d) ( Purchases ), and the Issuer may issue further notes, as described in Condition 11 ( Further Issues ). Such transactions may adversely affect the price development of the Notes. Market value of the Notes The market value of the Notes may be affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and a number of additional factors, including, but not limited to, market interest and yield rates and the time remaining to the Maturity Date. Notes may be used by market participants to constitute reference assets under transactions which are independent from the Notes; the unwinding or other life cycle events of such transactions or of related collateral composed of or including the Notes may, depending on the circumstances, impact the volume of the Notes then traded and in turn the market value of the Notes and/or the volatility thereof. In addition, if the creditworthiness of the Issuer deteriorates or for whatever reason the financial condition of the Issuer deteriorates, it may not be able to fulfil all or part of its payment obligations under the Notes, and the value of the Notes may decrease and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Application has been made to Euronext Paris for the Notes to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris as from the Issue Date. The value of the Notes depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political events in France or elsewhere, and factors affecting capital markets in general, including Euronext Paris. The price at which a Noteholder will be able to sell the Notes prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price paid by such purchaser. Interest rate risks Each Note will bear interest on its principal amount, from (and including) the Issue Date, at the rate of 0.875 per cent. per annum payable annually in arrear on 6 April in each year in accordance with Condition 3 (Interest ) of the Notes. Investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Notes. While the nominal interest rate of a fixed interest rate note is fixed during the life of such a note or during a certain period of time, the current interest rate on the capital market (market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis. As the market interest rate changes, the price of such note changes in the opposite direction. If the market interest rate increases, the price of such note typically falls, until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the market interest rate. If the market interest rate decreases, the price of a fixed rate note typically increases, until the yield of such note is approximately equal to the market interest rate. Noteholders should be aware that movements of the market interest rate can adversely affect the price of the Notes and could cause Noteholders to lose part of the capital invested if they decide to sell Notes during a period in which the market interest rate exceeds the fixed rate of the Notes. Any such volatility may have a significant adverse effect on the price of the Notes and cause Noteholders who sell Notes on the secondary market to lose part of their initial investment. - 22 - Exchange rate risks and exchange controls The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in Euro. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the \"Investor's Currency \") other than Euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may change significantly (including changes due to devaluation of Euro or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the Euro could significantly decrease (i) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (iii) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes, all of which could have an adverse effect on the return on the investment of the investors. Furthermore, government and monetary or financial authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. If such risk were to materialise, the Noteholders whose financial activities are carried out or dependent principally in a currency or currency unit other than the relevant Specified Currency could be very negatively impacted as they might receive less interest or principal than expected or, at worst, no interest or principal. Risks relating to the other terms of the Notes The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity In the event that the Issuer would be obliged to pay additional amounts payable in respect of any Notes due to any withholding as provided in Condition 4(b) ( Redemption for Taxation Reasons ), the Issuer may redeem all (but not some only) of the outstanding Notes in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. In addition, the Issuer has the option to redeem (a) at par all (but not some only) of the Notes outstanding from and including the date falling one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date to but excluding the Maturity Date, as provided in Condition 4(c)(i) ( Residual Maturity Call Option ), (b) at par all (but not some only) remaining Notes in the event that twenty-five (25) per cent. or less of the aggregate nominal amount original issued of the Notes remain outstanding, as provided in Condition 4(c)(ii) ( Clean-up Call Option ) and (c) in whole or in part the Notes at any time prior to the date falling one (1) month prior to the Maturity Date at the Make-whole Redemption Amount, as provided in Condition 4(c)(iii) ( Make-whole Redemption Option ). During a period when the Issuer may elect to redeem Notes, such Notes may feature a market value not above the price at which they can be redeemed. If the market interest rate decreases, the risk to Noteholders that the Issuer will exercise its right of early redemption increases. As a consequence, the yield received upon such early redemption may be lower than expected, and the redeemed face amount of the Notes may be lower than the purchase price paid for such Notes by the Noteholder. As a consequence, part of the capital invested by the Noteholder may be lost, so that the Noteholder in such case would not receive the total amount of the capital invested. In addition, investors who choose to reinvest monies they receive through an early redemption may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than such redeemed Notes. In particular, with respect to the redemption at the option of the Issuer when only twenty-five (25) per cent. or less of the principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding (Condition 4(c)(ii) ( Clean-up Call Option )), there is no obligation on the Issuer to inform investors if and when the twenty-five (25) per cent. threshold referred to therein has been reached or is about to be reached. The Issuer's right to redeem will exist notwithstanding that immediately prior to the publication of a notice in respect of the redemption at the option of the Issuer the Notes under Condition 4(c)(ii) (Clean-up Call Option ), the Notes may have been trading significantly above par, thus potentially resulting in a loss of capital invested. All of the above may reduce the profits Noteholders may have expected in subscribing the Notes and could have a materially adverse impact on the Noteholders. - 23 - Partial redemption of the Notes at the option of the Issuer may make the market illiquid. Depending on the number of Notes in respect of which a partial redemption of the Notes at the option of the Issuer is made pursuant to Condition 4(c)(iii) ( Make-whole Redemption Option ), any trading market in respect of those Notes in respect of which such option is not exercised may become illiquid which, depending on the extent of the illiquidity, may negatively impact the market value of the Notes and have a materially adverse impact on any remaining Noteholders seeking to dispose of their Notes. Changes of law may occur in the future that will impact the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. The Terms and Conditions of the Notes are based on and governed by the laws of France in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. Future judicial decisions or changes to the laws of France or administrative practice (or to the interpretation thereof) after the date of this Prospectus may impact the Notes. Any such decision or change could be unfavourable to creditors' rights, including those of the Noteholders. If any change in law were unfavourable to the Issuer or the Noteholders, it could (depending on the nature of the change) have a materially adverse impact on the market value of the Notes. Modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes Condition 8 (Representation of the Noteholders ) contains provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters affecting their interests generally. The Noteholders will be automatically grouped for the defence of their common interests in a Masse , as defined in Condition 8 ( Representation of the Noteholders ). Noteholders can adopt measures either through a general meeting (the \" General Meetings \") or by consent following a written consultation (the \" Written Resolutions \"). These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote or were not represented at the relevant General Meeting or did not consent to a Written Resolution. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Noteholders through a General Meeting or by way of a Written Resolution and the related modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Noteholders, this may have a material adverse impact on the market value of the Notes. - 24 - IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are complex financial instruments that may not be a suitable investment for all investors Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should: (i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement; (ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; (iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency; (iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and (v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic, monetary, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks. Credit ratings may not reflect all risks The Notes are expected to be rated A1 by Moody's, AA by S&P and AA by Scope. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised, suspended or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time and without notice. Any such revision suspension or withdrawal of any such credit rating could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. In general, European regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the EU CRA Regulation or (1) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the EU CRA Regulation or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA which is certified under the EU CRA Regulation. In general, UK regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not issued by a credit rating agency established in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation or (1) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the UK but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the UK and registered under the UK CRA Regulation or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the UK which is certified under the UK CRA Regulation. Taxation Potential purchasers and sellers of the Notes should be aware that they may be required to pay taxes or other documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the country where the Notes are transferred or other jurisdictions, including the Issuer's jurisdictions of incorporation, which may have an impact on the income received from the Notes. In some jurisdictions, no official statements of the tax authorities or court decisions may be available for innovative financial instruments such as the Notes. Potential investors are advised to ask for their own tax adviser's advice on their individual taxation with respect to the acquisition, sale and redemption of the Notes. Only these advisers are in a position to duly consider the specific situation of the potential investor. - 25 - Moreover, in certain circumstances Noteholders may be subject to U.S. withholding tax. The United States has enacted rules, commonly referred to as \" FATCA \", that generally impose a new reporting and withholding regime with respect to certain payments made by U.S. and non-U.S. withholding agents, particularly entities that are classified as financial institutions under FATCA. The United States has also entered into an intergovernmental agreement regarding the implementation of FATCA with France (the \" IGA \"). Sanofi does not expect payments made on or with respect to the Notes to be subject to withholding under FATCA. However, significant aspects of when and how FATCA will apply remain unclear, and no assurance can be given that withholding under FATCA will not become relevant with respect to payments made on or with respect to the Notes in the future. In the event that any withholding imposed because of FATCA, the Issuer will have no obligation to make additional payments in respect of such withholding.

Notes due 6 April 2025 (the \" Notes \") of Sanofi (the \" Issuer \") has been authorised by resolution of the Board of Directors ( Conseil d'administration ) of the Issuer dated 3 February 2022 and a decision of the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer ( Vice-Pr\u00e9sident Ex\u00e9cutif , Directeur Financier ) of the Issuer dated 30 March 2022. The Issuer has entered into an agency agreement (as may be amended or replaced from time to time, the \" Agency Agreement \") dated 6 April 2022 with BNP Paribas Securities Services, as fiscal agent and paying agent and has appointed Aether Financial Services as make-whole calculation agent. The fiscal agent, the paying agent, any other paying agents appointed by the Issuer from time to time, and the make-whole calculation agent for the time being are referred to in these Conditions as the \"Fiscal Agent \" and \"Paying Agent \" and the \" Make-whole Calculation Agent \", each of which expression shall include their successors from time to time, and are collectively referred to as the \" Agents \". A copy of the Agency Agreement is available for inspection at the specified offices of the Fiscal Agent. References below to \" Conditions \" are, unless the context otherwise requires, to the numbered paragraphs below. 1 Form, Denomination and Title The Notes are issued on 6 April 2022 (the \" Issue Date \") in dematerialised bearer ( au porteur ) form in the denomination of \u20ac100,000 each. Title to the Notes will be evidenced by book-entries ( inscription en compte ) in accordance with Articles L.211-3 et seq and R. 211-1 et seq. of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier in the books of the Account Holders. No physical document of title (including certificats repr\u00e9sentatifs pursuant to Article R.211-7 of the French Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ) will be issued in respect of the Notes. The Notes will, upon issue, be inscribed in the books of Euroclear France, which shall credit the accounts of the Account Holders. For the purpose of these Conditions, \" Account Holder \" shall mean any authorised intermediary institution entitled to hold accounts, directly or indirectly, with Euroclear France, and includes Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\" Euroclear \") and the depositary bank for Clearstream Banking, SA (\" Clearstream \"). Title to the Notes shall be evidenced by entries in the books of Account Holders and will pass upon, and transfer of Notes may only be effected through, registration of the transfer in such books, and only in the denomination of \u20ac100,000. 2 Status and Negative Pledge (a) Status of the Notes The Notes (subject to Condition 2(b) ( Negative Pledge )) constitute direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu without any preference or priority among themselves and equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer other than obligations as may be preferred by mandatory provisions of applicable law. (b) Negative Pledge So long as any of the Notes remains outstanding, the Issuer shall not create or permit to subsist any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien (other than any lien arising by operation of law) or other encumbrance or security interest over any or all of its present or future assets or revenues (i) to secure any Relevant Indebtedness issued by it or (ii) to secure any guarantee or indemnity given by it of any Relevant Indebtedness issued by others without (a) at the same time or prior thereto securing the Notes equally and rateably therewith or (b) providing such other security for the Notes as may be approved pursuant to Condition 8 (Representation of the Noteholders ) by the Masse (as defined in Condition 8 ( Representation of the Noteholders )). - 30 - \"Relevant Indebtedness \" means any payment obligation being borrowed money and subsisting under, or represented by any bonds, debentures or other form of debt securities capable of being listed, quoted or ordinarily dealt in on any stock exchange, over-the-counter market or securities market. 3 Interest (a) Rate of Interest The Notes bear interest on their outstanding aggregate principal amount from and including 6 April 2022 (the \" Interest Commencement Date \") at the rate of 0.875 per cent. per annum (the \" Rate of Interest \"), payable annually in arrear on 6 April in each year (each an \" Interest Payment Date \"), commencing on 6 April 2023. The period commencing on and including the Interest Commencement Date and ending on but excluding the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period commencing on and including an Interest Payment Date and ending on but excluding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date is called an \"Interest Period \". (b) Interest ceasing to accrue The Notes will cease to bear interest from the date provided for their redemption, unless payment of the full amount due in respect of the Notes is improperly withheld or refused on such date.

In addition, if the Issuer would on the occasion of the next payment due under the Notes be prevented by French law from making payment to the Noteholders of the full amount then due and payable, notwithstanding the undertaking to pay additional amounts contained above, then the Issuer shall forthwith give notice of such fact to the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer shall forthwith redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes then outstanding, upon giving not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days' irrevocable notice to the Noteholders, provided that the due date for redemption of which notice hereunder shall be given, shall be the latest practicable date on which the Issuer could make payment without withholding for French taxes, or if such date has passed, as soon as practicable thereafter.

In the case of a partial redemption, the redemption may be effected by reducing the principal amount of all such Notes in proportion to the aggregate principal amount redeemed, subject to compliance with applicable laws and the rules of Euronext Paris, and for the avoidance of doubt, the applicable Make-whole Redemption Amount (together with any interest accrued to (but excluding) the relevant Make-whole Redemption Date) shall be reduced accordingly. So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Paris and the rules of that stock exchange so require, the Issuer shall, each year in which there has been a partial redemption of the Notes, cause to be published in accordance with Articles 221-3 and 221-4 of the General Regulations (R\u00e8glement G\u00e9n\u00e9ral ) of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers , a notice specifying the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding.

Its net sales were \u20ac36,041 million in 2020 and \u20ac37,761 million in 2021. Sanofi is a holding company and as a result its financial and trading position depends on the financial and trading position of its principal subsidiaries. Sanofi operates under the laws of France. Sanofi is the parent company of a consolidated group of almost 290 companies. A list of its principal subsidiaries can be found in Note F to its consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of the 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F incorporated by reference herein.

Cardiovascular and Established Prescription Products; Consumer Healthcare; and Vaccines. Unlike Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare activities, which are operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8, Pharmaceutical activities are franchises whose performance is monitored primarily on the basis of net sales; the products sold by each of those franchises are included in Sanofi's Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
