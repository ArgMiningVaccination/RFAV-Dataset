Vitamin A deficiency adversely impairs testosterone production and muscle building. Vitamin Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol): 250 mcg/10000 IU Vitamin D plays a critical role in regulating hormones, muscle & bone density, blood sugar immunity, and heart health. Men with sufficient levels have significantly higher levels of testosterone. Vitamin K2/MK-4 (Menaquinone-4): 1000mcg Vitamin K2/MK-4 (Menaquinone-4): 1000mcg Vitamin K is synergistic with Vitamin D and makes sure calcium goes to the right places (your bones instead of your arteries), and lab studies show it stimulates testosterone synthesis. Vitamin E tocotrienols (\"DeltaGOLD\u00ae\" 10% gamma-tocotrienol): 50 mg Tocotrienols are a special form of Vitamin E that are much more potent antioxidants than the more common tocopherols. They have synergistic effects with LH-increasing medications like enclomiphene in stimulating testosterone. B-Vitamins: Vitamin B1 (as Thiamin Mononitrate): 5 mg Vitamin B1 (as Thiamin Mononitrate): 5 mg B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and steroid activity. Vitamin B2 (as Riboflavin): 5 mg Vitamin B2 (as Riboflavin): 5 mg B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and steroid activity. Niacin (as Nicotinamide): 50 mg Niacin (as Nicotinamide): 50 mg B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and steroid activity. Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate, or P5P): 5 mg Vitamin B6 (as Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate, or P5P): 5 mg B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and steroid activity. DFE B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and steroid activity. Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin): 100 mcg Vitamin B12 (as Methylcobalamin): 100 mcg B vitamins play an important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. They are responsible for much more than energy production, including: DNA synthesis and repair, immunity, and in Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, which most individuals recognize as an energy source for cellular reactions. ATP is important for steroid production. Ensuring your body has the resources necessary to generate energy is therefore foundational to hormone optimization. The form of magnesium used in Building Blocks, magnesium N-acetyltaurinate, has been shown to absorb rapidly and achieve higher tissue concentration. Zinc (Bisglycinate Chelate): 40mg Zinc (Bisglycinate Chelate): 40mg Zinc men has shown to bolster testosterone levels. Beyond testosterone and reproductive health, zinc is vital to gastrointestinal, neural, immunal, and most physiological systems Chelate): 2mg Copper (Bisglycinate Chelate): 2mg Studies in men (as well as animals) have shown that copper is beneficial to semen and sperm. Copper is involved in mitochondrial function and metabolism. Mitochondria (organelles involved in energy production) in the cells gather copper for copper-dependent enzymes required for efficient energy production (oxidative Multis Created by The Top Doctors in Men's Health COWARD, MD [Maximus Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuDHtwcwEpQ&t) BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION AND HORMONE OPTIMIZATION.

Can I take Building Blocks with other supplements? The Building Blocks supplement approaches the upper-tolerable limit for some vitamins, like vitamin A. As such it is generally recommended not to overlap Building Blocks with other supplements providing the same ingredients. (This means you save money!) Your Maximus doctor will review your current medications and supplements for you. Can anyone take Building Blocks? The Building Blocks supplement should not be taken with blood thinners/anticoagulants like Coumadin, Jantoven, and Warfarin. Your Maximus doctor will review your current medications and supplements for you. Always disclose any changes to your medications or supplements. Do not hesitate to contact your doctor via Elation Passport with questions. Where can I buy Building Blocks? Currently the Maximus Building Blocks supplement is only available with a subscription to Maximus Protocols. As a benefit to subscribers, it is made available at a discounted rate when included in your subscription. Why do some ingredients in Building Blocks exceed the Recommended Daily Values (RDV)? Many RDV values are set based on the absolute bare minimum amount of a vitamin or mineral for survival, not necessarily health optimization. Why does Building Blocks include 10,000 IU of Vitamin D3? Internal testing found that 66% of Maximus customers in Los Angeles were deficient and 100% were sub-optimal. 10,000 IU ensures nearly everyone gets the optimal range, and is in within the upper tolerable limit so toxicity is unlikely.
