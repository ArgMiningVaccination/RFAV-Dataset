RTS,S is the [first malaria vaccine recommended](/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk) for use to prevent malaria in children in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission. Implementation of the malaria vaccine through pilot introductions in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi has resulted in substantial reduction in deadly severe malaria and a drop in child deaths. The first malaria vaccine is safe and effective, and, when implemented broadly, the vaccine could save tens of thousands of lives each year. The WHO recommendation for the malaria vaccine was informed by results from the ongoing Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme, MVIP, coordinated by WHO. The pilot introductions have reached nearly 1.7 million children with at least one dose of vaccine since 2019 and more than 4.5 million doses of the vaccine have been administered through the countries' routine immunization programmes. Community demand for the vaccine is high and the vaccine is well accepted in African communities, even when additional visits to vaccination clinics are required to receive the 4-dose schedule. Malaria vaccine introduction is led by Ministries of Health in areas of the 3 participating countries, with support from WHO and international and country-level partners, including PATH, GSK and UNICEF. The RTS,S vaccine was prequalified by WHO in July 2022. In October 2021, on the advice of two WHO global advisory bodies, one for immunization and the other for malaria, the Organization made this recommendation. WHO recommends the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine be used for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in regions with moderate to high transmission as defined by WHO. WHO recommendations for the first malaria vaccine are provided in the [Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper - March 2022](/publications-detail-redirect/who-wer9709-61%E2%80%9380) and [WHO Guidelines for malaria](/publications-detail-redirect/guidelines-for-malaria). Malaria vaccine introduction should be considered in the context of comprehensive national malaria control plans. Demand for the vaccine is unprecedented: at least 28 countries in Africa have expressed interest in deploying the vaccine as part of their national malaria control strategies. [Gavi has invested](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-board-approves-funding-support-malaria-vaccine-roll-out-sub-saharan-africa) an initial nearly US$ 160 million (2022-2025) in a malaria vaccine programme to support broader vaccine roll-out in endemic countries. In July 2023, WHO, Gavi and UNICEF together announced that 18 million doses of available malaria vaccine will be allocated to 12 African countries approved for Gavi support in 2023-2025. The doses will maintain vaccination in the pilot areas of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi for the longer-term. The allocated supply will also be delivered sub-nationally in Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda in areas of greatest need (that is, where the risk of malaria illness are death among children are highest). These countries will introduce the malaria vaccine beginning in early 2024. The vaccine allocations were determined through the application of the principles of the [Framework](/publications/m/item/framework-for-allocation-of-limited-malaria-vaccine-supply) for the allocation of limited malaria vaccine supply, which was developed with expert advice to guide where limited doses would be allocated, until supply fully meets demand. (See more in [First malaria vaccine supply allocations: explanation of process and outcomes](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/mvip/first_malaria_vaccine_allocation_explained_may2023.pdf?sfvrsn=248c4624_4).) This first allocation makes use of all the currently available supply. Additional countries will be able to introduce the malaria vaccine after more supply becomes available.WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and other partners are working to increase supply as rapidly as possible to protect more vulnerable children and save more lives. Despite considerable impact in reducing malaria illness and deaths with the scale up of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), deployment of chemoprevention approaches, and the adoption of highly effective treatment, progress has stalled, and malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. According to WHO's latest data (World Malaria Report 2022) nearly half a million African children under the age of 5 died from malaria in 2021. The African Region continues to bear the heaviest malaria burden: approximately 95% of malaria cases and deaths. If implemented broadly, the malaria vaccine could save tens of thousands of lives each year. The WHO-coordinated Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) was designed to evaluate the public health use of the RTS,S vaccine, including whether caregivers would bring their children to clinics for the 4-dose regimen and the vaccine's impact on reducing childhood illness and death from malaria. The pilot implementations were launched in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in 2019. Four years on, nearly 1.7 million children at risk have been reached with the malaria vaccine across the 3 countries in Africa and more than 4.5 million doses of RTS,S have been administered in pilot areas of moderate to high malaria transmission. During the first 24 months of vaccination, the pilots showed that the malaria vaccine is safe and effective and has resulted in a substantial reduction in deadly severe malaria, a decrease in hospitalizations, and a drop in child deaths. The malaria vaccine is saving lives. Nearly 1.7 million children have been reached with the malaria vaccine through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) pilots and are benefitting from this malaria prevention. The resilience and capacities of the national immunization programmes to effectively deliver RTS,S (even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic) have resulted in substantial reduction in severe malaria and a drop in all-cause child deaths. The WHO recommendation has helped to unlock considerable global health investment in the broader deployment of the first malaria vaccine, including vaccine [roll-out support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-opens-applications-malaria-vaccine-rollout-support#:~:text=The%20opening%20of%20the%20application,for%20the%202022%E2%80%932025%20period.) (initial investment of nearly US$ 160 million from 2022-2025). Soon many more children at risk will benefit from this vaccine that improves child survival and strengthens malaria control, with some additional countries to begin introducing the vaccine to children at high risk of dying from malaria in 2024. The pilots will continue in the 3 pilot countries through 2023 to understand the added value of the 4th vaccine dose, and to measure the longer-term impact on child deaths. Ministries of Health of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi are delivering the vaccine in the pilot areas through each country's routine immunization programmes and will continue to do so. The pilot programme is coordinated by WHO and supported by in-country and international partners, including PATH, UNICEF, and GSK, which is donating up to 10 million doses of the vaccine for the pilot and pilot areas. Financing for the pilot programme has been mobilized through an unprecedented collaboration among three key global health funding bodies: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid. The RTS,S malaria vaccine is the result of 30 years of research and development by GSK and through a partnership with PATH, with support from a network of African research centres. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided catalytic funding for late-stage development of RTS,S between 2001 and 2015. A second malaria vaccine is under review by WHO - R21/Matrix-M (R21) - which, if recommended for use, could help close the sizable gap between supply and demand and further reduce child illness and death from malaria. A working group of WHO expert advisors (the SAGE and MPAG Working Group) is reviewing safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 trial of the R21 vaccine. The WHO prequalification process is also underway. If the R21 vaccine is recommended for use, there will be two WHO recommended malaria vaccines available for vaccine introduction - RTS,S or R21. Having two or more vaccines improve vaccine security. If R21 is recommended under the existing WHO recommendation for malaria vaccine, R21 will also be supported by Gavi and countries would be able to access it as part of the Gavi malaria vaccine programme as "}
