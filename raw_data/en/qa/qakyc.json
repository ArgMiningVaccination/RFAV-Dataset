WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 1.4-SUBSTITUTED PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF FIELD OF THE INVENTION 5 The present invention relates to 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives, compositions comprising one or more 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives, and methods of using the 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives for treating or preventing a viral infection or a virus-related disorder in a patient. 10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HCV is a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has been implicated as the major causative agent in non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). NANBH is distinguished from other types of viral-induced liver disease, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) j hepatitis delta virus (HDV), as well as from other forms of liver disease such as 15 alcoholism and primary biliary cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus is a member of the hepacivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae. It is the major causative agent of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis and is the major cause of transfusion-associated hepatitis and accounts for a significant proportion of hepatitis cases worldwide. Although acute HCV infection is often asymptomatic, nearly 80% of cases 20 resolve to chronic hepatitis. About 60% of patients develop liver disease with various clinical outcomes ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (occurring in about 20% of patients), which is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (occurring in about 1-5% of patients). The World Health Organization estimates that 170 million people are chronically infected with HCV, 25 with an estimated 4 million living in the United States. HCV has been implicated in cirrhosis of the liver and in induction of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognosis for patients suffering from HCV infection remains poor as HCV infection is more difficult to treat than other forms of hepatitis. Current data indicates a four-year survival rate of below 50% for patients suffering from cirrhosis and a five-year 30 survival rate of below 30% for patients diagnosed with localized resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients diagnosed with localized unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma fare even worse, having a five-year survival rate of less than 1%. WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 It is well-established that persistent infection of HCV is related to chronic hepatitis, and as such, inhibition of HCV replication is a viable strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma. Present treatment approaches for HCV infection suffer from poor efficacy and unfavorable side-effects and there is currently a strong effort directed to the 5 discovery of HCV replication inhibitors that are useful for the treatment and prevention of HCV related disorders. New approaches currently under investigation include the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines, the identification of interferons with improved pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the discovery of agents designed to inhibit the function of three major viral proteins: protease, helicase and polymerase. In addition, 10 the HCV RNA genome itself, particularly the IRES element, is being actively exploited as an antiviral target using antisense molecules and catalytic ribozymes. Particular therapies for HCV infection include a-interferon monotherapy and combination therapy comprising a-interferon and ribavirin. These therapies have been shown to be effective in some patients with chronic HCV infection. The use of antisense 15 oligonucleotides for treatment of HCV infection has also been proposed as has the use of free bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, and conjugated bile acids, such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Phosphonoformic acid esters have also been proposed as potentially for the treatment of various viral infections including HCV. Vaccine development, however, has been hampered by the high degree of viral strain 20 heterogeneity and immune evasion and the lack of protection against reinfection, even with the same inoculum. The development of small-molecule inhibitors directed against specific viral targets has become a major focus of anti-HCV research. The determination of crystal structures for NS3 protease, NS 3 RNA helicase, and NS 5B polymerase, with and without bound ligands, 25 has provided important structural insights useful for the rational design of specific inhibitors, NS5B, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is an important and attractive target for small-molecule inhibitors. Studies with pestiviruses have shown that the small molecule compound VP32947 (3-[((2-dipropylamino)ethyl)thio]5H-L2.4-tria.zino[5.6-b]indo]e) is a 30 potent inhibitor of pestivirus replication and most likely inhibits the NS5B enzyme since resistant strains are mutated in this gene. Inhibition of RdRp has been observed\". Despite the effort directed at the treatment and prevention of HCV and related viral infections, there exists a need in the art for non-peptide, small-molecule compounds having desirable or improved physicochemical properties that are useful for inhibiting viruses and treating viral infections and virus-related disorders.

An illustrative example of such nitrogen-containing heterocycloalkenyl is: 5-membered In another embodiment, group is a group. 10-membered group. The term \"substituted,\" as used herein, means that one or more hydrogens on the 10 designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency under the existing circumstances is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.

The terms \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" as used 20 herein, for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being isolated from a synthetic process (e.g. from a reaction mixture), or natural source or combination thereof. Thus, the term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being obtained from a purification process or processes described herein or well known to the skilled artisan (e.g., 25 chromatography, recrystallization and the like), in sufficient purity to be characterizable by standard analytical techniques described herein or well known to the skilled artisan. It should also be noted that any carbon as well as heteroatom with unsatisfied valences in the text, schemes, examples and tables herein is assumed to have the sufficient number of hydrogen atom(s) to satisfy the valences. 30 When a functional group in a compound is termed \"protected\", this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site when the compound is subjected to a reaction. Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 10 with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, T. W,. Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York. Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated 5 herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel DeliverySystems (1987) M of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in DrugDesign, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term \"prodrug\" as used herein, refers to a compound (e.g., a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to provide a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine 10 Derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. 15 Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. For example, if a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (Ci-Cs)alkyl, (C2-Ci2)alkanoyloxymethyl, 20 l-(a!kanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- l-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, l-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1- (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N- (alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N- 25 (alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, like. Similarly, if a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative contains an alcohol functional 30 group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (Ci~C6)alkanoy loxymethy 1, l-((Ci- C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(0)(0H)2, -P(0)(0(CrC 6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical 5 resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like. If a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' (CrCio)alkyl, (C3-C7) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or is a natural a-aminoacyl, \u2014C(OH)C(O)OY wherein mono-N\u2014 or di-N,N-(CrC6)aminoalkyl morpholino, 15 piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl, and the like. One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. 20 This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and the like. \"Hydrate\" 25 is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H2O. One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3) , 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of 30 solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1). article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 12 desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or 5 hydrate). The term \"effective amount\" as used herein, refers to an amount of 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative and/or an additional therapeutic agent, or a composition thereof that is effective in producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect when administered to a patient suffering from a viral infection or virus-related disorder. In 10 the combination therapies of the present invention, an effective amount can refer to each individual agent or to the combination as a whole, wherein the amounts of all agents administered are together effective, but wherein the component agent of the combination may not be present individually in an effective amount. Metabolic conjugates, such as glucuronides and sulfates which can undergo 15 reversible conversion to the 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives are contemplated in the present invention. The 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives may form salts, and all such salts are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Reference to a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise 20 indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are 25 included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non- toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a 1,4- Substituted Piperazine Derivative with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium 30 followed by lyophilization. as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the 5 formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic 10 Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto. Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic as dicyclohexylamine, t-butyl 15 amine, choline, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides 20 others. All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds which can be 25 metabolically converted to the compounds to the present invention include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, Ci^alkyl, or CMalkoxy or amino); (2) carboxylic acid esters esterification of a indole 2-carboxylic with a hydroxy! group of an alcohol, in which the WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 14 alcohol is selected from from straight or branched chain alkylalcohols (for example, ethanol, n-propanol, t-biitanoL or aryl alcohols (for example, phenol optionally substituted with, Cj^alkyl, or CMalkoxy amino); (3) sulfonate esters, such as or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (4) amino acid esters (for example, L- valyl or L-isoleucyl); (5) phosphonate esters (6) mono-, di- triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C1-20 alcohol or reactive 10 derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (Ce-24)acyl glycerol. The 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the 15 present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a 1,4- Substituted Piperazine Derivative incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the 20 art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, 25 some of the 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivatives may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column. The straight line as a bond generally indicates a mixture of, or either of, the possible isomers, non-limiting example(s) include, containing (R)- and (S)- stereochemistry. 30 For example, I means containing both I J and I I N N N H HH WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 15 A dashed, line ( ) represents an optional and additional bond. As well known in the art, a bond drawn from a particular atom wherein no moiety is depicted at the terminal end of the bond indicates a methyl group bound through that bond to the atom, unless stated otherwise. For example: CH3 N x represents- v 5 AU stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, hydrates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric 10 forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). For example, if a 1,4-Substituted Piperazine Derivative incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the 15 invention. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of 20 the terms \"salt\", \"solvate\", \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and or prodrugs of the inventive compounds. In the Compounds of Formula (I), the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope 25 having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic Formula I. For 1 9 example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium ( H) and deuterium ( H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may 30 afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 16 requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples.

The starting material and reagents depicted above are either available from commercial suppliers such as Sigma-AIdrich (St. Louis, MO) and Acros Organics Co. (Fair Lawn, NJ), or can be prepared using methods well-known to those of skill in the art of 20 organic synthesis. One skilled in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that the synthesis of the core of the Compounds of Formula (I) may require the need for the protection of certain functional groups (i.e., derivatization for the purpose of chemical compatibility with a particular reaction condition). Suitable protecting groups for the various functional groups WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 28 of these compounds and methods for their installation and removal can be found in Greene et at, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, New York, (1999). One skilled in the art of organic synthesis will also recognize that one route for the synthesis of the core of the Compounds of Formula (I) may be more desirable than others, 5 depending on the choice of appendage substituents. Additionally, one skilled in the art will recognize that in some cases the order of reactions may differ from that presented herein to avoid functional group incompatibilities and amend the synthetic route accordingly.

Compound MS m/z Retention Time No. (M+H) (min) XO Inhibition vitro transcribed heteropolymeric RNA known as D-RJMA or DCoH has been shown to be an efficient template for HCV NS5B polymerase (S.-E. Behrens et al., EMBO WO 96/37619). A chemically synthesized 75-mer version, designated DCoH75, whose sequence matches the 3'-end of D-RNA f and DCoH75ddC, where the 3'- terminal cytidine of DCoH75 is replaced by dideoxycytidine, were used for assaying the NS5B enzyme activity as described in Ferrari et al., 12th International Symposium on HCV and Related Viruses, P-306 (2005). The sequence of the template RNA was: NS 5 genotype lb, Genbank was produced and purified from WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 57 10 15 20 25 Escherichia coli a& C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein as described in Ferrari et al., J.

A typical assay contained 20 mM Hepes pH 7.3,10 mM MgCl 2, mM NaCl s ug/ml BSA, 20 0.026 ^iM CTP j 0.25 20 |aCi/m1 [33P]- Reactions were incubated at 22 0C for 2 hours, then stopped by adding 150 mM EDTA, washed in DE81 filter plate in 0.5M di- basic sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and counted using Packard TopCount after the addition of scintillation cocktail. Polynucleotide synthesis was monitored by the incorporation of radiolabeled CTP. The effect of the Compounds of Formula (I) on the polymerase activity was evaluated by adding various concentrations of a Compound of Formula (I), typically in 10 serial 2-fold dilutions, to the assay mixture. The starting concentrations ranged from 200 LtM to 1 fiM. An IC50 value for the inhibitor, defined as the compound concentration that provides 50% Inhibition of polymerase activity, was determined by fitting the cpm data to the Hill equation Y-100/(1+10 A((LogIC50- X)* Hill Slope)), where X Is the logarithm of compound concentration, and Y is the % Inhibition. Ferrari et al., 12th International Symposium on HCV and Related Viruses, P-306 (2005) described in detail this assay procedure. It should be noted that such an assay as described is exemplary and not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The skilled practitioner can appreciate that modifications including but not limited to RNA template, primer, nucleotides, NS5B polymerase form, buffer composition, can be made to develop similar assays that yield the same result for the efficacy of the compounds and compositions described in the invention. NS5B polymerase inhibition data was calculated for the compounds of the present invention using this method and is set forth in the table below. Cpd. ICso Cpd. ICso Cpd.

Various concentrations of a Compound of Formula (I), typically in 10 serial 2-fold dilutions, were added to the assay mixture, with the starting concentration ranging from 250 uM to 1 pM. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.5%, fetal bovine serum was 5%, in the assay media. Cells were harvested on day 3 10 by the addition of Ix cell lysis buffer (Ambion cat #8721). The replicon RNA level was measured using real time PCR (Taqman assay). The amplicon ID NO: 4). GAPDH RNA was used as endogenous 15 control and was amplified in the same reaction as NS5B (multiplex PCR) using primers and VIC-Iabeled probe recommended by the manufacturer (PE Applied Biosystem). The real- time RT-PCR reactions were run on ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System using the following program: 48 0C for 30 minutes, 95 0C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95 0C for 15 sec, 60 0C for 1 minute. The ACT values (CTSB-CTQAPDH) were plotted against the 20 concentration of test compound and fitted to the si gmoid dose-response model using XLfit4 (MDL). EC50 was defined as the concentration of inhibitor necessary to achieve ACT-I over the projected baseline; EC90 the concentration necessary to achieve ACT=3.2 over the WO 2011/087738 PCT/US2010/061203 59 baseline. Alternatively, to quantitate the absolute amount of replicon RNA j a standard curve was established by including serially diluted T7 transcripts of replicon RNA in the All reagents were from PE Applied Biosystems. Such an assay procedure was described in detail in e.g. Malcolm et al, Antimicrobial Agents and 5 Chemotherapy 50: 1013-1020 (2006). The study of the HCV life cycle has been difficult due to the lack of a cell-culture system to support the HCV virus. To date, compounds in different structural classes acting on different sites within the HCV polyprotein have demonstrated efficacy in various species, including humans, in reducing HCV viral titers. Furthermore, the subgenomic 10 replicon assay is highly correlated with efficacy in non-humans and humans infected with HCV. See K. del Carmen et al,, Annals of Hepatology, 2004, 3:54. It is accepted that the HCV replicon system described above is useful for the development and the evaluation of antiviral drugs. See Pietschmann, T. & Bartenschlager j R., Current Opinion in Drug Discovery Research 2001,4:657-664). 15 HCV replicon assay data was calculated for the compounds of the present invention using this method and the compounds demonstrated EC50 values between 1 JiM and 50 jiM.

HCV types and 15 subtypes may differ in their antigenicity, level of viremia, severity of disease produced, and response to interferon therapy as described in Holland et al., Pathology, 30(2 ):192-195 (1998). The nomenclature set forth in Simmonds et al.,JGen Virol, 74(Pt.l 1):2391-2399 (1993) is widely used and classifies isolates into six major genotypes, 1 through 6, with two or more related subtypes, e.g., la, lb. Additional genotypes 7-10 and 11 have been 20 proposed, however the phylogenetic basis on which this classification Is based has been questioned, and thus types 7, 8,9 and 11 isolates have been reassigned as type 6, and type 10 isolates as type 3 (see Lamballerie et al, J Gen Virol i 78(1^1 ):45-51 (1997)). The major genotypes have been defined as having sequence similarities of between 55 and 72% (mean 64.5%), and subtypes within types as having. 75%-86% similarity (mean 80%) when 25 sequenced in the NS-5 region (see Simmonds et al., J Gen Virol i 75fPt 5):1053-1061 (1994)).
