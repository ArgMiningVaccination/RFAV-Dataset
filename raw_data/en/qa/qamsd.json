Drugs of both types play a significant role in the healthcare system in China, but are not well-known outside China. The research and development process, the molecular mechanisms of action, and the clinical evaluation associated with some exemplificative anticancer drugs based on TCM are discussed, along with their potential of integration in western medicine.
