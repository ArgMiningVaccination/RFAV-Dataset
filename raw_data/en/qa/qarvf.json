It's a mindset that's almost too easy to fall into, especially if you're constantly seeing or hearing things that are telling you that you need to hustle hard, be creative, and do more during this quarantine. It's not to say that hustling, creating, and accomplishing are negative things; but the real problems come in when there is a lack of balance in this mindset. Getting things done is important, but it can't be *the* thing we're chasing. Accomplishment can't be the goal. The goal is finding enjoyment and practicing self-acceptance through the process. Balance is the key here \u2014 an understanding that self-care and relaxation go hand in hand with motivation, hustle, and accomplishment. In today's society, it can be easy to confuse a lack of motivation with laziness; when really a lack of motivation is a completely normal thing. The most \"accomplished\" of people still lack motivation, a lot of the time. There's nothing wrong with you for not feeling motivated, especially during unsure times like now. Beating up on yourself for not having motivation is almost never a productive habit, especially when there is a global health crisis. It's important to remember that our brains evolved solving problems, and when we cannot solve the problem at hand, it drives our brain into mental fatigue and exhaustion. Not to mention, the effects that extreme physical and social distancing has proven to have on our mental health. A recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that almost half of all Americans reported that the coronavirus pandemic has harmed their mental health. The current state of the world has made the importance of self-care more clear than ever. Rather than pressuring ourselves to do as much as possible and berating ourselves when we don't accomplish more and more each day, the key is to find things that make us happy and allow ourselves to explore and indulge in them, letting \"motivation\" and \"accomplishment\" come and go as they naturally do. Taking time to nap, play, laugh, indulge, and do a whole lot of nothing is healthy, normal, and even necessary. Don't feel bad for taking your time on things, or giving yourself breaks to play games and watch Netflix. Life is already hard enough without us buying into the toxic idea that we aren't hustling, creating, or accomplishing enough. You're already enough. You're not lazy, and you're not wrong for feeling unmotivated. You're a human being, and you deserve to take this time to do what feels right for you. Some ideas for nourishing a nontoxic mindset during the coronavirus quarantine: Practicing the box breathing method (see instructions [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321805)) Spending time in nature (even if it's just stepping outside) \"Free-writing\" or a technique in which you write continuously for a set period of time without forethought or censorship. This can be way more powerful than you'd think. Napping Watching your favorite \"trash\" television Playing video games Dancing around (like a kid who doesn't care how they look) Baking, cooking, and mixing fun drinks Finding an enjoyable [workout or yoga video on YouTube](https://www.keep-a-breast.org/blog/self-care-resources-for-right-now-and-always) Listening to a [guided meditation](https://www.keep-a-breast.org/blog/self-care-resources-for-right-now-and-always) Doing a whole lot of nothing and being okay with it! No matter how you choose to spend your time during this quarantine, if you are honoring your mental health and happiness, you are spending time wisely. "}
