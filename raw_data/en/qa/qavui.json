If you're not aware of colloidal silver it's basically condensed water with nanoparticles of silver added to it. The main reason why it's amazing is that it works in harmony with the body's cells and tissues and is effective as an antiviral, antimicrobial, and antibacterial treatment that doesn't destroy the delicate balance of the gut microbiome essential to a good immune response. This amazing healing nugget about colloidal silver has been handed down through generations of wise healers passing on their knowledge of working with natural medicine for over 6000 years and in fact, in many poorer regions of the world it's still used as a natural and effective antibiotic to prevent infection rather than more expensive prescription antibiotics as it's very affordable and can even be made at home. It can be used for a whole host of different ailments ranging from helping treat a tooth infection, burns, skin conditions, ear infections to fighting infectious diseases. It's known to be effective for around 650 different disease organisms whilst being virtually non-toxic in comparison to many allopathic alternatives. (1) It's essential to buy good and true colloidal silver especially if you're using it as a healing mechanism as not all products are created equally and poorly produced colloidal silver can have side effects in the body that a good colloidal silver product wouldn't when used as intended. A good colloidal silver is made using pure silver with a purity of 99.99%. It can come in different strengths of what is termed PPM or silver nanoparticles parts per millions that range from anything between 3 - 500 ppm. Depending on the needs of your pet will depend on the ppm concentration you need, so work with your naturopathic vet to determine the concentration, especially for more serious illnesses. But the lower the concentration i.e. 10 ppm the better able the colloidal silver is in penetrating cells to target and eliminate stubborn pathogens, smaller silver particles are more bioavailable to the body and more easily excreted from the body. As a really simple explanation, many diseases and illnesses thrive in environments where cells are low in oxygen. Colloidal silver acts as a transporter of oxygen to cells in the body. When it comes into contact with pathogenic cells in a low oxygen environment, it releases the oxygen it's carrying and damages the cell wall of the pathogen. It is so powerful that it goes a few steps further. Not only does it inhibit both RNA and DNA replication of pathogen cells, it also cuts off the ability for the pathogen cell to metabolise. All the while, doing no damage to healthy cells or essential metabolic processes in the body. Unlike many allopathic antivirals, antibiotics, etc. Colloidal silver doesn't destroy the [microbiome in the digestive system](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/digestive-enzymes) or consequently affect the [mitochondria](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/mitochondria) fundamental to the proper functions of the organs. It's why colloidal silver is so powerful and really should be a go-to treatment prior to using over the counter options. As a comparison an average course of allopathic antibiotics can destroy 17 years' worth of microbiome in the digestive system which is essential to immune system responses and using prescription antibiotics can set off an inflammatory reaction elsewhere in the body. Colloidal silver can do the same work as prescription antibiotics but without the side effect of microbiome destruction and [inflammation](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/chronic-inflammation-killing-pets). It's non-toxic so isn't seen by the body as a toxin and thereby impacting the lymph system and it's known for its anti-inflammatory properties. All in all, it's some of the best natural medicine to have available for everyday use or in your [first aid kit](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/natural-essential-pets-first-aid-kit). Although much less studied in animals than humans, many pet owners have seen great results using colloidal silver as an effective treatment for a number of common conditions pets suffer. It's far less toxic than other chemicals found in over the counter pet treatments and is less toxic than most heavy and soft metals pets are exposed to daily. Colloidal silver has very little odor or harmful chemicals so is great for those pets that are ill or have toxic overload. It has little to no side effects and more importantly doesn't kill the microbiome in the gut which is fundamental in producing an immune response and which normal over the counter antibiotics destroy. Colloidal silver is also great to use on fussy cats and dogs especially as it has very little taste so it can be an effective oral treatment for those pets that struggle to take allopathic medicines. As with all forms of medicine, if not over-used or if used as intended, then colloidal silver is very safe for cats and dogs of all ages. Although allopathic scientific studies are few and what studies are available are limited, the fact it's an old remedy that has been around for 1000s of years and still used today as an effective treatment in Latin America for a range of things such as an antibiotic, a disinfectant, treating drinking water, etc, that in recent years thousands of patents have been filed for colloidal silver (2) and more importantly, many pet owners swear by it, tells us a lot. That it's an effective treatment for many things. Colloidal silver can be used for treating: Its most common function is as an antibiotic, but it's also used as an antiviral, antimicrobial treatment and has been used for a number of illnesses such as... As each pet is an individual no one size fits all and it will also depend on the ailment you're looking to treat. If you're looking to use colloidal silver to treat more acute conditions then it's advisable you work with your holistic vet to ensure there are no adverse reactions with any existing medication your pet may be on and work out a more aggressive dosage. But given its broad spectrum for healing and that it's non-toxic, it will likely be more helpful than harmful and a high dose at the start can help speed healing as it's unlikely you're pet will over-dose on colloidal silver for the short time you may need to heavily dose. A simple approach is to think of colloidal silver in terms of, either a nutritional supplement, antibiotic treatment, or treatment for an illness. This will determine how much you would look to administer to your pet and the timeframe of use. For example, treating a severe illness would mean you're looking to use a higher dose, more frequently for a burst of time compared to the dosage if using it as a mineral supplement to be given daily or weekly. Colloidal silver can be applied topically or given orally. Some of the most effective ways to administer this is through a bottle that has a dropper or a spray bottle. Spray bottles make it far easier to use if you're treating fleas so you can spray the colloidal silver close to and on the skin, then let it dry naturally, if you're looking to clean your pet's bedding, etc. When it comes to treating things like eye and [ear infections](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/dog-ear-infections-in-cats) it's much easier to administer colloidal silver using a dropper. And to give it orally, you can add a few drops to your pet's drinking bowl, food, let them drink it directly, or pop it into their mouth using the plastic part of a syringe. The condition you're treating will influence the dosage. For fleas for example you may need to spray your cat and dog, their bedding two or three times a day for a number of days until the fleas have gone. It's also worth spraying your dog's and cat's collar to make them unattractive to more fleas. For ailments such as eye infections, use a dropper to place one or two drops into your pet's eye two-four times a day until you've eliminated the virus. It may take more or fewer dosages depending on the severity of the infection and how early on you caught the virus until you see it begin to clear up. As an oral treatment and depending on the condition, dosages can range from three to twenty drops, three or four times a day for small animals. For larger breeds, you'd look to be using 2-4 tablespoons each dose. As a rough guide, your average 3kg cat would have a teaspoon per dose, whilst a medium-sized dog would have 4-6 teaspoons. Ultimately you'll need to let your pet be your guide as some pets and viruses react quickly to the first few treatments others take longer. If you've caught an issue early you should start seeing results within 24 hours. If not play with the dosage and number of times per day given/applied and then ease off as things begin to improve. For more acute problems such as warts, skin conditions, etc. the dosage will be at the higher end and the number of times per day higher in order to break these stronger pathogens. It's hard to overdose on colloidal silver if you go in with the right approach, i.e. viewing it as a course of antibiotics or a treatment for a specific condition and not a long-term treatment at high dosages. The amount given will also be determined by the ppm concentration of silver. The lower the ppm i.e 8, 10, 12 pmm the more effective it is on tough pathogens and the easier it is for the body to absorb, but an average ppm is normally around 20 -25pmm and still works incredibly well on a wide spectrum of ailments. If you're looking to use it more long-term, like a daily or weekly mineral supplement then the amount given will be determined by the size of the pet and the ppm concentration you're using. However, think less is more when used as a supplement as you would have to factor in the RDA for your animal and what other nutritional sources contribute to their overall RDA. Long term use is probably better given weekly or bi-weekly as a supplement because in some cases, especially in people that have used high doses over long periods of time, they've noticed their skin begin to take on a blue-grey tinge. But if used sensibly and as intended, for example in South America human consumption tends to just be one or two drops taken orally daily and used throughout flu season, or it's used as an effective non-toxic mouth wash, then there are very few adverse effects. Remember your pet's system is so much smaller so any side effects would be seen quicker hence it's important to be sensible when using colloidal silver as a supplement. If you stick to using colloidal silver for infections only, it should be fine and will boost your pet's immune system for the time your cat or dog is fighting the infection. The great thing about colloidal silver is that over the course of a few days you should start to see some positive results, if not then you may need to amend the dosage. Alternatively, work with your integrative vet to determine if something more serious is happening or get them to advise on a more aggressive treatment plan. Be mindful of also maintaining good diverse gut health in your pet so ensure you're also giving your cat or dog access to natural sources of digestive enzymes, prebiotics and probiotics as these things all work in unity to aid your pet's immune response and healing time. Given colloidal silver has such a wide range of use they're not many instances where pet parents haven't seen the benefit of using colloidal silver as a first response treatment for the majority of common pet problems. \"The best defense against swine flu, or any flu, is the age old remedy of colloidal silver. The metal silver in its colloidal state can be safely consumed and used in the body. Bacteria and viruses cannot develop resistance to colloidal silver. Silver disables a vital enzyme and mechanism in all bacteria and pathogens so that they cannot survive. It is good to take a few teaspoons of colloidal silver daily to maintain health. More colloidal silver should be taken if experiencing illness.\"by Pravda/The Silver Edge NOW, we'd love to hear your feedback so LEAVE A COMMENT, and feel free to share this with people you think will love it.
