On March 13, the poet KennethGoldsmith\u2014an Nth degree Warhol Xerox in an animated GIF world\u2014performed anappropriative poem that drew on the Saint Louis County autopsy report detailing thecorpse of Michael Brown. Goldsmith read for half an hour, backlit by the projectedgraduation portrait of Michael Brown, unsmiling above perhaps in disapproval, andconcluded his reading by quoting, \"The remaining male genitalia system isunremarkable.\" This was perhaps not the cultural legacy the parents of the murdered18-year-old expected when their quest for justice catalyzed a new civil rights movement.After the Twittersphere roasted Goldsmith alive, the witty bon vivant crawled blinkingfrom the wreckage to explain himself on Facebook. Gone was his trademark faux-highbrow smirkiness. Rather, his status update aected an atypical earnestness. (Is thisthe rst time a Facebook status has become a high-prole primary document for apoetics?) Humanist, defensive, and as smarmy as commemorative 9/11 tchotchke,Goldsmith wrote that he had wrought a \"powerful\" and \"uncomfortable\" poem aboutAmerican tragedy, a poem \"that is able to tell the truth in the strongest and clearest waypossible.\" He did not apologize.Two months after Goldsmith's reading, a similar scandal occurred featuring VanessaPlace, the Empress Palpatine of process-based poetics, who you may imagine cacklingeuphorically from that narcotic high called the will to power. If Goldsmith appropriatedMichael Brown's body, then Vanessa Place has appropriated black appropriation. IfGoldsmith concluded with Michael Brown's male member, then Place's appropriationsobsess over stereotypes of black femininity\u2014she is, you might say, intersectionallyracist. On May 16, a Change.org petition demanded that the national MFA trade show\u2014Association of Writers and Writing Programs Conference (AWP)\u2014remove Place fromthe committee that selects conference participants. The reason? For several years,Place's Twitter account has published only text lifted from Margaret Mitchell's 1936novel Gone With The Wind, most noticeably the novel's wince-inducing racist dialogue.@VanessaPlace is a durational performance that, Place alleges, taunts the Mitchellestate to sue her for infringing on its copyright. A potential cease and desist letterAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 3 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18would mean the Mitchell estate owning up to Gone With The Wind's overt racism. Inpractice, Place has found in the novel a vehicle that allows her to disseminate 1930sracism over 21st century social media, gleefully garnishing the Internet with theN-word. As Place once said in an artist statement, \"I have stolen Margaret Mitchell's\"n**gers\" and claim them as my own\" (asterisks, unfortunately, mine). The petitionworked. AWP dinged Place from its selection committee, and Place also scurried toFacebook to issue her own poetics and non-apology.Kenneth Goldsmith and Vanessa Place are respectively the court jester and law-giver,the brand manager and ideologue, of Conceptual Poetry, a poetry movement whosechief aect is a snickering, joyless humor (the poems often read like punch lines withthe laughter redacted) and whose writers subject text to \"uncreative\" processes, such asredaction, appropriation, situation, and Oulipo-based routines. It is a movement theyhave relentlessly marketed and one that, in the past few months, they have destroyed.While the techniques of Conceptual Poetry will continue to be deployed after Spring2015\u2014just as poets still deploy Imagistic tropes without thinking they continue thepolitics of Ezra Pound\u2014the brand is perhaps dead. An anonymous poetry collectivecalled The Mongrel Coalition Against Gringpo has led a charge against ConceptualPoetry, spearheading the campaign around Place's role at AWP. In Berkeley, Place wasscheduled to appear at a poetry conference. Most of the participants dropped out inprotest. Undergraduate poets of color released a letter boycotting the conference. Theconference fell apart. And yet to appropriate Conceptual Poetry's media kit, Goldsmithand Place's individual authorship is insignicant. They are symptoms, not supervillains. This is not the rst time a white poet has publicly embarrassed himself bywriting about Ferguson, nor is it the rst time that Place herself has been banned foropportunistic blackface.This is why when poet Heriberto Y\u00e9pez dropped out of the Berkeley conference, hewrote: We are all Vanessa Place. This was not a display of solidarity, but a critique ofavant-garde poetry as an institution. What Goldsmith and Place's appropriationsshowed is that Conceptual Poetry requires racialized bodies. The racial body in avant-garde poetry is: mere material to own; a site of violation; or simply something toinstrumentalize if you want to flaunt your nihilist street cred and perform, one mightAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 4 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18say, your whiteness. If the avant ideology says that poets of color can never be avant-garde because they are anthropology, the mute primitivists of pure material\u2014then bythe same logic, the perfect ore to mine comes in only one vein: racial trauma. And soConceptual Poetry has created an aesthetically justiable way to ingest the racial body:the use of supposedly neutral tropes (quotation and appropriation) as a force eld thatcan both repress and exhibit the excessive \"authenticity\" of race. Let us start withKenneth Goldsmith. SS t t aa t t ee U U ssHow did Goldsmith defend himself? He argued on Facebook that his Michael Brownreading was not tasteless, since it merely duplicated the procedures he used in his bookSeven American Deaths and Disasters, which concerns national tragedies such as 9/11,the Challenger explosion, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, whose autopsyreport he did not read. The Michael Brown reading and Seven American Deaths andDisasters do have one thing in common. These works seem suspiciously unlikeConceptual Poetry's self-description. Rather than presenting signiers, they show that sentimentally political: American nationhood.They dier in one major respect: the \"viewpoint\" that is being transcribed. In SevenAmerican Deaths and Disasters, Goldsmith transcribes news broadcasts responding tothe tragedies\u2014in other words, an imagined public sphere. The tragedies areconceptualized as having happened to \"us.\" In his most recent piece, Goldsmith did nottranscribe mass media responses to Michael Brown's death, perhaps because he did notsee Brown as one of \"us.\" Instead, he read Michael Brown's autopsy report. He literallyperformed the role of the state, the man slicing apart the fallen body of Michael Brown.When I rst heard about the performance, I was initially struck by how Goldsmith'sAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 5 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18reading felt less like a faux-pas or a mistake, than the kind of deeply revealing slip froma psychoanalytic case study, that gesture by which the subject reveals the unconsciousself-knowledge that they did not know they possessed. What I learned when Goldsmithread the autopsy report of Michael Brown is this: Conceptual Poetry literally sees itselfas white power dissecting the colored body. Goldsmith saw Michael Brown not as abody but as a death-archive to be enumerated, dissected, and possessed (in the senseboth of property and haunting). He wrote in another lineage\u2014not just WesternModernism, but also the literary tradition that made modernity possible: thedocuments, the ledgers and the logs of the slave trade. MM a a t t h h e e mm a a t t i i c c s s o o f f t t h h e e U U n n l l i i v v i i n n g gThe slave trade required documents like Brown's autopsy report: texts that testied thatthese bodies were actually things. The black feminist geographer Katherine McKittrickwrites: \"historic blackness comes from: the list, the breathless numbers, the absolutelyeconomic, the mathematics of the unliving.\" In an incredible, rhapsodic titled\"Mathematics them ends: \"Jenny Frederick, 32 years, ordinary wench...Certied to be free by Jonah Frederick of Boston, New England... Betty Rapelje, 21 stoutwench, (Peter Brown)... Says she was born free at Newton, Long Island.\" Commentingon this sudden last eruption, the cry of Betty Rapelje asserting her freedom from withinthe ledger book, McKittrick writes:Worn out, bill of sale produced, certied to be free, ordinary wench, provedto be the property of, formerly slave to, formerly the property of, all withparenthetic possessors. New world blackness arrives through the ordinary,proved, former, certied, nearly worn-out archives of ledgers, accounts, pricetags, and descriptors of economic worth and nancial probability. The list ofAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 6 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18slaves upon these ships is a list of properties commodities. The slave is apossession, proved to be property. Yet a voice interrupts: says she.The tropes of Goldsmith's performance are here: the the necromancy of anti-black violence\u2014but McKittrick hearsone voice speaking back within the archive: Says she was born free. What McKittrickidenties is the surprise of this utterance\u2014the wonder that a piece of property couldspeak back. And this wonder, this listening deep into the archive of the slave trade,forms the basis of one of the most compelling recent poetry books of the archive. In1781, the captain of the slave ship Zong had thrown almost 150 slaves overboard andsought to recover restitution from his insurers for his lost property. More than twohundred years later, Canadian-Caribbean poet M. NourbeSe Philip's similarly titledpoetry collection appropriates text from the only record of the massacre: a legal casecalled Gregson v. Gilbert, which sided against the slave-trading syndicate that operatedZong, but did not dispute that it was legal to kill one's own slaves. Philip does notsimply recapitulate the ledger book of triangular trade, but deforms it to resurrect thetraumatic music, the moans, ululations and utterances smothered by the records of thelaw.Just a few years after the Zong massacre, a woman was born who went on to become themost famous black public body: Saartjie Baartman (1789-1815), the African woman whowas exhibited as the Hottentot Venus, after growing up as an indigene in a South Africathat was being reshaped by Dutch and British forces. Baartman was part of an imperialculture dedicated to displaying the bodies collected from the periphery in the empire'surban centers. The World's Fairs\u2014which so inspired Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project,itself a model for Conceptual Poetry\u2014were heterotopias of globalization, wondrousexhibitions where the denizens of the metropole went to see the rest of the worldpackaged and presented as objects. These Worlds Fairs were supreme sites ofappropriation, festivals dedicated to identifying, cataloging and quoting snippets ofcolonized objects. Objects, in the eyes of the empire, included persons.At one fair, the Khedive of Egypt was invited and asked to occupy a simulated palace,one exhibited to Londoners as though in a Natural History Museum. In the OpiumAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 7 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Wars of China, where the British and the French sacked the Emperor's Summer Palace,her Majesty's soldiers stole what they believed to be the skull of Confucius, which laterended up for sale at Christie's. In Saint Louis, just two years after the United Stateskilled almost a quarter of a million people in the Philippines, the 1904 World's Fairshowcased indigenous Filipinos as a \"living exhibit\"\u2014a project written about mostrecently by the poet Aimee Suzara in her book Souvenir. As Timothy Century writers\u2014Melville, Nerval, Gautier, Flaubert, Bentham,Edward Lane\u2014wanted the bustling streets of the Middle East to conform to what theysaw at the World's Fairs\u2014that is, a commodied diorama. These writers sought tocleave themselves from what they saw as the squalid Arab Street (to use a phrase thatstill has purchase today), all the better to imbibe its signiers and incorporate it intoone's work. In Giza, servants carried Europeans on litters to the ruined vertices of theGreat Pyramid, where their gaze could extend panoptically and behold all that wasbefore them. Back in the city, the Europeanized Turkish elite began to wearsunglasses\u2014this was the fashion of surveillance. Many of these writers foundthemselves searching for an authentic East, but found the actual east too impure tomatch the one they dreamed. Nerval wrote to Gautier that the true and \"authentic\"Cairo was not in Egypt, but in the operas and cafes of Paris. It was not the Egypt ofactuality, but the abstract Orient fantasized by the Western mind, that was real. And inthe South Asian subcontinent, the learned orientalists essentially invented thetraditions of Indian religion and philosophy, having found the actual lived rituals andpractices of contemporary Indians too base and primitive to match the more perfectIndia they imagined. As the writer and artist Youmna Chlala has written in a poem,\"Authenticity died with colonialism\"\u2014that is, authenticity did not predate colonialism,the remnant of a pristine pre-colonial Eden, but was created by the curatorial eye ofthose who came to own the world.Colonialism gave to art a new framework in which to contain, exhibit, and quote thoseit had conquered. Who implemented these colonial exhibitions? Not brutes and bigots,but sophisticated arts professionals: the philologists and translators of the BritishEmpire, the museum and festival curators who exhibited the world entire, and thegreatest writers of Western romanticism. These colonial curators could no doubt haveAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 8 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18defended their actions much more convincingly than Place and Goldsmith. They alsohad pretexts and complicating intentions.If these arts professionals sought to archive a primal racial essence, then so too didVanessa Place, who wrote in her Facebook non-apology: \"Both babe and Mammy areexamples of what I call radical mimesis, direct representation of the thing itself... thethingness of racism.\" The target may have changed from the essence of race to theessence of racism, but the colonial tropes and intentions remain unchanged. In the lastfew years, we have seen the rise of so-called \"ironic racism\"\u2014a speech act in which thespeaker simultaneously asserts and disclaims a racist statement. When Stephen Colbertsays he wants to start the \"Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation,\" when Charlie Hebdoportrays the women kidnapped by Boko Haram using the right-wing imagery of black\"welfare queens,\" when Daniel Handler makes a comment about racist watermelonjokes at the National Book Awards, they do not satirically intervene against racism.Rather they have it both ways. The racist perpetrator gains a cover by creating anothercontext and delegating the excessive racist intention\u2014the racist jouissance, one mightsay\u2014to that other domain. The racist taboo is exhibited within that other context,which serves as a containment cell against possible culpability. Such an act could beunderstood not as meta-racism, but as quarantine from accountability, as alibi. VanessaPlace's framing device around her racist Twitter project is just a 21st century form ofracial containment, not unlike these old colonial forms like the diorama, the fair, or theexhibition. What has persisted is that same downward looking stare, this eye that sapsthose whom it strikes of their agency and empiricism\u2014the gaze of the imperialoverseer.If you think the British Orientalist tradition possesses little relevance to avant-gardepoetry in English, consider the foundational poem of Anglo-American Modernism: T.S.Eliot's The Waste Land. Inspired by James Frazier's anthropological catalog ofindigenous tribal practices, The Waste Land imagines London as a site ofphantasmagoric globalization. The poem jingles with both early mass culture (Londonas metropolis of pop songs and ragged newspapers) and Near Eastern imperial echoes:Alexandria, Carthage, the Phoenician Sailor, and a Smyrna Merchant who literally staysat a hotel called \"The Metropole.\" Marjorie Perlo, the doyen of Conceptual criticism,Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 9 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18has retroactively canonized The Waste Land as a precursor of Conceptual Poetry. It isthe maximalist poem of appropriation, one that echoes everything from Webster toragtime boogie-woogie and culminates in an eleven-line \"tissue of quotations.\" But whatis the content of these quotations? When The Waste Land was published, its world-weariness voiced the melancholic spirit of the West, laid waste by modernization andthe Great War. Eliot ends the work by reenacting a key scene from the BrihadaranyakaUpanishad, where the decayed ruins of the poem nd themselves healed by theauthentic and universal love of Oriental mysticism. In a time when few people inAmerica nished high school, Eliot had all but completed a PhD in Oriental Studies atHarvard and Oxford. He could read Sanskrit. He thought that Indian Buddhists likeNagarjuna\u2014the brilliant critic of authentic essences, whose words Eliot appropriatesfor the start of Four Quartets\u2014made the European philosophers look like \"schoolboys.\"If The Waste Land created the tradition for our own individually talented appropriators,then it is a tradition brought to you by British colonial knowledge. As Eliot has twocharacters sing at each other in Fragments of an Agon:You'll be the cannibal!You'll be the Aim\u00e9 that colonization was thingication: the process by whichthe empire converted the self into a mere object. Much Conceptual Poetry minessources that are not people (say, Google search results), but when its gaze does alighton people, these people, too, nd themselves rendered dumbly into things. In what cannow be seen as unknowing self-satire, Kenneth Goldsmith once documented his ownevery movement, including his own art practices of masturbation. This piece, which wascalled Fidget, adopts the surveillance view of the body, the body as mechanistic sub-Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 10 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18routines: \"Eyelids open.... Palm corkscrews. Thumb stretches. Forengers wrap. Clench.Elbow bends.\" Rather than reveling in the of flesh, \u00e1 la visualartist Carolee Schneemann, works like Fidget monitor and discipline the body,processing it into a series of procedures that are video-gamed by the mind. ConceptualPoetry seeks to wind back the clock to an old-timey Enlightenment notion of the self,the self not as organism, situated and political, but as pure cogito. Conceptual PoetCraig Dworkin has even dened the movement as one based on \"intellect rather thanemotion,\" a poetry of \"meticulous procedure and exhaustively logical process.\" What ismissing from this account is the body.Conceptual Poetry could not ethically grapple with the murder of Michael Brown, sinceits mission has been to disappear the racial body. Seeing themselves as post-body, post-racial, and post-identity, the Conceptual Poets view identity as either redacted andirrelevant or fluid and mutable, a signier ping pong that, after information technologyand global capitalism, never stops or stands still. Eliot famously wrote that poetry wasthe extinction of personality\u2014and about a century later, this mantra is a Conceptualistcommonplace. Perlo writes that conceptual practices lead to the \"elimination of theego.\" Vanessa Place and Robert Fitterman post-identity Goldsmith's essay ofHyperrealism\" in his Uncreative Writing. After a boilerplate disclaimer about howthe \"rise of identity politics\" has helped \"voices that are still marginalized and ignored,\"Goldsmith states that his identity is endlessly mediated through interactions withothers, information technology, and the culture industry, his sense of self \"up for grabsand changing by the minute.\" (People of color, of course, never change when talking totheir friends or reading things online.) Goldsmith's template for identity is theatomized consumer, whose self is constantly collaged with the joyful play of web pages,advertisements and mass media. He also valorizes the transgendered person, who hedisembodies into a non-gendered shape-changer. Goldsmith further discusses themovement's Internet Platonism when summarizing a keynote address by MarjoriePerlo at a 2008 Conceptual Poetry Conference: \"[Perlo] questioned the values of apoetics based on identity in a time when neither phone numbers nor email addressestell us where caller and recipient are actually located... when an AOL or Yahoo address,Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 11 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18for example, reveals neither nationality, ethnicity, race, religion, age\u2014and often noteven gender.\" The argument, based apparently on mid-1990s fears of identity fraud in anAOL chatroom, is that the body no longer exists because one can surf the Internet. Infact, thanks to the Internet, race, class, and gender themselves no longer exist! How tomake sense of such obvious untruth, such theoretical unsophistication? By readingthese statements as specimens of racial expression.The decentered self imagined by these poets is the elite white self. If the ethnic self is anunmediated body, Goldsmith and Perlo imagine themselves as a disembodied whiteself: the self as hero of individualism and technology, a cogito levitating freely above theracial mob. As for the Internet, it goes without saying that Second Life, The Sims, andMinecraft did not replace reality. Blacking up on Twitter did not make Vanessa Placeblack. Instead, the Internet has consolidated our new tribal clubhouses, as groupidentities like ISIS and Gamergate show, and invented more innovative ways to oppressunderclasses, harass women, and gentrify public space. Rather than resisting the statusquo of our techno-libertarian overlords, like a good avant-garde should, ConceptualPoetry revels in the Singularity theologies of Silicon Valley body-phobia. For itsoccupants (otherwise known as us), the Internet has erected the empire of Big Data, asurveillance regime unparalleled in human history. Rather than diluting identity,electronic identication has granulated it, so that we are tracked by location, user-submitted photo, purchasing history, class status, and viewing history. When New YorkCity recently indicted seven separate gangs, almost half the evidence came from policeFacebook-stalking of 300 black youth crews. More globally, American military forcesdeploy biometrics identication units in Afghanistan, where drone operators view thebody from above, annihilating all the adult-aged males they see into pure death. TheNSA has indexed the pornography of Muslim fundamentalist clerics who the agencyhopes to discredit as closet pornhounds. Whether in the classic age of colonialism ornow, the empire maintains its power through its indexicality. In India, the Britishcolonialists assimilated the subcontinent via maps, surveys, translations, and newschemes of taxation and property development; it is the British colonial system thatinvented the ngerprint. And these biometric control systems\u2014these \"arithmetics ofthe skin,\" to quote a phrase that Katherine McKittrick attributes to SimoneAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 12 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Browne\u2014\"can be linked to the tracking of escaped slaves\u2014the black enslaved body, theblack escaping body, was recorded and coded as biometrically knowable (or ndableand searchable).\" In our biopolitical age of mass incarceration, conceptual poetrymimics the disciplinary tropes of the state, simultaneously surveilling the body andomitting it from its theoretical horizons. In stark contrast to Conceptual Poetry'svirtualization of the self, Michael Brown was not killed because of anything he believedor wrote, but because his identity was automatically processed by the militarized statepolice as a threat. This state power saw him not as a self, but as a pure black body\u2014notas a citizen, but as a \"demon.\" His family received no justice, because the system\u2014fromthe police department to the prosecution to the jury and witnesses\u2014was designed tocontain, discipline, and crush members of the black undercaste.In Goldsmith's performance, Michael Brown was not a person, not a body, not a boywho was murdered for no reason. He was a transaction. Goldsmith saw a transcriptionof Michael Brown's body being dismembered as simply another \"dry text,\" just anotherdocument undierentiated from any other document and ready to be \"massaged\" intoliterature. He wrote, \"I did not editorialize; I simply read it without commentary oradditional editorializing,\" and yet he edited the report to end with a description ofMichael Brown's \"unremarkable\" genitalia\u2014a classic obsession of the white overseer. featured the common trope of black didanother quintessentially American social occasion, the lynching. While Goldsmithobviously did not lynch anyone, he unknowingly mimicked the narrative structure ofthe lynching by ending a half-hour long reading on the state inspection of Brown'sgenitalia, despite it having little relevance to Brown's murder. This took intention. Theline was not prominent in the original report; it's mentioned in a list of unremarkableorgans on page ten of sixteen. Goldsmith is not the rst white male poet to pen aphallocentric Ferguson poem. The Pulitzer Prize nalist Frederick Seidel's \"The \"A man unzipping hisfly is vulnerable to attack. / Then the zipper got stuck.\" But Goldsmith's autopsy poemcaptures Conceptual Poetry's bipolar relation to the body, at once repressing itsexistence while simultaneously exhibiting it in its most private aspects, death and sex.Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 13 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18\"\" II ss aa w w tt h h ee b b o o d d yy ..

What is theethically responsible way to show the occult photographs of lynchings, saturated withthe dark spectacle of slaughter, or the leering grimace of minstrel iconography? Howcan one present such images of sublime horror without either simple-mindedlyreenacting their violence or disenchanting them into clich\u00e9s? How can one gaze on thememento mori of colonial horror without staring with the gaze of Medusa? What is theline separating one writer as a poet of witness and another as a poet of expropriation\u2014and what prevents either from being a producer of the kitsch of atrocity? One gets thesense of these images as asymptotic in their dark unknowability. The more we see them,the more we etch away their horror. Their witchy power erodes and they become merelyiconography. In Ferguson, Rika Tyler of Hands Up United said that she became anactivist when she inadvertently encountered Michael Brown after he had been shot byDarren Wilson: \"I went to Caneld [Drive, where Michael Brown was killed]... I saw thebody. I saw the blood. I just broke down.\" Why did Tyler see Michael Brown's body?\"They left [Brown] in the street for four and a half hours in the hot sun on concrete, justfor display,\" she said. \"That reminded me of a modern-day lynching. Because you know,they used to lynch slaves and then have it displayed. And that's basically showing usthat this system is not built for us.\" Tyler connects Michael Brown's body not just to atradition of race killings, but also to a tradition of racial spectacle: the black corpse asexhibited death-object.How can one depict the violence that rained upon the body while not again exhibitingthat body? The poet Marc Bamuthi Joseph's Black Joy in the Hour of Chaos\u2014amultimedia dance and spoken word piece performed outdoors under a parachute-turned-revival-tent\u2014seeks to emphasize an aect of joy against the racial justicemovement's predominant mood of grief. Another poet that engages with this mimeticdilemma is the Canadian-Caribbean poet Dionne Brand. In an essay titled \"PlantationAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 14 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Futures,\" Katherine McKittrick describes Brand's long poem Inventory as a counter-archive of globalized violence. The scope is broad. We travel from Hurricane Katrinaand the criminalized black urban spaces of Canada to more international landscapes ofviolence (Baghdad, Cairo, Darfur). McKittrick notes that Inventory does reify the blackexperience as another litany of violence, but writes that \"this poetics dwells on postslaveviolences in order to provide the context through which black futures are imaginable.The decolonial work of Inventory, therefore, does not lie in archiving and namingviolence; the decolonial work of Inventory lies in the analytical possibilities that arisefrom reading casualty-data as soldered to the creative.\" Similarly, a new piecechoreographed by Paloma McGregor deploys the movement vocabulary of policesavagery (being choked; the victim holding their hands up) to create what the New YorkTimes called an \"activist elegy.\" Created by an experimental dance initiative calledDancing While Black, such a dance imagines the possibilities of the body movingthrough a state structure devoted to policing it. If you can't walk down the streetwithout being stop-and-frisked, what does it mean to dance? CC oo nn c c e e pp t t uu a a l l PP oo e e t t r r y y a a s s M M i i nn s s t t r r e e l l S S hh oo wwIf the political question is one of complicity with a racially unjust state power, thenVanessa Place ignores the question. As she wrote on Facebook, probably to no one'sdisagreement: \"These works are cruel. It is a cruelty to display these images... I embodythe perpetrator, historically and currently.\" In other words, in language that self-servingly references a Kara Walker presentation, Place admits her actions are racist.What is her justication? She essentially argues that her racist act is valid because itshows the existence of racism, but as the poet Shane McCrae wrote, \"How does onejustify hurting black people to teach white people a lesson [about hurting blackpeople]?\" Place's paradoxical rationale\u2014that any reenactment of racism exposes ratherthan repeats racism\u2014would sanction any manner of brutal conceptual poetry projects.Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 15 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Presumably at some point, Place's allies would nd her alibi too wispy to cover herviolation. If this is the case then, as the experimental writer John Keene has asked, whatis the limit case? If we have not already reached it, then it must be because these whitecritics ultimately nd this particular violation to be trivial. Ultimately, Place's Twitterpiece represents a strange dematerialization of racism, a conversation about racism inwhich black people are strangely absent. Place and her allies accept her piece as anti-racist, regardless of the opinions of actual black onlookers, whose thoughts and agencyare presumably irrelevant to this charged conversation about America's racist legacies.Place strains credulity when she claims to expose Gone With The Wind's racism, sincethe text is overtly racist, a foundational document of the Mammy stereotype. Thenovel's racism hardly needs further exposure, since it has already served as the basis fora similar project: a potentially copyright-violating novel by a black author, The WindDone Gone by Alice Randall. One would also nd Place's anti-racism more plausiblehad she not so casually decorated her Twitter account with a drawing of a leeringMammy, lifted from the cover of sheet music for an 1899 minstrel song called \"Jemima'sWedding Day.\" (For her prole photo, she chose a portrait of the woman who won anOscar for Gone With the Wind's lm adaptation, Hattie McDaniel, grinning in Mammygarb.) If one seeks to expose the racism of Margaret Mitchell's work, why use a racistimage utterly unrelated to her work? Why casually throw around the N-word, as we sawearlier, when describing the piece? If many artists have thoughtfully wrestled with theethical representation of anti-black violence, Vanessa Place has bragged aboutpublishing minstrel text without any context or intervention. In fact, that's how herpiece in Poetry, the nation's most prestigious poetry journal, was published.But one can go even further back to cement doubt in Place's purported anti-racism,because she has actually done another project where she simply performs lines from oldminstrel routines. Titled (1957) The Black and White Minstrel Show (1978), theperformance features her reenacting the role of the \"coon shouter\"\u2014the white womenwho would wear blackface and perform minstrel songs in a time when they were themost popular musical genre in America. Here, Minstrel Show has no contextualwrapper\u2014that is, she cannot attribute her racism to Margaret Mitchell\u2014and Place hasexplicitly said she performs the piece with no intention to exculpate or critiqueAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 16 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18minstrelsy's racist legacy. When she tried to perform the piece at the Frye Museum lastyear for an event called \"Coon Songs, Kitsch and Conceptual Writing,\" the MuseumDirector canceled it, stating that \"the potential to cause hurt and harm was just not anoption for us.\" One could respond to this news by reenacting an old Culture Waropposition\u2014one that pits controversial speech against so-called diversity. Or one couldsuggest something else: that the Museum Director and Place actually shared the sameinterpretation of the piece\u2014that it was evil. This is the term that Place routinely uses todescribe her own work, but if her pieces are evil or nihilistic, they lack the ideologicalconviction of evil. They instead attest to a belief that nihilism is the best publicitystrategy. In her most famous piece, Place reads the court testimonies of alleged childmolesters, men who she claims to have represented as their attorney. In Minstrel Show,the history of black appropriation oers itself as simply another abject reservoir oftaboo.What drew her to minstrelsy, Place has said, is that she found the tradition had \"nopoint of authenticity, no point of origin.\" If the avant-garde is perpetually obsessed withorigin and lineage, blackface oers and authenticityloop Minstrel Show appropriates the work of ThomasDartmouth \"Daddy\" Rice, the traveling performer who supposedly invented minstrelsyin the late 1820s, when he came upon an elderly black stablehand, singing and dancing,but dancing a dance marred by a deformed shoulder and crooked leg. According to anAtlantic Monthly story, Rice literally bought the ragged clothes o the man's back. Healso took the words the man sang each time he turned on his one straight leg. The songthat Rice recorded became an international smash hit, a pop song so synonymous withAmerica that one American explorer recounted that a Mexican brass band played thesong upon his arrival, thinking it was the national anthem. And we ourselves continueto know the name of the song in the Twenty-First Century: \"Jump Jim Crow.\" Thisoriginal act of black appropriation named our system of legal apartheid, born at the endof the Reconstruction and persisting today in the very police department that killedMichael Brown.Was Thomas Rice a Conceptual Poet? He helped invent American popular music not bybeing an original creator, but by being an expropriator. One of the purposes of thisAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 17 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18origin myth was to prove that Rice's minstrelsy was not fake, but authentic. Theencounter with the stablehand supposedly showed that blackface could be traced backto some \"real\" foundational act from black culture. But it is highly likely that thisprimordial encounter between Rice and the black stablehand never happened. The onlymention of this story is the Atlantic article, which was published nearly 40 years later in1867 and called, by minstrel studies theorist Eric Lott, \"probably the least trustworthyand most accurate account of American minstrelsy's appropriation of black culturalpractices.\" Rice's minstrel act was both inauthentic and authentic\u2014it was based on astory that both testied to its connections to black culture and to foundational whiteexpropriation, an origin story that may not have happened. While blackface minstrelsyrepresented the commodication of a people already oppressed by slavery, it is also anexample of what historian Lawrence Levine called the \"unpredictability of the past.\" Theword \"coon\"\u2014as David Roediger notes\u2014originally referred not to blacks, but to whitecountry identity. At minstrel shows, audience members sometimes believed that thewhite performers in blackface actually were black. (This is what Mark Twain told hismother.) Some minstrels actually were black and wore blackface to fulll thesigniers of minstrelsy, whose fakeness (it seems) they could use to better representthemselves. One of these black minstrels was W.C. Handy, who spent his early yearsplaying cornet in the Chicago's Worlds Fair and then joined Mahara's Colored Minstrels.From these experiences germinated Handy's contributions to the Blues tradition, one ofthe traditional sources of black authenticity. And as Lott has pointed out, HoraceGreeley, James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. Dubois rather counter-intuitivelyconsidered black minstrelsy to be tied to black authenticity. Perhaps this fluctuating,fraudulent authenticity interested Place, for one can easily see how the minstrel showoers another perfect analogy, another perfect allegory, for the Conceptual Poet. IfGoldsmith inadvertently imagined himself as the professional dissector of corpses, thena similarly perfect avatar for the Conceptual Poet would be Place's minstrel.Like Place and Goldsmith, the minstrel approaches what she takes to be authentic (theblack self) and extrapolates it into both a sexual object to be deled and a fantasy to beperformed. For Place and Goldsmith, the most famous Conceptual Poets, black traumais simply a trauma commodity, automatically poignant subject matter than they canAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 18 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18deploy from above. And one might look at the roles they performed as two avant-gardereactions to supposed ethnic authenticity: the overseer, the supposed rational intellectwho dissects and surveys the primal subject of color; and the minstrel, the emotiveartist who does not insulate herself from the \"wild\" emotions of people of color, butenviously seeks to perform them herself. And how is one supposed to read their works?Surely, as an art genre dedicated to the conscation of content, Conceptual Poetry musthave developed a sophisticated hermeneutics of appropriation. Let us consider MarjoriePerlo's reading of another Vanessa Place work, dealing with another community ofcolor. \"\" F F aa m m ii ll ii ee ss \"\"At a 2010 Columbia poetry conference, Marjorie Perlo stated that reading VanessaPlace's work helped her learn that Latino rape victims were \"at least as bad or worsethan the rapists.\" Perlo was lecturing about Place's appropriations of the alleged rapistsshe defended as an attorney, primarily poor Latino men. The poet Stephanie Youngnarrates what happened when she heard Perlo say this: \"[T]here's this wave of faces inreaction throughout the room. The faces are audible, there are gasps... I'm watching herface... I sort of expect someone to stand up and shout but nobody does, not even duringthe Q & A, it doesn't come up at all.\" When Young posted this account on her blog,Perlo submitted the following reply, in which she describes Place's work and herreaction to it:Cases that come before the court occur primarily within certain interfamilialsituations involving poor people\u2014in LA mostly among Latinos\u2014in \"families\"that live in terribly cramped conditions: a step-uncle may be sleeping on theliving-room couch and his cousin from another marriage is sleeping on thefloor; they get drunk and the next thing you know, the 16-year old girl in theAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 19 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18next room is attacked... The rapist gets something like 30 years. But the boy[another victim of rape] himself may have committed similar crimes... Inother words, it's a horrible socio-economic situation within which oftenmothers refuse to give evidence in support of their daughters because, asillegal immigrants, they fear deportation and so on. It's a horric socialproblem. Read the book! That doesn't mean the rapists aren't guilty; of coursethey are and have already been sentenced. But they ar [sic] not always<<worse>> people than those in the larger network involved.What happens when the most prominent avant-garde literary critic, renowned for herprowess as a formalist close-reader and a theorist of textual indeterminacy, encounterswhat she takes to be simple primary material? She loses all critical faculty. Havingencountered what she imagines to be pure evidence, Perlo reads the work with innitecredulity (\"Read the book!\"), as though the poem constituted an obviously true socialdocument, rather than an edited text taken from an unusual sample set in a highlyspecic legal context. Perlo proselytized about Place's work on Young's blog, statingthat it contained \"a wealth of information from over 10 years of work in the eld\"\u2014asthough Place were a social worker or an anthropologist, rather than an avant-gardeappropriator. What Perlo saw in the work was a mirror for her own racist and classistassumptions, many of which seem to mirror the Moynihan report's right-wingcharacterization of black and Latino families as possessing a pathological culture ofpoverty. Having ventured on a sociological foray into lower-income Los Angeles, Perloemerges with two revelations: rst, that rape only happens to poor people; and second,that Latino child molesters are \"not always worse than\" the children they molest,presumably because those children are from the same poor Latino family, a family shecan only recognize in scare quotes (\"families\"!) and names using a racial slur (\"illegalimmigrants\").Presumably if a Latino poet had simply written autobiographical poetry, Perlo wouldhave dismissed it as artless self-anthropology, as she's done many a time. Because Placeframes another Latino subject's testimony within an appropriative project, Perlo cannd the resulting text valuable as simultaneously an intervention into poetic genre(Was this or was it not poetry?) and as the opposite of poetry: pure content. WhenAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 20 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18another poet questioned online whether it was ethically appropriate to use the lives ofpoor people of color to make a fairly uninteresting point about genre, Perlo wroteback, \"[W]hy is it wrong to use the stories of poor people to make a point about genre?Would it be OK to so use rich people? I don't understand what you're getting at.\"The more interesting feature of Place's piece was not simply publishing obviously non-poetic text (court testimony), but asking what it means to conscate the testimony ofthose who are presented as obviously abject, because of their race, class and supposedcriminality. When questioned about Perlo's statements, Vanessa \"neatly [. . . ] prove[] the point that whatever is in the text is brought theresolely by the one experiencing the text. The text is simply a conceptual portmanteau.\"When pressed further on the Internet, she wrote that \"Marjorie's remarks were bothmisreported and misunderstood\" (surely a point that would not apply to Perlo'swritten response, which I have quoted), but in \"the context of the collection in thebook, her observation is entirely accurate.\" That Perlo does not even comprehend thequestion points to a larger theoretical gap within conceptual poetry: its ignorance onhow to manage the meaning and ideology of content, and its inability to theorize theethics of appropriation.Conceptual Poetry has no politics of appropriation. One could say that the movement'smajor theoretical texts spend signicantly more time discussing, say, John Cage, Sol LeWitt, and Walter Benjamin than they do the power relations of cultural exchange, butthis would give the wrong impression. The texts do not discuss the latter at all. Whenone reads Craig Dworkin's Protocols for Literary Listening, a survey of listening-basedconceptual projects, it is curious to see him list each project by technique and renderpoliticized categories like \"labor,\" \"dialect,\" and \"fluency\" into purely art terms. (This isthe opposite of the old Language Poetry and Marxist dicta that literary forms do notappear ex nihilo, but express ideologies of power.) Vanessa Place and Robert Fitterman'sNotes on Conceptualisms simply admits that appropriation is \"conscation\" and addsthat \"re-iteration or re-cognition seems more apt, as the work is re-invented via itsadoption.\" Translation: an appropriating poet creates a fresh new romantic creation, abeautifully composed aesthetic object that obviates the need to formulate a politics ofappropriation, even if what one is conscating is a dead body. The text also mentions inAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 21 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18passing that it helpfullyadds, \"is is tempted to reply\u2014Oh really? WhenVanessa Place argues that she ghts racism by posting minstrel imagery and reciting\"coon songs,\" then one has simply given up any pretense of thoughtfully possessing apolitics.Goldsmith also defended himself by giving up the Conceptual Poetry paradigm. IfConceptual Poetry held itself out as uncreative anti-art, Goldsmith on Facebookdescribed it as a traditional compositional practice, one in which the author\"massage[s] dry texts to transform them into literature.\" If Conceptual Poetry saw itselfas a poetry of \"intellect rather than emotion,\" Goldsmith justied his performance bysaying it was emotionally \"powerful\"\u2014just as aecting, one might say, as lyric poetry!And rather than being apolitical nihilism or Art for Art's Sake, the Brown autopsy wasanother \"horric American document\"\u2014unremarkable, according to Goldsmith,because it was part of his larger project of articulating American national tragedy. Whatdoes it mean to write poetry that commemorates national tragedy? Poetry basedneither on the lyric self nor formalist dislocation, but on the pure content of historicallyauthentic suering, whether the martyrdom of Michael Brown or the necromancy ofblackface? This is not how you would describe historical avant-gardes, like Fluxus,Dadaism, surrealism, or Language Poetry. This is how you would describe the mostuncouthly politicized genre of them all: Poetry of Witness. GG e e nn r r e e a a s s PP o o l l i i t t i i c c a a l l I I d d e e o o l l o o g g y yWhat exactly dierentiates Conceptual Poetry from a genre like Poetry of Witness? Orfor that matter what separates it from a genre heavily influenced by Poetry of Witness,Documentary Poetics? Like Conceptual Poetry, Documentary Poetics deploys non-compositional moves (quotation, redaction, multimedia) and relocates the author fromAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 22 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18composer to appropriator, archivist and situation-maker. Compare Place andGoldsmith's quotations of the law with Charles Rezniko's Testimony: The UnitedStates (1885-1915) (completed 1978-9), a two-volume opus that quotes from hundreds ofvolumes of testimony from court reporters to tell a historical account of Americanracism. One section of Testimony, titled \"Negroes,\" begins: \"they found a Negro / undera workbench / within six or eight feet of the window / holding a piece of plank beforehis face\u2014 / begging them not to shoot.\" Like Place and Goldsmith, Rezniko quotesfrom the legal testimony related to people of color, but Testimony portrays its speakersas real people, rather than dead totems of racial spectacle. Rather than glancing at hissubjects with the necrophiliac eye of the white overseer, Rezniko wrote Testimony asan inquiry in the history of racial violence. What mattered was not furthering a genreabout investigating genre, but grappling directly with the narratives of power embeddedwithin the testimonies: in other words, the content. Or consider Muriel Rukeyser,whose most famous book (like that of Vanessa Place) orients itself around testimony,violence, and a legal dispute: specically, interviews that Rukeyser conducted in 1936Gauley Bridge, West Virginia with miners who were dying of lung disease, unprotectedfrom toxic silica by their mining company. You can hear their voices in Rukeyser's TheBook of the Dead, which includes letters from the miners, congressional testimony,medical examinations, back-of-the-envelope calculations about worker wages, theUnion Carbide stock readout, and an overview of the legal response to the GauleyBridge deaths. For Rukeyser, what mattered about the testimonies was the people whospoke them and the stories about power that they told.In other words, Documentary Poetics and Conceptual Poetry resemble each other intechnique, but dier wildly in their politics (Cultural Front leftism versus high-artconservatism), their ideological positions (social justice content versus artisticnihilism), and their site (in the world outside of literature versus inside one's reliquaryof dead aesthetics, one's Uncle Scrooge Moneybin of cultural capital). If DocumentaryPoets like Solmaz Sharif and Philip Metres redact the documents of the Americanmilitary complex, then Kenneth Goldsmith found little problem with performing forthe Obama White House during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the rise of dronewarfare. His visit led the poet Linh Dinh to asked, \"Did Bertolt Brecht dance for Hitler?\"Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 23 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Other avant-garde poets attacked Dinh for this hyperbole, but it's worth rememberingthat our post-9/11 wars have slaughtered 1.3 million people. If Place and Goldsmithdeploy aesthetic forms as a shield to protect their own power, then DocumentaryPoetics, the poet Mark Nowak writes, \"needs to nd its feet outside of AWP and artgalleries and instead locate itself ... on factory floors, in union halls, at political rallies...to shift the Draconian policies under which conservative school boards, Tea Partiers,and neoliberal politicians of the world (unite!?!) seek to police the rest of us.\"Documentary Poetics thus diers not just from Conceptual Poetry, but also from thosewriters whose political ghts\u2014say, calling out large literary institutions like AWP orfamous poets like Place and Goldsmith, as this essay does\u2014remain safely within thedomain of literary politics.Depending on your perspective, Documentary Poet Mark Nowak's artistic trajectorymay look like it culminates toward his own authorial evaporation or towards an evenricher blossoming of democratic fullness. After he started out writing rst-personpoems of working-class Polish American identity (Revenants), Nowak's work grewincreasingly heterogeneous, appropriative and multimedia, as he collaged togethertestimony, photographs, and public documents in Shut Up Shut Down and CoalMountain Elementary. Nowak now seeks to reimagine the writing workshop out fromthe institutions of literary professionalism and mastery: the workshop as the unit of thepoem, the workshop as unit of organizing. He has conducted writing workshops withFord autoworkers in Detroit, who were fearful of globalized outsourcing, and withworkers in South Africa, who saw their American compatriots as privileged elites of theglobal north. Once Nowak held a joint workshop with both groups over Skype, the twosets of workers reimagined themselves as allies in the struggle of labor against capital,rather than class competitors. Nowak more recently hosts workshops with the cuttingedge of the alternative labor movement, groups like Domestic Workers United and theCoalition of Immokalee Workers. While these workshops sometimes integratethemselves into a campaign, they are not strictly about creating \"protest poetry\" thatcan become a messaging tool for the movement. Rather, Nowak lifts a page fromJacques Ranciere's Proletarian Nights, which argues that the 19th Century Frenchworkers movement sought not just to rebel against specic labor conditions, but toAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 24 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18wield poetry as a way to imagine more liberated images of their selves beyond their pre-determined worker identities. Nowak's workshops use the words of other people, butone would never say that they deployed appropriation, since the low-income people ofcolor within the workshops possess power with, rather than under, the poet-instructor.A workerist heir to June Jordan's Poetry for the People and Paulo Freire's Pedagogy forthe Oppressed, Nowak's workshops incubate sites of radical democracy.As its vanguard model and fascist histories imply, avant-garde poetries might beimagined as poetries of anti-democracy. While more traditional poets have attackedConceptual Poetry as a supposedly \"parasitical\" and anti-authorial practice, it would bemore accurate to call it a supercharged version of the old-fashioned Romanticautonomous author: author as showman, actor, personal brand, and expropriator. Howdoes Place and Fitterman's Notes on Conceptualisms talks about participation? Itdiscusses how readers read books! How do readers participate in the text? Notes framesthis in terms of allegory, a literary genre older than the English language. Aside fromsome hand-waving about institutional critique, Conceptual Poetry oers no theory ofthe author's positionality, despite the author becoming the central engine of thesepoetries as performer and extractor. If Goldsmith's performance decontextualizedMichael Brown's death from a national movement against state power, this simplycontinued Conceptual Poetry's tendency to erase social contexts and better angle thespotlight at the author. Vanessa Place did not care about what people of color thoughtabout her minstrel pieces. When she quoted the alleged sex oenders, she stated thatshe was merely quoting the public record. I have not read her say what her subjectsthemselves think of her work. What matters is not the consent of those who speak, butthe approval of the state.And when referencing the brand names of Conceptual Art, Conceptual Poets ignorethose artists for whom identity was central (say, Adrian Piper, Nikki Lee, or FelixGonzalez Torres), unless to use them as alibis for their own racist practices. They havealso missed what was fundamentally interesting about the white male artists theyadore. In their quest to imagine Sol Le Witt and John Cage rather counter-intuitively assingular auteurs, Conceptual Poets have erased these artists' radical sense of context.John Cage's most famous piece, 4'33, features himself sitting silently at his piano as theAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 25 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18audience hears the ambient noise of the concert hall. Avant-garde poets have describedthe piece as investigating universalized abstractions of silence and indeterminacy, but4'33 was also a collaboration. What the audience heard was not silence, but their ownparticipation. For Cage, silence and indeterminacy were not noumenal abstractions, butracially coded\u2014the embodiment of Zen Buddhist practices from Japan. As for Sol LeWitt, his famous wall drawings consist of vectors drawn directly on museum walls, notby the Le Witt himself but by assistants following exacting guidelines. Conceptual Poetshave read these pieces as models of pure concept, authorship bereft of the author'shand. This interpretation erases the curious fact that Le Witt's wall drawings were alsocollaborations. Le Witt even asked draftsmen to randomly sketch onto the walls. \"Eachperson draws a line dierently,\" he said. In other words, rather than representing theabsolute ideation of the auteur, these drawings directly drew in that most contingent,anti-conceptual mark of all: the scribble. WW r r i i t t i i n n g g WW h h i i l l e e B B l l a a c c k kMark Nowak's writing workshops could be imagined as the outside strategy to theinside account oered by the black experimentalist Fred Moten. If Nowak imagines ademocratized space for poetry beyond the literary institutions, then Moten and his co-writer Stefano Harney contend that it is impossible for professors to escape theircomplicity with the corporate university. Most poets teach in university departments,and Conceptual Poetry and other avant-garde poetries could be read as genres ofacademic discourse. Moten and Harney's bookThe Undercommons: Fugitive Planning& Black Study argues that attempts to deconstruct the university will only end upreifying it, allowing the corporate education structure to incorporate dissent. Theuniversity is not the antidote to crime and social immobility, but a corporate structurewhose ideology justies the prison industrial complex. The answer, Moten and Harveysuggest, is not radical critique, but radical disengagement. Their organizing locus is theAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 26 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18undercommons, an anti-institutional slacker cell, comprised largely of mists of color,where one simply does not comply.Moten recently came under re from an avant-garde poet named Daniel Tiany, whoseessay \"Cheap Signaling\" seeks to revive the class struggle and demystify poetry bywriters of color and women. \"Identity politics,\" he writes, \"displaces the necessarilyeconomic antagonism of authentic social transformation.\" While an allergy to identitypolitics is commonplace among the left and the right, Tiany attacks another surprisingtarget: workers. For Tiany, both workers and people of color are romantic illusions,folk icons too pure to be real. Instead, he lobbies for his pet aesthetic category: thetrashiness of kitsch, which, being already impure, requires no demystication. Tianythus grants kitsch a strange authenticity and, like an inverted inquisitor, goes aboutdisinfecting poetry of the dirt of purity. He spends a third of the essay targeting FredMoten, who, he says, cannot be a real class warrior because he writes using blackvernacular. Tiany quotes a zzy poem by Moten that zigzags and code-switches, butTiany flattens the poem into a statement of primal authenticity that must bedeconstructed. Apparently unfamiliar with the genres par excellence of anti-essentialism, cultural studies and ethnic studies, Tiany writes that \"Moten's poetryprivileges the black vernacular as somehow authentic and genuine\" and, oddly enough,requests that Moten and all other poets of color declare that their writing is\"inauthentic, or cheap: discounted, vulgar, imitation, unfair, and even criminal.\" By\"criminal,\" Tiany means kitsch, but the word choice is unfortunate. If Tiany ndsMoten guilty of Writing While Black, then it is because Tiany sees blackness not asthe marker of our American underclass but as simply another essence to be debunked.And yet Moten and Harney's Undercommons anticipates metaphysical against the duo's institutional skepticism. If Tianyseeks to unmask the essences of worker and black identities, then Moten and Harneysee such unmasking as just another Enlightenment game of one-upmanship played bytheory bros looking to beef up their CVs. If Tiany's essay imagines class politics only asthe quoting of Marxist diction by his favorite professor-poets (that is, class politics notas revolution but as the privileging of one's own vocational position), then Moten andHarney see such depoliticized gesturing as just the corporate university doing its job. IfAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 27 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Tiany is skeptical of the People, then Moten and Harney are as well: not to performsome cheesy positivist unveiling, but because they believe the community is alwayscoopted by corporate governance. For Moten and Harney, blackness is not simply slangor a feel good multiculturalism, as Tiany seems to think, but a political position. Theywrite that the \"dismissal of any possible claim regarding the essence or even the beingof blackness... becomes, itself, the dismissal of blackness,\" and such de-essentialism, intheir view, can only constitute a form of social control. De-essentialism is a routinizingsystem of governance. Blackness, they argue, means to evade institutional controlthrough politicized anti-labor.One can understand Tiany's essay\u2014and another high-prole essay also published Boston Perlo's \"Poetry on the Brink\"\u2014as freak-outs about theincreasing share of people of color within the exploding poetry labor pool. These piecesmake sense less as literary criticism than as ideological white papers in a war ofposition: avant-garde anti-democracy. Both essays formulate a new cadre class of whiteavant-gardists and argue against the mongrel democratization of poetry posed byethnic poets. While Tiany and Perlo discuss a few poets of color, this is only to saythat they've accomplished that most corporate thing of all: promoted diversity. Suchracial window-dressing belies the ultimate function of both essays: to retaliate againstthe threat posed by poets of color and to denigrate certain poets (read: black poets) fortheir noncompliant authenticity.A panic about labor surplus starts Perlo's \"Poetry on the Brink,\" which begins: \"Whathappens to poetry when everybody is a poet?\" Noting that the national MFA faculty hasincreased to about 22,000 hapless creative writing instructors, Perlo argues that theplague of poets has meant an increase in bad, standardized poems, poems whosebadness possesses, in her words, \"a degree of variation, so that we have Latina poetry,Asian American poetry, queer poetry, the poetry of the disabled...\" Such pluralism hasmade it increasingly hard for Perlo to maintain her own role as critic, that omniscientsorter of hierarchies. The essay narrates her transition to Conceptual Poetry from a1980s-1990s avant-garde poetry movement called Language Poetry. This transition istheoretically curious, since Perlo describes the two as formal opposites. LanguagePoets break poems into fragments to permit the reader to supposedly assembleAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 28 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18whatever meanings they want\u2014supposedly a more just power division between authorand reader. Conceptual Poetry, as Perlo depicts it, is an author-centric aair. Its poemsmust be read using that most conservative of hermeneutic techniques\u2014close-reading\u2014to ascertain the exact textual edits made by its composer. (One could solve thisinconsistency with the observation that Perlo arguably does not understandConceptual Poetry: for example, she apparently believes Kenneth Goldsmith'stranscription of trac reports is an allegory for The Great Gatsby, since both featuregreen lights.) Perlo's switch from one camp to another with more cultural cachetcould be read not just as opportunism, but also as white flight. Perlo laments that by\"the late '90s, when Language poetry felt compelled to be more inclusive with respect togender, race, and ethnic diversity, it became dicult to tell what was or was not a'Language poem.'\" Conceptual Poetry provided a gated community: in our chaoticallydemocratizing times, it renewed the comforting authority of the writer as master andideologue. If mainstream poetry seemed a morass of confusing pluralism, swamped bysurplus poet-laborers, then Conceptual Poetry puried the language of the tribe,creating a system by which to exclude most poets and rank those avant-gardists thatremained.If Conceptual Poetry was the answer, what was American poetry's problem? Perlo'sanswer is \"tepid tolerance,\" which she a poem by Natasha Trethewaytitled Hot Combs. In the poem, the narrator comes upon old hot combs and recollectsher mother searing her hair straight. In a tone that is not a little patronizing, Perloreads as clich\u00e9d \"the memory of the painful hair straightening ritual the poet's AfricanAmerican mother evidently felt obliged to perform\"\u2014as though women do not use hotcombs today! In other words, Perlo starts her essay on the disembodied white genrepar excellence, Conceptual Poetry, by expressing displeasure at a black poet for writingabout the pain of the body. The point seems to be that the black body is alwaysunoriginal, always lost in some antediluvian past.The occasion for Perlo's essay was a rather innocuous object called The PenguinAnthology of Twentieth Century Poetry, edited by Rita Dove, a Pulitzer Prize winningblack poet. Contemporary poetry is often described as a sparring of partisan camps, butthe attack on the Penguin anthology came from both archconservative critics like HelenAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 29 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Vendler in the New York Review of Books or William Logan in The New Criterion andso-called experimental ones like Perlo. Both sides hated the anthology for the samereason: the book included poets of color, as well as women and other \"politicallycorrect\" persons. The critical consensus between Vendler, Perlo, and Logan shows thatour poetry wars are not really positioned around aesthetic camps (say, experimentalversus mainstream poetics), but by hierarchies of racial segregation. The Penguinanthology, for example, included many Language poets, the very poets traditionallythought to be too subversive for Ocial Verse Culture. If for Perlo, the Dove anthologytriggered vitriol for \"includ[ing] many more minority poets than is usually the case,\"this is only to say that most American poetry anthologies omit people of color\u2014evenanthologies that one would imagine would be racially marked, like American Hybrid(four people of color out of 78), The New American Poetry of Engagement: A 21stCentury Anthology (ve poets of color out of 50), Beneath a Single Moon: Buddhism inContemporary American Poetry (no people of color), and American Poetry Since 1950:Innovators and Outsiders(two black poets out of 35 total).When one calls out poets like Vanessa Place and Kenneth Goldsmith one diminishesthe problem to one of personality. What I have tried to demonstrate is thecomprehensive and institutional nature of avant-garde poetry's race problem. To quoteBrian Droitcour, a poet who attended the convening where Goldsmith performed theautopsy report, \"[Goldsmith's] choice to read Michael Brown's autopsy at a conferencethat was overwhelmingly white might have been conceived as an intervention in thatwhiteness, but in retrospect I suspect he was taking advantage of it as a 'safe space'\"\u2014that is, a safe space for white writers. Vanessa Place has similarly bragged about how shehas been Tweeting and publishing her minstrel texts for years without any pushback.Consider all the institutional components we have identied, all dedicated tomaintaining what Harryette Mullen has called \"aesthetic apartheid\": the movement'sleading the elds most influential critics, its theoreticians, professors andanthologists, its intellectual journals, poetry institutions, bloggers, and conferenceorganizers, not to mention the small presses and journals who have published thiswork, the magazines and book reviews that serve as the movement's mouthpieces andfawning press machine, and the colleges and cultural groups that invite these writers toAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 30 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18speak. When an institution decides not to further such anti-democratic exclusion, likethe Frye Museum or AWP, it is the exception\u2014an act so unusual that the powerstructure defends itself by saying it is being censored. The National Coalition AgainstCensorship has called for AWP to reinstate Vanessa Place. Writers in the Los AngelesTimes, Inside Higher Ed, and The Daily Beast have also defended Place, also buying intothe censorship narrative. Vanessa Place has even created another Twitter accountbearing a cover photo that says, \"Silencing Vanessa Place.\" But no one has censoredVanessa Place, who continues transcribing away Gone With The Wind on Twitter. AWPremoved Vanessa Place from a committee devoted to selecting writers, after she publiclyannounced her artistic project was to perpetuate cruelty towards people of color\u2014anact analogous to ring a volunteer HR coordinator who's made bigoted statements.Cries of censorship can often be the sound of powerful institutions smothering actualdebates about content. That so many institutions have supported Vanessa Place has theparadoxical eect of showing how non-transgressive her work actually is. Rather thanpushing up against the status quo or proving too edgy for easily oended minoritygroups, Conceptual Poetry is the status quo poetry of American state segregation.Because people of color are almost always excluded from the avant-garde, last year theAsian American Writers' Workshop presented an event series called theCounterculturalists, which sought to put forth a vision that included avant-gardists ofcolor (Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Martin Wong, Pedro Pietri, Afrika Bambaataa) andethnic radicals (C.L.R. James, Yuri Kochiyama, Eqbal Ahmad, Grace Lee Boggs). When Ispoke with one of our advisers-the writer and cultural activist who I had a storiedcareer that ranged from free expression to indigenous issues-I was surprised to discoverthat we had both flirted with Language Poetry in our youth. I should not have beensurprised. What the cultural activist told me was this: Language Poetry was a way forme to pass.Because avant-garde literature is racialized as the literature of white cultural elites,when one joins its ranks one can achieve a derivative white identity. In fact, manyLanguage poets like Ron Silliman and Barrett Watten have literally described theirgenre as a white ethnic writing. And one way to read essays like Trisha Low's \"On BeingHated: Conceptualism, the Mongrel Coalition, the House That Built Me\" is as anAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 31 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18attempt to come to terms with passing in a white power structure. Because becomingan avant-gardist of color means becoming integrated into a white power structure\u2014thatis, joining in the spoils of an anti-democratic, discriminatory diversity\u2014I havewondered whether people of colors' attempts to diversify the avant-garde simplyconstitute another form of respectability politics. TT hh e e SS uu bb l l i i m m e e oo f f AA uu t t hh e e nn t t i i c c i i t t y yIn the early nineties, some of the most prestigious poetry journals in the country beganpublishing the work of an only recently discovered Japanese poet, a man who hadsurvived the nuclear holocaust of Hiroshima. His name was Araki Yasusada. Born in1907, influenced by Roland Barthes and Jack Yasusada fused Japanese andAmerican avant-garde techniques a survivor's trauma. Language poet Ron Sillimancalled Yasusada \"a poet whose work simply takes my breath away.\" When he read thesepoems of nuclear holocaust, which seemed slightly familiar, as though influenced bycontemporary American experimental poetry, Silliman said, the poems \"kept me up lastnight and probably will again for another night or three. I recommend them highly.\"Yasusada was published in Grand Street, Conjunctions, and the American PoetryReview, which organized a special portfolio of his works. Wesleyan University Pressprepared to publish a selection of his poems. There was only one problem. ArakiYasusada did not exist.Yasusada, it is generally agreed, was the creation of the poet Kent Johnson, who was nota deceased Japanese war survivor, but a then 41-year-old white poet who taught atHighland Community College in Illinois. Johnson not only wrote Yasusada's poems, hewrote Yasusada's letters. He wrote secondary sources purportedly written by Japanesecritics. He may have also invented one or more collaborators who he claimed were thereal authors of Yasusada's oeuvre. (He also edited the anthology of American BuddhistAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 32 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18poetry, mentioned above, which only included white poets.) The poems themselvesmixed genuinely powerful lyricism with orientalist fantasy (e.g., a line where Yasusadadescribes himself as \"obediently bowing the white flowers\") and Americanized nonsequitur that in retrospect looked almost like clues, Johnson's taunting of the reader tond him out (\"The voices of the sorority girls sing of fucking in a plaintive way\"). AsYasusada's true identity leaked out, Wesleyan University Press canceled the publicationof his book. Arthur Vogelsang, the editor of The American Poetry Review, called thehoax \"a criminal act.\" These reversals struck many poetry observers as hypocritical. \"Ifthey thought it was such good writing,\" Marjorie Perlo wrote, as though describing ablind taste test, \"they should still think it was good writing.\" For critics like Perlo, thetarget was \"identity politics\" and a cultural studies framework that prioritized race andbiography over the traditionalist humanist creative ego. A sneering attack on poetry ofwitness, the Yasusada hoax\u2014as Eliot Weinberger said\u2014put to end the idea of \"poetrywhere you had to have been there.\"Kent Johnson\u2014who has called Place and Goldsmith a \"right-wing avant-garde\"\u2014hasnot been included in the canon of Conceptual Poetry. In fact, he has trolled themovement in rather ingenious ways. He impersonated the poet Craig Dworkin writingunder the name \"Kent Johnson\" and then threatened to sue Dworkin for identity theft.But one could consider the Yasusada hoax as one of the inaugural moments ofConceptual Poetry. Bubbling with Conceptual Poetry's Duchampian vibe of mischievousself-promotion, the Yasusada poems were one of the earliest recent literary works,parallel to or pre-dating Goldsmith's early pieces, whose frisson came from a poetgenerating their own extra-compositional context. Twenty years later, I have come toview the Yasusada poems not as a hoax or a critique, but a performance\u2014not a fraudaccidentally uncovered but as an artist-created situation. The poems did notdeconstruct \"poetry where you had to be there.\" Rather, they ushered in a new age ofpoetry that required precisely that. Poetry in which you had to be there\u2014is a perfectdenition of Conceptual Poetry. Re-contextualized in this way, one can see how Perlofailed to engage with both the ethical and avant-garde dimensions of the Yasusadapoems. While she argues that Yasusada was a trap for those who craved poetry flavoredwith Orientalist fantasy, she does not implicate Johnson himself in such exoticism.Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 33 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Johnson's cultural appropriation and possible fraud do not matter, she says, becausethey fall into a traditional literary form: the hoax. In other words, she moots politicalquestions of cultural appropriation by erasing the Yasusada poem's strange,performative nature and familiarizing it into an already familiar genre. One would notdescribe a work by Vanessa Place or Kenneth Goldsmith as poetry that you should likeregardless of what you know about the author's processes. And for Perlo, knowing thata white experimental poet wrote the Yasusada poems did change their meanings: it ishow she knew they were a metatextual critique. Their false authorship, along with theway Yasusada wrote like an American Language poet, elevated them above actualpoems written by Japanese holocaust survivors, which she clearly saw as primitivistanthropology.A group of Asian American writers called Yasusada something else: a minstrel show.These poets\u2014Juliana Chang, Walter K. Lew, Tan Lin, Eileen Tabios, and John Yau\u2014wrote that Johnson's \"act of yellowface at once plays into an existing and apparentlyvigorous orientalist fantasy, exposes American ignorance of both Japanese poetry andrecent Japanese history, and levels a critique against an experimental writingcommunity to which the author also seeks to ingratiate himself.\" People often reducerace into simply racism\u2014and racism into only hateful bigotry. This Manichean viewelides the often unpredictable, dialectical nature of racism, the way in which the racistworldview can comingle Eros and hate, desire and abjection. Many of the BritishOrientalists in India were often not bigots in the \"politically incorrect\" sense\u2014e.g., aperson who utters the taboo words of racial hate. Their problem was the reverse: theythought they loved Indian classical philosophy so much more than the brute savageswho actually happened to be Indians. The white minstrel actors performed the ultimateact of dehumanization, but they often did it with joy. Black identity was an escapehatch from which they could creep out from the connes of their whiteness. Theseminstrels could delegate their less 'civilized' emotions to their other, racialized selvesand play the carnivalesque clown. (Eric Lott has read the minstrel show, for example, asa pretext for white men to express repressed desire for black men.) Perlo characterizedthe Yasusada poems as bait for mainstream liberal suckers, but she elides how thepoems found many admirers in the avant-garde. No one would ever consider RonAuthenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 34 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18Silliman a reader of poetry of witness. As Juliana Chang and the other Asian Americanpoets pointed out, what Yasusada created was a way for avant-garde white writers togive themselves emotional permission to enjoy lyric poems of suering. Suchauthenticity envy also motivates works one might not think of as racist. In the domainof ction, for example, Dave Eggers's second novel, You Should Know Our Velocity,centers on straight white men who feel an emptiness in their lives and try to nd theirsocial conscience in a foreign country. If this problem was autobiographical, Eggerssolved it by situating his next two books around the traumas of men of color: Zeitoun,the story of Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a Syrian man who survives Hurricane Katrina onlyto nd himself mistakenly targeted by the War on Terror; and What Is the What, anovel told from the point of view of Valentino Achak Deng, a man who fled the CivilWar in Sudan to nd freedom in America. If Eggers's rst few novels are primarydocuments of white feelings of insucient soul and excessive privilege, these next twobooks showed the elixir: for the white author to vanish and achieve derivativeauthenticity by telling stories through the mask of a traumatized person of color.Similarly, Kent Johnson himself said that he objected to \"the strong impression that theYasusada corpus presumes to set itself above, and in judgment of, rst-ordertestimonial literature\u2014namely, poetry by those who witnessed, as victims, thebombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" He wrote poems of sympathy rather thansneering deception:The Yasusada is most emphatically not motivated by an impulse to critiqueanything at all in hibakusha literature, nor does it presume to set itself as anequal partner inside or alongside that body of work. [It] exists in relation tohibakusha writing at a distance, as an after-image or echo of it, if you will.And I would hold that Yasuada's apocryphal status makes that echo no lessreal. It whispers something about the double-fusing and mutually-deformedflowering of our two cultures, about our unacknowledged confusion in eachother, about some kind of deeper yearning to nd our voices entwined withan otherness that we know has been inside of us always. All of which is purespeculation and fancy on my part, but I do feel strongly that the echo isauthentic...Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - Asi...https://aaww.org/authenticity-obsession/ 35 of 3824/03/2023, 08:18That Johnson sees the echo as authentic, that he sincerely admires actual Japanesepoems of witness\u2014these facts do not make the piece less racist. The intermingling ofdisgust and desire is, after all, why Eric Lott titled his book on minstrelsy Love andTheft. What Johnson's sincerity reveals is this old longing for authenticity, the painfulsense of white ethnic inadequacy and self-erasure. Johnson invented a ctional authorwho was more \"authentic\" than himself, even though he existed and Yasusada did not.Like the minstrel, Johnson performed Yasusada, a ctional survivor of real racialtrauma. Johnson, Vanessa Place, and Kenneth Goldsmith\u2014all three are whitesimulators of colored bodies, which are seen at once as \"authentic,\" traumatized byworld historical catastrophe, and only accessible via the fantastic desires of whiteidentity.After the angry pushback against Goldsmith and Place's appropriations, the Languagepoet Ron Silliman asked if \"the signers of the petition to the AWP [were] really thatdierent from the police ocer who red at Michael Brown?\" For Silliman, the mostsignicant poetry blogger in the country for about a decade, the answer was an obvious\"no.\" He called those who objected to avant-garde racism an \"online lynch mob\"comprised of \"thuggish... fascist jackboots.\" The Language Poet Barrett Watten also saidthat Place's critics resembled drones, hovering to attack. What is noticeable about thesecomments, what one nds curiously insidious about the appropriations of Goldsmith,Place, and Johnson\u2014is how they appropriate the wounds caused by American empireitself. It is not enough for the colonizer to own the world\u2014the only thing missing, theonly thing escaping his grasp, is to own the trauma that he himself authored. In arecent video of a #BaltimoreGirls meeting, a community mediator named ErrickaWonder Voice Bridgeford delivers a devastating ars poetica\u2014a speech about style not asa decadent surface or an autonomous aesthetic, but as the sublimation of and rebuttalto black oppression:They see the glitter that we put on top of our pain, so they want to rockcornrows too...

Because it represents a visible but inaccessible\"realness,\" because it cannot be assimilated, the trauma of colonialism represents theultimate lack for the colonizer and those who possess it become the object of innitedesire. If the white subject feels bereft of content, neutral and disembodied, then thesetraumatized racial bodies represent the sublime substance of identity. They comeimbued with that pure primal ethnicity imputed to them by the colonizers and stolenalso by the colonizer, ingested through simulation: the excess of authenticity.Conversations with Youmna Chlala and Robert Chlala helped me conceptualize thisessay.Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel Show - 3824/03/2023, 08:18 | . too wander temple ofknowing.We watch heat lightningclamor against clouds copyright \u00a9 2023 Asian American Writers'Workshop Asian American Writers'Workshop112 W 27th Street, Suite 600New York, NY 10001About|Contact|PrivacySign up for the Asian AmericanWriters' Workshop Newsletter: Authenticity Obsession, or Conceptualism as Minstrel "}
