One of these is acupuncture, which can often be a useful complement to other treatments. Acupuncture comes from traditional Chinese medicine, a medical system that has existed for thousands of years. The treatment involves stimulating specific points on your body that are connected to pathways called meridians. Qi, or vital energy, flows through these pathways. Acupuncture is used to rebalance this energy. Acupuncture can help with many conditions from anxiety to pain and can alleviate symptoms such as nausea and fatigue. Acupuncture typically involves placing very thin needles into your body while you lie comfortably on a padded table. Sometimes heat or various types of pressure are also used as part of the treatment. Your provider will determine what part of your body to treat and how many needles to use. Once the needles are in, your provider may gently manipulate them. The needles typically stay in place for less than half an hour. Most people experience little or no discomfort. Much like massage or physical therapy, you may need multiple treatments spread over several weeks. Complications and side effects from acupuncture are very rare. At Providence we take every precaution to protect you and your health with every treatment you receive. Occasionally a person might experience a very small amount of bleeding or soreness where needles were placed, but even this is rare. Doctors Specializing in Acupuncture At Providence, you'll have access to a vast network of dedicated and compassionate providers who offer personalized care by focusing on treatment, prevention and health education.
