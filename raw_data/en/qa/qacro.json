More and more people are asking for the more gentle, process-orientated treatments of complementary and [integrative medicine](/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Gloeckler_2015-12-D-Integrative_Medizin_-_die_kreative_Medizin_der_Zukunft.pdf) to be made available alongside mainstream approaches - their regulation within the EU, however, remains unsatisfactory. [Anthroposophic Medicine](https://www.gaed.de/am.html) is an integrated approach which forges a link between the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of mainstream medicine and the philosophical and spiritual understanding of anthroposophy. [Anthroposophic hospitals](https://anthro-kliniken.de/deutschland.html) are renowned for their excellent care and approach to patients - see [www.anthromed.de](http://www.anthromed.de/en/start/). The basic medicine for treating cancer made from mistletoe is particularly well known. Mistletoe therapy supports mainstream treatment - and this is scientifically demonstrated - by improving the quality of life and reducing the need for painkillers. Meeting the patient and their individual healing path - physically, psychologically and spiritually - lies at the core of the training and post graduate training of doctors and therapists. Since it was founded in 1921, Anthroposophic Medicine has been continually evolving and today, it has a presence in more than 80 countries. The range of therapeutic possibilities available alongside mainstream practices include a wide range of natural medicines to stimulate the self-healing capacity of the organism.

Through its campaigning work, ELIANT seeks to secure the legal status of integrative medicine, and especially Anthroposophic Medicine. "}
