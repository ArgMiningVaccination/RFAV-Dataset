We assessed agentic narcissism with t he Narcissistic Personality I nventory (Raskin & Terry, 1988), the most widely used measure of agentic narcissism (Gebauer, Sedikides, Verplanken, & Holland, 2012). We administered a 4 -item short -form, analogous to our assessment of communal narcissism (see Experiment 1's Method section in the main text). We selected items with a good item- total correlation, adequate content -breadth, and high face -validity. The four items were: \"I like having authority over people,\" \"I am more capable than other people,\" \"I think I am a special person,\" and \"I like to be the center of attention\" ( 1=does apply at all , We and narcissism. The SCP -universal hypothesis predicts a null -effect of yoga (vs. control) on agentic narcissism, because agency is no t a mind -body relevant domain, and yoga -practice should only curtail self-enhancement in mind- body relevant domains (see Introduction section in the main text). In contrast, the ego -quieting hypothesis predicts that yoga (vs. control) reduces all forms of self- enhancement, including agentic self -enhancement and thus agenti c narcissism (see Introduction section in the main text). To examine the effect of yoga (vs. control) on agentic narcissism we conducted a multi- level analysis (see Experiment 1's Statistical Modeling section in the main text). We controlled for communal narcissism in that analysis, because agentic and communal narcissism are positively related (Gebauer et al., 2012) . In line with the SCP -universal hypothesis, t he multi- level analysis revealed no significant effect of yoga on agentic self - enhancement , B=.01, 95% Bayesian analyses revealed \"substantial \" evidence (Jeffreys, 1961) for the null hypothesis: BF 0+=9. In contrast, when swapping agentic and communal narcissism in the multi- level analysis (communal narcissism as criterion and agentic narcissism as covariate), we found a positive effect of yoga (vs. control) on communal narcissism, B =.13, 95% analyses favored the SCP -universal hypothesis (i.e., positive effect of yoga) over the ego - quieting hypothesis (i.e., negative effect of yoga) by factor BF +-=684\" extreme\" evidence for the SCP -universal hypothesis . Togethe r, then, the predictions of the SCP -universal YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 2 hypothesis regarding narcissism (agentic and communal) were met fully and firmly , whereas the predictions of the ego -quieting hypothesis were un met. S2. In Experiment 1, we assessed self -centrality and self -enhancement with the following items. Self -centrality : \"Executing correctly the asanas (yoga positions) that we were taught is...,\" \"Focusing mindfully on the exercises across the whole yoga class is...,\" \"Holding the asanas (yoga positions) as long as we were taught is ...,\" and \"Integrating the content taught in the yoga class into my everyday life is... \" (1=not at all central to me , 11= central to me). Better -than- average: \"In comparison to the average participant of my yoga class, my ability to execute correctly the asanas (yoga positions) that we were taught is...,\" \" In comparison to the average participant of my yoga class, my ability to focus mindfully on the exercises across the whole yoga class is...,\" \" In comparison to the average participant of my yoga class, my ability to hold the asanas (yoga positions) as long as we were taught is ...,\" and \"In comparison to the average participant of my yoga class, my ability to integrate the content taught in the yoga class into my everyday life is... \" The rating -scale ranged from 1 ( well below average ) via 6 ( average ) to 11 ( well above average ). Communal narcissism: \"I have a very positive influence on others,\" \"I will be well known for the good deeds I will have done,\" \"I am the most caring person in my social surrounding,\" and \"I am going to bring peace and justice to the world\" ( 1=does not apply at all , 7=applies completely ). Self -esteem : \"At the moment, I have high self -esteem\" ( 1=does not apply at all , 7=applies completely ). S3.

T he effect of yoga on each of the three self -enhancement measures was as follows . Better -than- average: Before testing the effect of yoga on better -than-average judgments, it was vital to insure that there was no worse -than-average effect in the control condition. Therefore, we computed each participant 's mean better -than-average judgment across assessments in this condition. Participants indeed judged themselves as better -than-average (i.e., above \"6\") regarding their yoga skills, M =6.95, 95% CI [6.71, 7.18], t (92)=8.00. In other YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 8 words, participants in the control condition self -enhanced , and thus a positive effect of yoga on the better -than-average measure indicates that participants in the yoga condition self - enhanced even more than participants in the control condition. Consistent with the SCP - universal hypothesis, we found higher self -enhancement in the yoga condition than in the control condition, B =.15, 95% CI [.04, .26], SE favored the SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego -quieting hypothesis by factor BF +- =234\"extreme\" evidence for the SCP -universal hypothesis . Communal narcissism: Further supporting the SCP -universal hypothesis, we found higher self -enhancement in the yoga condition than in the control condition, B =.21, 95% CI [.11, .32], SE =.05, again favored the SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego- quieting hypothesis by factor BF +-=13,635\"extreme\" evidence for the SCP -universal hypothesis . Self-esteem: Once more supporting the SCP -universal hypothesis, we found higher self - enhancement in the yoga condition than in the control condition, B =.29, 95% CI [.15, .44], SE=.07, t once more favored the SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego -quieting hypothesis by factor BF +=27,271 \"extreme\" evidence for the SCP - universal hypothesis . S5. An alternative explanation states that the findings are driven by yoga beginners, who may have not yet acquired the necessary experience and skill for yoga to unfold its ego - quieting effect. To test this possibility, we examined the cross -level interactions between yoga (vs. control) \u00d7 expertise (i.e., years of practice) on self -centrality and on self -enhancement (g- factor) . Expertise neither moderated the yoga effect on self -centrali ty, B =.09, 95% CI [ -.01, .19], SE =.05, t =1.71, nor the yoga effect on self -enhancement, =.06, 95% CI [ -.06, These results favor the SCP -universal hypothesis over its alternative explanation. S6. Experiment 2 included two additional measures, which were intended to assess self-enhancement in mind -body relevant domains. One measure was a newly devis ed version of the overclaiming task (Paulhus, Harms, Bruce, & Lysy, 2003). Specifically, at each assessment, we showed 2 \u00d7 3 concepts from mind -body relevant domains and instructed participants to report their familiarity with those concepts (0=I never heard of it , 80= I am very YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 9 familiar with it) . For example, under the header \"humanitarian aid organizations,\" we participants ;\" under the header \"forms of meditation,\" we showed concepts \"vipannana meditation,\" \"zen meditation,\" and \"metta meditation.\" What participants di d not know was that one concept under each header was made up and thus does not exist in reality (here: \"international well- being fund\" and \"vipannana meditation\"). For those made -up concepts we know participants' true knowledge; it has to be zeroit is impossible that participants have heard of it. Thus, any knowledge -claim higher than zero on those non- existent concepts are an instantiation of overclaiming and thus reflect self - enhancement ( Paulhus et al., 2003). At each assessment , we presented a different set of 2 \u00d7 3 concepts from mind- body relevant domains . We used Paulhus et al.'s (2003) common sense formulae to calculate an overclaiming index and an actual knowledge index. The two indices were positively related. Thus, following Gebauer, Sedikides, and Sc hrade (2017), we controlled for actual knowledge in our overclaiming analyses and we did so via the residuat ion method (John & Robins, 1994). The overclaiming indices ' internal consistencies were low (.08 s.52, =.35). Also, t he overclaiming task has not been used as a measure of state self-enhancement before. Hence, it is unclear whether th is task is a suitable measure of state self-enhancement and thus whether one can expect effects of our manipulation on overclaiming . Together, it is perhaps unsurprising that the results from the overclaiming task diverged from all other results of Experiments 1- 2. Specifically, a multi- level analysis revealed no significant effect of medi tation on overclaiming, B revealed evidence \"barely worth mentioning \" (Jeffreys, 1961) for the ego -quieting hypothesis over the SCP -universal hypothesis, BF -+=3. The other additional measure was a newly devised criterion discrepancy measure (Paulhus, Lysy, & Yik, 1998). Criterion discrepancy measures operationalize self - enhancement as the discrepancy between actual performance in a domain of interest and self - perceived performance in that domain. We focused on the domain of emotional intellige nce, because we assumed that emotional intelligence is a mind -body relevant domain. (We did not validate our assumption.) To measure emotional intelligence (i.e., actual performance) , each YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 10 assessment included two items from the Mayer -Salovey -Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT; Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2002). T he first item showed a portrait photo and asked participants to indicate the degree to which the face on the photo expresses each of five emotions (e.g., \"happiness,\" \"fear,\" strong ). The second item showed a picture (e.g., a photo from a rocky coast) and asked participants to indicate the degree to which that picture expresses each of five emotions (e.g., \"happi ness,\" To assess emotional intelligence self -perceptions (i.e., self -perceived performance) we asked the following question directly after each M SCEIT item: \"We are interested i n how you evaluate your performance on this emotional intelligence item: How accurately did you detect the feelings expressed by the face/photo \" (1=totally inaccurately , 81=totally accurately ). We calculated a criterion -discrepancy index for each assessmen t using the residuation method (John & Robi ns, 1994). The criterion -discrepancy indices ' internal consistencies were modest (.53s.70, =.62). Also , the validity of emotional intelligence measuresincluding the MSCEITis controversial (Maul, 2012) . Together, the results of this criterion -discrepancy measure should be interpreted with caution. Specifically, a multi- level analysis revealed no significant effect of medi tation on emotional intelligence criterion discrepancies , B=.06 =.06, for the SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego -quieting hypothesis (BF -+=5). If anything, then, the overall result across those two additional measures tends to support slightly the SCP -universal hypothesis. Irrespectively, when computing the self -enhancement g-factor on the basis of all self -enhancement measures (the three validated ones from the main text and the two non- validated ones) the main -text results replicated: Supporti ng the SCP - universal hypothesis, we found higher self -enhancement in the meditation condition than in the control condition, B =.12, 95% CI [.04, .21], SE SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego- quieting hypothes is by factor BF +- =287\"extreme\" evidence for the SCP -universal hypothesis . That evidence should be considered together with three additional pieces of evidence: Experiment 1's self -centrality results, Experiment 1's self -enhancement results, and Experiment 2's self -centrality results. YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 11 All four pieces of evidence lead to the same conclusion and together furnish decisive support for the SCP -universal hypothesis at the expense of the ego -quieting hypothesis. S7. In Experiment 2, we ass essed self -centrality, self -enhancement, and well -being with the following items. Self -centrality: The items started with the stem \"How central is it for you...\" and continued as follows: \"...to be a loving person?,\" \"...to be person?,\" \"...to be free from bias ?,\" \"...to be an understanding person?,\" \"...to be free from envy?,\" \"...to be \"...to be free from egotism?\" ( 1=not at all central me, 81= very central to me). Better -than- average: The items started with the stem \" In comparison to the average participant of this study, ...\" and continued as follows: \"...I am a loving person,\" \"...I \"...I am caring person,\" \"...I am free from bias ,\" \"...I am an understanding person,\" \"...I am free from envy,\" \"...I am \"...I am free from egotism\" ( 1=very much below average, 81 =very much above avera ge). Communal narcissism: We used the full 16- item Communal Narcissism Inventory, which can be found in Gebauer et al. (2012). Self -esteem: We used the full 10- item Self -Esteem Scale, which can be found in Rosenberg (1965). Hedonic well - being: We used the following nine items to assess hedonic being's -coded), and \"I feel blue\" (reverse- coded). We used the full 5- item Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess hedonic well -being's cognitive component (1= absolutely wrong, 81=absolutely right ), and the items of that scale can be found in Diener , Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin (1985). Eudemonic well -being: \"I judge myself by what I think is important, not by the values of what others think is important,\" \"The demands of everyday life often get me down,\" \" For me, life has been a continuous process of learning, changing, and growth,\" \"Maintaining close relationships has been difficult and frustrating for me,\" \"Some people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them,\" \" In many ways, I feel disappointed about my achievements in life,\" \" I tend to be influenced by people with strong opinions,\" \" In general, I feel I am in charge of the situation in which I live, \" \"I gave up trying to make big YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 12 improvements or changes in my life a long time ago, \" \"People would describe me as a giving person, willing to share my time with others, \" \"I sometimes feel as if I' ve done all there is to do in life,\" \" I like most aspects of my personality \" (1=absolutely wrong, 81= absolutely right ). Experiment 2 contained two additional dependent variables. We included them for a different project , and they are irrelevant to the present article (i.e., they did not tap into self - centrality, self -enhancement, or well -being). One measure was Neff's (2003) Self - Compassion Scale in its 6 -item short- form (Dyllick -Brenzinger, 2010) . The other measure contained 10 vignettes. Each briefly described an ambiguous behavior that can be interpreted as a display of weakness or strength. For example, one vignette read: \"If I am the first to apologize after a fight with my relationship partne r, I display...\" ( 1=weakness , 81= strength) . Experiment 2 was the first study to administer this newly devised measure. S8.

The effect of meditation on each self -enhancement measure was as follows. Better -than- average: Before testing the effect of meditation on better -than-average judgments, it is vital to insure that there was no worse -than-average effect in the control condition. Therefore, we computed each participant 's mean better -than-average judgment across assess ments in this condition. Participants indeed judged themselves as better -than- average (i.e., above \" 41\") regarding their meditation skills, M =51.39, 95% CI [49.70, 53.07], t(159)=12.17. In other words, participants in the control condition self -enhanced , and thu, a positive effect of meditation on the better -than-average measure indicates that participants in the meditation condition self -enhanced even more than participants in the control condition. Supporting the SCP -universal hypothesis, we found higher self -enhancement in the meditation condition than in the control condition, B =.13, 95% CI [.03, .23], SE favored the SCP -universal hypothesis over the ego -quieting hypothesis by factor BF +-=233\"extreme\" evidence for the SCP -universal hypothesis .

S10. Parallel to Experiment 1 (see S5 ), we tested the alternative explanation that the findings are driven by meditation beginners, who may have not yet acquired the necessary experience and skill for meditation to unfold its ego -quieting effect. Hence, we examined the cross -level interactions between meditation (vs. control) \u00d7 expertise (i.e., years of practice) on self-centrality and on self -enhancement (g -factor). Expertise neither moderated the meditation effect on self -centrality, B=-.05, 95% CI [ -.16, .05], SE =.05, t the meditation effect self -enhancement, B =.001, 95% CI [ -.09, .09], SE =.05, t =0.03. Once again, the results clearly favor the SCP -universal hypothesis over its alternative explanation. YOGA AND MEDITATION BOOST SELF -ENHANCEMENT 21 SUPPLEMENT REFERENCES Diener, E. D., Emmons, R.
