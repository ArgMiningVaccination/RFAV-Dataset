It's important to remember that vaccines offer protection against a range of serious diseases, not just the coronavirus. Before embarking on back-to-school shopping and capturing those first day pictures, ensure that your family has the necessary immunizations to start the school year safely. Adhering to a Vaccination Schedule The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a recommended [vaccination schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) for newborns and children. While infants receive essential vaccinations during their first years of life, additional boosters are necessary for school-aged children. These include vaccines for [measles, mumps, and rubella](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#note-mmr)(MMR), [varicella](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#note-varicella) (VAR), and an [annual flu shot](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#note-flu). It's also crucial to ensure children receive diphtheria, [meningococcal shot](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html#note-mening). COVID-19 Vaccination for Children COVID-19 continues to pose a threat, even as we return to normal life and the pandemic no longer tops the news. [Vaccines](https://www.altamed.org/vaccine#slidein-content-modal-4254) are approved for children as young as six months old. If your child is unvaccinated, multiple vaccine series are available, depending on their age: Pfizer-Biontech Bivalent Vaccine: - Children 6 months to 4 years old - 3 doses - Children 5 years and older - 1 dose Moderna Bivalent Vaccine: - Children 6 months to 5 years old - 2 doses - Children 6 years and older - 1 dose If your child is between 6 months to 5 years old and has already received one or more monovalent doses, your health care team will provide you information on current recommendations based on your vaccine history. Maintaining Prevention Habits Given the ease with which COVID-19 and other viruses can spread, it's crucial for children to adopt healthy habits. These include: - Practicing washing hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. - Avoiding close contact with sick individuals. - Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the crook of an arm. - Wearing masks in public when you or a family member are sick. Establishing a New Routine In addition to vaccines and COVID-19 prevention measures, it's important to be prepared and establish routines for the new school year. Ensure that your child's [school or care](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/index.html) facility has your updated contact information for emergency purposes. Regularly check your children for signs of illness, including: - Fever - Cough - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Body aches - Stay informed about potential COVID-19 exposures and know whom to contact at the school in such cases. Reinforce proper hand-washing techniques at home and emphasize their importance. Help your child develop daily routines for school, such as using hand sanitizer and a water bottle, as well as washing hands immediately upon returning home. Stay Informed and Seek Support Engage in meaningful conversations with your child after school to understand their experiences, and stay attuned to reports of excessive coughing, classroom disruptions, or students leaving school premises due to illness. Being aware of the happenings in their school environment can directly impact your home environment. Dealing with Change At AltaMed, we understand the challenges families face during these times.

Even if they and their immediate families have stayed healthy, these crises have taken a toll on young people. From the outrage over the murders of countless unarmed Black people at the hands of the police and the racism it put on display, to the sadness of missing important life milestones, and the anxiety they surely feel from all of the bad news out there, our youth need our support more than ever. It's natural that many of our children are [sad and grieving](/articles/grief-sadness-and-your-mental-health), but increasingly, health experts worry about [long-term mental health issues](https://www.northwell.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/news/insights/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-covid-19). While it's true that children are often tougher, smarter, and more resilient than we give them credit for, we need to take their mental health seriously. Here are a few ways you can support your children. Let Your Kids Be Sad and Grieve As a parent, it's natural that you want to protect your child from pain. However, denying them or trying to distract them from their sadness is actually doing them a big disservice. According to AltaMed's Director of Behavioral Health, Sandra Pisano, PsyD, this can make your child less resilient, which means they may have a harder time bouncing back from future sadness and disappointment. To help your child develop this important resiliency, help them participate in creative and playful activities. \"Creativity and play stimulate the \"pleasure\" and \"calming\" parts of the brain, which in turn prevents or reduces sad and fearful reactions,\" Dr. Pisano says. You might consider challenging your child to draw or write a story about what they're feeling. This will stimulate their creativity while allowing them to honestly process their thoughts. Communicate Honestly but Optimistically Even if your first instinct is to protect your kids from the harsh realities of current events, this could backfire. To some degree, your kids know what's going on - and if they aren't getting the full picture, they are probably imagining that things are much worse than they really are. [Communicate with them honestly and frequently](/articles/talking-your-child-about-covid-19), including discussions about the impact of recent events, especially if your family or friends have been directly affected. Be straightforward and include reasons for optimism, too - for example, point to how individuals and communities across the country have pulled together to offer support for one another during these uncertain times. Introduce Them to Mindfulness Maybe you've heard about mindfulness at your job or from a social media influencer. It's the practice of being present: slowing down, doing one thing at a time, and focusing on living in each moment. Mindfulness can help kids deal with anxiety and negative emotions, but it also has many other positive benefits, such as helping them make better decisions and improving their self-esteem. And, if they learn mindfulness at an early age, they can use it for the rest of their lives. If you're new to the concept, there's a simple exercise you both can practice together. When you or your child find yourself in a stressful or uncomfortable situation, just STOP: S: Stop. Whatever you're doing, take a time-out. T: Take a breath. As you breathe, tune everything out but the feeling of pulling air into your body. O: Observe. Notice what is happening, and your thoughts and feelings, too. P: Proceed. Whatever you do next, think about what you've experienced in this moment. Some people who practice mindfulness combine it with meditation, but you don't have to - and neither do your kids. The best way to teach your kids mindfulness is to practice it yourself, and then together. Limit Their Intake of News Thanks to social media and being home all the time, we're all seeing [more news than ever](/articles/be-careful-where-you-get-your-coronavirus-news) - and many of us are finding that it's terrible for our mental health. An easy way to limit the intake of news is by [limiting device usage and screen time](/articles/busting-myths-around-screen-time-balance-key-during-quarantine). Think about creating device-free zones or times - for example, no devices at the dinner table or an hour before bedtime. You can also make time for your family to watch or read the news then talk about it. Try to speak about the news honestly, while also emphasizing any positive aspects, and discuss what you can do to keep your family safe, healthy, and connected to loved ones during this time. Keep Providing a Healthy Environment One of the best ways to support your child is by continuing to maintain a nurturing, stable environment. - Make sure you [create structure and routine](/articles/why-having-routine-during-quarantine-so-important) in their daily lives. - Even if you want to spoil them or give in to requests for fast food, continue to cook healthy, balanced meals - [good nutrition can make a big difference in their moods](/articles/link-between-food-and-mood-its-not-all-your-head) (as well as your own). - Keeping them healthy means keeping them on their [vaccine schedule](/articles/child-immunizations-what-why-when). This is more important than ever since many children have missed their shots, which could put your child at risk when schools start to open up. - Kids require more sleep than we do - even teenagers require 8-9 hours a night, so help them get a [good night's sleep](/articles/10-easy-tips-better-nights-sleep). Recognize the Signs that Something's Not Right We all know kids - especially teenagers - can be moody. However, look out for these clear signs that there could be a bigger problem. - Noticeable changes in personality and temperament - Fatigue or claiming to be tired all the time - Anger or acting out - children often mask their depression with aggressive behavior - Socially withdrawn - Difficulty thinking or concentrating - Expressing feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness - Talk of self-harm or suicide Get Them Help If They Need It Depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues are real, and they can have serious consequences for children if left untreated. If you believe something is wrong, talk to your pediatrician. They may be able to give you additional guidance or refer you to a [Behavioral Health specialist](/behavioral-health-services). Our pediatricians are taking appointments now - your child may be able to have a [virtual visit](/telephone-health-visits), but in-person visits are required for immunizations.

Fueling up for Maximum Health Your body is a spectacular example of bioengineering genius. It is the human equivalent of a finely tuned, world-class automobile. At least, that's what it was intended to be. Finely tuned, world-class automobiles also require proper maintenance (regular check-ups) and the right fuel (diet). Your digestive system is the equivalent of the fuel system on a car. High-octane fuel goes in and the fuel injectors get that gas through the engine, burning at peak efficiency for either the greatest gas mileage or highest level of performance. If your fuel is garbage, your car slows down and you reduce the efficiency of the whole machine. It's the same with how you fuel your body. Highly processed foods like fast food, chips, snacks, canned foods, and [foods with added sugars](/articles/8-faqs-reveal-not-so-sweet-truth-about-added-sugar) will kill the good bacteria that work to keep you at your best. Gut Basics Between your mouth and anus are [30 feet of tubing](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/05/keeping-your-gut-check) that moves everything you consume by mouth through your body. Along the way that food and drink is broken down and absorbed into your blood stream as fuel. Whatever isn't absorbed is eliminated as waste. Given the twists and turns along that route, it's common for some problems to arise. Conditions like acid reflux or irritable bowel syndrome affect as many as 70 million Americans. Stress and genetics play a factor in those conditions, but so do poor sleep habits, a lack of fiber, how often you eat, when you eat, and not drinking enough water. Some things you can do to improve your gut health: - Eat slower \u2014 Chewing your food well can help you swallow less air and help you know when you're full. - Eat smaller meals \u2014 Packing your stomach can cause reflux and slow digestion. - Set a cutoff time \u2014 Your digestive system works better in the morning and during the daytime, so limit eating at night. - Manage stress \u2014 Digestion is tougher when you're stressed out. - Make it routine \u2014 Sometimes your gut reacts better to a schedule. - Consider probiotics \u2014 These are fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut which supplement your gut bacteria. Talk to your doctor. Dietary Boosts It might be great if there was one thing you could eat to keep your diet healthy and digestive system working the way it should. That would also be boring. Variety is the spice of life, after all. So, it's good to know there are several foods that will help you stay healthy. - Beans \u2014 Black, kidney, red, and garbanzo beans are great sources of fiber. So are peas and soybeans. They are easy to add to recipes. - Berries \u2014 Eat them plain or add them to cereal. They're just as nutritious frozen. - Fish \u2014 Eat it fresh, frozen, or canned. Salmon, tuna, herring, trout, anchovies, and sardines are all good options. - Leafy greens \u2014 Collard greens, spinach, kale, and mustard greens are all good sources of fiber. You can add them to soups or stews, and of course, salads. - Nuts \u2014 Almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and walnuts are good sources of plant protein and healthy fats. - Olive oil \u2014 Use it instead of butter in recipes or when saut\u00e9ing food. - Tomatoes \u2014 They're high in vitamin C and can be used in salads, sauces, and soups. Just limit the ketchup which is loaded with sugar. - Vegetables \u2014 We're talking about fibrous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, greens, radishes, and turnips. They are full of fiber and vitamins. Steam them, stir-fry them in olive oil, or buy them frozen and use them in soups and casseroles. - Whole grains \u2014 Whole wheat bread and oatmeal can give your gut bacteria something to break down for a while, which is good. It gives sustained energy. - Yogurt \u2014 Look for low-fat or no-fat. It's rich in calcium and protein and it also has good bacteria which helps maintain gut health. You can use it as a substitute for sour cream and mayonnaise in dips. We're Here for You AltaMed can help you answer questions about getting on a healthy regimen. We have registered dieticians to assist with creating a healthier diet for you. We can also help put together an exercise plan, and our [Behavioral Health Services](/behavioral-health-services) can help you with techniques to deal with stress.
