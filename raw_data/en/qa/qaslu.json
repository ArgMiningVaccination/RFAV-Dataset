The active metabolic form is the pyridoxine precursor, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P), because it enters directly into the functioning metabolic cycle. Usually, supplementing 25-50 mg. of B6 three times daily will help reduce the symptoms of morning sickness. Occasionally, higher amounts are needed. If these higher levels are used, it is wise to continue smaller amounts for a while to prevent pyridoxine withdrawal in mother or baby. (Excerpt from Nutritional Programs for Pregnancy by Elson M. Haas, M.D.) Large doses of pyridoxine can cause peripheral neuropathy. Thiamin/Vitamin B1 is crucial as deficiency exacerbates the symptoms of HG and may cause life-threatening complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy within 2 weeks of poor intake or HG. [Vitamin K deficiency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=vitamin+k+deficiency+hyperemesis+gravidarum) can result in facial and limb deformities in the child, as well as maternal clotting complications. Other supplements helpful in morning sickness include vitamins B12, C, D, E, fish oil, magnesium, and potassium. Fish oil or fatty acids is associated with [lower premature birth rates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=fatty+acid+premature+birth), and [lower allergy rates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=breastfeeding+fish+oil+allergy+prevention) in the child if taken while breastfeeding. Vitamin K and vitamin C taken together may provide some symptom relief for some women with mild symptoms. (Merkel RL. The use of menadione bisulfite and ascorbic acid in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 1952; 64:416-18.) Note: Due to muscle atrophy and increased pain sensitivity, it is recommended that intramuscular injections be avoided in HG patients. "}
