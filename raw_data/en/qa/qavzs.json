A great way to do that is an aromatherapy detox.", "sitename": "Starchaser-Healing Arts", "date": "2023-01-29", "cleaned_text": "Lots of people undertake some form of detoxing and rejuvenation in the spring. For example, some common ways people choose to detox are to emphasize exercise, exposure to fresh air and sunlight, lighter foods, fasting, and a trip to the spa. These are all good practices. But, why not add aromatherapy and get a bigger, more enjoyable bang for the effort? Essential oils and aromatherapy also help detox the body, tone the digestive and elimination systems, and rejuvenate the skin. Two excellent ways to add aromatherapy to your detox program are scrubs and self-massage (i.e., Abhyanga). Aromatherapy Detox - Juniper - (Citrus limon), Mandarin (Citrus reticulata), - Orange (Citrus sinensis) and - Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Aromatherapy Detox Choosing the right application for an aromatherapy detox is important as well. Here are some useful aromatherapy detox applications. Salts and Scrubs Salt and scrubs are wonderful for a stimulating detox. This abrasive action of salts and scrubs stimulates and exfoliates the skin and improves circulation in both the physical and energy bodies. Scrubs and manual manipulation of muscles activate lymphatic flow and the elimination of toxins from the body. Natural sugar and salts such as Epson, sea, and dead sea salt are more abrasive but, if finely ground, they are less abrasive and still offer beneficial stimulation. Salts contain minerals and Epson salt is high in magnesium. Plant-based scrubs such as finely ground nuts or fruit kernels add a bit of natural abrasive action as well as nourishment. Natural clays draw toxins from under the skin. Many clays also contain minerals that help rejuvenate the skin and nourish the body. Natural clays are a soft and soothing way to detox the skin. To enhance detoxification, add just a few drops (no more than 10 drops) of essential oils to one oz of salts, scrubs, or clays. Be sure to select essential oils that are appropriate for the application and use the right dilution. Facial skin and aged skin are more sensitive and reactive than the skin of the body so start with less. Those extracted from citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, grapefruit, and mandarin) can cause skin irritation, but are typically fine when diluted and applied to the skin in the form of a scrub. Massage and Abhyanga [Abhyanga](http://www.mapi.com/ayurvedic-knowledge/massage/benefits-of-an-ayurvedic-abhyanga-massage.html) is a type of massage and plays an important role in Ayurvedic practice and healing. The idea is to cover and stroke the whole body with lots of warm all-natural vegetable oil. Abhyanga is a great way to detox and nourish the skin and body. It can be used for drawing toxins from the skin and addressing cellulite, a symptom of congested lymph. Massage is a great way to activate the muscles and lymph and stimulate the circulation and elimination of toxins through the lymph. Add essential oils to the abhyanga using less than 10 drops per oz, but as many as 12-15 can be used. Regular, even daily self-massage is an ideal detoxing practice. Dry Brushing While technically not an aromatherapy detox application, dry brushing combined with an aromatherapy detox enhances the detoxification process. Dry brushing moves energy and stimulates circulation and lymph, removing toxins in the process. But, dry brushing doesn't call for oils or aromatic essential oils. In fact, no oils, creams, water, or other substances are used. Instead, a firm but soft brush is used to stroke the skin in a specific way: long surface strokes toward the heart for long areas of the body such as the arms and legs, and circular strokes for joints and the stomach. Dry brushing can be followed by a massage or abhyanga. For More On Detoxing, see: - My blog posts on: - Virtual and in-person [Personal Growth, Natural Healing, and Updated March 01, 2023 "}
