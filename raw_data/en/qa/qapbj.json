The incorporation of adjuvants into vaccine formulations is aimed at enhancing, accelerati ng and prolonging the specific immune response towards the desired response to vaccine antig ens. Advantages of adjuvants include the enhancement of the immunogenicity of antigens, modification of the nature of the immune response, the reduction of the antigen amount needed for a successful immunisation, the reduction of the frequency of booster immunisati ons needed and an improved immune response in elderly and immunocompromised vaccinees. Selectively, adjuvants can be employed to optimise a desired immune response, e.g. with respect to immunoglobulin classes and induction of cytotoxic or helper T lymphocyte responses. In addition, certain adjuvants can be used to promote antibody responses at mucosal surfaces. Interest in vaccine adjuvants has been gr owing rapidly for several reasons. Vaccine manufacturers and public health authorities, e.g. WHO, have established ambitious goals for enhancing present vaccines and for developing new ones, and new vaccine candidates have emerged over the past years against infectious, allergic and autoimmune diseases and also for cancer and fertility treatment. In many cases, because of their low immunogenicity these vaccines require adjuvants. New technologies in the fields of analytical biochemistry, macromolecular purification, recombinan t technology, and a better understanding of immunological mechanisms and disease pathogenesis have helped to improve the technical basis for adjuvant development and application. Adjuvants can be classified according to th eir source (natural, synthetic or endogenous), mechanism of action, or physical or chemical properties. The current most common described adjuvant classes are listed in footnote 2. Adjuvant activity is a result of multiple factors and an enhanced immune response obtained with one antigen cannot as a rule be extrapolated to another antigen. Individual antigens vary in their physical, biological and immunogeni c properties and antigens may have different needs for help from an adjuvant. Adjuvants should be chosen based on the type of immune response desired and should be formulated with the antigen in such a way that the optimal type of response with the minimal side effects, is obtained. The major means by which adjuvants may exert their activities are: (i) presentation of the antigen, defined by the physical appearance of the antigen in the vaccine; (ii) antigen/adjuvant uptake; (iii) distribution (targeting to specific cells); (iv) immune potentiation/modulation which includes activities that regulate both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the ensuing immune responses; (v) the protection of the antigen from degradation and elimination. In general, the mode of action of adsorbants and particulate adjuvants involves presentation of the antigen to the immune system, whereas th e microbial, synthetic and endogenous adjuvants act by direct stimulation or modulation of the i mmune system. In addition to their role in the presentation of the antigen to the immune system, the mode of action of emulsions is to promote slow antigen release and protection from rapid elimination. The use of repository adjuvants like EMEA 2005 5 / 1 8 mineral salts is accompanied by the formation of an inflammatory focus at the site of injection which may lead to the synthesis of pro-infla mmatory cytokines and stimulation of innate immunity important for the initial steps of the immune response. Quality evaluation of a vaccine/adjuvant form ulation therefore covers aspects such as demonstration of the compatibility of the adjuvant (s) with the antigenic component(s) present in the vaccine, proof of an adequate and consistent association of the antigen with the adjuvant, demonstration that no significant de-association take s place in the course of the shelf-life, degree of association throughout the shelf life, effect of the adjuvant on the ability to assay components, biochemical purity and pyrogenicity. As an exampl e of association, adsorption is specific for aluminium hydroxide gels, aluminium phosphate gels, calcium phosphate gels and ISCOMS, whilst ionic interaction occurs with charged di methyl dioctadecyl ammonium (DDA) micelles. For emulsions or liposomes the mechanism is encapsulation. With saponin derivatives or other extracts, interactions with antigens are lipophilic/hydrophilic or ionic. Many adjuvants have been developed in th e past, but were never accepted for routine vaccination because of safety concerns, e.g. acute toxicity and the possibility of delayed side effects. Therefore, the benefits of an adjuvant in a vaccine must be weighed against the risk of any adverse reaction inherent to it. The current attitude regarding risk-benefit of vaccination favours safety over efficacy when a vaccine is given to a healthy population. However, in high- risk groups, including patients with cancer and AI DS, and for other 'therapeutic vaccines', an increased level of toxicity may be acceptable if the benefit of the vaccine is substantial. Therefore, non-clinical safety evaluation should be addressed when relevant. Even if no serious adverse effects are observed in an extensive non-clinical toxicological and safety study, it cannot be guaranteed that the new vaccine/adjuvant formulation presents no risks to vaccinees and unexpected events may occur. Unpredictability of adjuvant effects in humans results from a complex interplay between such factors as route of administration, antigen dose and the nature of the antigen. Fo r this reason, a final safety evaluation of the newly developed vaccine formulation can only be conducted on the basis of clinical trials. 2. SCOPE This Guideline addresses the quality, non-clinical a nd clinical issues arising from the use of new or established adjuvants in vaccines. The appli cability of this guideline to established adjuvants (i.e. aluminium hydroxide and aluminium or calcium phosphate) will vary on a case-by-case basis. 2.1. V ACCINES The vaccines1 covered by this document are those that provide immunity against infectious disease. 1 The vaccines may contain one or more of the following: organisms inactivated by chemical or physical means whilst retaini ng adequate immunogenic properties; EMEA 2005 6 / 1 8 Antigens may be in their native state, truncated or modified following introduction of mutations, detoxified by chemical or physical means and/or aggregated, polymerised or conjugated to a carrier (see also Ph.Eur. 04/2005:0153). So far, adjuva nts have not been used in live vaccines for human use but this cannot be excluded in the future. The principles of this guideline should also be applicable to quality and non-clinical aspects of 'therapeutic vaccines' (e.g. 'anti-idiotypic vaccines', allergen specific immunotherapy and vaccines used to treat infected persons); however, clinical aspects of 't herapeutic vaccines' are not within the scope of this document. 2.2. A DJUVANTS A vaccine adjuvant2 is a component that potentiates the i mmune responses to an antigen and/or modulates it towards the desired immune responses. An active ingredient of a combined vaccine that has an adjuvant effect on other active ingredients of the vaccine is excluded from th e scope of this Guideline. Also excluded are carriers for haptens, antigens (e.g., CRM 197, meningococcal OMP, tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid that are used to conjugate polysaccharides) and excipients such as HSA. More than one adjuvant may be present in the final vaccine product. They may be combined together with a single antigen or all antigens pres ent in the vaccine, or each adjuvant may be combined with one particular antigen. Whatever the case, the guidance contained within this Guideline is applicable to each adjuvant and each antigen-adjuvant combination, as appropriate. living organisms that are naturally avirulent or that have been treated to attenuate their virulence whilst retaining adequate immunogenic properties; antigens extracted from or secret ed by the infectious agent; antigens produced by recombinant DNA technology; a live, recombinant vector producing antigens in vivo in the vaccinated host plasmid DNA antigens produced by chemical synthesis in vitro . The term 'vaccines' is used as defined by Ph. Eur. Other vaccines are qualified by terms such as 'therapeutic vaccines' 2 These adjuvants include for instance: Mineral salts, e.g., aluminium hydroxide and aluminium or calcium phosphate gels. Oil emulsions and surfactant based and lip ids), co-glycolide (PLG). Microbial derivatives synthetic), A (MPL), Detox (MPL + monosaccharide), self organise into liposomes), OM-174 (lipid A derivative), CpG motifs (s ynthetic oligonucleotides c ontaining immunostimulatory CpG motifs), modified LT and CT (genetica lly modified bacterial toxins to provide non-toxic adjuvant effects). Endogenous human immunomodulators, e.g., hGM- CSF or hIL-12 (cytokines that can be administered either as protein or plasmid encoded), Immudaptin (C3d tandem array) Inert vehicles, such as gold particles Other novel types of adjuvants not liste d above may be under development and th is guideline applies to these also. EMEA 2005 7 / 1 8 3. QUALITY3 The origin and nature of the adjuvants currently being used or developed is highly diverse. For example, aluminium based adjuvants consis t of simple inorganic compounds, PLG is a polymeric carbohydrate, virosomes can be derived fr om disparate viral particles, MDP is derived from bacterial cell walls, saponins are of plant or igin, squalene is derived from shark liver and recombinant endogenous immunomodulators are derive d from recombinant bacterial, yeast or mammalian cells. Consequently, it is not appropriate to provide a comprehensive list of individual tests that should be performed for a ny particular adjuvant or adjuvant/antigen combination in this Guideline. This guideline should also be read in conjunction with the Guideline on pharmaceutical and biological asp ects of combined vaccines (CPMP/BWP/477/97). The guidance provided below must be applied by adjuvant/vaccine manufacturers as is appropriate for their adjuvant on a case-by-case basis. Relevant Monographs of the Ph.Eur. should be adhered to. For manufacturers of recombin ant protein adjuvants it is useful to consult relevant CHMP and ICH guidelines, for inst ance cell substrates (CPMP/ICH/294/95), viral safety (CPMP/ICH/295/95), rDNA proteins (C PMP/ICH/139/95). Where the adjuvant is a nucleic acid, reference should be made to th e CPMP Note for Guidance on the quality, pre- clinical and clinical aspects of gene tr ansfer medicinal products (CPMP/BWP/3088/99). 3.1. T HE ADJUVANT 3.1.1. Description The nature or chemical composition of the adjuva nt should be described in detail. When more than one adjuvant is used and/or when an adj uvant has more than one component, the function of each adjuvant and/or each component should be described to the extent that it is known. 3.1.2. Manufacture The manufacture of the adjuvant should be describe d in detail. Special attention should be given to the source material for the adjuvant especially if this is biological in nature and any special considerations that may apply. Parameters that are critical in conferring the correct physical, biochemical, biological or adsorptive properties of the adjuvant should be defined. Attention should be paid to the use of any material of ruminant origin and if so, compliance with the Note for Guidance on minimising the risk of transm itting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products (EMEA/410/01) is required. 3.1.3. Characterisation The results an assessment of a number of parameters used to characterise the adjuvant should be described. Critical parameters should be identifie d and described. Such parameters are likely to be part of the routine testing of batches of the adjuvant. Other parameters will also be analysed to characterise the adjuvant and some of thes e may also form part of routine testing. The 3 The Quality-related data on the adjuvant should be presented in a self-standing section in 3.2.S of the CTD dossier with the same relevant subsections as for the active substance. EMEA 2005 8 / 1 8 parameters which define an adjuvant will depend on the nature of the adjuvant and may include, but will not necessarily be limited to: chemical composition (qualitative and quantitative) physical characteristics (e.g., visual appear ance, density, viscosity, pH, size and size distribution, surface charge) biochemical characteristics purity (e.g., endotoxin content, bioburden, manufacturing residuals) 3.1.4. Routine testing A list of tests to be applied routinely to the ad juvant should be defined as appropriate for the adjuvant in question and should be based on the para meters used to characterise the adjuvant as detailed above. Specifications should be set. 3.1.5. Stability Relevant physico-chemical and/or biological pr operties, based on the characteristics of the adjuvant, should be employed in assessing the stab ility of the adjuvant during storage. Stability- indicating parameters may include structure and antigen adsorption/binding characteristics. 3.2. A DJUVANT /ANTIGEN COMBINATION 3.2.1. Development and manufacture of the combination Combining the antigen with the adjuvant is a crucial aspect of the final adjuvant-antigen combination. The mechanism of association and association efficiency between antigen and adjuvant should be defined and described. Aspect s that are critical for the biological properties of the adjuvant-antigen combination (e.g. adsorption, binding characteristics) should be identified and monitored. If more than one ad juvant is to be incorporated, appropriate information for each adjuvant should be supplie d and compatibility studies should be performed on the intended combination of adjuvant(s) and antigen(s). The entire manufacturing process of the adjuvant -antigen combination should be described in detail. An intermediate bulk may be formed during antigen and adjuvant combination, prior to formulation. In other cases, formulation will take place simultaneously with the adjuvant and antigen combination (final bulk). Alternativel y combining the antigen with the adjuvant, formulation and filling (final product) may be a single process. Any excipient or diluent added to the adjuvant-a ntigen combination during the preparation of the final bulk (formulation) should not adversely affect the potency of the vaccine or the association of the antigen(s) with the adjuvant(s). In each case, the characterisation, routine testing and stability testing of the intermediate bulk, final bulk and the final product, where relevant , must be performed as detailed below. The EMEA 2005 9/ 1 8 vaccine manufacturer should clearly delineate and ju stify the tests that are being performed at each stage. 3.2.2. Characterisation The adjuvant-antigen combination should be characterised as appropriate. This may include the level and consistency of association of the antigen with the adjuvant, the integrity of the antigen in association with the adjuvant, the effect of adjuvant on the ability to assay the antigen and the extent of release of the antigen from the adj uvant (stability). Other parameters may include chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., particle size, viscosity). 3.2.3. Routine testing Tests for routine verification of the adjuvant-an tigen combination should be identified, described and validated. Such tests should be based on the parameters assessed during full characterisation of the adjuvant-antigen combination. 3.2.4. Stability The long-term stability of the adjuvant-antigen combination should be assessed investigating relevant physical and biochemical properties. Th e extent of dissociation of antigen from the adjuvant and its integrity may be important parameters. 3.2.5. Multiple antigen/adjuvant combinations If the final vaccine product comprises an antigen (s) in addition to the antigen present in the adjuvant-vaccine combination, then the effect of the adjuvant on this additional antigen(s) must be assessed using relevant tests for that antigen. Similarly, any effects of an additional antigen(s) on the adjuvant-antigen complex must be assessed. If the final vaccine product comprises more th an one adjuvant-antigen combination, testing appropriate to the nature of the adjuvants (whe ther identical or not) will be required including any adverse effects occurring between the different adjuvant-antigen combinations. 3.3. F INAL PRODUCT The final vaccine product should be subjected to tests for potency, identity and stability. Relevant requirements from existing CHMP gui delines and Ph. Eur. Monographs should be adhered to. Specific considerations for testing and stab ility studies should be defined and validated. Interference by an adjuvant(s) on an antigen(s) may have an impact on the performance of certain standard tests at the level of the final product or formulated final bulk. Whereas alternative methods should be investigated, it may be necessary to extrapolate from tests performed at earlier stages of the production where interference is absent. EMEA 2005 10 / 1 8 4. NON-CLINICAL 4.1. P ROOF OF CONCEPT There are m ajor areas in which adjuvants may exert their activities: Physical presentation of the antigen in the vaccine Optim isation of antigen uptake Targeting to specific cells (dendritic cells, La ngerhans cells, m acrophages, and others), e.g. by mune potentiation and modulation, e.g. through intracellular transport and processing of antigens, association with MHC class I or II m olecules and the expansion of T cells, with different profiles of cytokine production. The rationale for the proposed effects of an adjuvant should be given. The increased im munological response to the adjuvant/antigen combination should be shown in a relevant animal model. It should be considered whether the adjuvant triggers the cells of the innate immune system. Furthermore, it should be show n to what extent the humoral and cellular immune response is activated by the adjuvant given together with the antigen. Data from combinations with other antigens could be used as supportive evidence for understanding the mechanism of action of the adjuvant. Ideally the relevant animal model should demonstrate protection against a lethal challenge of the pathogenic organism (infectious disease). If such a model is not present an animal species in which an immunological response can be induced that resembles the expected human immune response in character should be chosen. Public literature could be used as supportive information for the proof of concept. 4.2. P HARMACOKINETICS Pharmacokinetic studies (e.g. determining serum concentrations of antigens) are not required. (see CPMP/SWP/465/95 Note for Guidance on prec linical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines; WHO Guideline on non-clinical testing of vaccines). In some cases, distribution studies may be of value in unders tanding the mode of action of the adjuvant. 4.3. T OXICITY OF ADJUVANT ALONE The methodology used to study the toxicity of adj uvants should follow the pattern of use of the vaccine. Adjuvanted vaccines might be administered repeatedly at intervals of a few weeks, up to several years. Generally, adjuvants will consis t of a small amount of material, which will be given only a few times in a lifetime. The adjuvant should be tested alone taking into c onsideration its use as an adjuvant in vaccines and the testing strategy should reflect this use. SupersededEMEA 2005 11 / 1 8 Adjuvants can be used in relation with different antigens and are often not very species-specific. They should be tested in two species unless otherwise justified (rodent and non-rodent) Adjuvants belonging to different biological classes might exert a high level of species specificity (e.g. some cytokines), that makes this discussion only theoretical as testing in more than one animal species does not make sense. However, other adjuvants (e.g. oil emulsions) exert less species specificity and based on toxicological pr inciples testing in at least two appropriate species is the default option. The evidence found in the second species does support the evidence in the first one. The choice of species depends primarily on the choi ce of antigen the adjuvant is intended to be combined with. Ideally the selected species should be the same as in which the proof-of-concept has been studied. 4.3.1. Local tolerance The local irritation induced by an adjuvant should be studied depending on the route of administration. For example: - For oral and intranasal adm inistration local and regional tolerance need to assessed. - For injectable vaccines, special consideration should be given to the possibility of induction of later granulom atous reactions as seen for exampl e when using particles and also some mi neral oils. 4.3.2. Induction of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Adjuvants them selves might be immunogenic and te sting should be considered with respect to the induction of hypersensitivity in appropriate m odels (e.g. passive anaphylaxis assa y [ASA]). An adjuvant-induced increase of IgE against the antigen should be considered as a possible concern for induction of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. 4.3.3. Pyrogenicity Adjuvants should be tested with respect to their possible pyrogenic effects. Alternative in vitro tests for fever-inducing substances are under development and should be used if validated. 4.3.4. Systemic toxicity Adjuvants of various classes may be distributed systemically and may induce toxicity in various organs. Protocols should be designed to establish dose-relationships and include repeated administration at intervals reflecting the pr oposed clinical use. Full necropsy and tissue collection should be conducted. Histopathology should always include pivotal organs: heart, lung, brain, liver, kidney, reproductive organs etc. Superseded EMEA 2005 1 2 / 1 8 skin (if the site of administration), primary and secondary immune organs: spleen, thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes (local and distant to the application site) Full tissue examination is recommended in case of novel adjuvants with no prior nonclinical and clinical experience. Toxicity would mainly result from the immunostim ulating effect of the adjuvant, but direct toxicity on non-targeted organs cannot be excl uded. The range of doses may remain relatively low reflecting its clinical use rather than reaching necessarily a maximum tolerated dose. With respect to the endpoints, refer to the Note for Guidance on Repeated Dose Toxicity. 4.3.5. Reproduction toxicity As vaccination programs may include women of childbearing potential, it is of importance to consider the need for reproduction toxicity studi es. Furthermore, vaccines might be intended to be given during pregnancy in order to preven t infectious disease in the young infant through passive immunization. Reproduction toxicity studies with adjuvant intended to be used in this type of vaccines should be performed. The prot ocol should reflect the intended schedule of administration. As the immunological response to the booster might be different from the first response, it should also be considered to give the first dose before mating, while giving the booster during the pregnancy. 4.3.6. Genotoxicity Adjuvants might be derived from biological as well as from synthetic origin. In line with requirements published for biotechnological products (ICH S6) genotoxicity studies for biologically derived adjuvants might not be rega rded as relevant. For synthetic adjuvants the standard battery (ICH S2B) can be seen as th e default position and any deviations should be scientifically justified. 4.3.7. Carcinogenicity As adjuvants are intended to be used only a few times with low dosages th e risk of induction of tumours by these compounds in a direct way is negligable. Furthermore, the action of the adjuvant is to stimulate the immune system, and not to act as a general immunosuppressant, reducing the risk on the spontaneous formation of lymphoid tumours. Therefore, carcinogenicity studies are not needed. 4.3.8. Combination of adjuvants Administration of substances with immunom odulatory properties, along with adjuvants improving the presentation of the antigen may furt her increase adjuvant activity. An appropriate set of toxicity studies should be provided to support its safety of the comb ination in addition of data on each individual component. Toxicity studies with the separate constituents might be seen as pilot studies. A study with the final combination should be done under GLP. Superseded EMEA 2005 1 3 / 1 8 4.4. T OXICITY OF ADJUVANT IN COMBINATION WITH THE PROPOSED ANTIGEN The pre-clinical safety aspects of the combina tion of adjuvant with the proposed antigen should be considered in line with the existing Note for Guidance Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological testing of vaccines CPMP/SWP/465/95. Specific attention should be given to: 4.4.1. Local tolerance Injection of antigens in combination with adj uvants might induce more severe local reactions than after administration of the adjuvant alone. The optimal dose-ratio of adjuvant and antigen with respect to benefit and risk should be explored. 4.4.2. Repeated dose toxicity studies A dosing schedule should be used in accordance with the proposed clinical schedule. In order to ascertain the safety of the repeated schedule (whe re an increase in the severity of the immune response might occur) the number of administrations should be higher than the number planned for human administration. 4.4.3. Characterization of the immune response As a minimal requirement the following non-clinical immunogenicity data are expected: Dose-response studies investigating the effect of different doses of adjuvant combined with different doses of vaccine antigen. Comparative studies to assess the effect of a new adjuvant with reference to a vaccine antigen alone or adjuvanted with a well-established adjuvant The nature and extent of an immune response (humor al and cellular) determines the efficacy of a vaccine. The type of an immune response against the same vacci ne antigen might be different in animals and in man. Thus, these data should be extrapolated only very carefully. On the other hand a proof-of-concept needs to be provided from non-clinical investigati ons before clinical trials can be started. If feasible, further studies in relevant animal models should focus on the more detailed investigation of the immunological mode of action of the new adjuvant (see Proof of Concept, \u00a7 4.1). If a combination of adjuvants is proposed, the ra tionale for this choice should be provided based on experimental data. Superseded EMEA 2005 1 4 / 1 8 5. CLINICAL 5.1. I NTRODUCTION The inclusion of an adjuvant in a vaccine must always be justified. There must be evidence to demonstrate that the benefit in terms of improve ment of the immune response has been achieved without an undue increase in local and systemic adverse reactions. It is critical that the clinical data demonstrate th at the amount of adjuvant used in the vaccine is appropriate to enhance the immune response to the antigen(s), to further direct the immune response towards the intended effect, or to improve the safety profile. In a combination vaccine, the adjuvant should improve the response to at least one of the relevant antigen(s) without exerting a clinically significant detrimental effect on immune responses to any other antigen in the vaccine. Any increase in the rates and/or seve rity of adverse reactions as a consequence of the presence of an adjuvant in a vaccine is of concern. Therefore, the risk associated with the adjuvant must be outweighed by the potential benefit conferred by enhancement of the immune response. This section addresses: The clinical assessment of a novel adjuvant wh en it is to be incorporated either into a novel (i.e. as yet unlicensed) or licensed prophylactic vaccine and The clinical data that would be required to support any change (removal, addition and/or replacement) in the adjuvant content of a licensed vaccine. The general principles covered in this sec tion are applicable to both single antigen and combination vaccines and to any of the possibl e routes of vaccine administration. There are special considerations for the characterisation of the immune response as part of the assessment of safety and efficacy. The various scenarios to be considered include the following (note that the term established adjuvant refers to any such compound that is already included in at least one licensed vaccine to enhance the immunogenicity of one or more antigens): 1. Novel vaccine Inclusion of one or more novel or established adjuvant(s) in a novel vaccine in order to enhance the immune response to one or more antigens or further direct the immune response towards the intended effect. 2. Changes to an already licensed vaccine Changes to already licensed vaccines may be made to enhance or modulate the immune response and/or to improve the safety profile. In special circumstances (e.g. pandemic influenza vaccine) inclusion of an adjuvant may be used in order to reduce the amount of antigen needed. Changes may include: Addition of one or more novel or established adjuvant(s). Superseded EMEA 2005 1 5 / 1 8 Increase in the amount of an adjuvant. Decrease or removal of one or more adjuvant(s) (without replacement). Replacement of one or more adjuvant(s) with one or more novel or established adjuvant(s). 5.2. P RELIMINARY STUDIES Whether the adjuvant is a novel or an esta blished compound, the preliminary studies should establish the effect of the adjuvant on the nature of the immunological responses to the antigen(s) with which it is to be combined. If more than one adjuvant is to be used in a vaccine, then the studies should evaluate the effect(s) of the combination of adjuvants on responses to the antigens. In addition, for a vaccine intended to contain more than one adjuvant/antigen combination, the action of each adjuvant on its intended antigen should be documented. 5.2.1. Effect of the adjuvant on the immunological response In general, the characterisation of the immune response should involve the administration of each antigen that is anticipated in the final product alone and with the adjuvant(s). In the development of combination vaccines, it may be sufficient to compare the combination without adjuvant with the combination plus each adj uvant. These early studies should also provide important, although limited, data on safety. It is likely that these studies will be performed mainly in healthy adults and in relatively small numbers of individuals. If the vaccine is wholly or predominantly intended for use in infants or young children or is very likely to be administered to the elderly, subsequent to studies in healthy adults some data should be obtained from these age groups if possible. The studies should involve a comprehensive assessm ent of the potential effects of the adjuvant on the immune response to all antigens that are to be included in the final product. In addition, the potential that the adjuvant itself might be immunogenic should be explored. The range of tests that will be appropriate will depend on the nature of the antigen and of the adjuvant and cannot be pre-specified in detail in this Note for Guidance. In addition, it is recognised that advances in the assessment of immunological responses may mean that experimental methodologies are used in describing the effects of the adjuvant. Whenever possible, the assessment of the humoral immune response should include the detection and titration of functional antibodies (neutralising, opsonophagocytic or bactericidal, antibodies) against an international standard (WHO or equivalent). Immunoglobulin subclass responses should be investigated. Circulatory and/or secretory IgA may be measured if relevant. It may also be appropriate to estimate other properties of the antibody response such as avidity. Assessment of the cell-mediated component of th e immune response is considered important. It is recommended that studies should monitor an tigen specific T-cell responses (including Th1, Th2 and T regulator cells, and/or relevant cyt okines). The range of te sts performed, with an explanation of the rational for each investigation, should be justified in the application dossier. Superseded EMEA 2005 1 6 / 1 8 It would not be envisaged that the adjuvant would have to be administered alone in these studies. If the adjuvant is novel, there should usually be sufficient safety data from the pre-clinical studies to allow for it to be given with antigen (s) from the outset. The same situation should apply to an established adjuvant when it is to be given at a higher dose than usual or by a new route of administration. However, if there is suspicion that an adjuvant might accumulate, consideration could be given to a pharmacokinetic evaluation in humans. If it is considered that the administration of adjuvant alone in clinical studies might be necessary, it may be appropriate to obtain further scientific /regul atory advice from EU Regulators. 5.2.2. Dose-finding studies It is essential that there should be sufficient data to demonstrate that the amounts of adjuvant and antigen that are chosen for further study re present an acceptable balance between immune responses and the risk of adverse effects. In mo st adjuvant-antigen combinations, the aim will be to use as little as possible of one or both of thes e so as to achieve the required immune response with the minimum of adverse reactions. A pre liminary estimate of the relative amounts of each adjuvant and antigen to be combined should em erge from the investigations, described in 5.2.1,which may overlap with dose-finding studies. The extent of the dose-finding studies that would be considered necessary will be at least partly influenced by the aim of the final product. For example, if it is proposed to incorporate an established adjuvant at a dose that is already in use in at least one licensed product, then it may be more important to focus on different amounts of antigen. Alternatively, if it is proposed to add the adjuvant to the same dose of an antigen or combination of antigens that is already approved in one or more products, then it may be more important to focus on the amount of adjuvant. However, in the case of a novel adjuvant and/or a novel antigen, alone or in combination, more extensive dose-finding studies would likely be necessary. Whenever possible, these studies should be perf ormed in the target population for the vaccine. However, this may, on occasion, prove difficult so that a dose may have to be chosen on the basis of studies in a population that may differ from the target population. Also, when the dose-finding studies fail to point to a single antigen-adj uvant dose, more than one product may have to be evaluated in confirmatory trials. In these cases, it is desirable to characterise the immune response to the chosen antigen-adjuvant combinati ons in at least a subset of subjects who are enrolled into the confirmatory trials. 5.3. C ONFIRMATORY TRIALS 5.3.1. General considerations In general, clinical trials should be randomise d, double blind, controlled trials. The design of the trials should depend on the characteristics of the an tigen /adjuvant formulation. It is anticipated that the majority of trials, especially if a modification is being made to the antigen content of a licensed vaccine, will likely involve only an asse ssment of immune responses against validated immunological correlates for protection. If ther e is no validated immunological correlate for protection, but a formal assessment of efficacy is feasible, the provision of immunogenicity data alone should be justified. Superseded EMEA 2005 1 7 / 1 8 These trials should be performed in the final targ et population. If this spans a wide range of age groups, studies may need to pre-stratify by age group or more than one study may need to be performed. For example, in some instances, the demonstration of enhancement of the immune response to at least one antigen may be reasonably expected to apply in only one or some of the possible age groups. 5.3.2. Possible scenarios 5.3.2.1.New vaccines with a new or established adjuvant The Note for Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines (EWP 463/97) applies whenever the product in question meets the definition for a new vaccine4 as described in the guidance. Therefore, further details will not be discussed herein. 5.3.2.2.Changes to the adjuvant content of a licensed vaccine At least one confirmatory study is needed to support a change(s). The study design will be determined by the primary objective, as follows: Changes for efficacy reasons If the primary objective is to enhance the immune response to one or more antigens, or further direct the immune response towards the intended e ffect, in general the trial should be designed to demonstrate the superiority of the modified ove r the existing product. For combination products, superiority should be shown with respect to the immune response to at least one of the antigens and the study should have the secondary aim of demonstrating non-inferiority with respect to responses to any other antigen(s) that may be pr esent. The demonstration of non-inferiority with respect to other antigens is relevant only if s uperiority is demonstrated with respect to the designated primary efficacy variable(s). The definition of what constitutes superiority and non- inferiority of immune responses must be justified according to the antigen(s) in question. If an adjuvant is to be given at a higher dose than used previously and/or via a different route of administration a specific safety study may need to be considered Whether or not such a study should be wholly performed before first licensu re of the modified product should be discussed with EU Regulators before submitting an application for a marketing authorisation. Changes for safety reasons If the primary objective is driven by (a) safety reason(s), the clinical program should aim to show non-inferiority of the amended vaccine with respect to the existing vaccine in terms of immune responses to each antigen. The definiti on of what constitutes non-inferiority must be 4 New vaccines are those containing antigens not yet described in the Ph.Eur. monographs or WHO requirements, or using a new conjugate for a known antigen, or any new co mbination of known and/or new vaccines. SupersededEMEA 2005 18 / 1 8 justified according to the antigen(s) in questi on. The safety data from this study would be expected to show an improvement in the safety profile. The safety data should allow for estimation of, with a reasonable degree of precision, the likely rates of reactions that may be expected base d on the known properties of the adjuvant(s) and antigen(s). In some cases, it may be appropriate that the data focus on immune mediated reactions. In all instances, the risk-benefit relati onship for the modified product should be at least as favourable as for the existing product. A post-marketing surveillance program should be c onsidered whenever there has been a change in the adjuvant content of an already licensed vaccine. 5.3.3. Statistical considerations The hypotheses to be tested and the statistical met hods to analyse them have to be clearly stated in the trial protocol. The sample size should ensure that the trial has sufficient power to answer its scientific question. For any test on non-infe riority, the non-inferiority margin has to be defined and justified in advance. In planning the analysis and sample size of the clinical trial possible multiplicity issues have to be accounted for appropriately.
