Artemisia is a diverse genus that comprises mostly of perennial and aromatic shrubs and herbs. Artemisia comes under the daisy family, Asteraceae, members of which are characterized by small flower heads and alternate leaves. Most of the species in the Artemisia genus are valued for essential oils or as ornamentals Table of Contents The genus [Artemisia](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Artemisia_(genus)) has about 200 to 400 species. It consists of hardy plants that are rich in volatile oils. The plants in this genus range from tall [shrubs](https://www.homestratosphere.com/types-of-shrubs/) to dwarf herbaceous plants. All members of this genus have alternative leaves small capitula, and tubular florets. They occur as racemose, pendant, paniculate, or capitate inflorescences. Rarely do they occur solitary. The leaves of Artemisia are fern-like and are covered with white hair. Artemisias are found growing in temperate climates of Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere. They are commonly found in areas where there is a dry or semi-dry climate. Artemisia offers a huge variety of herbs for herb lovers. They make outstanding ornamentals for the gardens and are also mainstays for craft shops. Artemisia species make beautiful herb gardens with their attractive foliage. Although there are so many varieties of Artemisia, most of them do not have any showy flowers. Most of the species in the genus Artemisia have white or yellow colored flowers except for some exceptions. There are not many types of Artemisia flowers, however, there are many types of Artemisia that are more commonly known and more widely used than others. Types of Artemisia [Artemisia](https://www.motherearthliving.com/plant-profile/the-many-faces-of-artemisia) genus consists of plants that are annuals, biennials, and perennials. Many species of Artemisia are woody or semi-woody. Some species are invasive, have creeping rootstocks. They have superb foliage that comes in numerous shapes like ferny, lobed, delicately lacy, or broadly strap-shaped. The colors of the foliage range from dark green to silver and grays, at times, sparkling white as well. The species with green foliage have smoother leaves while the gray species have woolly, hairy, or felted leaves. Some of the most popular types of Artemisias have been listed down below. Some of the Artemisia species are ornamentals while some have traditional herbal uses. 1. Southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) [Southernwood](https://www.motherearthliving.com/plant-profile/the-many-faces-of-artemisia) is a sturdy shrublet that is native to southern Europe. They usually grow up to 3 feet or taller. The stems are yellowish-green and have an upright habit of growth. Southernwood has gray-green, aromatic leaves which are finely dissected into segments that are threadlike. The leaves remain fresh throughout the summer season. Its shapeliness can be maintained by pruning the plants hard in spring. They can be trained to form a low hedge. Flowers of Southernwood are yellow-white in the color that blooms from late summer to fall. They grow in loose panicles. The flowers are small, nodding and inconspicuous. Southernwood can be propagated by layering. The branch is pinned down and covered with soil. When the formations of roots begin, the rooted part is severed from the mother plant. The new plant is left undisturbed after the procedure until next spring, after which the plant can be moved to another location. It attracts spittlebugs and tiny [insects](https://www.homestratosphere.com/types-of-insects/) whose larvae reside in froth globs that are attached to the leaves of Southernwood, from where they feed on plant juices. [Southernwood is used as a filler in bouquets and in dried arrangements. It has a pungent aroma, similar to the sage that makes it a significant constituent of moth repellents.](https://www.homestratosphere.com/types-of-artemisia-flowers/) [Preparations of A. abrotanum L.

Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) Wormwood is native to temperature North Africa and Eurasia. This type of Artemisia grows 2 to 4 feet tall. It has gray-green leaves that have a silky texture. The leaves are cut like that of carrot. It is well known for its anthelmintic character (a potent vermifuge) and as an important ingredient of absinthe liqueur. Although its leaves have a bitter taste, slugs still feed on them. Wormwood flowers are pale yellow in color. they are tubular and are clustered in spherical heads that are bent down. These spherical flower-heads are clustered in branches panicles that are leafy. The flowers bloom from early summer to early autumn. Lambrook Silver is a cultivar of common Wormwood that is silver. It grows to a height of 3 feet. It is extremely beautiful. It can be planted in front of a red brick wall or adjacent to plants that have red foliage to make a breathtaking sight. Powis Castle is another cultivar of Wormwood that has silver colored, feathery leaves. Its leaves are finer as compared to Wormwood. Powis Castle is most probably a hybrid between latter species of Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and Artemisia arborescens, which is evergreen Mediterranean species. It is not hardy beyond zone 6 but it can be wintered indoors. Wormwood has a history if being used as a medicinal herb. It is [poisonous](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Artemisia+absinthium) in large quantities. It can cause convulsions, insomnia, and nervous disorders even in small quantities. This is due to the presence of thujone which is a brain stimulant, causing toxicity in excess. The smell of Wormwood is strong enough to onset headaches and nervousness.

Mugwort grows up to 120 centimeters in length and is red in color. The leaves are hairy and the flowers are yellow-brown. mugwort Mugwort, use from prehistory to the present In prehistoric times, people probably ate mugwort as a vegetable, but it may also have been used to season food. The hairs on the underside of the leaf can be scraped off and used as tinder. All parts of the mugwort contain essential oils that can be used to control insects. Interestingly, the Mongols used the plant to repel mosquitoes by burning the leaves. The white smoke chased the mosquitoes away. The Romans used the plant in their shoes against fatigue and pain in the feet, but this remedy remains in use: Dodonaeus mentions it in the 17th century. The plant was known to the Germans and Celts to aid in childbirth. In the Middle Ages, people thought that the mugwort kept the devil at bay. In the garden, the mugwort can cause plants to grow less. The plant was smoked like tobacco instead of the expensive tobacco. Annoyingly, this plant can also cause an allergic reaction during flowering in August and September. Medicine and aid? Mugwort (FLEISCHHAUER, ET.AL., 2017, p. 195) . Thujone is a toxic substance when ingested in large quantities and when ingested for a long time. Mugwort as a tea has a relaxing effect on nervousness and sleep disorders. Mugwort should not be used in early pregnancy due to its stimulant effect. Mugwort helps with menstrual complaints, supports the pancreas and promotes digestion. Mugwort oil works for rheumatism and tired feet. Mugwort helps as a warm foot bath with warming properties for white water, chronic ovarian inflammation and abdominal or bladder catarrh (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). In the past, mugwort root was used against epilepsy, cough, hysteria and cramps. The ground root has remained in use in herbal medicine. Dried mugwort - ready to use. Edible? Leaves and young stems can be picked in April and May and are not yet bitter and slightly aromatic. Mugwort can be added fresh in salad or as a seasoning to dishes. Mugwort is tasty as a seasoning in egg dishes (omelette) and savory pies (quiche). These parts of the mugwort can also be made into liqueurs and teas. The top 10cm of the buds before flowering can be peeled and eaten as a vegetable. The leaves and tops can be dried without stems all year round and can be used as a herb (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). From July to October, the lignified stem with flower can be used as a seasoning. Boil the stem with flour for flavor and remove the stem before serving (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). The seasoning can be used in dishes with meat, game and poultry, but also in sauces. Mugwort can be used in place of wormwood absinthe when making absinthe. Mugwort tastes sweet to bitter. In the second part of the year, the herb is very suitable in fatty dishes (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). mugwort mugwort From the Hunebedcentrum you can walk the Bijvoetpad along dolmens and burial mounds.

However, that does not mean they do not need to be taken care of. - The foremost factor that affects the growth of Artemisia is the type of soil. They need well-drained soil for proper growth. They can grow well in rock [gardens](https://www.homestratosphere.com/types-of-gardens/)and areas with extremely sharp drainage, having long droughts. They will either dry out or rot if they are planted in moist clays or other heavy soil types. If Artemisias are grown in soil that is too moist, they grow very quickly but they flop and fall open. It is always recommended that Artemisia be planted in dry soils. - Artemisia plants grow best in areas that have sun exposures and are warm. When they are planted in part shade, they are a higher risk of flopping and getting infected by the disease. In areas where there are humid summers, Artemisias can get foliar diseases that can result in a decline in the foliage (for which Artemisias are popular). it is important that the site of growth is well-ventilated and receives full sun. - Some types of Artemisia grow so rapidly that they are considered invasive. They grow by underground stems or rhizomes. A check can be kept by planting Artemisias in containers or reining them in regularly by digging up runners. Artemisas are not known for their flowers but for their aroma and for their foliage. Artemisias are one of those genera of plants that have stunning foliage.

Vaccinations go straight into the bloodstream, and for that reason alone they are worse. Big Pharma hates natural remedies and will go to great lengths to discredit them and push their toxic junk. Don't fall for it. Herbal remedies are always preferable to pharmaceutics, for the reason alone that herbs have thousands of compounds that are effective. Pharmaceuticals have just 1, and therefor are toxic, have nasty side effects, and its easy for pathogens to build resistence to them. so after all that.they are ineffective as well. Phytomedicine by a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) led by biology and biotechnology professor Pamela Weathers demonstrates that treatment with the dried leaves of the plant Artemisia annua (DLA) can cure even drug-resistant malaria. The report adds to earlier research by the Weathers team showing that DLA was more effective than conventional malaria drugs in knocking out the malaria parasite (PLOS ONE, 2012) and that DLA is not prone to drug resistance (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2015). With malaria still raging as one of the most prevalent and deadly infectious diseases of the developing world, the research offers hope for an effective and low-cost treatment.

But mugwort gets more respect in other parts of the world, where it has been used for centuries.](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential#sideeffects) [A member of the daisy family, mugwort, or Artemisia vulgaris, is native to Asia and Europe. It can reach up to 6 feet in height and has yellow or reddish-brown flowers in the summer. Its leaves have a silvery fuzz on their underside and it has a sage-like smell and slightly bitter taste.](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential#sideeffects) In the past, mugwort was revered. Roman soldiers put mugwort in their sandals before marching to ward off fatigue. It was also thought to protect people from wild animals and evil spirits. People placed it under their pillows to induce vivid dreams and planted it around their houses and gardens to repel moths. [What is mugwort used for?] Moxibustion In traditional Asian medicine, mugwort or wormwood is used in a process called [moxibustion](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm). Mugwort or wormwood leaves are formed into sticks or cones about the size and shape of a cigar, and then burned on or over an acupuncture point to release energy. Moxibustion has been practiced for more than 3,000 years in China, and advocates claim that it can strengthen and warm your blood and life energy, and treat inflammations and cancers. This [study](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/CM20110200001_38765903.pdf) shows how moxa smoke can improve the autonomic nervous system and induce a relaxing effect on the body. Moxibustion is also used to treat menstrual cramping and to help a baby in the breech position turn. According to this [studyTrusted Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592693), the practice does appear to increase fetal movements, helping the baby turn to a normal head-down, or cephalic, position. However, the authors conclude that more research needs to be done to determine moxibustion's real effectiveness. Other uses Mugwort can also be used to stimulate a women's menstrual cycle. It can bring on delayed menstruation and in the past was used to induce abortions. Pregnant and breast-feeding women are advised to avoid the herb because of this potential risk. [In European and American herbal practices, mugwort is used to treat stomach and intestinal problems such as:](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential#sideeffects) [Some who use it also claim that it has antibacterial and antifungal properties, but these claims remain unstudied.](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential#sideeffects) [What are the side effects of mugwort?] [Mugwort can cause allergic reactions leading to sneezing and sinus-related symptoms, and it can cause contact dermatitis, or rashes, in some people.](https://www.healthline.com/health/mugwort-weed-with-potential#sideeffects) [In the United States, mugwort is sold as a dietary supplement and homeopathic preparation, and is considered safe for most people.

A presentation based on clinical function-their pharmacological or toxicological effects-is relevant for the clinician, pharmacist, or toxicologist. An approach based on biological effects is complicated by the fact that the clinical outcome is not exclusively connected to biochemically closely related compounds; even biochemically different molecules might produce similar clinical effects. A botanical categorization based on families and genera of the plants producing the bioactive compounds might also be relevant, as closely related plant species most often produce the same or chemically similar bioactive compounds. However, there are also ranges of examples that species even genetically less related produce similar secondary compounds. The main focus are the bioactive chemical compounds; therefore, it is useful to categorize them according to biochemical pathways and chemical classes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1934578X19850354).

These diverse biological activities are manifested by different compounds whose main components are essential oils and polyphenols. Artemisia holds a great potential for human health and its therapeutic effects should be more strictly and intensively analyzed.
