Would you immediately change your lifestyle habits? Would you stop smoking or drinking or eating unhealthy foods? Would you follow traditional treatment protocol as prescribed by your doctors, such as chemotherapy, radiation or surgery? Or would you question such conventional medicine and instead search for other holistic or alternative treatments? I have wondered this, possibly because I've written about so many people who've been diagnosed with cancer. Some of those people survived. Many others didn't. I've also wondered this because my father died of lung and brain cancer. Other relatives have died from various cancers. The same may be said for your family, too. Cancer is that prevalent in our world. The \"big C\" scares me, and it may scare you too. When Mark Lewers, 59, was diagnosed in 2013 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , a form of blood cancer , he immediately studied it. \"I studied to understand my cancer, how it operated, and what things I could do dietarily to keep my body in its healthiest condition. Or maybe even avoid any medical treatment,\" said Lewers, region manager for testing services at Ivy Tech Community College in Gary. The married father of four children also began praying with his church's congregation. \"Giving all glory to God, I was blessed to have been able to detect and suspect an enlarged lymph node early,\" Lewers said. His pastor directed him to a hospital with a doctor who had done specialized research on Lewers' type of cancer. \"I was placed on what's called watchful waiting, meaning no treatment yet, just monitoring,\" said Lewers, who's been at Ivy Tech for 15 years. In the meantime he sought a second opinion, something that too many cancer patients fail to do, he said. \"The pharmaceutical drug that was deemed to be most effective for my diagnosis was not available to me as a first-time cancer patient because it was only approved to be used for patients in relapse,\" Lewers said. During his \"watchful waiting\" period, which is common for many cancer patients, Lewers waited while his doctors watched his test results. In August 2016, there was a pronounced growth in his lymph nodes and neck, test results showed. Lewers said he was told to enroll in a clinical trial using the same treatment for first-time patients, including a short course of chemotherapy. He traveled to the University of Texas MD Anderson Center in Houston, at first weekly, then at least monthly for immunotherapy and maintenance therapy infusions. The cutting-edge treatment worked. \"The clinical trial protocol took me to complete remission in only six months, with no major side effects,\" he said. Dr. Luhua Wang, at the Texas hospital took notice of Lewers' success. \"He exemplified qualities of a great patient, including maintaining good protocol compliance, dietary habits and physical well-being,\" Wang wrote in an email. \"These characteristics are necessary to ensure a clinical trial is run smoothly and successfully. Above all, Mr. Lewers received excellent results. He was able to beat the cancer and remains in complete remission.\" After the treatments were completed, he was not required to take any more medications, he said. His cancer is now in remission, although he will continue to be monitored for several years. Up to this point in Lewers' story, he sounds like so many other cancer patients I've interviewed. But this is where I noticed a dramatic difference in their responses to being diagnosed and treated. Lewers, who already had a good handle on his overall well being, jumped into additional research about the human body and how cancers can invade it. \"I did a deep dive,\" Lewers said. He also got involved with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, based in Chicago. \"Mark's disciplined, faith-filled and optimistic approach to his cancer diagnosis is consistent with the way he lives his life,\" said Connie Lindsey, a national board member of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. \"He developed a thorough understanding of his cancer and he worked with his healthcare team to advocate for himself.\" Lewers became aware of cancer patients who were eating in ways that possibly promoted diseases of all kinds. \"In my follow-up visits to the oncology clinics, I witnessed all too often cancer patients who had lost their appetites, stopped taking in strategic nutrition, or became too weak to maintain themselves under strong medical treatments,\" he said. This realization shook his world, prompting Lewers to dramatically change his eating habits and his dietary supplementation, both targeted to optimize his overall health. \"In spite of my cancer,\" he said. Lewers became a vocal advocate for early detection of cancer and for being more proactive, not reactive, about health. \"I believe the American medical community is in support of patient health,\" he said. \"But it is currently focused on pharmaceutical solutions, and is slowly growing in its acknowledgment of the importance of the nutritional component of fighting various diseases.\" Lindsey, from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, told me that Lewers' \"indefatigable pursuit of information\" was crucial to obtaining the best possible health outcomes. Lewers now seeks homeostasis in his body. He encourages others to do the same. \"In other words, what's out of balance?\" he asked. Not only for cancer survivors and current patients, but for all of us. By this point in our chat, he had my complete attention. I asked what readers can do to help their overall health situation or their treatment options. \"Challenge the status quo,\" Lewers replied. \"Be inquisitive about your health and how to maintain or regain it. Be bold and do what it takes to achieve good health.\" Lewers suggests to eat for health, not only for taste or entertainment. Avoid sugars and processed foods. Eat fruit rather than drink fruit juice. Post-Tribune \"Train your taste buds to enjoy healthy foods,\" he said. \"And don't cook the nutrition out of what you eat.\" Question everything you eat, he said. Are those ingredients good for you? Do the foods offer important nutrition, or do they only look and taste good? Are they clean from herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics and growth hormones? Also, do you get enough restorative sleep? Enough exercise? Enough quality water? \"We need to be more astute about our health and what we put into our bodies,\" he said. \"The best cure is prevention.\" For too many of us, especially me, it may sadly take a diagnosis to change my bad "}
