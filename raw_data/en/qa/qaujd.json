If you are concerned as to how to get stains out of retainers, Invisalign cleaning crystals are your best option. Cleaning Invisalign is not difficult if you follow the directions. Although there are different ways to clean your retainer, the best way to clean Invisalign is with aligner cleaning crystals. This is because they are formulated to kill the bacteria you have growing on your aligners.

General Tips to Using Invisalign Cleaning Crystals Cleaning Invisalign should be done twice each day to ensure your aligners are clean. Your Invisalign cleaning system instructions advise cleaning your aligners in the morning before putting them on and at night once you remove them. This is the best way you can prevent bacteria and germs from building up. You should remove your retainers before you drink or eat to help prevent them from becoming stained or damaged from the food you are consuming. Particles from the foods you eat can become stuck in your aligners the same way they do in your teeth. As time passes, these particles can move to your teeth and gums. Your result will be a build-up of unwanted plaque. If you do not remove this plaque, it often hardens and turns into tartar. At this time, you will require the help of a professional to remove the tartar before gingivitis develops. Over time, this can result in a deterioration of your gum health. You can help to substantially decrease this risk simply by taking out your aligners before you eat or drink and cleaning Invisalign with Invisalign cleaning crystals. Aligner cleaning crystals are essential to ensure your aligners remain clean and plaque-free. When you are not using your aligners, store them in your case. This is the best way to make certain your aligners are not damaged and are protected from bacteria. Your daily oral care routine should include both brushing and flossing. This will help ensure your aligners remain bright and clear and your teeth stay clean. The process of cleaning Invisalign also includes soaking your aligners. You can protect them from Staph, Strep, Candida and E. Coli. You can purchase Invisalign cleaning crystals at your choice of a local or online dental supply store. Your purchase will include two separate packages. One contains your cleaning cup and the other 50 crystals for cleaning Invisalign. How Often to Use Cleaning Crystals with Invisalign? You should not use Invisalign cleaning crystals to soak your aligners more than twice per day. Even if you only use the crystals once each day, you still have a consistent solution to ensure your aligners remain clean. Every time you put your aligners in your mouth, you should brush and rinse them. This includes after you have finished eating or drinking. Make certain you keep your aligners stored safely in your case when you are not using them. To make certain there is no residue or food debris stuck to your gums and teeth, you should be brushing twice every day and flossing at night. Taking proper care of your Invisalign is extremely important. Never forget once your treatment is complete you will have straight teeth and a dazzling smile. Are There Alternatives to Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? Although Invisalign cleaning crystals have been specifically designed to clean invisible retainers, there are other cleaning solutions available. If you would like to try one of these options, consider denture cleaner. You can soak your Invisalign in denture cleaner to remove debris. Soak both your upper and lower aligners for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, then rinse them well. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles to ensure you remove all residue. You can also use hydrogen peroxide by mixing three percent hydrogen peroxide with three parts warm water in a glass. Your aligners need to soak for 15 to 30 minutes before you rinse and brush them. Your final option is one part distilled white vinegar and three parts warm water for cleaning Invisalign. After soaking for 13 to 30 minutes, rinse out and brush your aligners. The Best Way to Properly Remove Invisalign The easiest way to remove your aligners is by starting at the back of your mouth. Lift up your Invisalign from your molars while working forward to your front teeth. You can also remove your aligners by beginning on one side of your mouth and working your way to the other side. If your aligners tend to become stuck at a specific point, try living them upwards and over your teeth. If you are still experiencing issues, consider the Invisalign brace hook. You should not use any type of aligner hook until you have talked to your dentist and received any special instruction you need to follow. To use the hook, put it beneath the edge of your aligner and gently lift your Invisalign away from your teeth. Be very careful you do not scrape either your aligner or teeth or you can cause damage. If your teeth are crooked and you are unhappy with your smile, Invisalign may be the ideal solution. Call us at Victory Plaza Dental Group in North Hollywood today to schedule your consultation.
