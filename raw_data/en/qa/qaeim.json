Please check here to find most of the information you need. COVID-19 Vaccine Information The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines have arrived in Washington. The Department of Health, in concert with the Governor's office and other statewide health care organizations and advisory committees, has developed a distribution plan for these new vaccines. We are currently in Phase 1a of this plan. Phase 1a has been further divided into 2 tiers, and you will need to consult your local health department to understand where your community is. \"Phase 1a [tier 1] focuses on (a) high-risk workers in health care settings and high-risk first responders in order to protect our medical care response capacity and (b) residents and staff of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other community-based, congregate living settings where most individuals over 65 years of age are receiving care, supervision, or assistance aiming to avoid hospitalizations, severe morbidity, and mortality.\" Phase 1a tier 2 is to be implemented AFTER tier 1 is completed and involves \"all workers in healthcare settings.\" Learn more about Phase 1a by clicking [HERE](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/SummaryInterimVaccineAllocationPriortization.pdf). Information about the vaccine(s) and distribution plan is constantly changing. The Department of Health has released a graphic of the [expected vaccination roll out and timeline](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/VaccinationPhasesInfographic.pdf). Regardless, we strongly encourage you to keep yourself appraised by regularly checking the [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine page](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/vaccine) at the Washington State Department of Health. This resource provides many answers to the most common questions coming into us at the WANP, so please take a look. COVID-19 Vaccination Program Enrollment (i.e. \"How do I sign up to administer the COVID-19 vaccine?\") Providers must enroll in the federal COVID-19 Vaccination Program to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and supplies. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) is coordinating enrollment for providers in Washington state. Find more information and enroll [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/HealthcareProviders/VaccineInformationforHealthcareProviders). COVID-19 Vaccination Locations (i.e. \"Where can I go to receive a COVID-19 vaccine myself?\") The Department of Health just released a resource tool that allows healthcare providers to determine their eligibility for the COVID vaccine and to locate clinics that are currently providing immunization services to healthcare providers. We recommend that you start by completing the [COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility form](https://wadoh.jotform.com/203418436942154) to determine if you are currently eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, or to allow the DOH to notify you directly when you do become eligible (if you are not already). Once you determine that you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, you can then check the DOH's current list of [Vaccine Locations](https://www.doh.wa.gov/YouandYourFamily/Immunization/VaccineLocations) to find out where in your county you can go to be vaccinated. (Please note that there are some naturopathic medical clinics listed here, and we strongly encourage you to support our professional community if you can!) We note that Snohomish County is not on the DOH list and we have been advised that **WANP sponsor** Kusler's Compounding Pharmacy is currently administering the Moderna vaccine to those providers who meet Phase 1A parameters (i.e. providers who continue providing in-person patient care and who cannot telework). Register at [http://Kuslers.as.me](https://kuslers.as.me/schedule.php?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=105431253&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_mTnlF3nFheiO-BmKMzGu2LOF4SGN0a0odrUEh_DVxyedEMu42gPnjGnlouXdynPP8Bbcw11ZVP8un-CDOJ0tWVIOADw&utm_content=105431253&utm_source=hs_email) after reading ALL of the instructions provided there.

This is where you can find updates and extensions to COVID-related proclamations. The [Washington State Coronavirus Response](https://coronavirus.wa.gov/)website is another excellent state-wide resource. Telemedicine Resources (including link to Required Training) Telemedicine Parity [SB 5385](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5385&Initiative=false&Year=2019&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) went into effect on 1/1/2021 and requires that telemedicine services (excluding audio-only phone calls) be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person medical care, provided that the care is medically necessary. Required Telemedicine Training for Naturopathic Physicians [SSB 6061](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6061-S.SL.pdf?q=20201016074635) went into effect on 1/1/2021 and requires that all healthcare providers who provide telemedicine services undergo mandatory training as soon as possible. The required training can be found [HERE](https://nrtrc.catalog.instructure.com/courses/washington-state-healthcare-professional-telemedicine-training). Board of Naturopathy Guidance BON States Current Telemedicine Guidelines are In Line with the New CMS Guidelines. CMS released [new TEMPORARY telemedicine guidelines](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet) for healthcare practitioners, which will only be in effect during the Public Health Emergency declared by Health and Human Services on January 31st, 2020. We are following this closely, as many insurers will follow CMS guidelines. Keep in mind that the practice of medicine is defined as occurring at the location of the patient and you must be licensed to practice medicine in that location. See [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/2300/2018/BON17-01-Telemedicine.pdf) for additional guidance on the Appropriate Use of Telemedicine. MTSL Group Telemedicine Fact Sheet The MTSL Group has developed a Telemedicine Fact Sheet for practitioners in Washington and Oregon.

BON 20-01 aligns current CE requirements with the license renewal extension authorized by the Secretary of the Department of Health. This policy will be in effect through December 31, 2021. In addition, the board will accept online courses for meeting the CE requirements through December 31, 2021. Please continue to monitor the [board's website](https://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/NaturopathicPhysician) for updated guidance. Malpractice and other Legal Considerations Message from SIG As a reminder, Sprague Israel Giles and our carrier partner are proud to provide coverage for telemedicine services for NDs providing services to patients in both ND-licensed and ND-pre-licensed States. Great news! Generally, our carrier charges additional costs if a practitioner's services via telemedicine are over 49% of their total operations, but in light of the recent COVID-19 crisis, we have seen a large increase in doctors who have moved to a primarily-telemedicine model at this time. So, for the foreseeable future, we're proud to announce that upon our request, our carrier partner has agreed to waive any and all additional costs for coverage incurred as a result of a provider having a majority telemedicine operations during this crisis. In regards to restrictions on telemedicine across state line for medical providers, we are monitoring the situation closely and will be following the guidance of State ND Associations and the AANP, which is working on defining the guidelines as set forth in recent White House announcements on the subject. Message from Aegis & MedPro Group As the naturopathic community struggles with how to move forward in this unprecedented time in our country, Aegis Insurance Associates and MedPro Group (National Fire & Marine) are committed to serving our clients both in favorable conditions and through challenging times. During this time when the COVID-19 pandemic is generating concerns and questions, we remain steadfast in our mission to support our customers with peace of mind, expertise and choice. Aegis Insurance and MedPro Group have always provided telemedicine coverage with no additional premium, whether it be part of your practice now or if your telemedicine services will be increased because of the pandemic. We encourage you to visit the attached link from MedPro Group for updated information on the crisis as new data becomes available from the CDC and other governmental agencies. This information can change day to day and is subject to revision as circumstances evolve. Medpro Group has put together a list of FAQ's to address the most common concerns you may have during this time. Visit: [https://www.medpro.com/covid-19-information-and-resources](https://www.medprocovid-19.com/) MedPro Group has been providing medical malpractice insurance since 1899 and currently insures more than 200,000 healthcare providers nationwide. With assets in excess of $6.4 billion dollars, they are financially prepared to stand behind their insureds. Our carrier partner is proud to be flexible, and will be working with NDs in regards to compliance and coverage as regulations change, whether temporarily or permanently. We are glad to be able to help support the ND community at this time. The Federal Bar Association has a continuing legal education course (NO CE for NDs!) available right now that covers the legal aspects of employers requiring employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Since we suspect many of you will field these types of questions from your patients and/or perhaps you are dealing with this yourself as a clinic owner or a clinic employee, we wanted to provide the resource.
