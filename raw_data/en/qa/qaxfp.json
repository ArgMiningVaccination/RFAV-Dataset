(NASDAQ:ALXN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ULTOMIRIS \u00ae (ravulizumab-cwvz) 100 mg/mL formulation for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy for adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients. ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL is an advancement in the treatment experience for patients with aHUS and PNH, as it reduces average annual infusion times by approximately 60 percent compared to ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL while delivering comparable safety and efficacy. With ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL, most patients will spend six hours or less a year receiving treatment. This press release features multimedia.

This reduced treatment burden is important to consider for patients, as it has the potential to make a meaningful difference in their lives.\" PNH is a blood disorder characterized by complement-mediated destruction of the red blood cells that can cause a wide range of debilitating symptoms and complications, including thrombosis, which can occur throughout the body, and result in organ damage and premature death. Atypical HUS can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. Affecting both adults and children, atypical HUS patients can present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of both aHUS and PNH can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis\u2014in addition to appropriate treatment\u2014is critical to improving patient outcomes. \"ULTOMIRIS is the market leader for the treatment of PNH and is emerging as the standard of care for the treatment of aHUS,\" said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Alexion. \"The approval of ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL represents the next step in advancing patient care for the PNH and aHUS communities, as it reduces infusion times for patients and decreases the number of vials that need to be stored and prepared for the majority of patients' infusions, allowing healthcare providers more time to focus on the patient. With ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL, most patients will spend six hours or less each year receiving treatment, giving them more time to do what they enjoy, which we believe will provide a meaningful benefit to their quality of life.\" Alexion plans to make ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL available within a few days and has comprehensive training plans to educate all stakeholders about the new formulation. ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL will continue to be available until mid-2021, at which time Alexion will remove ULTOMIRIS 10 mg/mL from the market, as communicated to the FDA. The transition period is intended to provide a seamless conversion to the new formulation without interruption to patients' infusion schedules. Regulatory filings for marketing authorizations of the 100 mg/mL formulation of ULTOMIRIS are under review with regulators in the European Union (EU) and Japan. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recently adopted a positive opinion, recommending marketing authorization of ULTOMIRIS 100 mg/mL in the European Union, and we anticipate receiving a decision from the European Commission in November. Alexion continues to innovate with ULTOMIRIS, with the goal of improving the patient experience. We plan to submit regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU in the third quarter of 2021 for an ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous formulation and device combination for PNH and aHUS that can be self-administered at home, pending completion of the ongoing Phase 3 study and collection of 12-month safety data. In addition, the collective ULTOMIRIS clinical development programs present an opportunity to expand the treated patient populations across hematology, nephrology, neurology and for the treatment of severe COVID-19, with seven Phase 3 programs that are ongoing or have planned clinical trial initiations in 2020. About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) PNH is a serious ultra-rare blood disorder with devastating consequences. It is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, which is also referred to as hemolysis. PNH occurs when the complement system\u2014a part of the body's immune system\u2014over-responds, leading the body to attack its own red blood cells. PNH often goes unrecognized, with delays in diagnosis from one to more than five years. Patients with PNH may experience a range of symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, erectile dysfunction, dark-colored urine and anemia. The most devastating consequence of chronic hemolysis is the formation of blood clots, which can occur in blood vessels throughout the body, damage vital organs, and potentially lead to premature death. PNH can strike men and women of all races, backgrounds and ages without warning, with an average age of onset in the early 30s. About Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) aHUS is an ultra-rare disease that can cause progressive injury to vital organs, primarily the kidneys, via damage to the walls of blood vessels and blood clots. aHUS occurs when the complement system\u2014a part of the body's immune system\u2014over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. aHUS can cause sudden organ failure or a slow loss of function over time\u2014potentially resulting in the need for a transplant, and in some cases, death. aHUS affects both adults and children, and many patients present in critical condition, often requiring supportive care, including dialysis, in an intensive care unit. The prognosis of aHUS can be poor in many cases, so a timely and accurate diagnosis\u2014in addition to treatment\u2014is critical to improving patient outcomes. Available tests can help distinguish aHUS from other hemolytic diseases with similar symptoms. About ULTOMIRIS \u00ae ULTOMIRIS \u00ae (ravulizumab-cwvz) is the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor. The medication works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade, a part of the body's immune system. When activated in an uncontrolled manner, the complement cascade over-responds, leading the body to attack its own healthy cells. ULTOMIRIS is administered intravenously every eight weeks or, for pediatric patients less than 20 kg, every four weeks, following a loading dose. ULTOMIRIS is approved in the United States (U.S.), European Union (EU) and Japan as a treatment for adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It is also approved in the U.S. and Japan for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in adult and pediatric (one month of age and older) patients, as well as in the EU for the treatment of adults and children with a body weight of at least 10 kg with aHUS.

Do not receive ULTOMIRIS if you have a meningococcal infection or have not been vaccinated against meningococcal infection unless your doctor decides that urgent treatment with ULTOMIRIS is needed. Before you receive ULTOMIRIS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ULTOMIRIS will harm your unborn baby or if it passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed during treatment and for 8 months after your final dose of ULTOMIRIS. Tell your doctor about all the vaccines you receive and medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements which could affect your treatment. If you have PNH and you stop receiving ULTOMIRIS, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 16 weeks after you stop ULTOMIRIS. Stopping ULTOMIRIS may cause breakdown of your red blood cells due to PNH. Symptoms or problems that can happen due to red blood cell breakdown include: drop in your red blood cell count , tiredness , blood in your urine , stomach-area , shortness of breath , blood clots , trouble swallowing, and erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. If you have aHUS, your doctor will need to monitor you closely for at least 12 months after stopping treatment for signs of worsening aHUS or problems related to a type of abnormal clotting and breakdown of your red blood cells called thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Symptoms or problems that can happen with TMA may include: confusion or loss of consciousness, seizures, chest pain (angina), difficulty breathing and blood clots or stroke. What are the possible side effects of ULTOMIRIS? ULTOMIRIS can cause serious side effects including infusion-related reactions. Symptoms of an infusion-related reaction with ULTOMIRIS may include lower back pain, pain with the infusion, feeling faint or discomfort in your arms or legs. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you develop these symptoms, or any other symptoms during your ULTOMIRIS infusion that may mean you are having a serious infusion reaction, including: chest pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, swelling of your face, tongue, or throat, and feel faint or pass out. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people treated for PNH are upper respiratory infection and headache. The most common side effects of ULTOMIRIS in people with aHUS are upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, high blood pressure and fever. Tell your doctor about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of ULTOMIRIS. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor right away if you miss an ULTOMIRIS infusion or for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
