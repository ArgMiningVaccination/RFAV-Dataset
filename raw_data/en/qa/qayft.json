No hocus pocus, just heart-centered presence. We are here to listen to your needs and support you on your journey. Whatever your health goals may be, we are with you all the way. \"This is what rituals are for. We do spiritual ceremonies as human beings in order to create a safe resting place for our most complicated feelings of joy or trauma, so that we don't have to haul those feelings around with us forever, weighing us down. We all need such places of ritual safekeeping. And I do believe that if your culture or tradition doesn't have the specific ritual you are craving, then you are absolutely permitted to make up a ceremony of your own devising, fixing your own broken-down emotional systems with all the do-it-yourself resourcefulness of a generous plumber/poet.\" [Elizabeth Gilbert](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11679.Elizabeth_Gilbert), [Eat, Pray, Love](http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3352398) Nature is your cure, not because it fixes, but because it teaches. Everything you need to heal can be found in the wisdom of nature. "}
