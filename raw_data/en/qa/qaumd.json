Kurtz \"Research Your Passion in Complimentary and Alterna-tive Medicine: A Skill-based Course for CommunityPractitioners,\" read the advertisement in the Crazy Wisdom Calendar this past summer. I was intrigued by the possibil-ity of bringing the Hands of Light energy healing work I dointo a greater acceptance by mainstream medicine. Wouldthis course enable me to bridge the yawning gulf betweenalternative healing modalities and evidence-based medi-cine? Would it be possible to create a bridge between twoseemingly contradictory world views? Conventionalmedicine, based largely on the assumption that the realworld is composed primarily of physical matter, seems to beat odds with many forms of alternative healing which arebased on the assumption that consciousness precedesexistence and that healing can be approached through the energy system of the human body. What exactly is the CAM Research Center at the University that was offeringthis course? These and other questions lead me into aremarkable connection with a number of talented andcommitted researchers and practitioners devoted tobridging the gap between allopathic and complementarymedicine. It was the vision, determination, hard work, and \"guts\" of a fewdedicated people thathelped birth the Complementaryand Alternative Medicine ResearchCenter at the University ofMichigan. A National Institute ofHealth funded research grantinitially launched the Center in1998 and helped it to develop aninfrastructure to run three fundedclinical trials and build broaduniversity support for CAM. Aninterdisciplinary group of research-ers that extends across depart-ments of the Medical School andincludes CAM communitypractitioners came together underthe competent and visionaryleadership of family physician SaraL.Warber, MD and cardiac sur-geon, Steven F. Bolling, MD toquickly become a national andinternational model for integrativemedicine. The teachers for my course were Rita Benn and Suzie Zick. RitaBenn, PhD, is the the ResearchCenter, and Suzie Zick, ND, MPH, is a naturopathicphysician whose research grant on the Effects of Hawthornin Congestive Heart Failure formed part of the initial grantfrom NIH. The level of sophistication of their instruction,the quality of the materials they provided, the professional-ism of their approach, and the seriousness of their commit-ment to bring together conventional and complementary practices and practitioners was clearly evident. Also clearwas their respect for the ten of us community practitionersin the class who offered a wide range of healing modalitiesincluding massage therapy, nutrition, chiropractic, home-opathy, energy healing, naturopathy, craniosacral therapy,and herbal medicine. Rita Benn is currently leading the CAM Research Center in bold new directions. The CAM Center just last yearreceived a $1.5 million grant from NIH for an ambitious 5-year educational expansion. Its purpose is threefold: tocreate an integrative undergraduate Medical School CAMcurriculum; to develop an interdisciplinary CAM FacultyScholars Program; and to initiate a Graduate CertificateProgram in Holistic Health. In fulfilling the first component of the expansion, creating an integrative undergraduate Medical School CAMcurriculum, Dr. Benn comments, \"The goal is to integratematerial into the lectures and field visit experiences ofstudents in CAM, not to add additional courses.\" Conse-quently, CAM course content is skillfully incorporated over the four-year curriculum starting with a seven and a halfhour unit in the first year where students have an opportu-nity to go to different practitioners in the community,observe their practice, discuss their experiences, and try tounderstand how conventional medicine and CAM functioneither alone or in tandem with each other. Pointing out the importance of this early experience, Rita Benn states,\" Literature shows that patients don't sharewith their physicians what they are doing with respect toCAM because they are afraid of what their physician mighttell them or they might not feel that they will get approvalfor that kind of path. It is important that students haveexperiences early on so they can be exposed to differentmodalities. Then they have a frame of reference for what their patients may be talking aboutlater and can ask questions in anonjudgmental way.\" Another component of the NIH grant funded expansion is thedevelopment of an interdisciplinaryCAM Faculty Scholars Program.This is one of the very firstprograms on campus and nation-wide that is training faculty fromdifferent disciplines together in anew academic field. Seven facultyfrom Social Work, Business, PublicHealth, Medicine, Pharmacy,Psychiatry, and other disciplinesare learning one day a monthtogether about the theory andpractice and research related toCAM. The Faculty ScholarsProgram will be offered fourdifferent times during the period ofthe grant and bring together 7-8faculty at a time. Dr. Benn pointsout, \"The goal for each one ofthem is to develop an educationalcomponent about CAM, designingeither a new course or includingmaterials that they can implementinto their own courses already.\" The CAM Center is creating a cadre of enthusiastic and committed scholars across all segments of the universitycommunity to root this new perspective into alreadyestablished disciplines and course offerings. CenterDirector Sara Warber is \"thrilled by this program whichallows us to create permanent change within the institution Building the Bridge Between ConventionalMedicine and Holistic Healing Both Rita Benn and Sara Warber point tothe opening of the Integrative MedicineWellness Center at the Briarwood FamilyPractice Center in the near future as thenext step in bringing alternative healingmodalities to the community.The Crazy Wisdom Calendar January - April 2003 Page 8 Rita Benn is the Director of Education for the U-M Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Center.Photo by Ruth Schekter The Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Center is located in2 renovated houses on East Huron Street, across from the Frieze Building. by building a strong group of creative and talented people knowledgeable about alternative practice and ways ofthinking.\" This faculty training is the precursor to the final element of the expansion, the develop-ment of an interdisciplinary Graduate Certifi-cate Program in Holistic Health and Healingthat provides an opportunity for students inany discipline to learn more about CAM. Thisprogram is intended to complement graduatestudents' courses of study within their field ofspecialization. In addition to basic courseswithin their own discipline, students will berequired to take a set of common core coursesthat will provide them with a solid foundationfor integrating CAM and conventional medicine andundertaking clinical practice or research from a holistichealth perspective. Anyone involved in university life can imagine the com- plexity of an undertaking that endeavors to integratefaculty and students from all segments of the campus,ground them in an emerging academic field, develop corecourse content, identify and assess graduate school requirements, cross-list courses, and initiate a new interdis- ciplinary program. This integration requires meticulousplanning, keen organizational understanding, politicalsavvy, intuition, and interpersonal sensitivity. Rita Benn,Sara Warber, and their cohorts at the CAM Center embodyand wisely use these skills in implementing their far-reaching vision. There are very few universities anywhere in the country that are offering this type of interdisciplinary GraduateProgram in Holistic Health and Healing. Without question,the University of Michigan is in the lead in its capacity toenvision and implement such a program. Though there are 15 universities that have received this NIH grant to integrate CAM into the curriculum, every one of theuniversities is approaching this task from a differentperspective. And few are attempting such a wide-rangingintegration. There is only one other university in the 15 that have received the grant where the research and educationcomponents are combined. Dr. Warber points out, \"Theinclusion of three research grants in the original NIH grantwhich initiated the CAM Center gave the program credibil-ity within a conservative academic institution that allowedit to make a successful transformation from a nascent educational program. We were able to capitalize on the groundwork we had laid. We knew what we needed andcould be visionary.\" Both Rita Benn and Sara Warber point to the opening of the Integrative Medicine Wellness Center at the BriarwoodFamily Practice Center in the near future as the next step inbringing alternative healing modalities to the community.form connections with their fellow students in deeper ways that are so important for their support during medicalschool. It's a way of teaching students to be empathic, to learn about themselves and becomeself-aware. It's the beginning of afoundation for relationship-centeredskills for physicians and health-careprofessionals.\" Viewing the CAM Center and its offerings from the inside, as apractitioner enrolled in a challengingcourse of study focused on learningthe essential elements of research-ing and grant writing techniques, Iam truly exhilarated at the new perspective this undertaking has given me. I am impressedby the combination of scientific rigor and broad collabora-tion that is needed to bring any small new developmentinto accepted practice through research. I understand therequirements of \"evidence based\" medicine and how a newpractice must be validated in a particular manner to becomeaccepted and integrated into practice. This \"insider's\" view also provided me with new language with which to discuss my energy healing practice with twofirst year medical students coming to learn about this CAMmodality in late Fall to satisfy one part of the CAMcomponent of their training. I mused to myself howdifferent this interaction with these medical students wasfrom interactions in former years. I could explain my work innew language, with a new sensibility of the mind-set ofthese students, based in the theory, evidence, and practiceof conventional medicine. Somehow the distance betweenus didn't seem like the yawning gap I originally perceived. I am reminded of astronaut Edgar Mitchell's comments when he returned from his historic moon landing, \"When Iwent to the moon, I was as pragmatic a test pilot, engineerand scientist as any of my colleagues. But when I saw theplanet Earth floating in the vastness of space . . . thepresence of divinity became almost palpable and I knewthat life in the universe was not just an accident based onrandom process. The knowledge came to me directly\u2014noetically. It was knowledge gained through subjectiveawareness, but it was\u2014and still is\u2014every bit as real as theobjective data upon which, say, the navigational programor the communications system were based.\" This aware-ness led to his founding of the Institute of Noetic Scienceto study the potentials and nature of the human mind andto bridge the gap between mainstream science and thefrontiers of consciousness research. My hope is that the medical students who visited me and the other CAM community practitioners as part of theirundergraduate medical school curriculum can get a smalltaste of the \"knowledge gained through subjective awareness\" that guides our work. This could provide an experiential basis for a larger understanding of reality thatencompasses more than just the physical and posits thateverything is fundamentally interconnected. The CAMResearch Center, in its multi-faceted educational expansion,is leading the way toward this larger integration of underly-ing assumptions and is doing this with integrity, sophisti-cation, and great success. Lucinda R. Kurtz is a graduate of the Barbara Brennan School of Healing and is a certified Hands of Light EnergyHealer with a private practice in Ann Arbor. Dr. Warber will be one of the two family physicians workingat the Clinic one half day each week. She sees this as a bigstep toward creating an atmosphere of respect for what isuseful to eachindividual patient thatmight be beyond thenormal practice modalitiesthat consistentlyassist the patient inhis/her healingprocess Several other smaller programs and courses also reflect the sensibility and community orientation of the professionalsinvolved with the CAM Center. Rita Benn seems particu-larly proud of the Mind-Body Skills Course offered in thepast couple of years to about 50 medical school studentsand 15 students in other allied health fields. Adapted fromthe Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, DC,this 1 credit course introduces students (or clients in aclinical setting) to a different variety of mind-body tech-niques each week, such as meditation, guided imagery,drawing, movement, and writing. Students have an oppor-tunity to learn, practice and discuss these techniques thatcan enhance health and well-being and moderate stress. Dr. Benn comments, \"We've looked at their well-being before and after the course on a standardized measure andfound that they significantly increased their sense of well-being.
