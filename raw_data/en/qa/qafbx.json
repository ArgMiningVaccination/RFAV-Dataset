Come to clinic! Disclose to your sexual partners! No drugs! No smoking! Safe sex! Did you take your meds? Did you take every dose?

Chariyeva, C. E., Earp, J. A., & Suchindran , C. (2012). Does Motivational Interviewing Counseling Time Influence HIV-Positive Persons' Self -Efficacy to Practice Safer Sex? Patient Education and Counseling, 87(1), 101- 107. METHODS: A sample of 490 PLWHA was followed for 12 months. The researchers examined changes in safer sex self -efficacy when participants received zero, low to moderate (5-131 min) and high (132- 320 min) doses of MI time. RESULTS : Participants with low to moderate doses of MI counseling had 0.26 higher self -efficacy scores than participants with zero MI time (p=0.01). Participants with high doses of MI had a 0.5 higher self -efficacy score than participants with zero amount of MI time (p<0.0001). Those who had 1- 2 sessions on MI showed greater self efficacy than individuals who had no MI. CONCLUSION: MI time is a key to enhancing safer sex self -efficacy among PLWHA.OBJECTIVE: The study examined the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) counseling time (SafeTalk) on self- efficacy to practice safer sex for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Evidence -based Practice: MI and HIV Care (4) Using Motivational Interviewing in HIV Field Outreach With Young African American Men Who Have Sex with Men: A Randomized Clinical Trial METHODS: A randomized 2- group 96 young African American MSM completed a motivational interview based field outreach session and 92 young African American MSM completed a traditional field outreach session. The percentages of participants agreeing to traditional HIV counseling and testing (oral cheek swab) and returning for test results were the primary outcome measures.RESULTS : More of the participants in the motivational interviewing intervention requested HIV counseling and testing and wanted to know their status (49% versus 20%) and returned for test results (98% versus 72%).OBJECTIVE: To determine if Field Outreach with MI versus traditional field outreach leads to increased counseling and HIV testing and rates of return for HIV test results among young African American men who have sex with men.

Application: Name That Stage According to the \"Stages of Change\" model, individuals in the precontemplation stage would say which of the following? A.Don't even talk to me about taking meds. B.I am thinking about taking meds. C.I am getting ready to take my meds. D.I took my meds twice today. Name That Stage \"I've been using the stuff I learned in group so I don't get so \"heated up\" and \"punching mad\" at home and at work.

Maybe down the road.\" \"No way I can do it right now.\"How to Talk with Patients About How to Manage their HIV Tip #1 Avoid beginning with a prejudgment that the patient is the problem Tip #2 Match your strategies (words) to the patient's readiness to changeMI Principles Assume the patient is competent and capable Control and responsibility lie within the patient , not the professional Open-ended questions allow the patient to tell the provider and staff what they know, what they are experiencing and what tools they have to address their health issues Treat behavior change as a journey: destination (goal), map (pathways), and a means of transportation (agency/provider leveraging resources) MI Skills Provider Actions R. Miller & Stephen Rollnick (2012)Self-Efficacy A person's belief that change is possible for them is an important motivator to succeeding in making a behavioral health change. The MI approach to behavioral change is successful because it highlights that there is no one right way to change a behavior. MI promotes individuality and creativity in devising a plan or \"recipe\" that is of the patient's own making.BELIEVE Foundation Communication Skills: Prerequisites for the Practice of MI MI Definition of Listening Focusing all of one's purpose, attention, and energy on understanding what the SPEAKER'S message means to the SPEAKER Focus on what the SPEAKER is experiencing right now as well as hearing what the SPEAKER is NOT sayingThe Four Processes of MI Engaging Take 2 -3 minutes at the beginning of each encounter with a patient to engage the \"person\" Give the patient time to address overwhelming emotions, thoughts and/or concerns. Ask the patient about their life and take interest in what is going on with them in addition to their health concerns or challenges. Goal : to address issues that are on the forefront of the patient's mind and acknowledge the person. Focusing Focusing is not a one -time solitary event; refocusing is needed and focus may change. It becomes MI when there is a particular identified target for change that is the topic or focus of conversation Goal: The patient will identify a health behavior that they believe they can adopt or change.Evoking Ambivalence is normal You can hear a mixture of change talk and sustained talk. Goal: evoke change talk to move patient toward changeHow to Evoke Change Talk \"What is going well for you?\" What could you improve?\" \"It sounds like exercise is important to you and sweating is uncomfortable. You don't like sweat, but you like exercise. \" \"If you decided to take your medications every day how would you do it? \"How will you know when you are 'sick enough' to take the medication?Planning Ongoing process into implementation and uses the patient's expertise. Be sure to ask how the patient will know if the plan is working-this is the \"measure\" and the reason for the change. Goal: For the patient to develop a clear health behavior goal. Plans have CATs: C: What do you intend to do? A: What are you ready or willing to do? T: What have you already done?Core MI Communication Techniques: Using Your OARS Open -ended Versus Closed -ended Open-ended Questions 1.How can care for you today? 2.How are you doing? 3.How are you taking your medications? 4.What is the most important issue you want to talk about today? 5.What benefits are you hoping to get from the herbal remedy you are using?Closed-ended Questions 1.Did you write your name on the sign in sheet? 2.Are you feeling okay? 3.Did you take all your medications? 4.Are you drinking more than 4 glasses of wine in a day? 5.Do you have any questions for me?Affirmations Purpose: Build feelings of self -efficacy and empowerment Goal: To actively listen for the patient's strengths, values, aspirations and positive qualities and to reflect those to the patient in a affirming way. Examples: \"This is hard work you are doing .\" \"Your anger is understandable. \" \"Disclosing your status showed a lot of courage and concern for your new partner.\"Reflections Purpose: To state what the patient is saying using the same words or different words that \"rephrase\" the patient's words. Goal: To repeat, rephrase, and paraphrase the words of the patient in a collaborative non-judgmental manner. Important: The rule of thumb in MI is to respond to clients with more reflective statements than questions.Examples of reflection stems: \"It sounds like... \"You're wondering.. \"That makes me think... \"If I understand you correctly...Summaries Purpose: A short and concise review of the conversation between patient and the healthcare professional. Summaries may help to encourage a call to action or an \"aha\" moment, encourage a patient to look as his/her strengths, look at both sides of ambivalence, and/or prepares the patient to move on. Goal: Pull together the information discussed in the conversation in a strategic way and use the information that will encourage the patient the most. Resistance and Motivational Interviewing Motivational Interviewing is very effective when working with patients who are resistant to change. \"MI is like dancing rather than wrestling.\" Rollnick et al., 2008Case Conference Edward is a 28 -year old black male who is bisexual and HIV-positive since 2011. His mode of HIV transmission was intravenous drug use. The patient spent 9 months in prison in 2012 for drug possession and has been attending NA since his release from prison. This visit, Edward has a viral load of 1700 copies/mL after having two previous visits being undetectable. You and the medical provider are concerned. The provider asks Edward, \"What thoughts are you having about your higher viral load?\" Edward: \" I may have forgotten some doses of my meds ...there's a lot going on ...it's all my fault. You know I met a guy...he's great. He doesn't know I'm positive though... What do you think I should do?OARS Application Possible responses to the patient's question are listed below. Choose the best response using an open -ended question: 1. Are you having protected sex with this new guy? 2. How could telling your partner about your status improve your health? 3. Is this new guy HIV- positive too? 4. What changes in your life have happened since you met this man?OARS Application (2) Choose the response that is a helpful affirmation : 1. Honesty is always the best policy. 2. Telling the truth is the harder choice, but you can do it. 3. This is hard work you are doing right now; weighing important choices. 4. It's good you are mindful of your legal responsibility to your partners.OARS Application (3) Choose the response that is a reflection: 1. What are you afraid of? 2. I think you need to tell him about your status, don't you? 3. Some people disclose and some people don't. It's really up to you. 4. You are wanting to make good choices, but worry about the outcome, if you do choose to disclose. OARS Application (4) Edward goes on to talk with his provider about how he has been not taking his meds regularly because he did not want his new friend to ask him why he was taking medication. Edward is still going to his NA meetings. He did disclose his past drug history with his new friend, which the new friend accepted and genuinely expressed his support and happiness for Edward that he has been able to stay \"clean.\" On a scale of 1 -10 with 1 being \"not important at all\" and 10 being \"very important\", Edward says that disclosing his HIV- status is a 7 . On a scale of 1 -10 with 1 being \"not at all confident\" and 10 being \"extremely confident\", Edward reports being a 4 in his level of confidence to successfully disclose his status to his new friend. OARS/Summary Choose the response that is a good summary: Version #1 Let's just wrap up this visit with a quick summary of what we have discussed today. You are afraid to disclose your status to your friend because you think he will leave. You don't plan on telling him your status because your level of confidence is low . You know that you may be putting your health at risk by not taking your medication regularly, but you want to withhold this important information about your HIV at all costs even, if it means becoming sick and losing everything you have worked so hard to \"get right\" in your life. Do you have anything more to add?OARS/Summary ( cont ) Choose the response that is a good summary: Version #2 Let's stop and summarize what we've just talked about. You are not sure that you want to disclose to your new friend that you are HIV- positive because you fear he may become disinterested in you. You did share with him your past history of heroin use and were pleasantly surprised that he was supportive and recognized your great strength to stop using drugs. You are worried about your higher viral load and recognize that keeping your status a secret requires you to miss doses of your medication and you are not happy about that . I am wondering what you make of all these things?Ten Things MI is NOT! 1.A way of tricking people to do what you want them to do 2.Psychotherapy 3.Magic 4.Confrontational 5.Argumentative 6.Persuasion 7.Selling 8.A change 2.Respectful 3.Collaborative 4.Honors in careMI: Am "}
