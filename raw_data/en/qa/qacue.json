Giving the body and soul what it needs to thrive and function optimally, will allow innate healing processes and prevention of disease.

Naturopaths believe supporting the body in this attempt, versus suppressing the symptoms, allows innate healing to transpire. NDs remove the obstacles to cure, feed the body, mind and soul with living food and look for the root cause of an illness, instead of quick fixes, ignoring symptoms.
