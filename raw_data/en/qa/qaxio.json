Over the next few months, several agencies will be announcing their annual calls for competitive post-doctoral fellowships. Read more about some of these options (including the NCBS/inStem Fellows program) on Pages 3-4. We have had several enquiries from our graduate students about funding for visits to labs worldwide for collaborative research projects. We are constantly o n t h e l o o k o u t f o r s u c h f u n d i n g m e c h a n i m s a n d t h e s e a r e listed on our database on the RDO website.

The Committee for Research and Exploration funds hypothesis-based scientific research in the areas of anthropology, archaelogy, astronomy, biology, geography, geology, oceanography and paleontology. Robin's National Geographic Society supported skyisland project focuses on examining the past effects of climate change and predict p o s s i b l e f u t u r e e f f e c t s o n a v a r i e t y o f b i r d s p e c i e s o n m o u n t a i n t o p s i n t h e W e s t e r n G h a t s . Some of these species are highly specialized endemics while others are generalists found at different elevations. His work includes undertaking sampling expeditions to many of these high elevation locations where he work in teams covering large parts of the Western Ghats. More information on this project and the people in it are at http://skyisland.in/Evolution.html The NCBS/inStem Fellows program is intended to attract the brightest and most enthusiastic visiting scientists at all postdoctoral levels to work in a laboratory at NCBS or inStem. NCBS/inStem Fellows are expected to play leading scientific roles in the laboratory of their hosts and on our campus as a whole. Their research projects will be in close collaboration with those of their hosts and stimulate interactions within and outside the NCBS/inStem community. The host laboratory at NCBS/inStem w i l l p r o v i d e r e s o u r c e s a n d s p a c e , w i t h t h e p o s s i b i l i t y o f additional support, as needed. Fellows may also choose to hold a part of their Fellowship in laboratories outside NCBS/inStem for collaborative work and training in skills relevant to their program of research. Resources will be raised in coordination with the campus m e n t o r a n d t h e c o l l a b o r a t i v e l a b o r a t o r y a n d t h e p e r i o d o f s t a y i n t h e institution outside of the campus will be similarly decided. The program is open to candidates who are typically within 4 years of completing their PhD and capable of clearly articulating their scientific interests and directions. Potential NCBS/inStem f e l l o w s w i l l i d e n t i f y t h e laboratory with which they would like to be associated in preliminary discussions with the host faculty member. Once both the host faculty member and the candidate agree an application can be submitted to the Head of Academic Activities. A committee appointed by the Head Academics and the Dean will evaluate applications. Short-listed candidates will be invited to visit NCBS/inStem f o r a s e m i n a r a n d t o m e e t w i t h f a c u l t y a n d committee members. This part of the process will be coordinated by the office of the Head Academics. Details of the program and application procedure are available at (http://www.ncbs.res.in/postdoctoral_fellowships/ncbs_fellows_program). NCBS/inStem Fellows may be eligible for sponsorship by NCBS for the award of a range of external competitive fellowships from other agencies. Applications for extramural support will be coordinated by the RDO in close conjunction with the Academic Office. We are pleased to announce and welcome the first three appointees to the NCBS/ inStem Fellows program: Darius Koester (Mayor Lab), Marcus Taylor (Mayor Lab) and VV Robin (Ramakrishnan Lab). Darius, Marcus and Robin's research is also supported by extramural funding. They are members of the NCBS post-doctoral program, which is managed by the Academic Office. Their extramural grants are managed by the RDO in conjunction with NCBS Accounts.

Lorem Ipsum Dolor Spring 2012 5 Funding for meetings and workshops Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds Travel grants (http://www.bifonds.de/fellowships-grants/travel-grants.html ) The Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (BIF) is a public foundation based in Germany, dedicated to exclusive and direct promotion of basic research in biomedicine. The foundation awards travel grants to PhD students and early career postdoctoral researchers for short-term visits of up to 3 months to participate in practical trainings and scientific courses in basic biomedical research. These awards also sponsor graduates from abroad for short term visits to laboratories of potential PhD supervisors in Europe to enable mutual evaluation of scientific and personal prerequisites before embarking on a PhD thesis. These grants cover the expenses for travel, lodging and course fees. European citizens working in Europe and overseas and non-European citizens who will use the travel grant to work in Europe are eligible to apply. Applications are accepted throughout the year but should reach the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds at least 6 weeks before the planned date of departure. Since May 2011, I joined the group of S. Mayor financed by a NCBS postdoctoral fellowship. After my master degree in Physics at the University of Leipzig, Germany, and the study of the mechanical role of caveolae in cellular plasma membranes during my Ph.D. at the Institut Curie in Paris, France, I am interested in the mechanisms underlying the organization of lipids and proteins in cell membranes. Based on the past studies by our group in close collaboration with the theory group of M. Rao, it is suggested that the formation of nanometer sized clusters of several plasma membrane proteins and lipids is driven by the dynamics of short actin filaments underneath the plasma membrane. Using cellular membrane protrusions called blebs, which pop out and retract after the reformation of an actin network, I try to get insights into the proteins involved in the retraction and into the dynamics of actin and membrane proteins. In addition to the NCBS fellowship a postdoctoral fellowship provided by the AXA research fund was granted to me in September 2011, which allows me to address the role of short actin filaments in membrane organization in an in vitro s y s t e m . I n t h i s p r o j e c t , t h e a i m i s t o r e c o n s t i t u t e d y n a m i c s h o r t a c t i n f i l a m e n t s interacting with supported lipid bilayers which will allow testing theoretical predictions while exploring a much larger parameter space of protein concentrations than is accessible in the living cell. Currently, I visit the laboratory of D. Mullins at the University of California, San Francisco, USA, to work on the in vitro system and will set it up then at the NCBS later this year. NCBS Fellow: Darius Koester (Mayor lab) Lorem Ipsum Dolor Spring 2012 6 Marcus Taylor is currently an NCBS Fellow and will soon initiate his work supported by the AXA Research Fund. Marcus aims to use high-resolution microscopy to measure the nanoscale (<100nm) organisation and dynamics of signalling molecules on the surface of T-cells, an immunological cell type required for an immune response. He seeks to understand how the nanoscale organisation of signalling receptors is maintained and modulated to successful detect and respond to chemical signals. Unravelling the molecular details of T-cell signalling will allow him to understand how an adaptive immune response is formed, but also universal mechanisms of how signalling molecules are dynamically organised on the cellular surface. NCBS Fellow: Marcus Taylor (Mayor lab) As part of the contractual obligations on awarded grants, funding agencies require periodic reports both on scientific progress and on expenditures on grants. The RDO has now started managing the collation and dispatch of scientific and financial progress reports to agencies. To this end, we have generated a reporting calendar for all PI-based extramural grants and competitive post-doctoral fellowships at NCBS and inStem. Based on the dates in this calendar, we will be writing to the Principal applicants on these grants to verify details and with a reminder that a scientific report is d u e . I n p a r a l l e l , P I s receiving any communication from awarding agencies regarding their follow-on reporting requirements are requested to be in touch with the RDO and we can coordinate the process internally. The RDO will assist and manage the timely collation and dispatch of all relevant reporting paperwork for NCBS and inStem extramural grants to the Agencies as per their requirements. At times, these papers may also include copies of our institutional financial reports and Annual reports as required by the Agencies. In addition, Agencies may require copies of ethical approval documents from our committees dealing with Biosafety, Animal ethics and Stem cell ethics prior to releasing follow-on funds. In these cases, the RDO will request these documents from PIs for inclusion with the paperwork. All financial management on grants will continue to be the responsibility of our Accounts Teams, who should be contacted for queries in this regard. The RDO will only be providing due diligence and oversight on the reporting process to Agencies. If you have any queries, suggestions or concerns regarding the process for reporting, please contact Savita Ayyar at ayyars@ncbs.res.in.
