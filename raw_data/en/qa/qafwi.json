The Western Gove rnors' Conference approve d the cr eation of the Western States Water Council dur ing me eting s in Portland, Oreg on on June 10-13, 1965. The Governors' resolution explic itly stated: \"The future growth and prosperity of the we stern states de pend upon the availability of ade quate qua ntities of water of suitable quality .\" Further, the g overnor s felt that a fair appra isal of future water needs, a nd the most equitable mea ns of mee ting suc h needs, de manded a regional eff ort. Wate r availability and interba sin transfer s of water were important issues. Western states found themse lves in an er a of r apid fe deral water resour ces de velopment, and r egional or basinwide pla nning, w ithout a sufficient voice in the use of their wa ter re source s.

As envisioned by the Wes tern Governors' Confere nce, it has suc ceeded as a continuing body , serving the governor s in an expert advisory capacity. Over the years, the Western States Water Council ha s soug ht to develop a re gional consensus on we stwide wa ter policy and planning issues, particular ly fede ral initiatives. The Council strives to protect western states' interests in w ater, while at the same time serving to coordinate and facilitate efforts to improve western water management. Council membership and a ssociate membe rship status is deter mined based on a reque st from the governor. Original ly, Coun cil membership consisted of eleven western states: ARIZ ONA, CALIF ORNI A, COLORADO, IDAHO, MONTANA, NEVAD A, NEW MEXICO, OREGON, UTAH, WASHINGTON and WYOMING .

March 23- 25 The W SWC held its 162 meeting in Washington, D.C. at the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel onnd Marc h 23-25. During the meeting , it agreed to send the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) comments based on e xisting position s regarding CEQ's proposed Princ iples and Standards f or federal water projects and programs. The Council also consider ed a numbe r of sunsetting positions. It continued P osition #285, in support of federal funding for studies on the water resources-related impacts of climate change and ada ptation effor ts, as well as Position #288, in s upport o f implementation of the Rura l Water Supply Act of 2006. The Council furthe r recommended tha t the Western Gover nors' Assoc iation (WG A) continue its po sitions regarding the clean-up of abandoned mi nes, Indian water rights settlements, and federa l non-tribal fe es in g eneral wate r right adjudications. At the same time, the Council did a llow the following positions to sunset as outdated: (1) #287 se tting for th the ( #291 and proposed a nacte d Ag Water Enhanc Direc tor Bill ld, a forme r Council member and Cha ir, provided a n overvie w of Rec lamation's FY 2011 budg et request and related prog rams on behalf of Commissi oner Mike Connor. B ill ex plained that the $1.1 billion request is intended to promote \"certainty and sustainability\" in the use of water in the West. He also said climate chang e is \"immensely important\" to Reclama tion, and that implementing I ndian wate r rights settlements is also a \"ver y high pr iority .\" Howe ver, he acknow ledged that author ized settlements lack suff icient funding . These a nd other project backlogs ha ve cr eated \"incr edible\" budgetary pressures. Richard Rankin of the Idaho National Labora tory (INL) also addr essed the f ull Council, and gave a presentation on the Mo untain West Water Institute. It is a regional science and technology research instit ution crea ted to de liver wa ter-energy resour ce manag ement in the Mountain West reg ion. Mr. Rankin said the I nstitut e is a ve hicle for collaboration among western water users and offered the INL as a resource to the Cou ncil. Rolli e Wilson, S enior Counsel for the Senate Committee on I ndian Aff airs (Ma jority ), updated the L egal Commi ttee on the status of Indian wate r right settlement leg islation in t he Senate . He said there are four to five active settlements and that his Com mittee has reported the Aamodt (S. 1105), Taos (S. 965), Whit e Mountain Apache (S. 313), and Crow (S. 375) bills. Next, Ca mille Calimli m Touton of the House N atura l Resource s Commi ttee's Subcommittee on Water and Power20(Majority ) stressed the importance of justify ing the costs of Indian water rights se ttlements to the federal governme nt and involving f ederal par tners in settlement neg otiations. She also said the Subcomm ittee depends on the Council for information regarding tribal water rights and other issues, including streamgages. Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) addressed the Wat er Quality Com mittee regarding a number of issues. Evelyn Washington gave an update on EPA 's efforts to addre ss nutrient polluti on. She said EPA has bee n involved with a Nutrients I nnovation Task Gr oup that consists of each of EPA's Office of Water offices, nine states, and three associations. In August 2009, the Group r eleased a repor t with a number of finding s and recommendations. One ke y finding is th at national leade rship is \"vital\" to supporting and re quiring a more consistent and fuller utiliz ation of existi ng tools to address nutrient pollution. Ms. W ashing ton further explained that EPA intends to release proposed changes to its water quality standards in June 2011. As part of this effort, she said EPA is looking at ways to address anti-deg radation, but is try ing to limi t any chang es to those issues that \"absolutely mus t be done by regulation.\" She further explained that EPA is considering the pos sibili ty of usi ng improved re gulatory guidance as opposed to re gulatory chang es to address anti-degradation issues. Allison W iedeman, E PA Office of Water, discusse d development of a gener al per mit for pesticides, which w ill apply to industries that apply pesticides dire ctly to water , over water , and nea r water . EPA will propose the per mit by May 7, followed by a short comment pe riod. EPA environmental sc ientist Ry an Albert said EPA is reconside ring its water tra nsfer s rule, which exempts transf ers from the National Pollut ant Dischar ge Elimination Sy stem (NPDES). He explained that EPA h as formed an interagency workgroup to explor e options for addressing the rule that includes re prese ntatives fr om EPA, the U.S. Depa rtment of Ag riculture ( USDA), the Department of Interior, and the Corps. Mr. Albert said the group is trying to get a better understanding of the actual number of transfers and their impacts. Mr. Albert also discussed an \"EPA Desk Statement on Wat er Transfers,\" which reads: \"Because the [EPA] has conc erns a bout the water qual ity impacts of some wa ter tra nsfer s, the Agency intends to reconsider the Wat er Tra nsfers Rule.... Whil e EPA undergoes a process to reconsider the Wat er Transfers Rule, that Rule is in effect and will remain so until EPA rescinds it, Congr ess over rides it, or it is vacated by a cour t. The public will have a n opportunity to review and comment on any chang es EPA might pr opose for this rule.... No re gulatory action EPA mig ht take will chang e the provisions in the Clean Water Act which make c lear that a per mit is not nece ssary for either re turn flows fr om irrig griculture, or agricultural ' stormwater runoff .'\" Separa tely, on Marc h 25, Council members met with lead officia ls from WestFAST ag encie s and ation, highlig hting WestFA ST's accomplishments. The Council thanked the a gencie s for their pa rticipation and urg ed them to continue their support for a Federal Liaison position i n our off ice.21WSWC members a nd staff a lso met with Cong ressional staff to discuss the ne ed for Good Samaritan leg islation to address w ater pollution from abandone d hard r ock mines. The A d Hoc Group on I ndian Water Rig hts, including re prese ntatives from the WGA, WSWC, and Native Americ an Rig hts Fund, also met a number of cong ressional off ices in support of the WGA a nd WSWC' s positions on Indian water rights settlements. WSWC/ICWP DC Ro undtable On March 24, the Council and Interstate Council on Water Policy co-sponsored a roundtable discussion that focused on the role of the federal governme nt in support of state wa ter planning for a sustainable f uture, whic h included the pa rticipation of a numbe of Administration offic ials and essional staff Matt Geolog , descr ibed the wor k of CEQ's Climate Change T ask Force, which is developing recommendations for climate change adapta tion.

A Marc h 16 interim prog ress re port includes recomm endations regarding the following components for a national strategy on climate chang e ada ptation: (1) integ ration of sc ience into decisions and policy ; (2) communications and capacity building; (3) c oordination and c ollaboration; (4) pr ioritiz ation; (5) a f lexible fra mework f or agencie s; and (6) e valuation. Nanc y Stoner, EPA's Deputy Assistant A dministrator for Water , discussed a numbe r of efforts reg arding sustainable communities, smart g rowth, wa ter efficie ncy (Wat erSense), gr een infrastruc ture, a nd climate and water . Ms. Stoner also discussed the problems associate d with a lack of potable w ater supplies and stated, \"We want people to know that they are going to ha ve the wa ter they need.\" Anne Castle, Assi stant Secretary for Water and Science, D epartment of the I nterior, de scribed the Wat erSMART p rogram, R eclamation's basin studies and the development of environmentally sustainable hydropower. She also said Interior hopes to mov e toward a 50%-50% partnership cost-share match for Coo perative Wat er Program streamgaging when the economy recovers. Terrence (Rock) Salt, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Wor ks, described CE Q's effort to revise the Principles and Guidelines for federal water projects. He also addre ssed the \"sta ggering \" leng th of time neede d for the Corps of Enginee rs to complete its projec t studies, which has a negative impact on pr oject costs and qua lity, noting that \" data g ets stale.\" Harris Sh erman, Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said that forest health is a key to w ater quality. The Forest Se rvice is \"aggressively \" trying to restore forests throug h a number of ef forts, including the downsizing of r oad systems to improve water quality and the remova l of culver ts to improve fish passag e. He f urther noted that the Natural R esourc es Conserva tion Service is \"incr easing ly becoming the conse rvation agency in A merica \" and will be a \"major player\" in the future working with agric ultural comm unities.22Gary Carter, Director of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOA A) Of fice of Hydrologic Development, said his agency is expanding its hydrology program and leveraging its resour ces to move into wa ter re source prog rams holistically . He a lso mentioned NOA orts with the Western Gover Association in developing the National Integrated Droug Information Sy stem (NI DIS). The roundtable conc luded with a Cong ressional pa nel of majority and minority staff f rom the Senate E nergy and Na tural Resourc es Subcommittee on Water and Powe r; House Tr ansportation and I nfrastructure Subcommitt ee on Water Resource s and Environment; and H ouse Na tural Resource s Subcommit tee on Water and Power. Among other things, the panel discussed the status of the next Wat er Resources Development Act, the SEC URE Wa ter Act, the energy-water nexus, and I ndian wate r righ ts settlements. I n response to questions, Ted I llston, m ajority staff f or the House Subcommittee on Water Resour ces a nd Environment, said there is no tim eline to introduce a House version o f the Clean Water Restoration Act, or the House's pr oposed Sustainable Watershe d Planning Act. 163 Council Meet ingsrd Stateline, Nevada July 21-23 On July 21-23, the WSWC commemora ted its 45 anniver sary by holding its 163 meetingth rd in Stateline, Nevada, where it first met in 1965.

The State of N evada hosted a pre -mee ting f ield trip that focuse d on L ake T ahoe ope rations and water quality protections, Truckee River water rights, and the U.S. Ge ological Survey's (USGS) streamgage program. On J uly 23, at the F ull Counc il Meeting , the WSW C modified Posi tion #319 to call for a \"shared vision on water planning and policy\" instead of a \"national water policy vision.\" It also adopted a position urging the Administration a nd Congr ess to suppor t Department of Energ y hosted energy-water and other collabora tive water programs conducte d at national labor atories, including but not limited to the Idaho National Laboratory and its Mountain West Water Institute, and Sandia National L abora tories in New Mex ico, bot h of which are working with the WSW C. The position observes that these programs \". ..provide an essential link between federal energy research programs and wa ter issues of c oncer n to the wester n states.\"23Anne Castle, the D epartment of I nterior's Assistant S ecretary for Water and Scienc e, agency's wate r activiti es. \"O bviously , the states have their hands on the c ontrols of water allocation and policy about use of water ,\" she sa id. \"B ut I believe tha t the fede ral governme nt also has an oblig ation to provide lea dership, to promote wa ter conserva tion and to help provide w ater supplies in a sust ainable manner.\" Castle said the u of ram will ex pand the a gency's cost shar e grants and ba sin studies programs, give a \" big boost\" to the USGS' National Water Census, a nd provide a \"national commitment\" to use ava ilable fe deral resources to work toward a sustainable national water strategy. She also noted that Wa terSMART \"maps ve ry closely \" with the WGA's Ne xt Steps report, which w as an \" ...important g uide to the efforts of the ne w Administration in the water policy arena.\" She f urther c halleng ed states to ena ct the re port's land use pla nning r ecommenda tions and to reg ulate g round wa ter withdrawa ls. As for USGS streamg age activiti es, Castle said I nterior is working on the er osion of federal funding and that the issue is not \"g etting lost in the shuffle .\" In addition, Castle said I nterio r has re quested incre ased f unding of milli on ground sy stem require ments for L andsat 8 a nd its thermal infrar ed imag er. Allen Biaggi, a former Direc tor of the Neva da Depa rtment of Conservation and Natural Resources, WSWC me mber and Chair of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, discussed efforts to protect Lake Tahoe's water quality, such as ba nning 2-stroke watercraft engines, instituting best land manag ement pra ctices, a nd exporting sewag e effluent out of the ba sin. I nvasive spec ies, alg ae growth, and catastrophic wildfires c ontinue to pose problems. B iaggi, former Administrator of the Neva da Division of Environmental Protec tion, also said comply ing with federal arsenic r egulations has bee n a \"r eal sque eze,\" be cause of Nevada's high le vels of natur ally occur ring arse nic. He decla red N evada is \"ada mantly \" opposed to fe deral legislation li ke Rep. James Obersta r's A merica's Commi tment to Clea n Water Ac t (H.R. 5088), which he said could subject g round wa ter to Clean Water Ac t (CWA) jurisdiction. L astly, Neva da State Eng ineer Jason King discussed a N evada Supreme Court decision that will require his office to republish and rehear applications that the Southern Neva da W ater Authority filed as pa rt of a pr oposal to pump gr ound water to L as Ve gas from the Snake Valley Aquifer on the Neva da-U tah borde r. Edwin Sheffne r, of the N ational Aeronautics and Space A dminist ration (NA SA), descr ibed the capabilities of his agency's Earth Science Division, which includes earth observations, earth system modeling, and systems eng ineer ing. A s one of the ne west member s of WestFAST, Sheffne r said NASA is interested in wor king w ith the WS WC to addre ss \"critical\" western water issues and leveraging projects and activities. During the Water Resourc es Committ ee me eting , Jennife tional Labora tory's Mountain West W ater Institut e, said her organization ha s a number of ca pabilities that could be of interest to wester n states, including system dy namic modeling for r eservoir opera tions and thermal ground water resources calibration to increase model accuracy and predictive ability. Vince Tidwell of Sandia National Laboratories described efforts to develop and refine a mod el to help water resources and energy planners analyze water requirements for various types of electric powe r gener ation and the potential implications of wa ter stre ss for powe r generation and24transmission planning. Wa rd Staubitz, USG S, discussed federal stre amgaging programs. He said the Administration 's FY2011 budg et request is $63.6 mill ion for the Cooper ative Water Prog ram and $27.1 million for the National mflow ls. Eric Evenson of US GS gave a n overvie w of the Na tional Water Census, which aims to help st akeholde rs develop a water budg et and a nswer water availability questions by providing technica l information and tools. Of note, W SWC staff then descr ibed a r ecent letter to the F ederal Communications Commi ssion (FCC) that expressed conc erns regarding an Administration pro posal to open up the 1675- 1710 MHZ frequency for c ommercia l use. This same f requency is u sed to relay streamgage data and emergency management response information. The Legal and Water Q uality Commi ttees combined to he ar a prese ntation from Peter Nichols, an a ttorney from Colorado, who desc ribed the Envir onmental Protection Ag ency's (EPA) potential revie w of its water transfe rs rule, w hich exempts transfer s from permitting unde r the CWA's Na tional Poll utant Dischar ge Elimination System (NPDES). Nichols said EPA has f ormed a wor kgroup to develop information for the agency as it considers further action regarding water transfe r regulation. H e also said incre ased regulation w ill be expensive and that states alre ady have authority to address the water quality concerns associated with transfers. To illustrate his point, Nichols said eng ineer s from larg e water providers from a number of western states ha ve ana lyzed the effec ts of requiring NPDES permits for water transfer s. It could m ean a capital investment of $20 billion, and annual operating costs of another $7 billion to treat transferred water to the quality of the re ceiving water s (for the systems analy zed). Separa tely, the W ater Quality Commi ttee and listene d to David Hindin with e . said EPA teams focuse d on new a pproac hes and da ta ana lysis have pre pared 22 paper s and over 50 recomm endations for consideration. EPA intends to make decisions on p ossible actions in September. B ill Moore and John J enning s from the Washington Depa rtment of Ecolog y discussed their state' s efforts to addre ss polluti on from st ormwate r and pesticides. Tom Iseman de scribed a pending EPA study on hy draulic f racturing and possible impac ts on drinking water . Tom said the WGA has adopted a resolution encour aging E PA to collaborate with stakeholders in c onducting the study and to lever age existi ng state knowledge and poli cies. Lastly, Commi ttee Chair Walt Ba ker impac ts of requiring nutrient dischar ge standa rds, as we ll as a Utah study assessing wastew ater treatment plants' capa city and capability, and the potential ca pital and O& M costs relate d to nutrient removal. At the L egal Commit tee mee ting, Susan Cottingha m from Montana pr ovided an upda te on Indian wate r rights settlements and mentioned a r ecent letter fr om Interior supporting a modified version of the Crow settlement in Montana (H.R. 3563). I nterior wor ked with the Tribe to develop the modifications, which r educe the total fede ral cost of the settlement from an estimated cost of over $600 milli on to $460 mill ion. WS WC L Nathan desc ribed a 2006 Gover nment Accountability Offic e opinion that re asoned that the F orest Servic e wa s not require d to pay stormwater manag ement fe es asse ssed by King County , Washington because the fees constituted ahttp://www.westgov.org/wswc/163%20council%20mtg%20-%20nv%20july2010.html.2 25local tax. Nathan said there ha ve bee n scatter ed instance s across the country wher e federal entities have refused to pay stormwater fees, and that Sena tor Benjamin Cardin (D -MD) has introduced S. 3481 to clarify that such fe es are not a tax. The meetings also included a number of updates from WestFAST . Vice Chair Ward Staubitz noted that the team ha s entered its second year and has completed an inventory of federal climate chang e progr ams that relate to water scienc e and adaptive wa ter mana gement. The purpose of the inventory is to help the wester n states better understand the nature and scope of these pr ograms and inform th e discussion between the WSWC a nd the Wes tFAST agencies on how to p roceed in developing a comm on, integrated approach to adapting water resources management given climate chang e and va riability . Tea m members also re ported on a gency actions that may be of inter est to the WSWC, i ncluding: (1) a Forest Se rvice rule development on how the agency creates forest plans; (2) a partnership between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Natural Resources Conservation Service to improve manag ement of water and related resour ces; and (3) a reorganization of USGS that will eliminate a management layer and effect a change in l eadersh ip. Ward noted Bill Werkheiser would repla ce Ma tt Larsen as A ssociate Dir ector for Water , and Matt would over see climate change efforts.2 164th Council Meetings San D iego, California October 27-29 On October 26-29, the WSWC he ld its 164 meetings in San Diego, California. The Stateth of California hoste d a pre -mee ting field trip that included vis its to the I nterna tional Bounda ry Wastew ater Treatment Plant, a br ackish g round wa ter desalination plant, the San Die go Mission Dam, and the site of a proposed se awater de salination plant. I t concluded w ith a boat tour of San Dieg o Harbor. The meeting s also included two specia l sessions on activities relate d to NASA's re mote sensing capa biliti es and the USGS's National Water Census. The W SWC adopted one external position urging the Administration to enhance NASA's \"...foc us are as on re search for water resour ces a pplications, and to promote long t erm e ngagement with the [W SWC] and the state and re gional ag encie s in the western U.S. re sponsible for wa ter manag ement and water policy to maxi mize benefits to the public from NA SA's exis ting a nd future investments in Earth observations, Earth system mo dels and systems engineering.\" The WSWC a lso modified Po sition #293 to discuss impl ementation of the SECURE W ater Act and to e xpress c oncer n that many of the prog rams and a ctivities that the Act aut horizes, including U SGS st reamgaging activities, rema in unfunded or unde rfunde d. L astly, the WSW C readopte d Posit ion #294, which leg islatio n requiring the fe deral gove rnment to pay state filing fees in ge stream adjudications.26Jane L yder, the Depa rtment Secre tary for Fish, Wi ldlife, and Parks, discussed U.S. F ish and Wil dlife Service activities that perta in to water. Ly der said a sustainable wa ter stra tegy is a priority for the A dminist ration and that threa ts to water a re a leading indicator of impact s related to clim ate c hang e. She spec ifically discussed I nterior' s Landsca pe ac tions addressing climate chang e and other stressors within and across landscape s. The coope ratives will involve federa l, state, local a nd tribal offic ials, as well as academia a nd the public. L yder sa id the \"mantra \" for the L CC effort involves re prese ntation and collabora tion between fede ral, state, and other partne rs. She also said the Endange red Spec ies Act (ESA) drive s instream flows for environmenta l purposes. Howeve r, she said it is best for the fe deral governme nt and states to deve lop tools t ogether to determine suc h needs. L yder further sa id the Administration ha s asked the Ser vice to propose a FY2012 budg et that is less than its FY2011 budget. Jeanine Jones discussed Califor nia's re sponse to climate chang e. Among other thing s, she descr ibed an e xecutive or der tha t Governor Arnold Schwa rzeneg ger sig ned in 2005. I t recognized global climate c hange, esta blished g reenhouse g as emissions reduc tion targ ets, requir ed biennial assessments of climate chang e impacts, a s well as the de velopment of impac t miti gation/adaptation plans, and for med an inter agency \"Cli mate Action Tea m\" (CAT) to implement the or der. CAT serves as a forum for California state a gency coordina tion on climate policy and planning and opera tes throug h a number of subgroups known as \" kittens.\" Additional state climate planning activities and mechanisms include the West Coast Governors' Global Warming Initiative, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, a 2008 executive order, and the California Adaptation Strategy. Jeanine further said California is expected to g et war mer a nd could s ee an 80% loss in Sierra Ne vada snowpack by the end of the century. On Oct ober 28, the Water Resources, Water Quality, and Legal Committees held a joint session to d iscuss a number of topics of mutual interest. Th e sess ion in cluded a roundtable discussion on state climate cha nge efforts per taining to water resour ces. The committees dec ided that the WSW C will circulate a short questionnaire a mong its member states to g ather more information on the state e fforts discusse d during the roundtable. The joint session also included a roundtable discussion on the need to share data between the water quantity and water quality communities. One observa tion that emer ged from the discussion was that data sharing needs to be a \"two w ay street,\" and that ther e is a ne ed to ensure \"good data a nd quality control.\" The joint session also included a pr esenta tion by Betty Olson of California on thre ats rela ted to residues fr om em erging contaminants in water supplies, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs ). She spec ifically noted that I buprofen constitut es 20% of the $2.5 billion over-the- counter medicine market. She added that a significant portion of the population is ove r 50 y ears old and will likely use incre asing ly signific ant amounts of PPC Ps. S he also mentioned tha t the USGS has found detectable, yet minute quantities of PPCPs i n 80% of 139 susc eptible streams in 3 0 states. Betty further opined that wate r resource manag ers need to be aware of these c ompounds in sit uations wher e water entra U SGS hy drolog ist, discussed the Priority Basin Project, which is part of the California State W ater Resource s Control Boar d's Groundw ater Ambient Monitoring a nd Assessment P rogram. The project evaluated untreated wa ter fr om California's a quifer sy stem and sampled over 2,000 wells for contaminants. The trace elements and minor ions mo st comm only detected above drinking water standard uranium , vanadium, moly bdenum, fluoride, and d. study found phar mace uticals in 2.5% of 1,231 g roundwater samples. Ha lf of the de tections wer e in the L os Ang eles a rea. It also found perchlorate f rom natura l and anthropog enic sourc es in vary ing c oncentr ations acr oss the state. Alex Davis of Colorado di scussed the litig ation surrounding the EPA's wa ter tra nsfer s rule, which exempts water tr ansfe rs from NPDES permitting unde r the Clean Water Act (CWA). A recent 11 Circuit decision upheld the rule , rea soning tha t the CW A is ambig uous as to whetherth it requires NPDES permits w ithout the addition of a pollutant, and that the EPA rule was a reasonable interpretation entitled to deference. The plaintiffs have petitioned the U.S. Su preme Court to overturn the de cision. Colo rado has filed an a micus brief tha t argues that the de cision author izes EPA to chang e the r ule and r equire permits, contra ry to Congre ss' long -standing deference to state water allocation law under the CWA. The brief also argues that requiring permits may impede or supe rcede the a bility of states to exercise their leg al entitlements to water under Supreme Court wa ter a pportionments, i nterstate c ompacts, and c ongressional a cts. Alaska, California, Florida, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, New M exico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wy oming joined the br ief. At the Water Resourc es Committ ee, Mike Inamine, California Depa rtment of Water Resources, discussed levees and vegetation in California. He noted that many deep floodplains in the Central Valley are now urbanized and that \"legacy\" levees, which are often covered in vegetation, should be dea lt with in a separ ate manner than new leve es. Ne xt, Stephanie Gra nger of the Jet Propulsion L abora tory discussed some of N ASA 's remote sensing capa biliti es. These include the Terrestrial Observa tion a nd Prediction System (TOPS), which mea sures e vapotra nspiration, and the Modera te Resolution I maging Spec troradiomete r (MOD IS) instrument, w hich measure s snow water equivalents a nd is use d to mode l snow cover depletion. The me eting also included upda tes on the National I ntegrated Droug ht Information Sy stem, the C orps' rece nt national wate r planning repor t, and Commit tee efforts to help the Western Gover nors' Assoc iation (WGA ) develop wa ter demand and availability mod els as part of an energy transmission planning project the WGA is implementing unde r a grant fr om the Depa rtment of Ene rgy. The Water Quality Com mittee meeting included a presentation on EPA a ctions related to its arsenic drinking water standard by Jim Taft, Ex ecutive Direc tor of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. He said EPA is prepar ing a risk assessment for arse nic and will make a decision on whe ther to re vise the standar d afte r it is completed. EPA is also seeking comments on the standar d throug h Dec ember 13, as par t of a review that it i s conducting under Sec tion 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although EPA is under no obligation to revise the standard, Taft said it would be worthwhile for states to provide c omments. J ohn Wagne r of Wyoming a lso discussed three bills (S. 3735, H.R . 6087, and H.R. 6273) aimed at over turning a Six th Circuit decision thathttp://www.westgov.org/wswc/164%20council%20mtg%20-%20ca%20oct2010.html.3 28struck down an EPA ru le that exem pted pesticide applications from N PDE S permitting. The bills would prohibit any additional permits for a pplications applied in ac corda nce wi th Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rod enticide Act (FIFRA) requirements. During the Legal Committee meeting, MaryLou Smit h with the Colorado Wat er Institute discussed the e fforts of a wa ter shar ing gro up that she has facilitated. Ma ryLou said the g roup, which included pa rticipation f rom the WSWC and WGA, is finalizing re commendations and a repor t to help states and other stakeholder s minimi ze the impacts of ag -to-urba n transfe rs on environme ntal values a nd ag ricultural communities. Candace West of Montana and Jean Thomas, WestFA ST's Forest Service representa tive, then par ticipated in a panel discussion tha t focused on how states and federal agencies can collaborate with respect to federal water rights. The Com mittee agreed to c reate a subcomm ittee to explor e the issue of colla boration further. Bidtah Becker of New Mexico also provided a n up date on Indian wate r rights settlements leg islation. L astly, Brian Dunnig an of Nebr aska discusse d Keating v. Nebraska P ublic Power District , an Eig hth Circuit case in whic h junior appropriators are claiming that Nebraska violated their due process rights by closing their headgates to protect a senior appropriator without holding a p re-deprivation hearing.329OTHER MEE TINGS National Integrate d Drought Inf ormation System Workshop s San Francisco, California The second in a ser ies of WGA/WS WC National I ntegrated Droug ht Information Sy workshops was San Fra ncisco on Mar ch 31-A pril 1. One c onsistent comment about the workshop was the quality, diversity, and expertise of the panelists and meeting participants. It was c lear from the wor kshop t hat droug ht affe cts a ra nge of r esourc es and ma nagement dec isions in the West, with signific ant impacts and c osts. Participants urg ed the de velopment of more responsive and regionally tailored information services to address future management decisions. They also recognized their obligation, as managers, to be willing to make decisions in the fa ce of uncertainty, both for climate and ecological systems. As the wor kshop proceeded, the discussion moved fr om droug ht and NI DIS toward the ongoing de velopment o f climate ser vices. Da vid Be har of the Water Utility Clim ate Allianc e highlighted water managers' priority needs for climate services and identified key goals that a \"climate se rvice \" should promote, including \"actionable scienc e.\" Robin W ebb of N OAA de the g oals and roll-out NOAA C limate Service Prog ram a nd emphasized the significance of the upcoming report on climate services by the National Academy of Pub lic Administration. There was agreement that NIDIS could serve as a mod el for a National Climate Service, both in terms of how NIDIS is getting it right and places where NIDIS needs to improve. Participants urged WGA and the WSWC to work to ensure that national climate services meet the needs of western stakeholders and resource managers. Key messag es from the workshop included: A Rang e of K ey Decisions: P articipa nts noted a wide- range of critical decisions that are affected by droug ht and should be informed by droug ht and climate infor mation. These inc lude re servoir management and water allocation, ag ricultural use , municipal water supply , land-use planning , forest ma nagement, flood control, hy dropowe r and energy, fish manag ement cies c onserva Sebastian De gens obser ved, \"A 900 foot ship needs a t least a foot or two of dra ft.\" Basic Data and F orecasts: I ncreased resour ces a re ne eded to c ollect funda mental drought and climate data and to improve the accuracy and utility of droug ht monitoring. This includes st reamgages and SNOTEL sites, but also highe r-resolution run-of f and c limate fore casts, a better understanding of popul ation trends, and mor e information on the g rowing economic impac ts of droug ht. We a lso need more30information on g roundwater levels and trends. Basic data is essential to a true \"early warning sy stem\" for droug ht, and it needs to be more available to the public, in order to facilitate \"risk-based\" decision making. Socio-Economic Da ta: Socio-eco nomic impacts, not just phy sical data , need to be incorpora ted in the dec ision-making pr ocess. Currently , we ha ve ane cdotal information in specific sectors and place s. For example, a n estimated $4 billion was lost to t he ag ricultural se ctor in Texas in the 1990s due to droug ht. Howeve r, we need to develop comprehensive socio-economic data for a full range of the economic impacts of droug ht. As Kelly Red mond asked, \" Is it a droug ht if it doesn't aff ect anyone?\" Ecolog ical Da ta: There is as much mor e) uncer tainty in ecolog ical sy stems and response s as there is in climate fore casts. We need to do more to understand the ecolog ical impacts of dr ought and climate c hang e, and ho w multiple stressors (including levees, invasive species, water quality, etc.) may be interacting to influence ecosy stems. As Chuck Bonha m note d, \"Is there a differ ence betwee n droug ht and climate c trout, probably not.\" Decision-Making : Perfe ct information is not available . We need to under stand what forecasts mean , assess how we ca n best use them, and ma ke dec isions under uncer tainty . We need to e ducate decision-make rs and the public on the meaning of information and f orecasts. We will need to build public pri vate partne rships and provide re levant, S ervic es: The emerg ing N IDIS pilot s demonstrate the utilit y and effectivene ss of providing droug ht service s that ar e tailore d to a spec ific re gional issue and re spond to the needs of local mana gers. To da te, NI DIS has commence d pilots in the Colorado River Basin and U.S. Southeast. NIDI S is just undertaking a pilot in Ca lifornia. To the extent possible, regional pilots and services sho uld continue to be a n emphasis for N IDIS and should be a model for vertica l integr ation of drought and climate services. Coordination of Service s: As we look towar ds the deve lopment of a broader set of climate services, we should build on the federal climate service enterprise that is already in place, inc luding NI DIS, but also NOAA supported Reg ional I ntegrated Science and Assessment (RI SA) prog rams, Reg ional Clim ate Cente rs, and Reg ional Forecast Centers. I n addition, fede ral cl imate servic es should rec ognize and be coordinated with state and local services and plans. NIDIS as a Model: In many way s, NI DIS can ser ve as a model for how the fede ral government develops and implements climate services. Key aspects of the NIDIS model include eng agement of state and loca l stakeholders in identify ing needs a ndhttp://www.westgov.org/wswc/nidis%20sf%202010%20workshop%20presentations.html.4 31priorities; vertically integ rated service s that include national da ta but also tailored, regional and local pilots and services; development of new information and forecasts in response to user needs; coordina tion a mong federal agencie s and establishment of a sing le droug ht information portal; and on-g oing e ngagement with s takeholder s and users of the system to improve delivery of services.4 Washington, DC The WSW C and WGA held their last in a ser ies of droug ht workshops (held ove r a two-y ear period) in Wa shington, D.C. on September 13-14. It brought together a diverse group of about a hundred f ederal, tribal, state a nd local par tners fr om the public and priva te sec tors to solicit decision- maker s' priorities re lated to droug ht and water information needs. Particular attention was foc used on droug ht and re lated climate se rvice s and sponses among governme nt agencies and non- governme ntal org anizations, with a goal of r ecommenda tions to i mprove droug ht information coor dination, re sponse a cha nging e nvironment. WSWC Executive D irector Ton y Willardson and WGA Executive Dire ctor Pam I nmann welcome d participa nts and provided introductory rema rks. They were followed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Wa ter and Science, Deanna Archuleta, who began quoting Mark Twain saying, \"Climate is what we e xpect, we ather is what we g et...\" She c ontinued, \"I t is not surprising that the issue of wa ter is on the lea ding e dge of the climate cha nge deba te bec ause w e're feeling the water impacts of climate chang e before we feel any thing e lse.... Climate chang e impacts on wa ter can be downrig ht frig pa tterns, rising sea level, higher air/water temperatures impacting ecosystem he alth, drought an d increased uncertainty for everyone, A report from UN Water - the UN sponsored group of 80 nations concerned with water issues - conclude d that ' water is the primar y medium throug h which climate c hang e influenc es the ea rth's ec osystem, and thus the livelihood and well-be ing of societies.'\" She cha llenged participa nts to w ork tog ether to achieve sustainable solutions to water proble ms, realize the recommendations in the WGA 2008 W ater Report, and pa rtner w ith Interior on their new WaterSMART a nd climate change programs. The keynote address was delivered by Dr. Jan Lubchenco, Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) . She rec ognized the WGA and WS WC mpioning envir onmental stewa rdship programs that bala nce c aring for natural resources with protecting the ec onomy and the wa y of life of affected citizens.\" She observe d, \"Very few environmenta l events affect our economy , natura l resourc es or c itizens' lives more than c limate.

Sta te and local governm ents a re calling for easy and timely access to scientific da ta and infor mation about the state of our climate today , how i t may chang e in the future , and what impacts any anticipated changes may have on our environmental, social and economic systems. This inf ormation is cr ucial to help the m mak e informed decisions in their lives, businesses, and communities.\" Dr. Lubchenco continued, \"We have heard loudly and clearly that the nation needs an authoritative and consistent so urce of timely and reliable climate information, based on the best available scienc e, to support dec ision-making a t national, reg ional, state, and loc al levels.\" She referred to a Na tional Acade my of Public Administration (NAPA) ana lysis of the organ izational options for a Na tional Cli mate Servic e in NOAA , prepa red at the reque st of Congr ess. It concluded that a NOA A Climate Service, pr operly config ured a nd implemented, would be uniquely qualified to serve the public and priva te sectors as a lead fede ral agency for c limate rese arch and ser vices, a nd to provide an ong oing a ccessible, authoritative cle aring house for all fede ral scie nce a nd service s related to climate.\" She concluded, \"We n eed your input on prioritizing the services and information that will be most useful to the end users. Whil e we work toward long-term benefits resulting from o ur efforts, we also must focus on succe sses in the short-term. We want to hear from y ou at eve ry stage of the development pr ocess to ensur e that we are on target in our planning . It is im portant that y ou and y our peers around the country feel some ownership in this new activity because it is intended to be in service to you.\" The thre e princ iple objectives of the S and droug ht information promote the and integ rated droug ht prepa redne ss to use droug ht prepa redne ss strateg ies and NI DIS as a model for delivering other c limate information and services. The workshop proceedings and discussions were intended to help form the foundation for a summa ry report with recomm endations to the Governors.5 Western Governors' Association Annual Mee ting The Western G overnor s' Association (WGA) held its 2010 Annual Meeting on J une 26-28, in Whi tefish, Montana. Entitled \"100 Ye ars of Common Ground,\" the mee ting c ommemorated the first time the weste rn governor s met to discuss natural re source s issues in 1910. I t focused on manag ing w ater and ene rgy demands while pr otecting water supplies, la ndscape s, and wildlife. The Gover nors of Colorado, I daho, Mo ntana, Ne w Mexico, Nevada , Oklahoma, South Dakota, U tah, Washington, and Wyoming attended. During the meeting s, the g overnor s readopted re solutions onThe report is available at http://www.westgov.org/wswc/publicat.html.6 33the neg otiated settlement I ndian water rights feder al non-tribal f ees in g eneral wate r adjudications, cleanup of abandoned hardrock mines, and implementation of the Enda ngered Species Act. The y also adopted a resolution commenting on the use of hy draulic f racturing for oil and natural gas recovery, and the need to protect drinking water supplies. The governors approved their 2010 Annual Report, which acknowledges WSWC e fforts saying: \"Two reports - 'Water Needs and Strategies for a Sustainable Future' and a subsequent 'Next Steps' report - developed by WGA and its affiliate, the Wes tern States Wa ter Council, continue to guide WGA's wate r prog ram a ctivities. I n addition, they 've be come a n essential re ference to fede ral agencies and water managers across the West and in the nation's capital. More than once, officials in Washington have held up dog -eared c opies of the reports to acknow ledge their value and utilit y.\" Separately, a WSWC 2 010 Progress Report on imp lementation of both reports was also accepted.6 With respe ct to climate cha nge, the governor s adopted a scoping repor t that emphasizes the need f or state and federal ag encie s to work togethe r to identify key scienc e needs that are wester n- specific and begin to share and implement smart ada ptation prac tices. The r eport wa s prepa red by a WGA Climate Adaptation Work Group to addr ess appropriate uses of clim ate adaptation modeling to inform natural resour ces, e conomic and inf rastruc ture planning and policies, a s well as identify and fill exist ing g aps in WGA climate ada ptation effor ts. The Clim ate Adaptation Work Group consists of wester n state experts in air, forests, wildlife and water , including WSWC members a nd staff. The opening plenar y session also focuse d on water manag ement cha lleng es and opportunities. WGA Chair and ontana Governor B rian Schwe itzer (D) re ported that de mand for water across the Wes t is beginning to outstrip supplies and said, \"As a region, we have to become more a ggressive and a lot smarter in how we manag e this resourc e.\" WGA Vic e Chair B utch Otter (R-ID) said, \"Although wa ter may go to the higher-value uses through ma rket transfers, we need to make sure we protec t agricultural communities a nd economies, the environment and food sec urity.\" Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Mike Connor discussed Department of the Interior priorities. He said the WaterSMART Initiative is an examp le of how the federal government can \"...work with the states and other parties to find solutions for the future.\" Of note, Susan Cottingham, a WSWC member a nd Montana Reserved W ater Rights C ompact C ommissi on Prog ram Dire ctor, discussed the need to se appr opriations for a uthorized I ndian wate r rights settlements, say ing, \" It is clear that if funding cannot be found these inc redible se ttlements cannot be f inalized.\" Wint er Me eting The Western G overnor s' Association (WGA) winter mee ting wa s held Dec ember 6-8, in L as Vegas, Nevada. Attending and participating in the m eeting s were : Chairman C. L . \"Butch\" Otter , Gover nor of Gover Gibbons; Utah Governor oming34Gover nor Da ve Freude nthal and Gove Elect Matt Mea d. Be fore the openi ng panel on \" Ensuring Adequa te Water Supplies for the West,\" Otter said, \"Nothing is more near and dea r to the hea rt of any past, prese nt or future governor than wate r.\" Gover nor Schwe itzer added, been a WGA meeting wher e we ha ven't talked about wa ter, nor should ther e be.\" He talke d about his bull ranch on the Continental Divide and efforts to upda te its irr igation sy stem by constructing new he adgates a nd ditches, and sc reening diversions and fe ncing streams to protec t fish. It wasn't long before he got calls fr om three state and two fede ral a gencie s that wanted to know w hat he wa s doing. A n Army Corps of Eng ineer s wetlands e xpert was dispatched from Omaha to ensure he had complied with the Clean Water Ac t's Section 404 require ments. He took a quic k look a nd conclude d what the Gover nor already knew, that all the work tha t had bee n done fe ll under an a gricultural e xemption. The pa nelist speaking to the Gover nors included: Anne Castle, Assistant Secreta ry of the Interior f or Water a nd Science ; Patricia Mulroy , Gene ral Mana ger, Southern Nev ada Water Authority; American Wa ter (a private company) President, Jeff Sterba; and Debra G. Coy , with Svanda & Coy , a consulting firm serving companies a nd investors in the wate r sector. Mulroy talked about sharing water in the very contentious Co lorado River basin, with impacts rela ted to use stretc hing f rom Wy oming to Mexico and including the California B ay-Delta. It is all int erconnecte d. She descr ibed Southern Ne vada' s conse rvation, achie droug ht resiliency ach a greem ents with other B asin States. There is no other alterna tive to cooper ation. \"We know how deep the cuts would be [to water supply ] and what the conseque nces w ould be.\" With reg ard to the c urrent Shortag e Sharing Agreement, which trig gers actions base d on the level of Lake Me ad, she sa id: \"My messag e is that 'beginning agreement' is the only thing that is g oing to g et us throug h future dr oughts.\" L ake Me ad could r each the initial trigg er level at 1075 elevation, with increasingly serious cuts down to elevation 1025. \"We don't know what happe ns after that,\" she declared. \" It affe cts eve ryone in the wa tershed.\" Some 30 mill ion people and a productive agricultural economy depend on the waters of the Colorado River. She also noted that discussions wi th Mexico have been g oing on f or some time, and will be pa rt of the solution. Sterba noted American Wa ter serves comm unities in two Canadian provinces, and 35 states, from F lorida to the ar id Southwest. The West is \"ahe ad of the curve \" in that we' ve alr eady learned a lot of lessons related to scarcity and the value of water. His remarks focused on water use efficiency and conse rvation, desc ribing the latter a s more of a \"state of mind\" than a tec hnologic al challeng e. He also talked a bout the \"D- \" grade given our wa ter re source s infrastruc ture, a nd the question of how we pay for imp rovements. America n Water invests $800 milli on-$1 billion annually in its sy stems. He fur ther discussed the ener gy-water ne xus, say ing tha t water -related energy use across the U.S. is only about 4%, but that figure is 18% in California. Nationwide energy uses consume 25% of our wa ter, a nd acc ount for 41% of all diversions. Americ an Water is working on projec ts in Arizona, California and Ne w Mexico.35Debor ah Coy stated that there are billions in private money available to invest in water a nd related infra structure needs which amount to some $500 billion. In general, private inve stors see the water sector a s stable over time, but they also nee d to see a profit. Pension and other funds a re interested, but much of the money rema ins on the sidelines. Many view private sector capital as too expensive, but with declining public sector spending we need to overcome the inertia and find ways to encourage more private spe nding with appropriate incentives. Wha t is the true cost of capital? Public subsidi es distort our view of the true cost of water . She would love to see the private se ctor more involved in the public dialogue over water. Water i s a grow ing cost for the f ood and beve rage, pharma ceutica l, ener gy and other industries, which need to pay more a ttention. At present, the municipal bond market is concerned about future risk, given past stimulus spending. Castle sug gested that water is alway s on the Gover nors' a genda be cause in some place s we are already at the limi t of supplies, and w e are looking at continuing incre ases in dema nds from population gr owth, ener development, instrea m and ec osystem needs, a nd climate cha nge. The re is a \"fundamental imbalance\" between water supplies and demands. Interior is focused on both structura l and nonst ructura l alterna tives. The WaterSMART is designe to help achie ve sustainability throug h greater efficie ncy, in both water and energ y use, which are ine xtricably linked. The U.S. B ureau of Reclama tion (USBR) re ceive d about for stimul us spending , but is \"not likely to ge t a big boost in the future.\" We need to lever age our resour ces. She noted that I nterior is try ing to wor k out an ag reement with the Offic e of Ma nagement and B udget over authorized loan guarantees for non-federal opera tors of fe deral projects to enc ourag e priva te lending . USBR and USD A's Natural Resources Co nservation Service are also working together to leverage their resour ces to he lp farme rs improve both on-f arm a nd off- farm water delivery and mana gement systems. \"Pricing is the key to water conservation,\" she declared, adding that we need to \"marry\" land use, energy and water policies. Dr. James Horne, Australia's Deputy Secretary of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communiti es, also joined the Gove rnors a nd just come throug h toug hest 10-y ear drought experience d in Australia,\" r equiring the fe deral governme nt, industry and others to work togethe r to face head on the structura l imbalance be tween their water supplies and demand. Their approach has been to introduce water markets into rural Australia and move t owar ds full cost pricing , including in the cost of servic e capital char ges. You have to r ecognize water a s a valuable resourc e, and not a \"free good.\" ce er and movi ng from low to hig h value use as a me ans to ensure economic survival. Horne stressed the need for goo d water information and good science for decision making. Further, c limate chang e has be en incorporated into their mode ls looking 10, 20 and 30 y ears ahea d. He state d, \"We think we 're already being affected,\" and there is a need to take conc rete adapta tion measure s while there is tim e. \"We live in a dif ferent world whe re the re are resourc e constra ints.\" Addressing water resources challenges takes \"a concerted effort over a long period of time. The time to start educa ting the public is now.\" The g overnme nt is helping farmers do more with less, making irrigation sy stems more ef ficient. I t's making a differe nce in communities. Australia's population36is about 22 mill ion and on the municipal wa ter supply side, they are moving to supply about four million with desalted water. In addition, they are building 50 water reuse and recycling projects. 2010 Water Management Sym posium On Novembe r 8-10, the WSWC held its 2010 Water Manag ement Sy mposium i n San Antonio, Texas. Entitled \"Western Water Resources Infrastructure Strategies: Identifying, Prioritiz ing f state a nd local officia ls, consultants and banke rs, as we ll as other stake holders to discuss infrastruc ture re lated challeng es fa cing the West and the Na tion. The Texas Water Deve lopme nt Board (TWDB) tion. RBC Capital Marke ts was an underwriting sponsor, with contributions from the Associated General Contractors of Texas, CDM, CH2M Hill and HDR. We appreciate their support. The 2006 WGA Water Repor t, \"Wat er Needs and Strateg ies for a Sustainable Future ,\" included the f ollowing r ecommenda tion: \"The WSWC should nnial symposia desig ned to: (a) bring stakeholder s together to try and find ways to me et our growing wester n water , wastew ater, water public saf ety-related infrastructure funding needs; (b) find ways to qua ntify, evaluate and prioritize fu nding those needs; and (c) highlight the be nefits of integ rated water shed, river basin, reg ional and interstate planning and management.\" A March 2008 Water Infrastructure Financing Workshop cosponsored by the WSWC and Interstate Council on Water Policy (ICW P) in Washington, D.C. was intended as a beginning. The 2010 sy mposium bui lt on that first step, and was pla nned to implement in p art some of the recomm endations in the Wes tern Governors' Association's 2008 \"Next Ste ps\" Report related to water and wastewater infrastructure needs and strategies. Among other thing s, the WGA's 2008 Next S teps Report re commended, \" All levels of governm ent, along with appropriate private sector involvement, should cooper ate in the de velopment and implementation of a ppropriate criter ia for pr and technolog ies.\" I t recommended, \"States should encourage adequate and progressive local asset ma nagement plans, programs a nd best manag ement pra ctices throug h technica l and financ ial assistance .\" Further, \" States, with assistance from relevant federal agencies, should provide institutional mechanisms and otherwise encourage regional water and wastewater projec ts to max imize economies of sca le and minimiz e envir onmental impacts from sm aller, piecemeal suggested that \"...public-private financ ial partne rships can be useful and should be encour aged.\" Other recommendations were directed to the Con gress and utilities. Over the course of the symposium, speakers from public and private entities discussed ways to identity , evalua te, and prioritize the na tion's water infrastruc ture ne eds, as we ll as way s to fund and f inance present and future projects, including public/private partnerships. Capital budgeting and life-c ycle asset manag ement we re othe r areas of emphasis. Senior state of ficials fr om California, Colorado, New Mexi co, Te xas, Utah an d Wyoming a ddresse d water resour ces pla nning a nd development a ctivities, focusing on projec t and prog ram funding mecha nisms, such as the use of37sales tax and general fund appropr iations, bonding, a nd dedica ted trust funds financ ed from oil, gas and minera l leasing on public land s. Top federal agency leade rs from the U .S. Army Corps of Engineer s, U.S. Bure au of Rec lamation, Environmental Protec tion Age ncy (EPA), a nd USDA's Natura l Resource s Conservation Service (NRCS) also participated. Othe rs attending represente d state legislators, mun icipalities, local governments, river authorities, groundwater districts, utilities, water companies, consultants, contractors, construction companies, and the financial community. On the fir st day, Michae l Deane , Executive D irector of the Na tional Association of Water Companies, discussed a number of the factors driving water infrastruc ture ne eds, including an ag ing inventory of projec ts and population g rowth. He particula rly addre ssed the si zable gap betwee n infrastructure needs and current funding. He said, \"we paralyze ourselves\" by focusing on the huge overall projected costs. He also said EPA h as found that their estimated spending gap would \"disappe ar\" in 20 y ears if water and wastew ater rates were raised by 3% (over and above inf lation rates). Although the construction of water infrastructure can create jobs in the short term, Deane said there is a nee d to underscor e the f act that \"very few jobs\" ca n exis t without a sustainable wate r supply and that re liable wate r systems cre ate and allow for r eliable job g rowth. A pane l of state and l ocal water mana gers discusse d water resour ces pla nning a nd development in Texas. TWDB Executive Director Kevin War d provided an overview of his agency's infra structure efforts, noting that it committ ed $1.5 billion for wate r and w astewa ter projec ts in 2010, and has provided $12.4 billion for such projec ts to date. (TCEQ), nd a WSW C discussed his ag ency's efforts regarding water conser vation and municipal and industrial wate r use. He sa id EPA's decision to revisit whether National Pollutant Discharg e Elimination Sy stem (NPDES) per mits are re quired for water tra nsfer s is \"troubling\" to Texas, which does not nee d additional authority to regulate transfers. Ro bert Puente, CEO and President of the San Antonio Water System, said his Sy stem ha s seen an increase in cu stomer connections, but also a decrease in treated sewa ge discha rges due to c onserva tion. Perry Fowle r with the Associa ted Gene ral Contractors of Texas s aid \"we have to i nvest\" to add ress the Na tion's infrastructure needs. Conservation alone will not be sufficie nt. He added that construction costs are lower tha n they have been in the pa st, and that now i s a good time to build. All of the pa nelists identified infrastruc ture funding as a pr incipal cha lleng e. A sec ond panel of experts from the finance industry addre ssed way s to fund curr ent and future rastruc ture ne eds. Sharle ne L eurig Senior Mana ger w ith Ceres I nvestors and Environmentalists, discus sed a model that her company created to help investors e valuate a company's water-related risks, including the reliability of their water supplies. Consultant David Yanke, with RW B eck, described financing options for the public sector, including revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, certificates of obligations, cash, and the state revolving funds. Pub lic Werks, I nc. President John Crew descr ibed a \" basic investment cycle\" that he had use d to raise $40 milli on for infr astructur e proje cts from the pr ivate sec tor last y ear. He also noted that risk capital is profit driven and is g enerally intolerant of bur eaucratic pr ocesse s. Shawn Dra lle, Treasurer/Managing Director for RBC Capital Markets, said there is an \"enormous gap\" betwee n large and small systems with respe ct to financ ing. The latter will need the most help. She describe d38recent funda mental cha nges in the ca pital and cr edit marke ts, as well as the use of traditional debt instruments. A panel of state experts, a ll WSW C me mbers, descr ibed wester n state water plans and resources development programs. Jeanine Jone s, the California Department of Resources' Interstate Resource s Manag er, discusse d how her state has f unded wa ter infr astructur e proje cts throug h voter- approve d bond acts, initiated by the L egislature or vote r initiatives. She noted that 10% of California's water systems serve over 90% of the population, and the remainder are small systems that often lac k the re source s to fund projec ts or participa te in the pol itical proce ss (which me ans that they are often ignored). She added that catastrophic flooding and drought have served as a catalyst for planning in California. Utah Division of Water Resourc es Dire ctor De nnis St rong said his state uses a numbe r of methods to fund infrastruc ture, including grants and low or no interest loans (as pa rt of a r evolving loan prog ram), a n interest buy down prog ram and bonding, a mong othe r mec hanisms. Gener al fund appropr iations and a de dicated por tion of the state sale s tax help fund financ ial assistance , but projec ts are pr oposed by local decisionmake rs. A sepa rate board w ith lay members r eviews a nd approves project assistance mainly to small cities and irrigation districts. The State of Utah is also designing and planning to construct a couple of large projects to develop and transport water to municipalities from the B ear River in the North, a nd Lake Powe ll in the Sout h. Colorado Water Conservation Boa rd Dire ctor Jennifer Gimbel discusse d a number of observa tions pertaining to water planning and infra structure , including the need to de velop a c loser connection between land use planning and water supplies. Recent \"roundtable\" planning efforts have focused attention on meeting the State's future water needs. Of note, drying up agriculture is not an accepta ble alternative i n Colorado. The State ha s identified a number of projec ts in various stages of de velopment, and pr ovides some financ ial assistance (funding waxes and wa nes). Eve n taking into account a ggressive w ater conser vation, more wa ter proje cts will have to be built to meet projec ted demands f or a g rowing population. Wyoming W ater Deve have water to develop!\" The State provide s project loans f inance d by an ener gy resour ces se verance ta x. He noted they have ne ver ha d a \"ba d loan .\" Loans are secured by the projec t and wate r rights. He discussed the Commi ssion's responsibilities in m aking study and proje ct recommendations to the state legislature regarding planning and construction. The Governor reviews requests presented to the Legislature, and individual pr ojects are approve d throug h a Selec t Water Commit tee composed of twelve state leg islators, equally divide d betwee n both Houses. A bene fit of this process is that the Gover nor and the se leg islators also act a s advoca tes for f unding f or appr oved proje cts. New Me xico State Eng ineer John D'Antonio said t hat the rea son for state w ater planning was to put water to be nefic ial use, and you need infrastruc ture to do tha t. The State uses sixt een pla nning regions, based on g eopo litical boundarie s. Western wate r law is desig ned to provide c ertainty of supply . D'Antonio cha irs the Water Tr ust Boar d, which oversees the distributi on of g rants and loa ns39from thre e sepa rate funds. Money from severance taxes capitalizes these funds. De fault ra tes on infrastruc ture loans se cured by water rights are e xtreme ly rare. While mostl y small projects ar e financ ed, ther e is money available for lar ger stora ge proje cts and c onvey ance systems. The B oard also E ndang ered Species Ac t-rela ted programs, as w ell as flood pre vention, water treatment, water reuse, recycling and wa ter conserva tion projects. Patrick Na tale, the Executive Dire ctor of the Americ an Society of Civil Enginee rs (ASCE), spoke on a panel focused on wa ys to identify and prioritize water projec t needs. He descr ibed an ASCE \"repor t card\" that g ives Nation's infra structure an over all \"D\" grade. ASCE has a number of legislative priorities, including the Water Resources Development Ac t (WRD A) of 2010 (H.R. 5892). He also said leade rship at the state a nd local leve l is key . Richard Nor met, Ex ecutive Direc tor of the Na tional Council for Public-Private Partner ships (PPPs), discussed the be nefits of such par tnerships, primarily betwee n the private sector a nd municipalities. He noted PPPs are not a new or re volutionary conce pt, nor are they synony mous with privatiz ation. They are contra ctual agreements that can vary with different purposes and needs, which should be clearly defined. He also advised, \" Pick y ou partne r carefully!\" CDM S enior Vice P resident Rodney Chapin descr ibed alternative delivery methods to t he traditional design-bid-build process, which when properly applied, can be effective in accelerating projec t development and financ ing, as well as shift risk. He noted wate r projec ts are increasingly more c omplex and diffic ult to buil d and fina nce, c reating problems for owners in terms both of cost and scheduling. Claudia Copeland, of the Congr essional Resea rch Ser vice, discusse d how cha nges in the House lea dership re sulting fr om the mid-term e lections could impact infr astructur e proje cts. She said Rep. J ohn Mica (R-F L), a f iscal conse rvative, w ill chair the House Transp ortation and Infrastructure Com mittee, which has jurisdiction over the Corps of Engineers and EPA 's State Revolving F und (SRF) progr ams. Although Mica has a strong history of supporting infrastruc ture, he and other Republicans have not supported a 2010 WRDA bill, stressing that the Nation needs to addre ss the backlog of unfunde d projec ts before authorizing ne w ones. Copeland a lso reporte d that Rep. Doc H asting s (R-WA) will chair the H ouse Na tural Resourc es Committ ee, w of Reclama tion pr ojects and prog rams. She said Ha stings is a fisc al conse rvative a nd is not known for his interest in water issues. He a lso \"is not a fan\" of Recla mation's Title XVI Water Recy cling and Reuse Prog a nd may want bene ficiaries of projec ts to pay a greater shar e of project costs. A panel of federal officials and other speakers discussed capital budgeting and life cycle manag ement. Steve Allbee, of EPA's Off ice of Water, said that it will be more diff icult to secure funding for infr astructur e proje cts given fe deral budg et defic its and that greater care will need to be given up-front in determining whether to replace or rehabilitate an asset. Dr. Elliot Ng, from of Corps of Engineer s, discussed asset mana gement, say ing w e nee d to collabora te more a nd look at infrastruc ture fr stic perspe ctive. Ella Mae H errera, with the Bur eau of Reclama tion, noted many facilities we re built in rura l areas now urba nized, raising risks of fa ilure. A re cent federal canal invento ry found that 13% a re in urba n are as. L astly, John Maxwell, Director of40Integrated Water Planning with HDR Engineering, said that most states have some form of wa ter planning, but most do not require utility planning, which he believes states should promote through incentives, a long w ith asset manag ement best mana gement pra ctices. \"Utiliti es are a busine ss,\" and need a business plan. Another panel focused on mu ltipurpose and multiple agency projects. Rog er Figard, City Engineer for L incoln, Nebr aska, pr ovided an ove rview of the Antelope Valley /Creek Projec t, which was a partnership between Lincoln, the University of Nebr aska, the Corps, and the Lower Platte South Natural Resourc es District. I t addre sses flood control, tra nsportation, rec reation and community revitalization needs. Mar k Pifher, De puty Direc tor for Water in Aurora , Colorado, descri bed the Prairie Waters Projec t. Working closely with the Corps and the F ish and Wil dlife Service to avoid environmenta l issues, as well as other interested non- regulatory third parties, the pipeline will transport and tre at wate r from a lluvial r iver bank wells along the South Pl atte River. Continuous value eng ineer ing r eviews, a nd partne ring among the owner , desig ner, c onstruction manag er and contra ctors have helped pr omptly and equitably resolve problems. Suzanne Scott , San Antonio River Authority (SARA) Ge neral Manag er, de scribed the San Antonio I mprovement Project, a 13- mile long f lood protection projec t undertake n in collabora tion wi th the Corps. The effort involves restoring the cha nnelized river with a \" more na turalized setup\" with aquatic fea tures and riparian woodlands. Th e San Antoni o River flood control system is an internationally recognized eng ineer ing ma rvel, thoug h few residents re cognize the extent of the infrastruc ture underground beneath their feet. On the final day of the Symposium, a panel of senior Administration officials, all with careers of over 30 y ears, discussed fe deral water resour ce inf rastruc ture es priorities. Steve Stockton, Direc tor of Civil W orks f or the Corps, said his ag ency is looking at considerable reductions in its budget and that the days in which the Corps could fully fund projects are over. He also said there is a need for water resources managers to educate the political leadership about infra structure priorities. He a lso mentioned t he Corps' re cently released N ational Report on Responding to Na tional Water Resource s Challeng es, and collabor ative wor kshops leading up to the publication of the re port, one he ld in c onjunction with the WS WC's Spring 2009 meeting s in Kansas City, Kansas. Steve Allbee, EPA P roject Director for Gap Analysis, said you cannot have a sustainable community without discussing infra structure and n oted that it is essential to disti nguish betwee n essential proje cts and those be nice.\" He described the multi-ge nerational urba nization and need rade and expand water and wastewa ter sy stems. He discussed EPA' s capitalization of state re volving loa n funds and the A merica n Recove ry & Re investment Act spending. He noted that sustainability requires investment to support long term outcomes. Michae l Gabaldon, Rec lamation's D irector of Technic al Resourc es, desc ribed halleng ag ing inf rastruc ture a nd invas ive species, focusing on Re clamation's pr ojects and a ctivities related to cana ls, quag ga mussels, and incr easing hydropowe r produc tion. He re viewed http: //www.westg ov.org /wswc/2010%20a wms.html. 7 A a memorandum of understanding between the Departments of the Interior and Energy and the Corps of E ngineer s relate d to the latter. Tom Christensen, Natura l Resource s Conservation Service (NRCS), R egional Conservationist - Central, discussed the De partment of A griculture' s efforts rela ted to water , noting that NRCS a ctivities impact 80% of the Nation's waters. He said NRCS be lieves conservation mu st be done on a landscape scale, and that you can't isolate natural resources c oncerns, saying soil, wildlife, air a nd water are all interre lated. Mana gement nee ds to be based on g ood science and a systematic appr oach, \" not just random acts of c onserva tion.\" He talke d about USDA's wa tershed rehabilitation program, w atershed operations, floodplain easements, and its aging infrastructure in the form of small dams, many now considered hazards due to increasing threats to life and property, should they fail. Sue L owry , Wy oming State Eng ineer 's Off ice and a WSW C me mber, provided a wrap-up summary of the mee ting, followed by a plena ry discussion eng aging those attending related to what they had heard and learned, and suggestions for next ste ps.742CONGRES SIONAL TE STIMONY House Subc ommittee on W ater P ower FY2011 Bud get Oversight Hearing The WSW C was invited to testify before the House Resources Committee's Water and Power Subcommitt ee on Ma rch 11, 2010 w ith reg ard to the Pre sident's budg et request for the U.S. Bure au of mation and nted was the WGA W ater Reports and pre vious positi ons and statements. I t touched on a number of topics, including the ne ed for more and better information for de cision-making , climate cha nge and the need to qua ntify Indian water rights by means of se ttlements, and use of the fede ral Rec lamation Fund for authorized purposes. Selected sta tements from the testimony follow: \"Without the B ureau of Recla mation and federal investment in past wat er projects, the West would not be what it is today .

WestFAST was established in 2008 to support the Western Stat es Water Council (WS WC), and the Western ting state efforts to addre ss water resour ces needs. In 2010, Wes tFAST continued to grow as a collaborative organization, and continued to provide federal support to the WSWC. WestFAST focused on several major federal initiatives, including c ollaborating on climate cha nge and dr ought initi atives, as we ll as completing a number of other ke y activities. Some highlig hts include: WestF AST Agencies Wate r Clim ate C hang e Program Inventory: In 2010, WestFAST compiled an inventor y of WestFAST agency climate cha nge prog rams. The purpose of this inventory is to share information on Federal climate chang e prog rams that are relevant to wester n water manag ers and facilitate closer c oordination betwe en Federal agencies and State water scientists and managers. Th is inventory is a from 9 to 11 Agencies: During 2010, both NASA and DOE jo ined the WestFAST team. The addition of these two agencies provides additional perspective to We stFAST , and allows Wes tFAST to better support the WSWC. Interagency Collaboration: Throughout 2010, Wes tFAST continued to facilitate interac tions between the WestFAST ag encie s. WestFAST ag encie s participate d in the Clim ate Chang e and Water Working Gr oup (CCAWG) as well as in the Na tional Integrated Droug ht Information Sy stem (NI DIS). The U.S. Army Corps of Eng ineer s (USACE), in collabora tion with WestFAST and develope d a report entitled \"Building Strong Collaborative Relationships for a Sustainable Water Resourc WestFAST rtment of the I nterior' s Landscape Con servation Co operatives as well as through Reclamation's Basin Studies. Lastly, the USA CE he lped establish a liaison position with the State of Kansas that will help coordinate federal efforts with state efforts. Suppo rted the Goals of the WSW C Committees: Wes tFAST's core mission is to support the efforts of the WSWC, and to bring federal insight and coordination to initiatives identified by the WSWC in the ir work plan. In 2010, some particular highlights included: worked with the WSWC on NIDIS; participa ted in an Ag -to-Ur ban wa ter tra nsfer work g roup; worked with the WS WC as par t of an Ad H oc Gr oup on the National Water Assessment; NASA p rovided a special session on remote sensing capabilities to the WSWC;45provided input on fede ral claims in non-tribal water rights adjudication; supported and lped plan WSW and the WS WC on estimating w ater needs f or ene rgy production. Supported the goals in the 2008 Next Steps Report: WestFAST was formed i n part a s a response to a recomm endation in the Next Ste ps Report. We stFAST has continued to focus on the recomm endations in this report to guide its work. In 2010, WestFA ST particula rly focuse d on are as of the N ext S teps repor t relate d to climate cha nge and droug ht. Particular e fforts were in support of: Objective 8c - Development of a Federal Toolbox to su pport state water plans; Objective 20 - Wor k with the State of Kansas to develop innovative ways to encourage better collaboration betwee n federal and state agencies at the state level; Objective 32 - Implementation of NI DIS; and Objective 33 - D evelopment of the WestFAST Age ncies Climate Change Prog ram I nventory (mentioned arlier ).46OTHER IMP ND EVENT S Weste rn States Wate r Since the first iss ue in 1974, the Council's we ekly newsletter , Western Stat es Water , has been one of its most visible and well received products. Its primary purpose is to provide governors, members a nd others with ac curate and timely information with respe ct to important events and trends. I t is int ended a s an aid to help a chieve better federal, state, a nd local dec isionmaking a nd problemsolving, impr ove intergovernmental relations, promote western states' rights and interests, and hig hlight issues. F urther, it cove rs Council meeting s, chang es in Council membership, and othe r Council business. The ne wsletter is provided as a free service to me mbers, governor s and their staf f, member state wa ter re source agencie s, state water users associations, selec ted multi-state org anizations, key cong ressmen a nd their staff s, and top federal water officials. Other public and private a gencie s or individuals may subscribe f or a f ee. The following is a sum mary of sig nificant a ctivities and eve nts in 2010 primarily taken f rom the newsle tter. Howe ver, this does not represent an exclusive listing of all Council activities or other important events. Rather, it seeks to highlight specific topics. Ag-to- Urban Transf ers The Walton F amily Founda tion f unded a two- day forum in Castle Rock, Colorado to identify effective and innovative wa ys to transfer and shar e wa ter a mong the agricultural, ur ban, and environmenta l sectors, while avoiding or mitigating damag es to agricultural economies an d the environment. Ove r 30 re prese ntatives from wa ter user groups and organ izations from ac ross the basin attende d the forum, including Audubon New Mexico, the Maricopa/Stanfie ld Irrigation District, the San Diego County Water Authority, and others. Colorado State Engineer and WSWC member D ick Wolfe was a lso in attendanc e. The forum's goal is to develop re commendations that can be prese nted to the Western Governors' Association (WGA), U.S. B ureau of Recla mation, and others for their consider ation. The for um utili zed a series of small break out se ssions consisti ng of re prese ntatives from the three sectors. The first session clarified t he water needs of each sector, as well as what ea ch sec tor could lose or g ain by not sharing water resour ces. The second se ssion discussed ways to develop effective collaborative processes for sharing water, how to improve water management flexibility, transaction strategies, and regulatory/oversight processes. The final session focused on ways to overc ome wate r shar ing obsta cles. The forum conclude d by identify ing those \"next steps\" for whic h there was consensus among attendee s. These r ecommenda tions will be fur ther re fined a nd prese nted for approval to attendee s and their r espec tive org anizations before they are distributed to the WGA and Rec lamation for possible conside ration. Of note, the forum age nda was develope d by a wor k group consisting of re prese ntatives from the WGA, WS WC, Alliance , the Natur e Conserva ncy, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , and other s. This gr oup was for med i n response to the WGA's 200847\"Next Ste ps\" Report, which recomm ended: \"States...working with interested stakeholders, should identify innovative ways to allow water transfe rs from a gricultural to urba n uses while avoiding or mitigating damag es to ag ricultural e conomies and e nvironmental values.\" The forum was intende d endation.

Bureau of Reclamation FY2011 Budget Request The Department of Interior requested $12.2 billion in f unding for FY2011, a 0.3% decrease from 2010 leve ls. ithin I nterior, the B ureau of Recla mation would see a funding decr ease of about $23 milli on, down to $1.1 billion. Of this amount, $489.9 m illion would go to water , ener gy, and other r ehabilitatio n activities at Rec lamation fac ilities, including dam safe ty; $62 mill ion would be Reclamation's share of the WaterSMART Program (encompassing $27 million for grants, $6 milli on for basin studies, and $29 milli on for Titl e XVI projec ts); and $11.5 million i n scienc e and tec hnology funding to support the establishment of I nterior' s Clim ate Scienc e Center s. Recla mation's budg et also see ks funding for a number of pr ojects in California, including $171.7 Prog ram; and $49.9 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. Funding for other programs o f note includes $25.1 m illion for the Middle Rio Grande Projec t in New Mexico; $22.5 mil lion for the Klamath Projec t in California and Or egon; and $62 m illion for ongoing construction on seven rura l water projec ts in North Dakota, South Da kota, Montana, and Ne w Mexico. Separate ly, the Central Utah Projec t reque st is $43 mi llion, mitiga tion and conser vation. With respect to tribal projects, Reclamation is seeking $12.5 million for the Animas La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico; $10 million for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project in New M exico and Arizona; and $4 million for the Sob oba Wat er Rights Settlement Project in California. Another $7.4 million would go to Reclamation's Native American Affairs Program, which provides technical suppor t for Indian water rights settlements and helps tribes protect, manag e, and de velop wate r and r elated r esourc es. The Bureau of Indian Affairs would also rec eive $46.5 million for Indian land and water settlements under Interior's budget request. Estimated FY2011 a ppropriations from the Rec lamation Fund total $867 million. Total estimated Fund receipts are $1.892 billion. The bulk of the receipts come from mineral leasing revenues fr om fede ral lands. Estimated Fund r eceipts for FY 2010 total $1.6 billi on and expenditures $948 milli on. Actual F und rec eipts for F Y2009 were $1.822 billion, and ex penditures we re $1.869 billion (with Reclamation's Wa ter and Related Resources Account receiving $1.6 billion - due to Stim ulus spending - w hich is near ly twice the $806 mill ion reque st for F Y2011). The estimated unobliga ted balanc e at the end of FY2011 is $10.312 billion, compared to ttee on Ene rgy and Na tural Resourc es' Subcommittee on Water a nd Power he ld a hea ring on April 27, to discuss eig ht bills that authorize new pr ograms in Arizona, California, Oregon, Texas, and Utah under Reclamation's water reuse and recycling program, otherwise know n as Title XVI . \"We're seeing an incr eased demand f or a f inite exi sting supply of water and how we man age that water is a very imp ortant question for all of us today,\" said Subcommitt \"The Subcommittee's g oal will be to ensure that the bills we move for ward are consistent with the criter ia required by legislation authorizi ng Title XVI projects. Accordingly, we'll be looking for projects that are technically and economically feasible.\" Reclama tion' s Deputy \"We recog nize that water r euse is an essential tool in stretching the limited water supplies in the West, a nd I believe the FY 2011 Budg et request on top of the [Stimu lus] funding has demonstrated the emphasis placed b y this Administration on t his Progr am,\" she said. \"How ever, given that there are 53 alre ady authorized Title XVI projects and numerous competing mission priorities and demands on Reclamation's budg et, the De partment c annot support the author ization of new Title XVI projec ts or extensions of existing c ost ceiling s at this tim e. Rec lamation will, how ever, continue to work with projec t proponents to eva luate the c ompleteness of f easibility studies of their cts.\" With respe ct to the FY 2011 budg et proposal, Kir a noted that it includes $29 m illion for the Title XVI prog ram, a 113% incre ase ove r the 2010 enacte d level. Of that a mount, she said I nterior is requesting $20 mi llion for Title XVI projects that will be selected using funding criteria Reclama tion is currently developing . These c riteria w ill help address the Title XVI backlog \"...by providing some useful metric s that we can [rely on to] revie w and r ank and pr ioritiz e propose d projects that will give us the best bang for our buck.\" The bills addressed at the hearing include S. 745/H.R. 9 SECURE W ater Act On Febru ary 9, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on Reclamation's implementation of the SEC URE Water Act. Cha irman Jef f Bingaman (D-NM)10 called the oversig ht hear to a lso address Rec lamation's Water Conserva tion I nitiative, including the Cha llenge Grants, Basin Study, and Title XVI Programs, as well as water reuse projects. Because of the limit ed amount of time a vailable for the he aring , only a few witnesses we re invited to testify in person, but others ha d been e ncoura ged to submit written testimony for the r ecord. The witness list inc luded: Commissioner Michael Connor; Melinda Kassen, T rout Unlimited; Dan Ke ppen, F amily Farm Alliance ; Pat nd #1868, Marc h 5, 2010.13 49the C olorado River Basin States; and Tony Pack, Eastern Municipal Wa ter District, which is a freshwater, wastewater and recycled water service provider in the Moreno Valley and the 5 largestth water district in California.11 Basin St udies The B ureau of Recla mation sought letter s of interest ederal throug hout the 17 weste rn states conduc t river ba sin or sub-basin studies wher e wa ter supply and dema nd imbalance s may exist. The request was pa rt of the De partment of I nterior' s WaterSMART Progr am and is a ke y component of Reclamation's plan for implementing the Secur e Water A ct (SWA). The studies will include assessments of the imp acts of climate change on water resources and will consider other risks to water supplies. The basin studies will be cost-shared on a 50/50 basis with willing state, triba l and local pa rtners. The y will ge nerally be two y ears in duration. Howeve r, because this is not a financial assistance program, R eclamation's share of the study costs may only be used to support work done by Reclamation or its contractors. Reclamation also may not pass funding through to cost-share partners in the form of grants or cooperative agreements. On Aug ust 12, Bure au of Rec lamation Commi ssioner Mike Connor announc ed $3.3 million in funding for six ba sin studies and two plans of study to begin in fiscal year 2010. The studies will match over $4 million in non-federal funding from s tate, tribal, and local partners. The six ba sin studies that Connor announce d include: (1) the Truckee River Ba sin St udy in California and N evada ; (2) the D eschute s River Ba sin St udy in Oreg on; (3) the Henr y's Fork of the Snake River Basin St udy in Idaho; (4) the Niobrar a River B asin Study in Nebra ska; (5) the Santa Ana Water shed B asin Study in California; and (6) the Southeast California Regional Basin Study. The studies will assess climate change imp acts on water resources and consider risks to water supplies, includ ing changes to snowpack and runoff timing and quantity. 12 Two plans of study include a Klamath B asin Study in California and O regon and a T aos Pueblo Water Supply and De mand B asin Study in New M exico. The plans of study will define outcomes and set the scope and focus for potential future basin studies. Partners will develop the plans of study with Reclamation and submit proposals for basin studies during the next funding opportunity announcement.13 Water Supply Northw est Area W ater Supply Projec t On Marc h 9, a fe deral district court judg e orde red Reclamation to conduct fur ther environmenta l studies on the potential impacts of the Nor thwest Are a Water Supply Project. The projec t would pipe 3.5 billion gallons of wa ter pe r year from L ake Sak akawea, a Missouri Ri ver reservoir in ce ntral North Da kota, to the North Dakota c ity of Minot, located in the Hudson B ay Basin, which includes ce ntral Canada and portions of the Grea t Plains wit hin the 2009, and #1863, January 29, 2010.16 50water would then be distributed to ten North Dakota counties. Although mo st of the planned 45-mile pipeline has be en finished, the Ca nadian pr ovince of Manitoba filed a lawsuit, in 2002, claiming tha t Reclama tion failed to consid er the proje ct's envir onmental impacts as r equire d by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Miss ouri, has filed a separate suit over concerns about impacts on downstream water levels. In response to Ma nitoba's lawsuit, Reclama tion a rgued that it was not require d to conduct a study of the c onsequenc es of a specie s transfe r, which it said wa s unlikely . Reclama tion further argued that fe deral law did not require it to investiga te the potential impacts of the projec t on other countries a nd that a pre vious court order and rec ommendation from EPA had de termined that the project's environmental safeguards were adequa te. Re clamation also revised the project to incorpora te a plan to disinfec t the Missouri Ri ver B asin wate r prior to tra nsfer . Howeve r, the c hang es we re not e noug h for Judge Rosemar y Colly er of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbi a, who f ound that the ag ency had taken steps to re duce environmenta l impacts, but had not studied the potential conseque nces. \" The Court is acute ly aware that Reclama tion and North Dakota have built miles of pipeline a nd that the citizens of the ar ea want the Project c ompleted. These facts do not ex cuse Rec lamation's fa ilure t o follow the law,\" she wrote. \" This case demonstrates the adage that it is better to do something rig ht the first time. Reclamation has wasted years by cutting corners and looking for shortcuts.\" Col lyer further wrote that an existi ng injunction will remain in place a s Reclamation stu dies the ef fects of the transf er. The a gency must also study the conse quence s of potential spec ies transfe rs into the Hudson Ba y Basin.14 Delta-Mendota Canal/California Aqueduct Intertie On April 13, the De partment of I nterior a nnounced tha t Reclamation will provide $20.7 million funds for the Delta-Mendota Canal/California Aque duct Intertie, which is intended to provide more reliable water supplies to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley and other communities throug hout California. The project i s schedule d to be onli ne in the Fall of 2011 and will connect the Delta- Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct vi a a new pipeline and pumping plant desig ned to improve convey ance, allow for maintenance and re pair a ctivities, and improve the flexibi lity of oper Reclama State Water Project. \"The intert ie...will facilitate more efficient movement of water,\" said Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar . \"This will help alleviate some of the diff iculties cause d by the three-year droug ht.\"15 Senator B arbara Boxer (D-CA) a lso praised the project, say ing, \"This Delta Mendota Interie w ill get water wher e it's nee ded, whe n it's neede d. This project will help provi de much needed wate r supplies while cre ating hundreds of jobs.\"16www.usbr.g ov/ruralwa ter. 17 http://transportation.house.gov/.18 51Rural W ater Supply Act On May 13, the B ureau of Recla mation announce d the next st ep in impl ementation of the Rural Wa ter Supply Act. Reclamation will work with comm unities of less than 50,000 people in rural areas to assess their potable water supply needs and identify options to address those needs. A progr am has been cre ated to help investig ate oppor tunities to ensure saf e and a dequate water supply projec ts for domestic, muni cipal, and industrial use. R eclamation will help plan rural wa ter supply projec ts through a ppraisal investig tion would require Cong ressional a uthorization. As part of the program, Reclamation announced the availability of at least $2 million in grants to help rur al communities conduct a ppraisal inv estigations and isal investiga tion, Reclamation will pa y 100% up to $200,000 and 50% for all costs above tha t amount. Funding for feasibili ty studies will be cost-share d with Reclamation pay ing 50% . The non- federal c ost sharing require d may be provide d in the form of mone y or in-kind servic es that Reclama tion determines ar e nec essar y and re asonable to conduct and complete an investiga tion or study. Following completion of an appraisal investigation and feasibility study, Reclamation will report to the Congress with recomm endations regarding the construction of a rural water supply projec t, and the appr opriate non- Federal share of construc tion costs. Aga in, the prog ram provide s authority for appraisa l investigations and feasibility studies, but Congressional authorization is require d for pr oject construc tion. Eligible a pplicants include states, political subdivisi ons of states, tribes, and othe r entities with water manag ement and w ater authority . Reclama tion will revie w the stateme nts of interest to determine if applicants satisfy the eligibility and prioritization criteria for the funding.17 Clean Water Act/Environm ental P rotection Agency America's Com mitment to Clean Wa ter Act On April 21, Rep. James Oberstar (D-MN ), Chair of the House Transpor tation and Infrastructure Committee, introduce d the Amer ica's Commi tment to Cl ean Water Act (H .R. 5088).18 The bill is the latest attempt at amending the CWA to overturn the Supreme Cou rt's SWANC C and Rapanos decisions, which Obe rstar a nd others believe created c onfusion over the types of wa ters subject to CWA jurisdi ction and lef t certain water s without adequate protec tion. The bill would replac e the ter m \"navig able wa ters\" (used to deter mine CW A jurisdiction) with \"waters of the United Stat es,\" which it would then define as: (1) \"all wa ters that are currently used, we re use d in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or fore ign c ommerce , including all waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide; (2) \"all interstate and international waters, including interstate and international wetlands;\" (3) \"all other waters, including intrastate lakes, rivers, streams ( including intermittent streams), mu dflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet mea dows, play a lake s, or natura l ponds, the use, deg radation, or destruction of whic h does or would a ffect interstate or fore ign c ommerce , the obliga tions o ov/news/PRArticle.aspx?

This Act and the amendments made by this Act do not affect those administrative and judicial interpretations.\" The findings also say the bill and its amendments do not affect the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Eng ineer s, which have permitting authority under sections 402 and 404 of the CWA, as interpr eted or applied as of Januar y 8, 2001, the day befor e the SWANC C decision. The bill marks the f ifth attempt in the House to o verturn the Sup reme Cou rt decisions. Howeve r, it differ s from pas t efforts by deleting lang uage sug gesting that any \"activiti es,\" a s opposed to \"discha rges,\" w ould require regulation. I t also codifies e xemptions f or wa stewate r treatment s ystems and prior c onverte d cropla nd and attempts to clar ify fede ral jurisdiction by identify ing the Commerce Clause , Trea ty Power, and Property Clause of the U.S. Constit ution as the underly ing a uthorities for CWA reg ulation. On April 21, Obe rstar a nd co-sponsors Rep. John Dinge ll (D-MI ) and Rep. Vernon Ehlers (R-MI) held a press conference to discuss the bill. \"[The bill] is n ot an expa nsion of the CWA, \" said Ober star. \"The bill will not require permits for e very wet ar ea. Simply put, if it was not reg ulated befor e 2001, it will not be reg ulated with the enactment of this legislation.\" Ding ell, one of the few current member s of Cong ress to have voted for the original version of the CWA, discussed the laws legislative history saying, \" We made it clear that we were prote cting all of the wa ters of the United States.... The bil l is simple. It makes it perfectly clear what the C ongress int ended in 1972.\" Rep. Vernon Ehlers (R-MI) also said, \"Our purpose here is to cla rify without any doubt what the Congress originally intended to do all those many years ago, and to wr ite the bill in a way that everyone, all the users of water , all the judg es who wil l be aske d to review the law, c learly understand our intent...so that this will be the final version of the [CWA] th at will guide this nation for years to come.\" Howeve r, Tra nsportation and I nfrastructure Ranking Member John Mica (R-F L) issued a statement saying, \"The added confusion, delay s, and endless litigation created by this bill will heap new c osts on America n agriculture, ma nufac turing , housing a nd other businesses, a nd our alre ady grim unemploy ment picture w ill wo rsen.\" In addition, Water Resource s and Environment Subcommitt ee Ra nking Me mber John Boozman (R-AR) cr iticiz ed the bill as \"an undeniable and considera ble expansion of fede ral a uthority.\" House Na tural Resourc es Committ ee Ra nking19 Member Re p. Doc Ha stings (R-WA) sa id it would risk jobs and \"t he very viability\" of f arms and small businesses in rural Ame rica. Represe ntatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Rodgers (R-WA ), and Adrian Smith (R-NE) have also similarly criticized the bill.Western States W ater, #1831, J une 19, 2009, #1842, September 4, 2009, and #1856, De cembe April 30, 2010.22 53Ober star had indicated that he would like to beg in moving the bill by June and hope d to bring it to the House floor by September. O f note, a simil ar bill (S. 787) passe d the Senate E nvironment and Public Wor ks Com mittee last Jun e, by a 12-7 vote, with strong Republican dissent.20 On June 22, Represe ntatives Doc Hastings (R-WA), Fra Lucas ( R-OK), a nd Sam Grave s (R-MO) se nt a letter to Re p. James Obe rstar, Chair of the House Transpor tation and I nfrastructure Com mittee and other Democratic leaders asking for hearings on H.R. 5088. The letter said the bill21 would have \"...a great impact on Wes tern irrigation proj ects, farming and ranching operations, mining, and sma ll businesses....

The Plan is intended to establish clea r expectations for sta te per formanc e, hold s tates consistently accountable, and se t the same e xpecta tions for EPA wher e it implements prog rams. The document notes that the a ctions are intended to help test the Plan's direction and additional changes to EPA 's oversight of state programs may be nee ded. The fir st action asks EPA re gions to expand their Na tional Poll utant Dischar ge Elimination System (NPDES) to tion of enfor ceme nt and per mitti ng in an integrated way, using data and analyses from other CWA programs (such as water quality standards, assessment and monitoring ), and w orking together with states to ensure tha t planned ac tiviti es combine to improve wa ter qua lity and that our limited resourc es addr ess the most serious problems.\" The second states that \"...EPA regions a cross the country should ta ke action wher e states have demonstrated long-standing problems w ith their permit quality or enforcement programs t o demonstrate the deterrent value of enforcement, ensure a fair and level playing field across states, and equa l protection for all citizens.\" The docume nt also asks reg ions to identify the most serious source s of pollution, conduct routine and r egular meeting s with sta tes to disc uss pr ogress, and ca rry out reg ular re views of state performanc e. Of note, a memorandum a ccompanying the document directs regions to work with state partners to \"...identify water quality priorities at the national, regional and state level and to use those priorities to g uide the investment of our limit ed re source s toward addressing the most significa nthttp:// tomudall.senate.g ov/?p=pre ss_relea se&id=590.23 54water quality problems and serious violations.

The bill would establish up to five regional centers that would research and develop these techniques and provide technic al assistance to state, tribal, and loca l gove rnments re lating to the construction, operation, and maintenance of green infrastructure projects. The bill wou ld also create a green infrastruc ture program within EPA's Offic e of Water to coordinate and promote the use of new stormwater techniques, and integrate green infrastructure into permitting programs. As for funding, the bill would authorize EPA to provide competitive grants to states, tribes, local governments, and local wastewater utilities to carry out green infrastructure projects. Grants would be limited to $200,000 for planning and deve lopment and $3 million for implementation activities. Although the federal cost share would not exceed 65% of a project's total cost, EPA would be able to waiv e this lim itation for elig ible entities that tely demonstrate f inancial ne ed. The Assoc iation of State and I nterstate Water Pollut ion Control Administrators, the Na tional Association of Clean Wa ter Agencies, American Rivers, and others have supported the bill. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act On Aug ust 6, Sena te Ag ricultural Committee Chair B lanche Lincoln (D-A K) and Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) introduced S. 3735 to clarify that National Pollutant Discharge Elimination S ystem (NPDES) per mits under the CWA would not be require d for pes ticide applications ca rried out in accor dance with the Fe deral Insecticide , Fung icide, and Rode nticide Act (FIFRA). T he bill seeks to over turn a 2009 Six th Circuit Court o f Appeals' ruling in National Cotton C ouncil v. EPA , which struck dow n a Ge orge W. Bush-e ra EPA r ule that exempted pesticide applications over water , which the judge found wa s an unre asonable interpre tation of the CWA. The case consolidated c halleng es that environme ntal g roups filed in ele ven diffe rent fe deral circuits and there fore has national implications. The court gave EPA and states until April 2011 to develop a nd issue g eneral per mits for pesticide applica tions. The U.S. Supreme Court d eclined to revie w the decision ea rlier this y ear. \"Our legislation is very simple: as long a s a produc er is complying with FI FRA, then no [CWA] permit will be requir ed,\" sa id Lincoln in a pre ss relea se. \"D uring the more tha n 35 y ears since the e nactment of the [CW A], the EPA has never requir ed a per mit for the applica tion of FIFRA-r egistered c rop protec ch and avoid duplicative, unnece and ranchers.\" 4, 2010, and #1891, A ugust 13, 2010.26 Western States W ater, and #1899, Oc tober 8, 2010.27 55\"Our legislation would sim ply preve nt the EPA from imposing a n err oneous re gulation that does absolutely nothing to fur ther prote ct or e nhance the environme nt.\" Of note, EPA issued a draft general per mit for pesticides in J une to comply with the court ruling . It would regulate biol ogical pesticides and chemical pesticide discharg es that lea ve a r esidue, and wo uld cover a number of pe sticide use patter ns, including mosquito and other flying inse ct control, aquatic weed and algae control, aquatic nuisance animal control, and forest canopy pest control.24 On September 29, House Ag riculture Commit tee Chairman Collin P eterson (D-MN) introduced H. R. 6273, which ame nds the FI FRA a nd the CWA to prohibit additional permits for pesticid e application when pesticides are applied consistent with FIFRA. The bill is similar in purpose to S. 3735 and H.R. 6087, which Sena tor Bla nche Lincoln (D-A R) and Frank Lucas ( R-OK) introduced last month. However, those bills only amend FIFRA, while Peterson's bill in cludes a confor ming amendment to the CWA that states: \"The Administrator [of the EPA] shall not require a permit under this section, nor shall the Administrator directly or indirectly require any State to require a per mit, for the applica tion of any pesticide subjec t to [FIFRA] if the pesticide is applied in conforma nce w ith that Act.\"25 \"This legislation will make clear that Congress never intended for farmers and ranchers to meet additional per mit requirements for pesticide a pplications under F IFRA,\" Peterson said.26 On Dec ember 16, twelve Republica n Senators sent a letter to the Of fice of Mana gement and Budget (OMB), expressing concern over EPA 's pesticides general permit (PGP). OMB is currently revie wing the PGP a nd the letter expresses conce rn over: (1) its scope ; (2) the \"...short timeline for states to implement and re gulated entities to comply with the new regulatory scheme ;\" and ( 3) \"...the extraordinary cost the new reg ulation will im pose on aff ected stakeholder s for minimal environmenta l benef it.\" I t also urg es the Administration to \"...either seek a delay from the c ourt or use its authority to suspend enfor ceme nt of the new permit.\" The following Senators sig ned the letter: Saxby David Johanns (NE ), Dick L ugar (IN), John Thune (SD), Chuck Gr assley (IA), L amar Alexander (T N), John Ba rrasso (WY), Thad Cochr an (MS), a nd Mike Crapo (I D).27 Water Transfers Rule In a November 4 letter to EPA A dministrat or Lisa Ja ckson, the Wes tern Governors' Association (WGA ) supports the agency's water transfers rule and opposes changes. The EPA rule clarifies that wate r transf ers are ex empt from NPDES permit require ments under Section 402 of the CWA. EPA has indicate d that it is reconsidering the rule. The letter states, \"W estern G overnor s suppo rt the rule in its curre nt form and be lieve that tra nsporting w ater throug h constructe d conveyances to supply beneficial uses should not trigger NPDE S pe rmit requirements simply because the source and receiving water contain different chemical concentrations and physicalWestern States W ater, #1821, April 10, 2009.28 56constituents. Historically , water not been subjec t to NPDES permitti ng and the federal government has deferred to the states' control of water allocation and administration within their border s.\" The letter also notes that states alr eady have a uthority to addre ss the water quality issues associated with transfers and that Congress did not intend the NPD ES p rogram to govern transfers. \"To the c ontrary , Section 101(g ) expressly states t hat the CWA will not superc ede or abrog ate the rights of states to allocate water qua ntities with their jurisdiction.... NPDE S permitting requirements could have the effect of forcing water sup pliers to forgo the full exercise of their state water rights which would directly abrogate or supersede state water law and the allocation of state water rights. This would contradic t Section 101(g ) and upse t deral balance regarding water quality protec tions and rig hts to water use .\" Cooling Water I ntake Structure s EPA Administrator L isa Jackson pr ovided new insig ht into a rule her agency is developing for cooling water intake structures at existin g electric power pla nts. In a December 16 letter to incoming H ouse Ener gy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton said: \"I do not favor a one-size-fits all federal ma ndate. The proposal that EPA i ssues next Ma rch will reflect a eping faith with the need to minimize adverse environmenta l impacts. Then EPA will invite all members of the public to offer suggestions for imp roving the proposal.

In total, the Service is proposing to de signa te about 22,679 mi les of strea ms and 533,426 ac res of lakes a nd rese rvoirs in I daho, Or egon, Washington, Montana, a nd Neva da. Estimated costs for the proposal include $5 million to $7 million per year for the next 20 years, primarily for additional federal agency consultation requirements, and $2.1 million to $2.5 million per year for fish passage improvements at more than 70 federal and non-fe deral dams. Forest manag ement cha nges could run milli on per year. Approxim ately 58% of the proposed critical habitat occurs on federal land, while 36% and 2% are found on state and tribal land respectively. \"This proposed r evisi on is the re sult of ext ensive re view of our earlier bull trout critical habitat proposals and 2005 designation, public comments and new information,\" said Robyn Thorson, direc tor of the Ser vice' s Pacific Reg ion. \"We voluntarily embar ked on this re- examination to ensure tha t the best scienc e was used to identify the fe ature s and ar eas essential to the conser vation of the spec ies.\"34 Delta Sme lt The U.S. Fish and Wild life Service (FWS) r ecomm ended reclassifying California's delta smelt as \"endangered,\" from \"threatened,\" under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Although FWS is u nable to d etermine which threats are directly responsible for the d ecrease in s melt populations, it says the fish meets the definition of an endangered species because its low numbers, in conce rt with ong oing thr eats, indica tes that it is now in dange r of e xtinction.http:// www.f ws.gov/cno/press/re lease Western #1808, J anuar y 9, 2009, #1821, April 10, 2009, and #1830, June 12,36 2009. 61Howeve r, FWS said the nee d to addres s other, hig her pr iority specie s ludes reclassification at this time. Re classifica tion is lower priority beca use cur rent ctions alrea dy prohibit \"take\" of the thre atene d smelt in the same way as an e ndang ered specie s. Thus, the recomm endation will have no practical effect on protections for the smelt, existin g federal actions, or water flows in the delta smelt habitat.35 San J oaquin-Sac rame nto Delta Pumping Restric tions On Fe bruar y 10, J udge Oliver Wange r of the U.S . District Court for the Ea stern District of California denied a request by the Westlands Wa ter District and other water agencies to temporarily postpone new pumping restric tions for the San Joaquin-Sacrame nto Delta. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) orde red the restric tions under ical desig t the endang ered pursua nt to the ESA. Intere stingly , a we ek prior, Wang er issued a decision that tem porarily suspended a nother BiOp aim ed at p rotecting migrating salmon in the Delta. However, that decision led to an increase in pumping that entr ained smelt, t hereby prompting FWS t o impose the new r estrictions. Since the smelt BiOp re quires lower pumping rates than the salmon BiOp, Wang er's decision this week rende rs moot his prior decision to su spend the salmon B iOp. San J oaquin Valley water agency representatives say the restrictions will result in the loss of 90,000 acre-fe et of water. They also indicated that they will try again to g et Wang er to lift the re strictions nex t week. 36 On Ma y 25, Jud ge Oliver Wa nger temporarily lifted the p umping restrictions in Sacramento-San Joa quin Delta that are intended to protect native salmon and steelhead trout, until June 15. Some fa rm groups have estimated that it could mean an extra 200,000 acre-feet of wa ter for farme rs, many of whom have left larg e tracts of land f allow bec ause of the extended droug ht and Delta pumping restric tions. The ruling follows a May 18 decisio n in which Wang er sa id the National Mar ine Fishe ries Servic e, which develope d the restric tions as part of a biologica l opinion, had ac ted \"...a rbitrarily and ca priciously in formulating [pum ping limits] to protect thre atene d specie s under the E SA that lack fa ctual and sc ientific justification, while ef fectively ignor ing the irreparable harm those actions have inflicted on huma ns and the human environment.\" He also said the limits were the \"produc t of g uesstimations.\" Of note, Wang er is expected to issue a ruling in a simil ar case involving pumping r estrictions aimed a t protecting the Delta sme lt, which is also list ed under the ESA. Such a ruling could have an additional impact on pumping in the Delta. Columbi a River/Salmon Judge James Redden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, the federal judge overse eing efforts to make the Colum bia River Basin's hy droele ctric da ms safer for sa lmon has given National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Fisheries until February 19 toWestern States W ater, #1785, Aug ust 1, 2008, and #1804, Dec ember 12, 2008.37 62decide whether to voluntarily take ba ck its proposed improve ments to a Geor ge W.

I n litigation stretching back over 15 y ears, the fede ral governme nt has attempted to determine how to best balanc e wa ter ne eds for hydroele ctric pow er and wild salmon in the Columbi a Basin. I n September, the Obama Administration set forth a c onserva tion plan, known as the \"Ada ptive Manag ement I mplementation Plan,\" which include d climate cha nge monitoring a nd proposed r emoving dams as a \" last resort.\" Judge Redden said he cannot consider the revisions until they are formally included in the overa ll biologial opinion. He also urg ed the agency to produce a stronger plan, saying: \"I will not sign an order of voluntary remand that effectively relieves Federal Defendants of their obligation to use the be st available sc ience and conside r all important aspec ts of the problem. This cour t will not dictate the scope or substance of Federal Defendant's remand, but Federal Defendants must comply with the ESA in prepar ing a ny amende d/supplemental biologic al opinion.\" Redden has found twice before that federal plans violated the ESA for not adequately protec ting sa lmon, thereby forcing the governme nt to devote more water to fish and less to power production. He has also urg ed NOA A Fishe ries to work w ith Oreg on and the other parties in the case.37 The federal government will spend an additional three mon ths revising its plan on how to opera te dams i n the Columbia River Ba sin, while also protec ting sa lmon, which are listed as threa tened unde r the ESA.

At issue is the construction of a n Austin water tr eatment plant a nd associate d transmission tunnels. The g roups claim the construc tion poses an \"ur gent to the s alamande r's surviva l beca use it will take place in the \"hea rt\" of its habitat. \" The Joll yville Plateau Salamande r nee ds Giese. \"The fact that one population has alre ady been lost to drilling de monstrates there is a signif icant risk....\" In 2007, the FWS determined tha t the salamande r wa rranted listi ng as a threatened or endang ered specie s under the E SA. Howeve r, it also found that such a listing was pre cluded a nd delay ed prote ction of the spec ies. The ESA require s FWS to monitor precluded spe cies a nd protec tions if their survival is threate ned. A CB D pre ss relea se say s such emer gency protections are warranted, citing a letter three University of Texas s cientists sent FWS in A pril, expressing concerns that constructing the plant could \"...pose a major threat to the species, both in the short and long -term.\" The letter also said, \"I f the City cannot pr ove the pr oject will have no63adver se effects, the Service should proc eed w ith lis ting the salamande r as endang ered so as to forc e necessary conser vation measure s on the City 's activiti es.\" Energy and Water The WSWC is working with the WGA and the National Laboratories under a contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop water demand projection and water availability mod els as a basis for estimating and evaluating water needs for electric power generation and other energy uses. The WSWC a nd WGA will also evaluate the impacts of those demands on oth er water use sectors. A s part of this ef fort, the WSW C is providing expert advice and state- generated da ta, and is prepar ing a nd gather ing inf ormation on the state institutions, s tatutes, policies and pr ocesse s that govern water rights and control the allocation and use of water in the Wes t. Specific a ctions in 2010 included a joint eff ort with Sandia National Labora tories and Arizona, Colorado, Ore gon, and Te xas to beg in ga thering the state wa ter da ta nee ded to develop the project's water demand and availability models.

Exem pt Wells Report The WSW C prepar ed a r eport that discusses the costs and benefits of monitoring exempt wells and potential approaches to mitigate their impacts. The Lewis and Clark Law School's \"Environmenta l Law\" journal published the re port in Marc h 2010. The re port found that all but two weste rn states e xempt cer tain amounts of g round wa ter used for domestic and livestock purposes from their permitting and/or adjudi cation pro cedures. These \"exempt\" wells have the potential to cre ate signific ant regulatory and administrative cha lleng es and could impact the sustainability of water supplies, surface flows, and water quality. Among the key findings were the following: There is no single a pproac h for a ddressing exempt w ell use and eac h state's individual circumstances will determine how and if it should mitigate exemp t well impacts. Permitting and monitoring exemp t wells on a statewide basis may not be politically or administratively feasible for a ll states. Some states may need to use narr ow appr oache s that addre ss specific concer ns as opposed to efforts with statewide applications. States may also nee d to work wit h stakeholder s to crea te neg otiated solutions that address concerns while allowing responsible exemp t uses.WGA 2008 Next S teps 64Effor ts to mitiga te the adver se impacts of existi ng exempt wells will likely be more costly and difficult than prospective measures that prevent future impacts. Examples of possible prospe ctive mea sures include water banks, limit ing the number and ty pe of e xempt uses, ensuring proper well construc tion, an d restricting new exemp t wells in areas with comm unity water systems and/or limited water supplies. Metering exempt wells will not show how much wa ter exempt wells consume a nd will not cu rtail exempt us e bec ause most users a ppear to comply with exempti on limits.38 Indian Water Rights Blackfeet Settlement On April 29, Senators Ma x Baucus (D- MT) and Jon Tester (D-MT) introduced le gislation (S. 3290) that would authorize the B lackf eet Indian Tribe' s water settlement. The settlement is the result of ove r 20 y ears of negotiations between the Tr ibe, Montana, the federal governme nt, and local communities. I f appr oved, it would quantify the Tribe' s water rights and protec t existing wa ter users. It would also authori ze $591 mi llion in federal funding to b uild drinking water systems, irrigation systems, and water storage projects. \"This is an historic mom ent for the Blackfeet tribes and for the Mon tanans who call these communities home,\" B aucus sa id. \"Montanans of all stripes worke d toge ther on this plan. Now we're taking the ball and moving it closer to the g oal line to finally solve these long -standing disputes.

Th e reservation's existin g drinking water system ha s significant deficiencies in capacity and water quality that have resulted in health problems. The bill would authorize up to $460 milli on in fede ral funding , and would dire ct immediate spending of $301 million. The de tails of the Taos se ttlement in New Mexico are outlined in Titl e V. This settlement solidifies and makes pe rmanent water-sha ring arrangements betwe en the Pueblo of Ta os and neighboring comm unities. It also protects and restores th e Pueblo's Buffalo Pasture, a culturally sensitive and sac red w etland. The overa ll cost is $144 mi llion, with a f ederal contribution of $124 milli on. The bill also includes $66 million i n immediat e spending to purcha se wa ter rig hts and construct projects to help improve wat er use effi ciency, grou nd water managem ent, and water quality in the Taos Valley. The Aamodt settlement in New Mexico comprises Title VI and would end one of the longest running water rights cases, a fter ne arly 43 y ears of litigation. The settlement provides for the construction of a regional water system to serve the P ueblos of Tesuque, Nambe, Pojoaque, and San Ildefonso, as as surr ounding c ommuniti es in norther n New Me xico. The total c ost of the settlement is estimated to be $291.2 million, with a federal contribution of $174.3 million to be paid over 13 years. State and local contributions will total about $116.9 mi llion. This represents a 60%/40% fe deral and non-fe deral cost share . The bill immediately makes a vailable $81.8 million to implement the settlement.

In a floor spee ch, he e xpresse d conce rn that the settlements will cost more than if the tribes had litigated their water rights in court. He also said, \"I believe Congress needs to demand that the Administration be candid and forthcoming in all claims for se ttlement, and that Cong ress insists that before it begins delibera ting on a settl ement, that the Attorney General has conducted and completed the negot iations , determined all the details, certified that the settlement is within the leg al liability of the g overnme nt and only then submits that settle ment for consider ation by Congr ess.

Among other things, WaterSMART calls for water conservation actions to increase available water supplies by 350,000 acr e-feet by 2012 for a gricultural, municipal, i ndustrial, and environmental uses. Several parts of the order are aimed at improving wa ter management through conser vation and helping water manag ers make wise dec isions about water use . First, it calls for a national framework to integrate and coordinate the water sus tainability efforts of the Department an d its sta te, federal, and private partners. To do this, the Initiative will: (1) coordinate with the Task Force on Energ y and C limate Chang e to identify the wate r footprint of energy technologies; (2) work with the Energy and Clim ate Cha nge Cou ncil, the DOI Clim ate Science Centers, and the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives to obtain the best available climate69chang e scie nce on water impacts and integ rate sustainable wa ter stra tegies within the field offic es of the Department's bureaus and agencies; and (3) establish a water footprint reduction program to reduce the Department's potable water consumption by 26% by 2020 and its industrial, landscaping, and ag ricultural c onsumption by 20% by 2020. Second, it will crea te a Water SMART clearinghouse to \"...c onvene inter ested g overnme ntal supplier org anizations, conserva tion and scientific or ganizations, and other s to ide ntify best practices in water conser vation, incentives, the most cost-e ffective tec hnologie s that stretch e xisting wa ter supplies, and a ctions that integ rate ener gy and wa ter policies....\" Third, with respe ct to th e energy-water ne xus, the I nitiative will ensure that I nterior \"...applies c riteria tha t identify and support proje cts and ac tions that promote sustainable wate r strateg ies, hy nitiative \"...will evalua te the information neede d for sound de cision-making on sustainable water and will determine whether there is adequate information about the availability, quality , and use of water across the Nation for this purpose. The I nitiative will make recommendations for e nhance ments to inf ormation collection analy sis and e nee ded.\" The WaterSMART Initiative e xpands existing Bureau of Reclama tion g rant prog rams and river basin studies, and provides funding to the U.S. G eological Survey (USGS) to conduct a National Water Census ( for the f irst time in som e 30 y ears). President Obama's proposed FY2011 budg et request for Water SMART is $72. 9 million, represe nting a n incre ase of $36.4 milli simil ar 2010 pr ograms. FY2011 budge t reque st included $9 milli on to fund WaterSMART's availability and use assessment and the USGS has orga nized an ad hoc committee of which the WSWC is a member in order to draft a conceptual framework for such an undertaking. The WaterSMART prog ram will be implemented by a Ta sk Forc e cha ired by Assistant Secretary of Wat er and Science, Anne Castle, with help from Interior's other Assistant Secretaries, burea u heads, a nd the Solicitor's Offic e. The Secre tary and the Deputy Secretary will serve a s ex-officio member s. Assistant Secreta ry Castle, kicked off t he Initiative at a workshop in L as Ve gas on F ebrua ry 23-24. About 160 stakeholder s from across t he seve n Colorado River B asin States came toge ther to help fra me the new Initiative and discuss issues and idea s on how to improve wate r conse rvation and water management as a means of addressing future challenges.

The Cou ncil also worked extensively with western Senators and members of the House to secure bipartisan support for federal funding for TIRS. Litigation/ Water Rights Snake Va lley Aquifer On J anuar y 28, the Neva da Supreme Court issued a dec ision that could delay or upend a Southern Neva da Water A uthority (SNWA) proposal to pump 50,000 acr e-feet of wa ter pe r year from the Snake Valley aquife r on t he Nevada- Utah border to Las Ve gas via a 285-mile, $3.5 billion pipeline. In turn, the dec ision could impact a re lated, possible ag reement betwee n Neva da and U tah over how to divide gr oundwater in the aquife r. At issue is the timi ng of the Ne vada State E ngineer 's appr oval of the w ater rights applications that SNWA filed for t he pipeline in 1989. When SNW A filed its applications, Ne vada la w required the State Eng ineer to proce ss water right applications no l ater than one y ear after the e nd of a f ormal protest per iod. The State Eng ineer did not process the a pplications within the nece ssary time period. In 2003, the Nevada Legislature amended the law to let him po stpone action on water-rights applications for municipal use. Howe ver, the Legislature did not make its chang es re troac tive, raising legal questions as to the status of SNWA 's filings. In a unanimous dec ision, the court stated, \" Because we de termine that the 19 89 water appropr iation a pplications were not pending in 2003, we conc lude that the (N evada ) State Eng ineer violated his statutory duty by failing to take action with in one year after the final protest date. Thus, we reverse the order of the district cou rt and remand for a determination of whether SNWA must file new g roundwa ter appropriation applica tions or whether the State Eng ineer must re-notice SNWA's 1989 applications and r eopen the period in which a ppellants must file protests.\"46 As a re sult of the ruling , Utah Gove rnor Ga ry Her bert (R) ha s put the Snake Va lley negotiati ons on hold. \"This ruling significantly changes the landscape upon which our ongoing discussions have bee n based,\" he said. \"It also allows us to revisit the proposed a greement with the state of Ne vada a nd ensure that our continued de sire to protec t Utah's wa ter intere sts and the environment is met.\" He further stated, \"B ased on the additional require ments imposed by the Neva da Supreme Court, an ag reement, at this tim e, is prema ture.\"47 Of note, SNWA has spent milli ons on studies, preliminary desig ns, and leg al work f or the pipeline projec t, which is expected to supply enoug h water for more than 250,000 homes and re duce Las Ve gas' reliance on the Colorado River. Nevada D epartment of Conservation and N atura l Resources Director Allen Biaggi, a WSWC me mber, has expressed concern that the ruling could call into questi on other water pe rmits issued before 2002 and could impac t hundreds of pe ndingWestern States W ater, #1837, J uly 31, 2009, and #1840, Aug ust 21, 2009. 48 Western States W ater, 2010, and #1870, Mar ch 19, 2010. 71applications. Allen crafted a leg islative fix for state lawmakers to co nsider. Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons (R) will determine w hether or not to ask that it be adde d to the session's ag enda.48 A petition filed on March 15 with the Nevada Supreme Cou rt on behalf of the Nevada State Engineer asked the court to re consider its J anuar y 28 decision. The petition arg ues that the de cision could impact thousands of other water rights in Ne vada a nd asks the cour t to reconsider the dec ision so that it only affects SN WA. At the same time, it also asks the c ourt to indicate that the State Engineer should not re-ope n approve d water right case s where there is no documented e vidence that there was a n unhear d protestor. Of note, the Neva da Legislature did not issue a \"legislative fix,\" but WS WC member A llen Biaggi, the Direc tor of the Ne vada D epartment of Conservation and N atura l Resou rces, has not ruled out the possibility of the Governor requesting another session to address the subject.49 A June 17 Ne vada Supre me Court decision led to the re opening of the protest periods for ground water applications associated with the SNWA proposal. In 2006, a number of parties in Neva da and U tah petitioned t he State Enginee r to re-notice S NWA's applications and to re-ope n the protest per iod. The State Eng ineer denied the request and the parties filed a petition for judicial revie w, which the district court denied. The pa rties then appe aled a nd the Neva da Supreme Court has re verse d the district court, finding that the 2003 amendment did not apply retroa ctively and that the State Engineer had not acted within the one-year time period as required by law. The court also remanded the case to the district court for further consideration as to whether SNWA needed to re-file its applications or if the S tate Enginee r need only re-open the protest period. SNW A and the State Engineer subsequently filed petitions with the Nevada Supreme Court for a rehearing. On re hearing, the court reaffirme d that the 2003 amendment is not re troac tive and that the State Engineer did not act in a timely manner. However, it clarified that the \"proper and mo st equitable remedy\" is for the State Engineer to re-notice the applications and re-open the protest period. \"Voiding the State Engineer's ruling and preventing him from taking further action would be inequitable to SNWA and future s imilarly situated applica nts. And applicants ca nnot be punished for the State E ngineer 's fa ilure to follow his statutory duty ,\" it said. \"Similarly , it woul d be inequitable to the orig inal and subseque nt protestants to conclude tha t the State Eng ineer 's failure to take ac tion r esults in approva l of the applications over 14 years after their protests were filed.\"50 Oklahoma Tarrant Regional Water District In Februar y, the Tar rant Reg ional Water District in Texas r enew ed its 2007 challeng e to an Oklahoma embargo on out- of-state water sales. Tarrant had been trying to appropriate Oklahoma water that fee ds into the Red River and filed a lawsuit in federal court ag ainst the Oklahoma WaterWestern States W ater, #1800, 2010. 53 72Resources Boa rd (OWRB) , alleg ing tha t the embar go violates the Commerce and Suprema cy Clauses of the U.S. Constituti on. I n November 2009, a fe deral district court rea soned that the Red River Compact (RRC) , which apportions water between Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, insulated the emba rgo from a Comm erce Clause c halleng e. It also found that the emba rgo did not raise pr eemption issues under the Supremac y Clause bec ause it did not conflict with the RRC. Since the cour t limit ed its ruling to wa ters that ar e subjec t to the RRC , Tarr ant filed a n amend ed complaint that asserts the same constitutional challenges, but does so with respect to an agreement with the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma that Tarrant says is no t within the scope of the RRC. The OWRB filed a motion to dismiss. 51 In a Jul y 16th ruling, the U.S. D istrict Court f or the Western D istrict of Oklahoma r ejected another attempt by the Tar rant to appr opriate w ater in Oklahoma. Tarra nt alleg ed that it had made arrangements to purcha se Oklahoma water that is not subject to the Compact, including a 10-y ear option to purcha se ground wa ter in Stephens County and a me morandum of unde rstanding (MOU) with the Apac he Tribe of Oklahoma , which states that Tarr ant would \"wor k cooper atively \" with the Tribe to fur ther qua ntify its reserve d water rights and develop t erms for the purc hase or lease of certain amounts of its water. The c ourt held that neither of Tarrant's alleg ations made out a case or controve rsy. First, the court found tha t the statutes in question do not apply to groundwater and ther efore do not obstruct Tarrant from appropr iating the water subject to its 10-y ear option. Second, the cour t held that the MOU with the Apa che T ribe was not an enf orceable a greement and re asoned tha t \"...it is very much an open question whether the Tribe has any water rights at all which ar e per tinent to plaintiff's needs and, if so, what those rights are.... And even if, at some point, the Apache Tribe is able to establish that it in fact has reserved water rights as a general matter, its obligation to pursue any further arrangement wit h plaintiff is made expressly conting ent on the 'qua ntification' of those r ights.... The court c oncludes such a scena rio is far too spe culative and subject to too many conting encie s to set out a controversy ripe for judicial resolution.\" Acting OWRB Executive Director and Oklahoma52 Secre tary of Environment J.D. St rong, also a WSWC member, praised the dec ision. \"This important ruling once a gain streng thens Oklahoma' s right to control the use of its most prec ious natural resour ce and enable s the state to meet its interstate w ater obliga tions.\"53 City of Hugo On April 30, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma dismissed the latest challeng e to an Okla homa embar go on out-of-state water sales. The c ase stemmed f rom a c laim by the City of Hug o in Oklahoma, which ha d agreed to sell Kiamichi River water to Irving , Texas, that Oklahoma' s embarg o violated the U.S. Constitut ion's dormant Commerce Clause. Although th e dormant Commerce C lause gene rally prev ents states from g iving their residents a pre ferred right of access to water s within their borders, t he court found that the wa ter ater, #1514, May 23, 2003, and #1834, Jul y 10, 2009. 73was subject to the Red River Compact, which a pportions surfac e water among A rkansa s, Louisiana, Oklahoma, a nd Texas. \"The Compac t here expli citly provides for the allocation of resource s along a rationa l and consistent basis among the relevant states,\" it said. \"The Compact is ess appr oved the Compact, and it is not subject to any dormant Commerce Clause challeng e. Tha t approva l nece ssarily constituted Congr ess' consent to a leg al scheme differ ent from that whic h would otherwise sur vive Commerce Clause scrut iny.... The relevant Oklahoma sta tutes are not inconsistent with the Com pact whe re the y addre ss the water s allocate d and apportioned to Oklahoma under the Compact, and tha t state's rig ht to control water s within its border s is not inconsist ent with the Compact.\"54 Of note, the case follows a November 2009 decision that the Eastern District issued in Tarrant v. Sevenoak s, which also dism issed a Commerce Clause cha lleng e to Oklahoma' s embarg o. \"We h ave been successful thus far in these cases but we know the water wars [are] not yet won,\" said Oklahoma Attorne y Gene ral Dr ew Edmondson in a state ment.\" 55 Republican River Compac t On M ay 3, the Kansas Attorney General filed a pleading with the U.S. Supreme Cour t regarding the Republican River Compact, which a llocates wa ter among Colora do, Kansa s, and Nebr aska. The pleading alleges that Nebra ska violated a 2003 decr ee tha t approve d a settlement outlining the states' rights to w ater from the Republican River Basin; that Neb raska exceeded its Compact alloca tion by 78,960 acr e-feet in 2005 and that its curr ent plan for achie ving compliance is inadequate. Among other things, the filing also asks the Cou rt to hold Nebraska in contempt, order it to pay damages, and require it to take certain steps to comply with the Com pact. \"Our state's a ctions in this mater are, and alway s have been, to ensur e that we get the wa ter we are due under the compact and settlement,\" said Kansas Chief Engineer Dave Barfield, a WSWC member. \" We're not try ing to be litigious; we j ust want Nebr aska to be fair.\" Nebr aska A ttorney General Jon Br uning issued the following statement: \"Tha nks to the hard wor k of Ne braska 's irrigators, the State has been in compliance since 2006. We are working with local natura l resourc es districts to ensure we stay in compliance. We a re prepared to vig orously defe nd the State.\" The filing follows a 2009 arbitra tor's ruling that af firmed Ka nsas' e stimate of Nebr aska violations for 2005 and 2006 and recommended certain actions to ensure compliance in water short years. At the same tim e, the ar bitrator found tha t Kansas ha d not adequa tely proven its claim for monetary damag es. Howe ver, Colora do, Kansa s, and Ne braska were unable to acc ept eve ry aspec t of the de cision, which exhausted Kansa s' options under the Compac t's dispute resolution provision and cleared the way #1834 J uly 10, 2009, and #1877, May 7, 2010. 74On July 7, the Colorado Attorne y Gene ral's of fice filed a r esponse to Ka nsas' pe tition before the Supreme Court that a lleges that Ne braska had e xceeded its Republican River Compac t allocation. Kansa s' suit does not make any direc t claims ag ainst Colorado and Col orado's brief takes no position on Kansas' petition. However, Attorney General John Suthers issued a statement saying, \"Though the U.S. Su preme Cou rt ultimately will decide whether to take this cas e, I continue to believe that here, as with all interstate disputes, Nebraska and Kansas can resolve their disagreements without subjecting a ll of the states to the costs and unc ertainties of litigation.\"57 On October 7, Arbitrator Martha Pag el issued two non-binding decisions on disputes involving the Republica n River Compact, which a llocates wa ter be tween K ansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. The f irst involved a Nebr aska proposal to adjust the proce dures that de termine Compact compliance to refle ct pay ments of monetar y damag es paid by one st ate to another . Nebr aska maintained that the proposal wa s neede d to ensure tha t the compliance proce dures did not allow for a \"double recovery.\" Ka nsas objected that the proposal was contrary to the Com pact, would encour age future violations, and would deprive K ansas use rs of water. The Arbitrator conclude d that Nebraska's proposal was not ne cessary to av oid a double recovery for damages and was contrary to the Compact bec ause it would substitute money for wa ter. She a lso found that the proposal wa s incomplete, but would not deprive Kansa s of wate r or e ncoura ge future Compact violations. The sec ond decision addr essed a pipeline projec t that Colorado has propose d to offset the effects of g roundwa ter de pletion on streamf lows as a mea ns of ac hieving future Compac t compliance . Kansa s raised eight issues of conce rn and w ithheld its consent, \"The [proposal] , in and nec essar y approa ch for meeting Colorado's Compact oblig ations,\" the Ar bitrator's de cision stated. \"With chang es as recommended her ein, the re vised Proposal should be approved. Howeve r, the facts...do not support a conc lusion that Kansas has a cted in bad faith or has breached a duty of fair dealing in questioning and cha lleng ing ke y aspec ts of the proposed a ugmentation plans. To be sure there is a risk that, at some point in the future, continuing objections by Kansa s may suggest there is nothing Colorado c an do to develop a plan that would meet with appr oval by Kansa s. At this st age, howe ver, the re is no basis for concluding that Kansas has acted unreasonably or that Colorado is entitled to a recommendation from the Ar bitrator that the [proposal] should be approved.\" Kansas Chief Engineer David Barfield, a WSWC member, praised the decisions, saying, \"We are greatly encouraged by the arbitrator's ruling, particularly with regard to N ebraska's attempts to claim monetar y damag es as a n offse t of the unauthorized and expanding consumption of water .\" Nebr aska A ttorney Gene ral Jon Bruning said, \"We ar e plea sed the a rbitrator r ecognized the importanc e of preventing a double re cover y by Kansa s, but disappointed the proposed c rediting issue was not accepted.\" Colorado Attorney General John Suthers expressed disappointment in the ruling, but noted it recognized his state's \"...fundamental right to proce ed 2,58 2010, and #1887, Jul y 16, 2010. 75Compact compliance , that the proposal provides a r easona ble and ne cessa ry approa ch by Colorado, and that Ka nsas does not have an unfe ttered a bility to block the projec t.\"58 Keating v. Nebraska Public Power District Nebr aska is see king a micus support for its p osition in Keating v. Nebraska Public Power District befor e the Eig hth Circuit Court of Appeals. The case stems from a lawsuit that a g roup of farmers and r anche rs with junior rig hts on the Niobrar a River br ought in federal court a gainst the Nebr aska D epartment of Resource s (DNR), a rguing the agency violated their due proce ss rights by not providing a pre- depriva tion hearing befor e closing their hea dgates during a period of wate r scarcity in favor of a senior a ppropriator . The plaintiffs wa nted the hea ring to challeng e DNR's scarcity deter mination and the validity of the senior appropr iator's wa ter rig hts. A fede ral district court dismissed the plaintiff's suit, finding that they did not have a pr operty right to be fre e from DNR's re gulation of the prior a ppropriation sy stem. The plaintiffs a ppeale d, asking the Eig hth Circuit to direct the district court to orde r DNR to provide the plaintiffs with pre-depriva tion notice and hearing before requiring them to stop using waters on the Niobrara. In a brief filed earlier this mon th, the plaintiffs argued, \"It is the right to use the water of the Niobrara that must be given due process protection, a right the district court wholly ignor ed in its analy sis of the depriva tion issue.\" Nebr aska is pre paring a brie f that will arg ue, among other things, that the district court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs took their property rights subject to senior rig hts and did not have a l egitimate claim of entitlement to water during times of sca rcity when a senior appr opriator wa s not receiving its full allocation. Nebr aska ha s also opined that the case could impact other states that rely on the prior appropr iation d octrine. Nebr aska circulated a r equest for amicus brief s among the Confer ence of Western Attor neys Gene ral and WSWC member state s in October. River Basins Yakima B asin Study In January, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Washington State Department of Ecology announced the Yakima Ri ver B asin Study to build on previous effor ts perfor med as pa rt of the Yakima River Basin Water Enhancement Project (YRBWEP. ) Reclamation and Eco logy would jointly conduct the study under the U.S. Depa rtment of the Interior' s Water Conserva tion I nitiative Basin St udy ram. This one- year compre hensive study soug ht to further define future options for water supply development, while improving conditions for ana dromous fish. The study , to be cost-shar ed on a 50/50 basis betwee n Reclama tion and Ecology , would also evalua te the potential impacts of climate c hang e on wa ter supplies and de mands. A YRBWEP Workgr oup - comprised of state and fe deral agencie s, county commissioners from the three Yakima Basin counties, the City of Yakima, the Yakima Nation, irrigation districts, fisheries managers, and American Rive rs - are collaborating on the study. The workgroup has alsoWestern States W ater, #1844, September 18, 2009.59 a outline aimed at deve loping ne w wate r supplies, s torage, and im proving habitat and pa ssage for fish in the basin.

Desired outcome s include basin-spe cific pla ns that recomm end collaboratively-developed solutions to meet water demands and foster susta inable development.59 USG S also presented the preliminary results of a study on groun d water resources in Washington's Ya kima River B asin. It estimated that, on average, ground wa ter pumping reduc ed river flows by 200 cubic feet per second b y the time the Yakima River drains into the Columbia River. \"The numbers are sobering ,\" said Ken Slattery , the Washington Depa rtment of Ecolog y's Water Resource s Prog ram Manag er and a WSWC member. \" Ground wa ter pumping and deple tion of this ma gnitude means there 's less water available to meet fe derally mandated ta rget strea mflows and the irrigation delivery obligations in the basin. This c ertainly adds urgency to o ur efforts to tackle the basin's wa ter supply needs, pa rticularly for junior user s.\" Ecolog y, the Yakima Nation, and the B ureau of Recla mation commissioned the study in a 1999 Memorandum o f Agreement related to ground water management in the Basin.

USGS is also reviewing a dra ft report documenting a computer model that simulates large portions of the ground wa ter system in the Basin that can be used as a water management tool.60 Klamath B asin Restoration Ag reement On Januar y 8, the parties involved in the Klamath River Basin neg otiations release d the final draft of the Klama th Ba sin Restoration Ag reement (KB RA). The B asin's wa ter a nd fi sheries resour ces ha ve bee n the subject of de cades of neg otiations betw een California, Or egon, fede ral agencie s, tribes, environmenta l groups, ag ricultural inter ests, and others over the water available for irrigation, national wildlife re fuges, fish and w ildlife, and other use s within the Basin. The KB RA is intended \"...to result in effective and dura ble solutions which: (1) re store and sustain n atural production and provide for Full Participation in Harvest Opportunities of Fish Species throughout the Klamath Basin; (2) establish reliable water and power supplies which sustain agricultural uses and comm unities and National Wildli fe Refuges; and (3) contribute to the public welfa re and the sustainability of all Klama th Ba sin communiti es [to resolve disputes].\" As for funding, estimated costs to implement the agreement in its first year total abo ut $41 million, while long- term costs would run about $97 million per y ear. Of the total, ove r 90 per cent is budg eted f or fisherie s restora tion and reintroduc tion and actions to enha nce the amount of wa ter for fish. To accomplish the KBRA's goals, the agreement w ould create a number of pro grams, including schedules, plans, and other provisions to change the management of delivered water supply for irr igation and related uses in the K lamath Recla mation Project, upper K lamath B asin, and the national wildlife re fuges. The K BRA a lso contains a fisher ies prog ram t hat would, among otherWestern States reintroduce anadromous fish, establish conditions to contribute to fishery sustainability, assess the e ffectiveness of actions, and pr ovide for adaptive manag ement. The KB RA would further establis h the Klamath B asin Coordinating Council to facilitate coor dination, cooper ation, collabora tion, and accountability by the par ties to ensure tha t elements of the a greement are carried out effectively. Federal authorizing leg islation is neede d befor e the federal governme nt and its ag encie s can become parties to the KBRA and be required to implement any of its provisions.61 On February 18, Oregon Governor T ed K ulongoski, California Go vernor Arnold Schwar zeneg ger, Sec the I nterior Ke n Salazar, PacifiCorp, triba l leader s, and other stakeholders signed the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement and the Klamath H ydroelectric Settlement Ag reement. I n Restora tion Agr eeme nt pr ovides for salmon habitat improvements on Klamath tributaries, allocates water rights, and guarantees water deliveries for both farmers and f ish. The a greement is also meant to complement the Klama th Hy droele ctric Settlement Agreement (KHSA) r eleased in September 2009, w hich establishes a proce ss for the potential remova l of four Pac ifiCorp dams on the Klamath River to allow sa lmon and steelhea d trout g reater access to spawning habitat. Niobrar a River The Ne braska Depa rtment of Na tural Resourc es had a nnounced that it would rece ive a $350,000 grant from R eclamation's Basin Studies Program to study water management options in the Niobra ra Riv er. The study will model surfac e and g round wa ter intera ction, as we ll as the economic e ffects of water manag ement strate gies to provide options that optimi ze both surfac e and groundwa ter resource s. It will also include involvement from state, loca l, and fe deral interests. The 2-year study will include the Niobrara River from its headwaters in Wyoming to its confluence with the Missouri River in northeast Ne braska . It will begin in January 2011.62 States California Central Valley Project On Januar y 26, Interior Secre tary Ken Salazar announc ed that 350,000 to 400,000 ac re-feet of wa ter would be made available for Centra l Valley Project (CVP) wa ter user s, particular ly, farmers on the west side of California's San Joaquin Va lley, by March 1. \"The recent storms in California are a we lcome re lief for farmers, wa ter user s, and wa tersheds tha t have be en hit ha rd by three years of drought, but we are not out of the woods yet,\" said Salazar. \"We m ust keep all hands on deck to stretch wa ter supplies, move wa ter to whe re it is neede d most, provide cer tainty for g rowe rs in the year ahea d, and build long- term wa ter solutions in partnership with the State.\"Western States W ater, #1868, Marc h 5, 2010.63 78The announcement is the result of two decisions by Reclamation. First, the Mid -Pacific Region issued gui delines that allowe d far mers to hold water over f or the 2010 g rowing season. Second, Rec lamation has dete rmined that it could deliver non- CVP water c urrently stored in t he San Luis Reservoir unde r Warre n Act contra cts and approve reque sts to reschedule CVP supplies from the 2009 contra ct year for de livery in 2010. On April 15, Salazar announce d incre ased water supply allocations for the Bureau of Reclama tion's Ce ntral Valley Project as a result of improved hy drolog ic conditions. \"F or the sec ond consec utive month, we ar e accelerating our re porting of update d allocations, i n an ef fort to g et the best available information to our contra ctors...to aid in the ir planning decisions for the u pcoming season,\" he said. Municipal and industrial contra ctors and a gricultural wa ter service c ontrac tors north of California's Bay Delta saw their allocations increase to 100% from 75% and 50% respectively. Allocations for agricultural service contra ctors south of the Delta were incre ased from 25% to 30%, while C lass 2 allocations to Fr iant Division ag ricultural wa ter ser vice c ontrac tors moved from 10% to 15%. Class Friant agricultural contrac tors rema ined at 100%, a Division ag ricultural c ontrac tors, contra ctors with senior wa ter rig hts claims along the Sacra mento and San Joaquin Ri vers, a nd wildlife refuges north and south of the De lta. Allocations for municipal a nd industrial contrac tors south of the Delta r emained a t 75%. Despite the increased allocations, Salazar acknowledged that water supply chal lenges still exist for ag ricultural c ontrac tors south of the Delta. \" As I announce d in March of this y ear, we a re comm itted to efforts to secure an additional 8 to 10 pe rcent supply for agricultural contractors south of the Delta. We are expecting that up to 1 50,000 to 2 00,000 acre-feet can be secured to help supplement the South-of-Delta supplies.\" These amounts were not previously available for the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.63 Montana Exempt Wells The Montana Depa rtment of C) sche duled a public hear ing on June 17 to discuss whether an ag ency rule g overning exempt wells is consist ent with state law. Unde r Montana sta tute, ground water permits are not ne eded for wells outside the boundarie s of controlled g round wa ter areas if they appropr iate less than 35 g allons a minute or 10 acre-feet a year. However, a \"combined appropr iation\" from the sa me source from two or more wells that exceeds these limit ations does require a permit. Montana law does not define \"combined appropr iation\" and the r ule clar term re fers to \"...the appr opriation of wa ter fr om the same source aquifer by two or more groundwater developments, that are ph ysically manifold into the same sy stem.\" In December 2009, the Western Environmental L aw Cente r filed a petition on behalf of f ive senior water rights hol ders, asking DNRC to decla re the rule invalid. The petition took particular exception to the \"physically manifold\" requirement, arguing \"...because very few, if W ater, #1836, 24, 2009, #1837, J uly 31, 2009, and #1872, Apr il 2, 2010. Western States W ater, #1894, September 3, 2010.65 79ground water developments are 'physically manifold,' DNRC's definition effectively rende rs the Ac t's combined appr opriation exception superfluous. I ndeed, the re is abso lutely no reason why a developer would install a groundwater system that is 'physically manifold' and go throug h DNRC's permitting a nd environmenta l review proce ss when he c an simply install hundreds of individual wells for free, without a permit and without any environmenta l review .\" The petition also asked D NRC to adopt a new de finition of the rule. \"The use of e xempt wells is an issue of statewide importance , with statewide implications,\" said Sexton. \"This briefing and public hearing process will allow formal input from all interested parties.\" Mary also ac knowledg ed that this proce ss may not be the \"f inal step\" in deter mining the appropr iate use of exempt wells and that further court or legislative action ma y be necessary. DNRC will refrain from taking up the petition's request to amend the rule until after a determination is made on the declaratory ruling, which is expected in July.64 On Aug ust 18, the Montana De partment of N atura l Resource s and Conservation issued a decla ratory ruling , stating tha t it would ini tiate rulem aking within eight months to develop a new administr ative def inition for a key provision of the state' s exempt well statute. The Depa rtment believes the ruling is consistent and not in conflict with the s tatutory exemption, but also found that incre asing demands on the state 's wate r resource s warr anted a new de finition. The ruling responded to the 2009 pe tition by senior water right owners and other parties, which aske d that the Depa rtment dec lare the cur rent rule invalid and adopt a new rule. The petition focuse d particula rly on the rule' s \"phy sically manifold\" language, which it said allows developer s to circumvent the state's ground water permitting process by installing individual exemp t wells instead of c onstructing a \"phy sically manifold\" g round wa ter sy stem . As a re sult, the petition maintained that ther e was a surg e in the ins tallation of ex empt wells in closed basins that threatene d senior water rights. Of note, the ruling indicated that the Department is evaluating a possible rule that would allow an e xempt well to serve up to twelv e residential lots wit h a maximum appropr iation of 35 gallons per minute and not to excee d 10 acr e-feet pe r year. As Water Resourc es Division Acting Administrator, Tom S chultz stated, \"We w ant to give the Department as well as legislators time to analy ze the issues and provide input as w e go forwa rd. The new definition will take into acc ount the original intent of the statute, along with the fact that we have a number of basins close d to appropr iations, where we h ave seen an increase in groundwater development.\" For more information on the ruling , please see: http://dnrc.mt.gov/ne ws/news_re lease s/2010/18Aug.a sp. In November a Montana court a dopted a se ttlement betwee n the State's DNR C and plaintiffs regarding an administrative de finition for a key part of the State's exempt we ll statute. Under the settlement, DNRC will de velop a broade r definition within 15 mont hs and will consider a mending the def inition t o consider cum ulative or c ollective impacts fr om multi ple, unconne cted we lls in a single aquifer for a project.65http:// coa.nmc ourts.g ov/documents/opinions/October10.htm. xico Exempt Wells On Octobe r 29, the Ne w Mexi co Court of Appea ls had issued a dec ision in Bounds v. San Lorenzo, upholding the state's domestic well statute, which provides that the New M exico State Engineer shall issue permits to withdraw g roundwa ter for domestic use \"[u]pon the filin g of each application.\" Although the statute re quires the State Eng ineer to issue a per mit without notice and evalua tion of the eff ect of such use on senior water rights, the State Eng ineer 's Off ice e nacte d regulations in 2006 that include authority to reduc e domestic we ll pumping in some ca ses. The Court of Appea ls' ruling overturns a state district court de cision that the statute vio lated the Ne w Mexi co constitution beca use it was an impermissible e xception to the prior a ppropriation doctr ine. The lowe r cour t had also order ed the State Engineer to administ er dome stic well applica tions in t he same manner as all other ground water applications. The c ourt rea soned that the State Eng ineer had suff icient administrative authority to protect pre-existing wa ter rig hts from domestic well use. I t also found that the Ne w Mexico Const itution established a \" broad pr iority principle\" that does not set forth a particula r priority administration system from which the Legislature cannot deviate. \" The L egislature has e nacte d statutes intended to limit appropriation and use in circumstances in which the State Engineer determines that a basin is fully appropr iated with no ava ilable wate r for new appropriations,\" it said. \"Yet, we see no re ason why the L egislature can not enac t exceptions to or variations of the law s. The [statute] is such an exception or varia tion, ulti mately leaving for the State E ngineer , as diffic ult as it looks t o be, the administrative deter mination whether to curtail domestic use whe n senior wa ter rig hts are impair ed or threa tened with impending impairment bec ause of water shortag es.\"66 Water Sup ply Ou tlook The Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Snowpack/Drought Monitor Update for the week of January 7 reported that most of the Wes t was \"at or below normal values\" despite above nor mal snow wa ter equivalent (S WE) over much of the Southwest. NRCS also said many basins wer e running at 60-75% of normal. The only exceptions w ere southwest and southea st Utah, Arizona's hig h country , parts of N ew Me xico, and c entra l Montana. As for dr ought, a favor able storm tr end had led to the re moval of abnor mally dry conditions in ext reme northwest Nor th Dak ota and e astern Monta na. L ikewise, re cent pr ecipitation in and around the Shasta-Trinity Forest in northern California led to a slig ht reduc tion in the northwestern area of se vere droug ht. Howeve r, extreme and sever e drought blanketed Ariz ona, while severe and modera te droug ht persisted throug hout California, the western half of Nevada, southern Texas, and northce ntral W ashing ton. Modera te drought also expanded i n southwestern W yoming and emer ged to the north of the Bitterr oot Rang e along the Montana a nd Idaho borde rs. Simil arly, that abnormally dry and/or mod erate drought conditions existe d in parts of ev ery western state except the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Was hington. Sm all pockets of seve re drought conditions persisted in northeast Ar izona, southern Ore gon, and we stern Wyoming, while abnorma lly dry conditions have e xpanded in f our counties in Colorado a nd one county in Arizona. Howeve r, seve re dr ought condi tions were no long er evident in the I daho panhandle and we stern Montana . For the 2010 water year, which began on October 1, 2009, Arizona, southern Ne w Mexico, easte rn Ne vada, southwest Utah, the Oly mpic Rang e in Washington, c entra l Montana, and centr al-eastern Wy oming ha d the larg est surpluses. The nor thern a nd Upper Snake River r egions of Idaho and the northern Was atch region in U tah had the greatest deficits. 68 Yakima River Basin Reclamation released its Ma rch 2010 forecast for irrigation water supply in the Yakima Basin. Among othe r things , Reclamation found that sy stem storag e wa s 49 perc ent full and 90 percent of average as of March 1, and that junior users were expected to receive 77 percent of their entitlement from the be ginning of prora ting until September 20. \" We are expecting a below norma l water supply at this time,\" said Chuck Garner, Yakima Project River Operations supervisor. \"It would be ver y difficult for the snowpac k and reservoir storag e to recover suf ficiently to provide a full supply for a ll users this season.\" Post 1905 water users must cea se diverting water as soon as prora ting is implemented. Drought Declaration/Klamath Basin On March 17, Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski issued a drought decla ration for six Klamath B asin counties, which w ill provide flexibl e wa ter mana gement strate gies that are not generally available under Oregon law to assist irrigators, municipalities, and other water users. In particula r, the decla ration will a llow ir rigators in the affected counties to beg in work with the Ore gon Water Resourc es De partment to apply for tempor ary emer gency permit s that ar e valid during the length of the dec lared droug ht. I n general, these permits allow wate r user s to use supplemental ground wa ter sourc es in lieu of their sur face water rig hts and for e merg ency transfe rs of wa ter fr om one par cel of land to another . The de claration comes as Oregon waits for the federal gove rnment to deter mine how much Klamath Projec t surfac e water will be a vailable this irrig ation season without harming specie s that are listed under the Endang ered Species Act, such as the L ost River sucker and shortnose suc ker tha t spawn in Uppe r Klama Lake, a nd coho Vilsack on Mar ch 16, re questing a federal natural re source disaster de termination to provid e eligible farmers and r anche rs with fede ral aid. The letter detailed basin water conditions saying, \"Due to ongoing drought conditions, reservoir storag e in the Klama th Ba sin is currently 51% of nor mal.

Reclama tion also estimates that irrig ation deliverie s could begin by May 15, depending upon prec ipitation in t he Klama th Ba sin and Upper Klamath Lake levels. At the same time, the U.S. D epartment of Agriculture' s Natura l Resource s Conservation Service (NRCS) has made available $1 milli on in Ca lifornia and $1 milli on in Oreg on for a specia l drought initiative under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in the Klamath Project ar ea.

Muc h of the West is chara cterized by its aridity , and the continuing dr ought acr oss much of the re gion highlig hts the fact that wate r ava ilability is an eve r present constraint defining our economic and environmental well being and quality of life. This is particularl y true for many small rural c ommuniti es strug gling to comply with present f ederal mandates and meet future water supply needs. The Western Gover nors' Association's June 2006 repor t, \"Water Needs and Strateg ies for a Sustainable F uture,\" specific ally endorse d the leg islation and refer red to the need to assess rura l water supply needs a nd authorize fede ral loan g uarantees...to better enable non-fe deral proj ect sponsors to obtain private fina ncing for r eimbursable e xtraordinary operation and maintenanc e, rehabilitation and replac ement costs.\" It is our understanding that under the prior Administration, the O ffice of Mana gement and Budg et deter mined that the authoriz ed Tit le II loan guar antee s must be bac ked, dollar- for-dollar, by appropriated funds. This position effectively negates the purpose for the guarantees, which is to lever age non-f ederal funding to ensure that water districts which operate and maintain facilities that are part of f ederal projec ts can access private source s of financ ing. This is problematic due to the fact that while they depend on these facilities for their livelihood, they do not own the projects. Given the low anticipated default rate for such loans, we believe the risk to the Federal Treasury is minimal. OMB's past position is a serious obstacle to fulfilling the intent of the Con gress.88Posit ion No. 322 Under Title I, we look forward to continuing to work with the Bureau of Reclamation to compile a list of rura l water needs, a nd look forwa rd to coll abora ting with Rec lamation, on the revie w of the status of r ural wa ter supply projec ts and the dema nd for ne w projec ts, as well as to further develop g uidelines and c riteria f or determining prog ram eligibility and establishing projec t priorities. As the leg islation specifically states, it is im portant that Recla mation \"...consult and cooperate with appropriate Federal, State, tribal, regional, and local authorities\" as it conducts appra isal investiga feasibility repor ts, and identifies funding sources. Moreover, again as recognized in the legislation, the program mu st be coordinated with \"...existi ng federal and State rura l water and wastew ater programs to fa cilitate the most eff icient and effective solution to meeting the wate r nee ds of the non-F ederal projec t sponsors.\" Fur ther, we appre ciate the recognition that compliance wi th State water laws and inter state compa cts is vital. Upgrading and replacing inadequate rural water systems m ay require finding new water supplies, which will entail acquiring necessary state water rights. We would appreciate your help in addressing the prior Administration's position on Title II loan g uarantees a nd loo k forward to working toge ther to take appropr iate ac tions to fund and implement the Title I program.

We appreciate your continuing leadership in addre ssing the se rious water -related cha lleng es facing the West and Na tion. We espec ially appre ciate the expli cit rec ognition that \"...States bear the primary responsibility and author ity for mana ging the water resour ces of the United States\" a nd that \"the Federal Governme nt should support the St ates, as well as regional, local and tribal g overnme nts....\" We also appre ciate the other provisions i n the bill requiring fede ral a gencie s to \"consult and coordinate with the applicable State water resource agency with jurisdiction,\" as well as comply with applicable State water laws and interstate compacts. Western wate r law a nd policy are based on the reality of scarcity and the need to use wate r wisely. States continue to seek to increase efficiency and reduce water use, while at the same time effectuating sound infrastruc ture improveme nts and additions, particular ly new wa ter storage opportunities. We c annot ig nore supply -side solutions to water shorta ges. The Counc il recog nizes the difficult cha lleng es facing the Nation re lated to our c urrent economic woe s and the fe deral budge t deficit. Howeve r, we are conce rned w ith the lack of inve stment in our Nation's wate r resource s infrastruc ture. With out the Bureau of Reclamation and federal investment in past water projects, the Wes t would not be what it is today . Continui ng investments and sacrifice s will be neede d to maintain our quality of life a nd protec t our environment. Difficult choice s have to be made at both the fede ral and state ag ency levels. As we plan for the future, states are well aware of the importance of maintaining our existi ng water -related infra structure and prioritiz ing future capital i nvestments. States are in the best position to i dentify , evalua te and prioritize their nee ds. State water plans should help form the basis for f ederal dec isions, and the federal gove rnment shoul d support States by providing technica appr opriate f inancial a ssistance.95Posit ion #326 We are also concerned that the lac k of basic da ta and infor mation on surfac e and g round water supplies, and present and projected water demands and consumptive uses, threatens both public and priva te planning and dec isionmaking a t all levels. Real-time wa ter re sources data a re critical for timely actions in response to droughts, flooding and other extreme weather events, as well as climate a daptation. Moreove r, our present day-to-day planning a nd manag ement dec isions depend on this information. We need better information now, as well as improved projections of future supplies and demands. The SECURE Water Act recognized and attempted to address many of these needs. Specifica lly, we supporte d a g round water monitoring system, brac kish water study , new methods to estimate a nd measure water use, a na tional water use and availability assessment, esta blishment of an intra- governmental panel on climate change and water resources, a Reclamation Climate Change Adaptation Prog ram, hy droele ctric pow er assessment and ef fects of climate cha nge, and financia l assistance to non-federal entities for water-use efficiency improvements. We strongly supported the USGS W ater Use a nd Availability Assessment Prog ram, whic h would provide g rants to assist State water resour ce agencie s. We are working with an Ad Hoc USGS group to implement this progr am, which includes gather ing data and information on environmenta l water uses, including instream uses a nd outflows for ba ys and estuar ies, as we ll as traditional consumptive water uses. Unfortuna tely, many of the programs and activities authorized in the SECURE W ater Act have la rgely gone unfunde d or ar e under funded. I t is our understanding that amounts authorized for expenditure under the bill are in addition to assistance a uthorized and provided pur suant to other provisions of fede ral law . In general, we are conce rned that the amounts authorized and subseque nt appropriations mus t be sufficient to reasonably support the authorized activities. Without timely and acc urate wa ter re source s information, human life, he alth, welfa re, proper ty, and envir onment al and na tural re source s are at consider ably greater risk of loss. The USG S has bee n a lea der in de veloping and realizing the potential of state-of-the-art technology to provide re al or ne ar real-time data with the promise of vastly improving the quantity and quality of water -related informa tion available to dec isionmakers in natura l resources and eme rgency management, with the States as essential partners. We must work toge ther as partne rs, and we very much appr eciate Interior' s support for the Western Fe deral Ag ency Support Team (WestFA ST), whi ch is working in conce rt with other Cabinet Depa rtments, the C ouncil and W estern Governor s' Association (WGA) to implement many of the re commendations in the WGA Water Reports. I ncreasing demands related to our growing population in the West, environmental protection im peratives, as well as uncertainty related to climate and unquantified Indian water right claims ( and unfunded triba l settlements), make pr esent and future wester n water resour ces pla nning nd manag ement particularly challeng ing. Other tion are f acing simil ar challeng es. WestFAST is a model for and fe deral cooper ation and collabor ation.96 Posit ion #326 The Reclamation Act of 1902, recognizing the vital need to invest in Western water resour ces, c reated the R eclamation Fund as a means to financ e such inve stments. The unobliga ted balanc e at the e nd of F Y2011 is projecte d to be about $9.35 bil lion (but spending f rom this special Treasury account is well below receipts and subject to appropriations and pay- go-rules). Receipts are more than suf ficient to fund a ll curre nt Reclam ation expenditures a nd more. I n essenc e, the unobligated balance grows as fund receipts are used to finance other government purposes. There is a continuing nee d to highlight the importance of water to our Nation's economic vitality and envir onmental hea lth, and we c ontinue to urg e the Congr ess to increa se spending from the Reclamation Fund for authorized purposes. We r ecognize and appreciate your leadership in enacting separate leg islation that authorizes future transf ers f rom the Recla mation Fund for construction of pr ojects re lated to I ndian wate r rights settlements, which has been a longsta nding goal of the Cou ncil. The Council has be en a pr oponent of watershed and ba sin-wide coor dination and a commitment to invol ving a ll gove rnmental e ntities and stakeholder s with an interest in finding solutions t o prese nt and future water manag ement cha lleng es. The Council supports technical and financ ial assistance to states and loca l water shed g roups and water districts as an appr opriate f ederal role, a uthorized Reclamation prog ram, nd suitable Reclama tion Fund expenditure. We are encour aged by the requests for I nterior' s WaterSMART Progr am, and r ecognize the importance of the proposa l in an incre asing ly tight fe deral budge t. The prog ram include s studies intended to i dentify basin-wide water supply issues, and in partne rship with basin States, Tribes and stakeholder s define options for meeting future w ater demands a nd rela ted cha lleng es. Thre e of the proposed ba sin studies invol ve seve ral Council- member states, and we appre ciate Re clamation's invitation to collaborate. The WaterSMART prog ram is in part de signe d to make wa ter available throug h conser vation for other uses. I t is im portant to note that the allocation of wate r is primarily a state pr erogative, and water transfe rs are subjec t to state water law and policy . The use of any Wat erSMART prog ram water saving s will be subject to state law. We would hope in the future to continue to work with y ou, your Commi ttee, staff a nd the Congress t o improve wes tern water managemen t under the new au thorities provided by the SE CURE Water Act.
