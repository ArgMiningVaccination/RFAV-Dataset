It offers descriptions of variouslandscape designs or planting styles used within or adjacent to Iowa's highwayrights-of-way, as well as various plant profiles. In addition, this guide will help youlearn more about the value of plants and their contribution to our environment andsociety. This publication is written for persons having little or no formal training in botany, and technical terminology has been kept to the minimum necessary to maintainstandards of accuracy and conciseness in the descriptions. Plants are known by common names and botanical names. Most people prefer to use common names because they are easier to spell and say. Both have beenused in this publication. Botanical names are taken from Latin, Greek or \"Latinized\" words of other lan- guages. Each plant species has a unique botanical name, consisting of the genus,followed by the species. Some botanical names contain additional words after thespecies name to designate cultivars or subspecies. Plant species are grouped intofamilies by flower structure. Family names are Latin, so the associated commonfamily names are included in parenthesis. Sources of information for this publication are not cited within the text to save space, avoid repetition and make it more readable. However, all references usedare included in the bibliography at the end of this publication.2Landscape designs A landscape design is a detailed planting strategy used to achieve certain goals in Iowa's landscape. Designs normally include an integrated planning map, oftenwith sketches of proposed systems. They also include a written report providingbasic planting and landscaping strategies, water systems design, soil improve-ment suggestions, and wildlife habitat restoration. All designs are customized tomeet specific needs of the site and the DOT's planting philosophies. The DOT uses a number of landscape design philosophies. Those designs are customized by type of plant species and are described in more detail within thetree, shrub and native grasses and wildflower sections of this publication. Roadside plants This publication is designed to enable those interested in learning more about thespecies and cultivars of plants most commonly used by the DOT in enhancingIowa's roadsides. It is not intended as a field identification guide because accu-rate identification takes a close look, which is difficult at driving speed. Thedepartment advises motorists not to stop along the highway because of safetyconcerns. There are many rest areas, county and state parks, preserves, andarboretums where these same species can be viewed up close. As you compare descriptions given to the plants, keep in mind that considerable variation occurs in plant growth and appearance, depending on local conditions ofcompetition, soil moisture and type, available nutrients, etc.3The time of flowering and fruiting can also vary, with differences of several weeks sometimes occuring between the extreme northern and southern parts of thestate. Plant uses Iowa law prohibits the destruction of public property, including plant material.Harvesting of seed or other plant parts requires a permit obtained from the localDOT office. The DOT recommends you enjoy these plants from a distance asyou travel along Iowa's roadside or stop at rest areas. This publication offerssome trivia on the historical uses of various plants for medicinal or nutritivepurposes. The Iowa Department of Transportation does not recommend plants beused for these purposes.4Chapter 1: Iowa's Climate, Land, Original Vegetation,Growing Season, and Land Use Climate Iowa's climate reflects the state's position in the interior of the North American continent. It is characterized by warm summers and cold winters with long, mildsprings and autumns. Average temperatures in the summer range from 71 o F in the north to 73o F in the south. Temperatures from December to February average22 o F, with January temperatures averaging about 14o F. Average humidity is 70 percent and sunshine can be expected on about 200 days of the year. Precipita-tion ranges from less than 28 inches in the northwest to more than 35 inches inthe southeast. Land Iowa is located in the heartland of the U.S. between the nation's two longestrivers. The Mississippi forms Iowa's eastern border, and Missouri borders thestate on the west. The state of Missouri borders Iowa to the south, and state ofMinnesota borders Iowa to the north. Iowa is the 23rd largest state in the United States. It has a total area of 56,276 square miles (145,754 square kilometers). The state has a maximum distancefrom east to west of 332 miles, and 214 miles from north to south.5The physical features of present-day Iowa are the result of widespread and repeated glacial activity during the last Ice Age, and subsequent changes broughtabout by wind and water erosion. Iowa's bedrock was formed by shallow warmseas that covered the state for many millions of years. Iowa contains a total of 36,016,000 acres. Lakes, ponds, reservoirs and streams cover about 210,000 acres, and urban areas cover roughly 2.89 million acres.The vast majority of the state is farmland. Original Vegetation Before the state was inhabited by European settlers, Iowa's vegetation was amixture of prairie, wetland and forest. Iowa's original wetland area was approxi-mately four million acres. This wetland area included the prairie potholes ofcentral and northwest Iowa, and riparian wetlands along Iowa's major streams. It is estimated that Iowa's forest acreage equaled approximately 6.7 million acres, including the savanna habitat. The northeastern and southeastern cornersof the state and major river drainages, such as those of the Des Moines, Iowaand Skunk rivers were the most heavily forested areas. The remaining 70 percent of the state was prairie. Prairie covered the flat and rolling portions of the state, as well as the loess hills in western Iowa, sandyareas in southeastern Iowa, and hills along many of the alluvial valleys, particu-larly in northeastern Iowa. Prairie plant communities were composed of approxi-mately 60 percent grasses (tall grass and short grass), 35 percent forbs and 5percent shrubs.6Growing Season Iowa's growing season, the period between the last killing frost in the spring and first killing frost in the fall, ranges from about 180 days in the southeastern andsouthwestern corners of the state to about 130 days in the extreme northwest.The last killing frost in the spring usually occurs in late April in the south andearly May in the north. The first killing frost in the fall generally occurs in lateSeptember or early October in the north and the second week of October in thesouth. Land Use Since Euro-American settlement began in the 1850s, Iowa's landscape haschanged dramatically. By 1930, 95 percent of the state's land had been con-verted to farmland. The prairies that helped produce the state's fertile soil have today been reduced to less than 0.1 percent of their original size. Approximately 30,000 acres remain.The prairie ecosystem was destroyed as fire was suppressed, grasslands plowedunder, and woody farmstead and urban plantings were established. Conversion of Iowa's wetlands to farmland also accelerated in the late 1880s. Iowa landowners constructed drainage ditches, straightened existing streams andtiled the land. All of these actions resulted in the drainage of approximately 95percent of the state's prairie pothole wetlands.7Iowa's native forests were cut to provide lumber, fencing material, railroad ties, wood for fuel, and other products, and clear land for farming. Nearly 73 percent ofIowa's original forests and savannas have disappeared. The good news is fairlyrecent tree planting programs and a decline in livestock numbers are contributingto a return of Iowa's forest acres in the state. In 1990, a survey by the UnitedStates Forest Service showed about 2 million acres of trees in Iowa, compared toabout 1.5 million in 1974, which represents an increase of a half million acres. In total, less than 7 percent of Iowa's original natural landscape remains. What is left is fragmented, split by roads, farms and towns. While many of these changes have been good for Iowans, they have resulted in the loss or degradation of suitable habitat for many plant and animal species.Plants and animals depend on their habitat. If Iowans want the diverse flora andfauna to remain in Iowa, a continuing effort by the public and DOT must be madetoward the reconstruction of native vegetation areas, as well as the preservationand enhancement of existing habitat remnants.8Chapter 2: Iowa's Roadside Management Programs Iowa's public lands add up to approximately 2 percent of the state's total land area. The Iowa Department of Transportation is responsible for managing over175,000 acres of this land that is dedicated to the state's highway rights-of-way.While rights-of-way are valuable for public safety and future road construction,they can also serve as valuable habitat for plants and animals. Several programsaid the Iowa DOT in carefully enhancing and managing Iowa's roadsides. Living Roadway Trust Fund The Living Roadway Trust Fund was authorized by the Iowa Legislature andestablished in July 1989. This fund supports integrated roadside vegetationmanagement programs on city, county or state rights-of-way or public areasadjacent to traveled roadways. These funds allow for the purchase of specialequipment, roadside inventories, gateway plantings, native grass and forb seed,tree and shrub plantings, and research, education and awareness programs. DOT/DNR Roadside Planting Program In the mid-1800s in Iowa, forests covered 10 to 15 percent of the land. By 1990,two-thirds of that original forest was gone. This depletion of natural resourceswas the impetus for the formation of a partnership between the Iowa Departmentof Transportation and Department of Natural Resources. This partnership, betterknown as the DOT/DNR Roadside Planting Program, has resulted in the plantingof more than 1.3 million trees and other woody plants on Iowa's largest publiclyowned areas of land - the interstate and primary highway rights-of-way.9Wetlands Mitigation It is the DOT's responsibility to determine and mitigate any impacts the state's highway projects may have on the survival and quality of Iowa's wetlands and itsinhabitants. Aerial photographs and topographic maps identifying these areas are provided to the highway designers to use when laying out roadway alignments so they canfirst avoid, then minimize impacts whenever possible. Where this is not possible,compensatory mitigation measures are deployed. Through those mitigationmeasures, the DOT has restored, created or enhanced more than 1,000 acres ofwetlands at sites throughout the state. A combination of plant types are used inthe establishment or restoration of wetland areas. The DOT's efforts not only replace wetlands that are lost, but they often provide additional public benefit such as education, recreational opportunities and wildlifeviewing. Roadside Maintenance and Enhancement DOT personnel responsible for the maintenance of state roadways (highwayrights-of-way) use a number of approaches to enhance and preserve these areas.The primary objectives of roadside maintenance are safety of motorists andcontrol of noxious weeds, while at the same time providing a habitat for wildlifeand an aesthetically pleasing environment. Roadside mowing is limited to safetyzones and noxious weed areas. Spot herbicide applications are also used fornoxious weed and brush control. Wildflowers and native grasses are beingestablished to provide competition for weeds and provide travelers with a moreintriguing landscape.10New Highway Construction An important component of any new or reconstruction highway project is its roadside development plan. The plan is specific for each project and outlines theappropriate planting styles and species that will be used for erosion control, andas enhancements to the project. These plans will vary depending on the terrain,soil types, areas disturbed during construction, required mitigation related toenvironmental impacts, and overall highway corridor design. Adopt-A-Highway and Roadside Planting Sponsorship Program This program allows groups to select a portion of highway right-of-way for removal of litter and/or to plant trees, shrubs, wildflowers and grasses. For moreinformation about this program, contact the DOT's Office of Maintenance at 515-239-1471. Private Sponsors In addition to the plantings done by the Iowa Department of Transportation, thedepartment encourages private citizens and civic groups to establish andmaintain plantings on highway rights-of-way. For information about how to getinvolved, contact your local DOT maintenance facility or the DOT's roadsidedevelopment section at 515-239-1424.11Chapter 3: Value of Landscaping and Roadside Management Flowers, grasses, trees, shrubs, and other woody plants are a familiar site to most people traveling Iowa's roadways. However, few of us pause to considerhow they came to be there, how they are managed, and the benefits they bestowon us. In reality, people often take plants for granted. The value of plants for their aesthetic contribution is obvious. Many less obvious benefits of plants and roadside management are described here.\u007f Plants protect water quality. The hair-like root fibers of trees and other plants trap pollutants such as nitrates and phosphates that would contaminate ground-water. Plants also reduce surface water runoff, keeping phosphorus and otherpollutants out of our waterways. \u007f Proper landscaping reduces soil erosion and rejuv enates the ear th. A dense cover of plants and mulch holds soil in place, keeping sediment out of lakes,streams, storm drains and roads; and reducing flooding, mudslides and duststorms. The decaying of dead plant parts improves the soil through theaddition of organic matter. \u007f Plant foliage improves air quality by acting as a filter, absorbing both solid and gaseous particulates. These particulates include such pollutants as carbondioxide, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and others. One tree can remove 26 pounds ofcarbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually, equaling the emissions createdby 11,000 miles of car travel. Of course, plants also give off oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. Without plants there would be no life on earth.12\u007f Landscaping alters the environment in which we live by moderating climate. Climate control is obtained by moderating the effects of sun, wind and rain.Radiant energy from the sun is absorbed or deflected by leaves in the summer,and is only filtered by branches in winter. Urban plants reduce urban airtemperatures significantly by shading heat sinks such as buildings and con-crete, and returning humidity to the air through evaporative cooling. \u007f Landscaping screens busy streets and roadways. Well-placed plantings offer privacy and tranquility by screening out busy street noises and objectionable views of traffic, as well as unwanted views from the highway such asjunkyards, etc. They also reduce glare and reflection from headlights andstreet lighting. \u007f Good landscaping increases community appeal. Psychologists have discov- ered that trees, well-landscaped grounds, and places for taking walks to beamong the most important factors considered when individuals chose a placeto live. Size and distribution of trees also relates to citizens satisfaction withtheir neighborhood. \u007f Landscaping reduces crime. One state study showed that landscaped areas were relatively graffiti-free, while open, non-landscaped areas were graffititargets. Well planned and maintained landscapes are seen as safer thanunmaintained plantings.13\u007f Plants also offer social benefits by making our life more pleasant and less stressful. Most of us respond to the presence of trees beyond simply observ- ing their beauty. We feel serene, peaceful, restful, and tranquil when trees arein view. It has been shown that workers who view trees on their commute arehealthier because they experience less stress on their way to and from work. \u007f Landscaping enhances business districts. Greening of business districts increases community pride and positive perception of an area, drawing custom-ers to the businesses. Economic development will take place where peoplewant to live. \u007f Plants also attract wildlife, and provide shelter and food for many different animals. This is extremely important as development overtakes natural habitats. \u007f Wind speed and direction can be affected by plants. A well designed windbreak can benefit highway maintenance operations by reducing the amount of snowthat blows across or drifts onto the roadway. \u007f Roadside plants also contribute to highway safety by providing a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes to break up the landscape, and decrease highwayhypnosis. This visual stimulation reduces driver fatigue and the potential offalling asleep at the wheel. Plants can also be used to delineate highwayalignment, giving visual cues to drivers of upcoming curves or intersections.Some native grasses, as well as trees and shrubs, protrude through Iowa'ssnow cover, thus reducing the sun's glare. Roadside plants provide a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes to break up the landscape, and decrease highway hypnosis.14Chapter 4: Wildflowers and Native Grasses A. Planting philosophy and benefits When highway construction is complete, vegetation is established to help control surface erosion and provide competition for Mother Nature's inevitable invasion ofopportunistic weedy species. Different seed mixes are used depending on thelocation in the right-of-way. For example, areas next to the shoulder that receiveregular mowing are seeded to species that can best tolerate mowing. When looking for species that are tough enough to thrive in roadside conditions, the Iowa DOT has looked at what grew here historically. Iowa was predominantlyprairie, with 85 percent of the state covered by more than 300 species of grassesand wildflowers. Most of these species are warm-season plants that tolerateIowa's hot summers because they have developed a special photosynthesissystem, and deep, massive root systems to find moisture. It is these rootsystems that help prevent soil erosion and crowd out undesirable weeds, thusmaking them well suited for roadsides. Many of the non-native species now usedin the state, such as bluegrass for lawns, are cool season plants and grow mainlyduring the spring and fall, often going dormant during the summer. Since nativeplants have successfully developed here for several centuries, the DOT strives touse these plants in the majority of roadside seedings. The goal is not to try torecreate the prairie, but to use prairie plants for landscaping Iowa's roadsides.15B. Planting mixes Seed mixes can be changed to meet a variety of needs. The following gives some examples of how the Iowa DOT designs seed mixes to achieve differentresults. Minimum Maintenance MixesThese seed mixes are used on the majority of roadsides. The intent is to useplants that can best tolerate the least amount of maintenance and still providethe needed erosion control and weed competition. Only spot mowing and targetedspraying are anticipated as maintenance activities. Native grasses and wildflow-ers are mostly used, with some non-natives added occasionally for fastervegetative establishment in highly erodible areas. Cover crops of annual plantsare sometimes added to these mixes to reduce erosion during establishment.These mixes include approximately 70 percent grasses and 30 percent forbs(wildflowers), attempting to mimic the ratio of grasses to forbs found in the tallgrass prairie. Mowable MixesThese mixes are used for areas that will receive periodic mowings. Cool season,non-native plants such as fescues and ryegrasses are often used along shoul-ders and in medians where mowings are needed three to four times a year.Where an aesthetic turf look is desired, seed mixes containing bluegrass andcreeping red fescue are used because they tolerate frequent mowing.16Weed Area Mixes These mixes contain primarily grasses and are used when reseeding areas withhigh noxious weed infestations where future herbicide applications are expected.Few wildflowers tolerate the herbicides used to control thistles. Wildflower MixesThese mixes are a variation of the basic minimum maintenance mixes. In thesemixes, shorter grasses and a higher concentration of wildflowers are used to givea more showy floral display. These are used at selected areas where there is adesire to draw attention to the roadside. Communities often request these typesof mixes to beautify their gateways. Special Seeding MixesSeed mixes often need to be designed for special areas such as butterflygardens, outdoor classrooms, wetlands, woodlands, or in areas with unusual soilcharacteristics. It is important to know about the growth and habitat characteris-tics of many different species to identify which plants to use in these areas.17Common name: Canada 24 inches tall; rhizomatous; white flowers Bloom period: May to July Trivia:Pollinated by bees and flies;

Tree planting philosophy and benefits Iowa's highways traverse many kinds of landscapes: from urban to rural; from prairie and savanna to forests; and from dry, upland sites to rivers and wetlands. Designers use a variety ofplanting styles to help the highway visually blend into the surrounding landscape or improveaesthetics and safety. Trees are often planted to add visual variety to the landscape, thusbreaking up the \"highway hypnosis\" effect. Trees are also planted to help control blowing anddrifting snow, screen unsightly views both to and from the highway, frame interesting views, ordelineate curves and other changes in the highway alignment. When the DOT impacts woodlands and wooded wetlands with highway projects, it mitigates those impacts with new tree plantings and/or preserving existing woodlands. B. Definition It is sometimes difficult to categorize a plant as a tree or a shrub. Sometimes species appeartree-like under favorable environmental conditions, but shrub-like in other areas. For thispublication, a tree has been defined as a plant with a single woody stem with a mature diameterof not less than 2 inches and height of at least 15 to 20 feet. All species of broadleaf trees, except the ginkgo, produce flowers sometime during the growing season, generally in the spring. The most colorful blossoms are usually found on the smallesttrees. Most large trees have tiny, inconspicuous flowers that few people notice, with someexceptions, such as catalpa and tulip trees.59 C. Tree planting styles The following is a brief look at some of the more common tree planting styles. Formal Style Plantings This is where the plant materials are planted in evenly spaced, straight lines or rigid geometricshapes. This style is often used in urban areas where the planting area is very narrow or thedesigner is trying to define a space or create an image. This style generally requires a higherlevel of maintenance because if a plant dies or is replaced, it is obvious to the viewer. Informal Planting StyleInformal planting is where plant materials are randomly spaced, either individually or in groups.This style gives a natural, park-like look to the landscape. One of the benefits of this style isthat if a plant dies or is removed, it is not obvious to the viewer. Forestation StyleThis is where large numbers of trees (often seedlings) are planted tightly together in closelyspaced rows. This is a technique used by foresters to establish tree stands with strong, straighttrunks. It is a very economical way for planting and early maintenance. The idea is to return tothe planting after a number of years and strategically thin the stand by removing selected treesto give it the desired look.

Planting philosophy and benefits Shrubs have many attributes that make them well suited for roadside use. First, they do not have large trunks that can cause a hazard for errant vehicles. Second, there are many speciesof shrubs, native and non-native, that thrive in Iowa. This gives designers a large palate to usewhen selecting shrubs for specific uses such as living snow fence, enhancing medians wheresight distance is critical, screening unsightly views, or framing community entry signs. In addition, shrubs can offer colors throughout the seasons with flowers, berries, fall leaves, and winter twigs. Much of Iowa's small wildlife relies on shrubs for food, nesting and winter cover. B. Definition A shrub is defined as a woody, busy plant, branched at or near the base, and usually less than15 feet in height. C. Planting styles The following are some of the ways shrubs are used in Iowa's roadsides. Living Snow FenceIowa has established several hundred miles of living snow fence along its roadways. Livingsnow fence is made up of two shrub rows approximately 5 feet apart, with shrubs closelyspaced (approximately 3 feet apart) within each row. Research has shown that this plantingstyle stores the most snow in the least amount of space.99Shrub Beds Shrubs are often planted in groups to give a greater visual effect. Large groups and largeshrubs are used in higher speed areas where drivers cannot notice small details in the road-sides. In lower speed areas, such as communities or rest areas, smaller groups and smallershrubs can be used. The groups can be either formal or informal in their appearance. Formal shrub beds are sometimes used in narrow areas such as medians to give the appearance of order and helpguide drivers. Informal beds are sometimes used to enhance community entryways andvisually frame entrance signs.100 ShrubsCommon name: A deciduous shrub; grows 3 to 6 feet high, spread 10 feet; glossy, pendulous clusters of black fruit suspendedbefore lustrous green leaves;

References and Bibliography123Amazing Plant Facts \u007f If every American family planted one tree, more than 1 billion pounds (500,000 tons) of pollutants would be removed from the atmosphere every year. \u007f In one day, an average tree exhales enough oxygen to keep a family of four breathing for that day. \u007f A mature tree can pull one ton of water from the soil each day. This water cools the air through evaporation, acting as an air conditioner. \u007f Young trees absorb more carbon dioxide during growth than older trees.\u007f An acre of trees (400 trees), roughly an area the size of a football field, absorbs the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by a single automobile in oneyear. \u007f The world's largest living thing, the General Sherman Giant Sequoia in Califor- nia, weighs 1,400 tons (as much as 300 elephants.) \u007f Evaporation from a single large tree can produce the cooling effect of 10 room- sized air conditioners operating 20 hours a day. \u007f The raffia palm (Raffia ruffia) has one of the world's largest leaves; some have been recorded measuring over 65 feet long. Amazing Plant Facts124 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f Fossils of the Ginkgo tree (Ginkgo biloba) date back some 160 million years; it first appeared at the time of the dinosaurs (Jurassic era). \u007f Duckweed (Wolffia angusta) is the world's smallest flowering plant. It is a mere 1/42nd of an inch long and 1/85th of an inch wide. It bears a tiny fruit. A tablespoon can hold more than 100,000 plants. \u007f The Coco-de-Mer palm (Lodoicea maldivica), from the Seychelles, has the largest seed in the world. Also known as the double coconut, its seed weighsas much as 40 pounds. \u007f Speedy tree (Albizzia falcata) is the world's fastest growing tree. One speci- men was recorded growing 35 feet, three inches in only 13 months. That'sover an inch a day! \u007f Flowering plants dominate the contemporary flora of the Earth. There are an estimated 250,000 species, with the greatest diversity in the moist tropics. \u007f The orchids (Orchidaceae) have more species than any other family of flower- ing plants, with 25,000-35,000 species recognized, mostly in the tropics. \u007f It is likely that 10 to 15 percent of the Earth's flowering plants have not yet been described. Most will be in the moist tropics, especially remote parts ofLatin America.125 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f A conifer, California Redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ), is the tallest tree on high). \u007f The Bristlecone Pine ( Pinus aristata ) was thought to be the oldest, at about 4,900 years, but a huge Huon Pine ( Dacrydium franklinii ) found in Tasmania may be thousands of years older still. \u007f As plants get smaller, we know less about them. We know 85 to 90 percent of the flowering plants, but only 1 percent or less of some microscopic organ-isms. \u007f In developing countries, plants are the main source of medicine.\u007f Eighty percent of the world's people depend on traditional medicines, made from plants, for their primary health care. \u007f Two of the largest users of medicinal plants are China and India. Traditional Chinese medicine uses more than 5,000 plant species; India uses some7,000. \u007f China has 250,000 doctors trained in traditional medicine, India 460,000. All use plant drugs. \u007f Latin America, home of a third of the world's plants, also has a long-standing tradition of use of plants as medicine, especially among the indigenouspeoples. Nearly 2,000 species are used in the Colombian Amazon for medici-nal purposes.126 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f Plants are the origin of more than 30 medicinal drugs, proven effective by scientifically controlled therapeutic trials. \u007f Some drugs like aspirin are synthesized copies of chemicals found naturally in plants. Others, like digoxin or morphine, are produced from plants cultivatedspecially for the purpose. \u007f An extract from the bark of Cinchona (quinine) from the Andes of Ecuador and Peru was for three centuries the standard remedy for malaria. The activealkaloids have been isolated and synthesized, and crude 'botanical' hasceased to be used in western medicine. However, it is now beingreinvestigated for use against strains of malaria resistant to modern drugs. \u007f Meadow Saffron is one of the oldest medicinal plants that is still in the modern pharmacopoeia. Its use was recorded in 100 AD to treat joint pains, and nowis used in the treatment of acute gout. \u007f Plants provide almost every sort of material in everyday use, such as fiber, gums, resins, luxury foods, and stimulants. \u007f Fibers, extracted from plant stems, are one of the most ancient and valuable of plant products. People use the fibers of over 2,000 plant species. \u007f Flax, an annual crop originally from Southwest Asia and the raw material for linen, is probably the oldest cultivated fiber.127 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f Bamboos, huge grasses with hollow, compartmentalized, woody stems, continue to provide one of the major structural materials of tropical regions,especially Asia. \u007f Reeds, robust aquatic grasses, are an important sustainable resource of temperate and tropical wetlands. Some peoples, like the Marsh Arabs of theRivers Tigris and Euphrates, build entire houses (even mosques) from reeds.Reed beds also protect against erosion of lake shores and river banks andare important habitats for birds and other wildlife. \u007f Almost all the world's 65 species of grapevine are native to North America (which the Vikings called Vinland). These North American plants saved theEuropean wine industry after 1867 when root aphids began devastatingEuropean vines. Today all European vines are grafted onto American stock. \u007f Natural rubber, a native of the Amazon basin, is one of the most widely used of all plant products. \u007f Eighty-four percent of a raw apple is water.\u007f A cucumber is 96 percent water.\u007f A notch in a tree will remain the same distance from the ground as the tree grows. \u007f A pineapple is a berry.128 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f Advertisements for coffee in London in 1657 claimed that the beverage was a cure for scurvy, gout and other ills. \u007f Almonds are the oldest, most widely cultivated and extensively used nuts in the world. \u007f Americans eat more bananas than any other fruit: a total of 11 billion a year.\u007f An average ear of corn has 800 kernels, arranged in 16 rows.\u007f Bananas are actually herbs. Bananas die after fruiting, like all herbs do.\u007f Cranberries are one of just three major fruits native to North America. Blue- berries and Concord grapes are the other two. \u007f Dr. Joel Poinsett, the first U.S. ambassador to Mexico, brought the poinsettia to the U.S. in 1828. The plant, called \"flower of the blessed night\" in Mexico,was renamed in Poinsett's honor. \u007f Eggplant is a member of the thistle family.\u007f Ginger has been clinically demonstrated to work twice as well as Dramamine for fighting motion sickness, with no side effects. \u007f In 1932 James Markham obtained the first patent issued for a tree. The patent was for a peach tree.129 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f In the Netherlands, in 1634, a collector paid 1,000 pounds of cheese, four oxen, eight pigs, 12 sheep, a bed, and a suit of clothes for a single bulb of theViceroy tulip. \u007f No species of wild plant produces a flower or blossom that is absolutely black, and so far, none has been developed artificially. \u007f Oak trees do not have acorns until they are 50 years old or older.\u007f One ragweed plant can release as many as one billion grains of pollen.\u007f Oranges, lemons, watermelons and tomatoes are berries.\u007f Orchids have the smallest seeds. It takes more than 1.25 million seeds to weigh 1 gram. \u007f Peanuts are beans.\u007f Plants that need to attract moths for pollination are generally white or pale yellow, to be better seen when the light is dim. \u007f Plants that depend on butterflies, such as the poppy or the hibiscus, have more colorful flowers. \u007f Quinine, one of the most important drugs known to man, is obtained from the dried bark of an evergreen tree native to South America.130\u007f Tea was so expensive when it was first brought to the United States in the early 17th century it was kept in locked wooden boxes. \u007f The California redwood - coast redwood and giant sequoia - are the tallest and largest living organism in the world. \u007f The fragrance of flowers is due to the essences of oil they produce.\u007f The largest single flower is the Rafflesia or \"corpse flower.\" They are generally 3 feet in diameter with the record being 42 inches. \u007f The pineapple was symbol of welcome in the 1700-1800s. That is why in New England you will see so many pineapples on door knockers. \u007f The plant life in the oceans make up about 85 percent of all the greenery on the Earth. \u007f The rose family of plants, in addition to flowers, gives us apples, pears, plums, cherries, almonds, peaches and apricots. \u007f The world's tallest grass, which has sometimes grown 130 feet tall or more, is bamboo. Amazing Plant Facts131 Amazing Plant Facts\u007f There are more than 700 species of plants that grow in the United States that have been identified as dangerous if eaten. Among them are some that arecommonly favored by gardeners: buttercups, daffodils, lily of the oleander, azalea, heart, delphinium and rhododendron. \u007f Wheat is the world's most widely cultivated plant; grown on every continent except Antarctica. \u007f When a coffee seed is planted, it takes five years to yield consumable fruit.\u007f Willow bark, which provides the salicylic acid from which aspirin was originally synthesized, has been used as a pain remedy ever since the Greeks discov-ered its therapeutic power nearly 2,500 years ago. \u007f Carrots, potatoes and radishes are examples of roots that we eat.\u007f Leaves have veins that help carry water and minerals to different parts of each leaf. Sometimes many veins are networked within a single "}
