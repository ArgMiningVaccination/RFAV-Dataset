Searching to answer these questions, we turn to every possible medical specialty and lifestyle cause, looking for clues. After guiding thousands of patients on their journeys back to health, Dr. Linda Lancaster has discovered that it is the interplay of invisible forces such as chemicals, heavy metals, radiation, and opportunistic parasites\u2014the \"Five Culprits\"\u2014worms, fungus, bacteria, micro-parasites, and viruses, that are the cause of many of the health struggles we experience today.
