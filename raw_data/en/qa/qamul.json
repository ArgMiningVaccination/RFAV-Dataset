We will start by looking at the definitions of complementary or alternative medicine, mind-body medicine and o ptimal aging. Alternative or complem entary healthcare derives its name from being alternative or complementary to allopathic medi cine, which typically involves the use of drugs, surgery, or rigorously tested FD A-approved modalities of treatm ent. Alternative or complementary medicine typically involves the use of natural su bstances, such as herbs, essences, and oils, and the use of mind, body, and spiri tual techniques. The terms are often used interchangeably, but it should be noted that generally, alternative healthcare uses techniques that are alternative to conventional medicine techniques and complementary healthcare uses techniques that are in additi on to conventional techniques. It should also be noted that at some point in time, probably every medical technique was considered complem entary or alternative to conventional techniques, until sufficient testing, research , and standardization of proc edure was done. Finally, different medical philosophies vary in what they consider stand ard and complementary techniques, e.g. allopathic medicine does not include osteopath ic manipulation as a conventional technique, whereas for osteopathic medicine, it is a foundational technique. Mind-body medicine, popularized by Deepak Chopra, MD, and integ rative medicine, popularized by Andrew Weil, MD , include approaches from all bra nches of healing modalities: allopathic, osteopathi c, and complementary or alter native techniques. Once again, the terms are often used interchangeably. Mind-body medicine focuses on the interactions between the brain, the body, the mind, and behavior. It also focuses on the ways in which emotional, mental, social, spiritual, experientia l, and behavioral factors affect health. Integrative medici ne focuses on integrating effe ctive practices from all branches of medicine. 4 The National Center for Complement ary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), located within the National Institutes for Heal th (NIH), is one of the largest and most complete resources for scientifically based information about complement ary and alternative medicine. Among other resources, i t provides literature reviews , clinical guidelines, a dictionary of practices and appr oaches, and reviews of research. Much of our discussion will be based on NCCIH information. In working with geriatric patient s, it is useful to have a fram ework for treatment. Dr. Ken Brummel-Smith, MD, a noted geriatrician, has provided an easy w orking definition of optimal aging that is commonly used by clinicians, geriatrician s, and geriatric patients: Optimal aging is the capacity for function across many domains - physical, functional, cognitive, emotional, social, and spiritual - to one's satisfac tion and in spite of one's medical condition. Osteopathic medicine supports this definition of optimal aging, through application of its foundational principles that focus on the whole person, on the capacity of the body to heal itself if given the right c onditions, on the use of OMT to support healing of the body, and being patient-centered rath er than disease-centered. Other types of medicine have similar philosophies of treatm ent. Allopathic medicine supports this definition of optimal aging, through its efforts to relie ve symptoms of disease or ma lfunction, reduce or eliminate pain, and to improve quality of life for patients. In other modules, we have discussed (1) demographics of aging, (2) optimal aging, (3) complementary and alternative approaches to healthcare, (4) com plementary techniques that primarily use the body as the entrance point fo r care, and (5) complementary techniques that p rimarily use the mind as the ent rance point for care. Geriatric patients often use a combination of methods, techniqu es, and practices in their healthcare to improve their quality of life, so we are reviewin g many of the most commonly used types of complement ary healthcare techniques that might be used by your geriatric patients. Here we will be discussing alternative techniques that primarily use the spirit as the entrance point for care. 5 People often assume that spiri tuality and relig ion are synonymo us, but that is not necessarily so. Spirituality is broader than religious belief. Thus, although many religions have a spiritual component, spiritual activities and beliefs extend way beyond any one religion. As Linda Keilma n, PhD, points out, religion d oes not equal spirituality, and spirituality does not equal rel igion. Whereas in times past , religion was centered on a building and a group of people, now relig ious and spiritual b eliefs are expressed and fostered in many settings, incl uding support groups, home-centered Bible studies, and retreat centers. From being formal (Sunday dress, Sunday or Sabbath events, celebration of religious holidays in ritualistic ways), now we find that many churches and religious centers have added to their events. They have incorpo rated popular music, allowed less formal dress, inc luded all ages and other members of the community, allowed audience par ticipation, and even changed seating arrang ements. This has been done in an effort to be more cont emporary, appealing and releva nt to participants. In the same way, spiritual events have blossomed, in many types of ven ues, involving many types of people, programs, types of learning, and activities. M any people find these activities, both religious and spiritual, to be comforting, soo thing, healing, centering, social, and personal. In particula r, some of the activities spe cifically seem to have a stress-reducing or healing comp onent, and we will be discussing some of those here. Affirmations are positive verbal statements that one says to oneself in a re laxed state of mind. Many people find that, ov er time, the us e of affirmati ons can create healthier energy patterns in the mind and b ody. Affirmations are often us ed to relieve stress and chronic pain, and to promote c onditions in the body that foster healing of many conditions. They are simple to do, cost nothing, and can make a difference in a person's physical and mental condition . Affirmations have been, and can be, used to address improvement in or healing of phy sical conditions, mental condit ions, relationship issues, abundance or lack of it, and, y es, even spiritual growth. To make the best use of affirmations to promote personal growth, well-being, and self-healing, it is generally recommended that a person start by ide ntifying the condition to work on, and then identify an a ffirmation to use, which is a si mple statement with positive intent. Typically, a per son will start by writing the affirmation out and saying it 6 aloud, several times a day, for ex ample 10-20 times a day, and 2-3 times a day. As a person gets more comfortable with this process, he or she may s witch to repeating the affirmation silently, but continuing to say it several times da y, at several intervals. It is believed that, with enough repetit ions, a person can change the ir underlying thinking about a condition, leading to permanent change in belief and at titude, which ultimately leads to a change in the physical or mental condition. The use of affirmations can be tr aced back more than a century ago to a French pharmacist named Emile Coue, who ran a free clinic for patients. He suggested that patients say the following affi rmation 20 times a day: \"Every d ay in every way, I am getting better and better.\" He used many more affirmations in h is work, but this is one of the most common, and it remains in use by many people to this d ay. He believed what many people today believe: that p hysical conditions in the body often start in the mind and changing thought patterns in the mind can result in changes in the physical body. Louise Hay is a popular author, teacher, and lecturer who has w ritten more than 50 books and been a leader i n self-healing and metaphysics for mor e than 30 years. In her writings, she explains what affi rmations are and how they can be used. She teaches that all physical conditions have an underlying mental componen t and that if one changes the underlying mental com ponent, one can also address the manifesting physical condition. In her earlie r work, she compiled a long li st of medical conditions and then identified the underlying problematical mental thoughts th at may contribute to each condition. She then suggested a positive affirmation to positively address the situation, which she said might help a per son in changing that condition. In her more recent writings, she has teamed up with M ona Lisa Schulz, MD, a board- certified psychiatrist, with a PhD in neuroscience. They have tied Hay's earlier works together with current research and scientific findings , and pulled together many tools for supporting personal growth and self-healing for a range of conditions. Affirmations for release of stre ss and spiritual growth might i nclude such ideas as the following: I am supported by life. 7 I am safe. I am loved. I have faith. I am at peace. Meditation , which was discussed in Module 5, is a broad category that inc ludes many different techniques, approaches, and styles, and it can be use d for many different purposes. Typically, a person who is meditating focuses attenti on on a word, an object, or the breath. Meditation can be used to increase calmness or r elaxation, for health purposes to help deal with a spec ific condition or to improve o verall wellness, and for spiritual development. Most types of meditation have similar ch aracteristics: Meditation is usually done in a q uiet location, free from dist ractions, although there are also walking forms of meditation, and some people reg ularly meditate anywhere, anytime. Meditation is usually done in a comfortable posture, which can be sitting, lying down, standing, or walking. Meditation usually includes focu s of attention, which can be a word or set of words, a mantra that is a specifically chosen word or set of wo rds, an object, or even simply the breath. Meditation involves keeping an open attitude, which lets distr actions, thoughts and emotions come and go without focusing on them, gently bring ing the attention back to the focus of a ttention when one becomes aware that the mind has wandered. Meditation styles can include cont emplation, in which a person thinks deeply about some subject; and concentration, in which a person focuses on s ome object or idea, such as a picture, a statue, a c andle, or something in nature. Generally, meditation can be used for health purposes for c onditions such as anxiety, pain, depression, addictions, stress, insomnia, and many physical and emotional s ymptoms of chronic illnesses, as well as general overall wellness. All types of meditation help to balance the mind, body, and emotions. 8 Prayer is an activity that almost e veryone recognizes, and have proba bly done at some point in their lives. According to Richard Gerber, MD, prayer c an be considered a type of spiritual affirmation tha t can bring about healing, change, and spiritual growth. Prayer can be done in many ways, but c ommonly is done with heads bowed and eyes closed, to better focus on the ideas bei ng expressed. However, prayer c an be done while standing, sitting or moving, sil ently or verbally, and can be directed at such entities as a deity, a spirit, a loved one, to t he Light, or the Universe. It can be ritualistic, memorized, or more casual. It typically involves communication with a power greater than one self does, and many people believe i t can bring about peace and heal ing. In their book How God Changes Your Brain, Andrew Newberg, MD, a nd Mark Robert Waldman present research findi ngs and suggest that spiritual ac tivities do no harm and can actually change a person's br ain in fundamentally healthy ways. They specifically identify eight different activities that can do so: smile, stay intellectually active, consciously relax, yawn, meditate, do aerobic exercise, engage in dialogue with others, and have faith. Visualizations are mental images of something that you want to see, occur, or have happen. The greater the detail in a visualization, the stronger and more forceful it becomes. Some teachers recommend in corporating all the senses i n visualizations - sight, sound, touch, smell, heari ng, and even tasting, if appro priate. These mental pictures are often used to accompany affirmations, requiring a person to use greater focus, and giving more power to the new reality a person wishes to create. Recent research has shown that visualiz ation can be helpful in dealing with stress-related conditions, as well as recovery from many illnesses. For exampl e, visualization is often a tool used in cancer-recovery programs. Keeping a gratitude journal is an interesting method to fo cus on what is good in one's life. All too often, we seem to focus on our problems rather th an the things that make us happy or for which we are grate ful. Keeping such a journal can help a person change their focus from negativity and complaint to recognition that e very life has things in it that can be appreciated. The idea is simple: every day the pers on writes down things 9 that happened that day for which they are grateful. A person can aim to write a certain number of things, like three things or five things. What is important is to spend some time thinking about the day and writ ing something down every da y. Over time, this can help a person move their thinki ng from one of negativity and co mplaint to a more positive and even happier attitude. Conclusions: Not all of these approaches will ap peal to every person. For ex ample, some people may either gravita te towards, or be opposed to, pra yer, based on their religious beliefs. Some people ma y not be good at creating visual pictures in their mind and so, for them, visualizations may be difficult and therefore not so helpful. Some people may find that sitting still and meditating is hard. They may prefer to do walking meditations, or to use affirmati ons and visualizations while they are engaged in other activities. Because there are so many differ ent options, every person can p robably find one or more of these methods easy to d o and helpful. Because these methods are so simple and generally no- or low-cost, you will probably encounter many patients, especially your geriatric patients, using one of more of these methods. Th is is the reason it is important for you to familiarize yourself with these techniques . It is also important for you to know where to get reli able information about them, for y our own knowledge and to share with your patients. One very good source of evidence-based information on all kinds of alternative and complem entary methods of healthcare is the National Institutes of Health, National Center for Co mplementary and Integrative He alth website (www.nccih.nih.gov ). You will likely find, as you work with your geriatric patients, that as they age they begin to think more seriously about iss ues such as death, life after death, God or Higher Powers, and the role of spirit i n their lives. Keilman points o ut that spirituality increases with aging. People may already be using some of the techniques discussed in this module. They may be using these techniques because they are dea ling with some illness or chronic condition. Som e individuals may be using the se techniques because they are concerned about these i ssues and are growing in spirit uality as they approach 10 their own demise. You may want t o explore with your older patients if they are doing so, or if they would like more information about any of these types of techniques. You will recall that Brummel-Smith includ ed consideration of the spiritu al dimension of life as one of the factors to consider i n optimal aging. Engaging in di scussions with your geriatric patients on these topics can support them, give them additional ways to aid in improvement or recovery from chr onic conditions, help them relieve stress, or otherwise bring them peace. Additionally , you will show yourself to be an exceptional medical or healthcare practitioner. 11 Experiential Activities Assignment 1.Pick one approach an d practice it 10 minutes every day for o ne week.

Alternative or complementary medicine typically involves the use of natural substances, such as herbs, and essential oils, and the use o f mind, body, and spiritual techniques. The terms alternative and complementary are often used interchangeably, b ut generally, alternative healthcare refers to techniques and approaches that are alternative to conventional medicine, and comp lementary healthcare refers t o techniques or approaches that are complement ary to conventional medicine. 2.Definition of mind-body medicine or integrative medicine: In tegrative medicine involves the best approaches from all branches of healing modal ities: allopathic, osteopathic, and comple mentary or alternative medicine. Mind-body medicine focuses on the interact ions between the brain, the bod y, the mind, and behavior. It also focuses on ways in which emotional, ment al, social, spiritual, experiential, and behav ioral factors all affect health. 3.The National Center for Comple mentary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), located within the U.S. National Institutes for Health (NIH), i s one of the largest and most complete resources for scientifically based informatio n about complementary and alte rnative medicine. 4.A solid, practical, and useful framework for working with ge riatric patients has been developed by Ken Brummel-Smith, MD, a noted geriatrician. He provided an easy working definit ion of Optimal Aging that is commonly us ed by clinicians and others working with geriatric patients. 5.Definition of opt imal aging: Optimal Aging is the capacity o f the geriatric patient for functioning across many domains - physical, functional, cog nitive, 16 emotional, social, and spiritual - to one's satisfaction and in spite of one's medical condition. 6.Osteopathic medicine supports this definition through emphas is on foundational principles of Osteopathic Practi ces and Principles (OPP) that f ocus on working with the whole person, the capac ity of the body to heal itself if given the right conditions, the use of Osteopathi c Manipulative Treatment (OMT) to support healing, and being patient-centered. 7.Allopathic medicine supports this definition through its emp hasis on its efforts to relieve symptoms of disease or m alfunction, reduce or eliminate pain, and to improve quality of life for patients. 8.Geriatric patients will often use a combination of conventio nal medical approaches and complementary or alternative health approaches, for many reasons. 9.For maximum effectiveness, healthcare professionals need to be familiar with the various types of treatment approaches (traditional and non- traditional!) their geriatric patients may be using , so they can provide and coordi nate the best possible treatment plan. 10.Examples of mind-body approac hes that use the spirit as the main pathway to affect the whole perso n include affirmations , meditations, pray er, visualizations, and gratitude. 11.Familiarity with and exploration and experience of these an d other complementary techniques is en couraged for all healthcare profe ssionals, so they can best work with their ger iatric patients who will often be using one or more of these techniques. This also supports the concept of opt imal aging. 17 Resources and References Brummel-Smith, K. (2007). Optima l aging part 1: Demographics an d definitions. Annals of Long-Term Care. 15(11), 26-28.
