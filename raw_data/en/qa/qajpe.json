For 16 years, she has practiced many forms of massage therapy, specializing in medical massage since 2018. She has worked at the Graf Center for Integrative Medicine at Englewood Hospital, providing massages to Oncology patients and post-operative clients. Inspired by community and service, she supports people in recovery from substance abuse, giving them the tools and healing they need to recover and flourish. As an AcuDetox Specialist, she is certified in the NADA protocol for Auriculotherapy with Acupuncture Ear Seeds. Passionate about energy work, Jocelyn's hands are an instrument of healing. She can feel and sense the current in the body and feels grateful to be able to help people get back into a healthy flow of energy. What sets her apart from other massage therapists is her ability to feel the electromagnetic field and communicate with the body. She listens to the body's needs and trusts in the body's wisdom to heal. Jocelyn has a gentle, holistic approach to healing, believing \"less is more.\" Deeply connected to her roots, she was born in the Dominican Republic and emigrated to the United States when she was 14, growing up in Washington Heights, NYC. Jocelyn comes from a long lineage of healers, mediums, and medicine women through her mother and grandmothers. After overcoming personal challenges and working with the wisdom of her ancestors, she developed a passion for helping others heal their physical, emotional, and spiritual wounds. In 2015, she dreamed of working with wood in sessions to extract heat and inflammation from the body. The next day, she came to work with a wooden rolling pin; the rest is history. In her Sacred Wood Therapy sessions, Jocelyn uses a specially crafted piece of maple wood as a therapeutic tool to reduce inflammation and heat and facilitate healing. Jocelyn loves traveling and takes great pleasure in exploring new places, meeting new people, and learning about their lives. She believes everyone has something valuable to share and that we can erase many of the prejudices in today's world by simply reaching out and connecting with others. Jocelyn offers Manual Lymphatic Drainage, Wood Therapy, Reiki, Spiritual Healing, Oncology Support, and Recovery Support sessions. She teaches classes in massage and introduces people to wood therapy and how to work with their guides. In addition, she volunteers her healing services at the Women's Rights Information Center in Englewood and for the National Harm Reduction Coalition in NYC. "}
