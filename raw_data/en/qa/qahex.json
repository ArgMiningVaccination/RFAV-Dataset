Some people and companies are trying to profit from this disease by selling unproven and illegally marketed products that make false claims. Unlike products approved or authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, [fraudulent products](/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products) that claim to diagnose, cure, treat or prevent COVID-19 haven't been evaluated by the agency for safety and effectiveness and might be dangerous to you and your family. The FDA is particularly concerned that these deceptive and misleading products might cause people to delay, skip or stop appropriate medical treatment for COVID-19, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. It's likely that the products do not do what they claim, and the ingredients in them could cause adverse effects (bad reactions) and could interact and potentially interfere with medications to treat many underlying medical conditions.

Taking Drugs Meant for Animals Is Dangerous In addition, the FDA reminds people that taking drugs for animals is dangerous.

How to Protect Yourself and Your Family From COVID-19 Fraud The FDA advises consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Fraudulent COVID-19 products come in many varieties, including supposed dietary supplements and other foods, as well as products claiming to be tests, drugs, medical devices or vaccines. The FDA has been working with companies to remove hundreds of misleading products from stores and online. The agency will continue to monitor social media and online marketplaces promoting and selling fraudulent COVID-19 products. Here are some tips to identify false or misleading claims: - Be suspicious of products that claim to treat a wide range of diseases. - Personal testimonials are no substitute for scientific evidence. - Few diseases or conditions can be treated quickly, so be suspicious of any therapy claimed as a \"quick fix.\" - If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. - \"Miracle cures,\" which claim scientific breakthroughs or contain secret ingredients, are likely a hoax.
