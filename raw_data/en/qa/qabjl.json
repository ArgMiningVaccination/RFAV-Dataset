I would particularly like to thank Jo Newton, our former Chair, for her unstinting service for the three years up to her departure in November 2017. Readers will be well aware by now that for a number of reasons the Transforming Care Together Partnership (TCT) ended somewhat abruptly in February 2018. However, it provided us with some invaluable learning to take forward, and I'd like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board of Directors to thank our counterparts from Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for their support and contribution throughout. The financial position of the Trust, as indeed for the majority of NHS Trusts, remains challenging and a priority for the Board of Directors is to secure sustainable service provision for the future, aligned very much to the expectations of the Sustainability and Transformation Plan for services across the Black Country. Against a very difficult and for many, an uncertain time, the Trust performed extremely well last year, and this report provides what I hope you will find to be a helpful account of what has been achieved. Our performance is testament to the skill and dedication of the people associated with the Trust. Having thanked our TCT partners, it would be remiss of me not to extend my grateful thanks to: - all our staff in whatever function they work through whose collective professionalism and care have helped our service users, many of whom are the most vulnerable in society, on their journey to recovery. - my fellow members on the Board of Directors for their invaluable contribution to steering the Trust through its busy agenda, from ensuring the continued quality of service provision through to overseeing operational performance; and - our governors, who are an important, dedicated group of volunteers giving freely of their time in fulfilling their duties. Looking forward, the Trust, like the wider NHS finds itself in an increasingly challenging and changing environment. Against that backdrop, I and my colleagues on the Board of Directors remain fully committed to ensuring the best possible service provision in the future, and the sustainability of that provision in our area. Foreword from the Chair Andrew Fry ChairAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018 5Foreword Whilst the end of the Transforming Care Together Partnership (TCT) was disappointing, there is now an opportunity to take the Trust forward to prominence across the Black Country and I'm delighted to have been appointed to lead the Trust in this quest. An enormous amount of work went into preparing for a safe integration and transfer of our services as part of TCT; front line staff were heavily involved in various work-streams looking to ensure a seamless transition and to develop the service offering, but our staff in corporate supporting functions, where the change and uncertainty was most prevalent showed tremendous professionalism in their approach. There were some very good initiatives coming out of the TCT programme and it will be important that we build on this and other learning from TCT in our future work. All of this work went on whilst we continued to provide good quality services, met all the national service targets and contractual obligations and delivered it at less cost than we expected; that's testament to everyone working together across the Trust for which I would like to say a big thank you. The NHS faces some of its most significant challenges ahead - the need to transform service provision in collaboration with other partners in the health and social care system whilst maintaining and improving the quality of services within increasingly stretched financial budgets is perhaps of greater significance now than it ever has been. Change and uncertainty can be daunting for both our staff and those who use our services. Having worked within the Trust for nearly seven years I am fully aware of the commitment of our staff to the provision of good quality services in which care and compassion for the people who use our services is prominent. At the same time, the Trust also has to demonstrate that it cares for its staff, which is a priority that has been agreed by the Board of Directors. Looking ahead will inevitably lead to closer and more collaborative working relationships with other bodies and it will be as demanding in the future as it has been in the recent past, but I'm confident in our collective ability to secure the very best outcome for the services and those who use them. In conclusion, I would once again thank staff and colleagues, and our partner organisations for their commitment and support during the year and look forward to continuing to work together to deliver high quality services in the future.Foreword from the Chief Executive Officer Lesley Writtle Chief Executive Officer Vision, Values and Strategic Objectives6 Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018 The Trust's vision is: Supported by our vision statement: To work with local communities to improve health and well-being for everyone Values Honesty and Transparency Integrity Empowerment Compassion and Kindness Dignity and Respect Goals To reduce inequality To improve and promote the health of local communities To provide high quality care, in the right place, at the right time To put people and their families at the heart of care Strategic Objectives1.

In 2011 the Trust changed its name to Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in acknowledgement of the transfer of services from the former neighbouring Primary Care Trusts. The Trust's services are predominantly divided into two clinical groups: the Mental Health (planned and un-planned care) Group and the Learning Disabilities and Children, Young People and Families Group. The following section provides an overview summary of our services. More detailed descriptions can be found on our website: www.bcpft.nhs.uk 1.3 Purpose and activities The principal purpose of the Trust is laid out in the Trust's constitution, but is primarily the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England. Key activities in furtherance of that purpose include the provision of mental health and specialist health learning disability services to all age groups, and the provision of children's community services. 1.4 The services we provide 1.4.1 Mental Health (MH) In the mental health group, we support people aged 18 years and above who are experiencing both common and severe mental health difficulties. We provide services within hospital and community facilities, as well as within people's own homes. Inpatient Care Hallam Street Hospital in West Bromwich comprises of three inpatient wards providing intensive care and treatment to people who are aged between 18 and 65 who are acutely unwell. Penn Hospital in Wolverhampton has three inpatient wards, two of these wards provide intensive care and treatment to people who are aged between 18 and 65 and one provides care to those over the age of 65, all patients will be acutely unwell and require treatment that cannot be delivered at home. The Macarthur Centre Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) supports adult males with severe mental health conditions, who need a short period of intensive care to reduce risk to themselves and others and enable them to return safely to a mainstream mental health ward. Edward Street Hospital in West Bromwich has two wards for older adults normally over the age of 65 but the service is based on need not age. The wards provide intensive care and treatment to older adults who are acutely unwell; this service includes patients who have dementia. Community-based Care Comprehensive community support is provided by a number of staff working in multi-disciplinary teams. Sandwell has a number of community teams which currently include: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), single point of referral, community mental health teams, for both adults and older adults, wellbeing service, crisis resolution and home treatment, criminal justice mental health team, and acute liaison team (based in Sandwell General Hospital). Sandwell Recovery College provides a collaborative educational learning environment for anyone over the age of 18 who have or are experiencing a mental health issue.Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 20189 Performance Report Memory assessment and treatment services are available in Wolverhampton and Sandwell. In addition Sandwell has a therapy and recovery unit for older adults which uses a recovery focused approach to care. Wolverhampton services are also multidisciplinary. They include a referral and assessment team, crisis and home treatment, acute hospital liaison (New Cross Hospital) and a complex care and wellbeing service which provides care to those who require 1.4.2 Learning Disability Services (LD) These services provide specialist health care to adults with learning disabilities and additional complex health needs, including autistic spectrum disorders, mental health difficulties and behaviour problems. We provide services in Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. A team of specialist health staff from different professions provide a range of inpatient, outpatient and community treatments and interventions. Specialist healthcare staff work closely with community nurses and social workers. Learning Disability Inpatient Care The Gerry Simon Clinic in West Bromwich is a regional low secure service for men with learning disabilities and complex health needs, some of whom may have come into contact with the criminal justice system. The Larches is a specialist step-down and rehabilitation service for men with learning disabilities, many of whom have been discharged from a secure environment. The Pines is a unit for women with learning disabilities, which aims to help them move from hospital back into the community whilst keeping safe. Penrose House is a specialist learning disability acute assessment and treatment service for both men and women. Orchard Hill House is our service for people with learning disabilities and / or additional needs who require medical admission to a specialist assessment and treatment unit. This could be because they are at risk in their current situation or because they require a period of treatment and rehabilitation.Community Learning Disability Services In addition, the Trust provides learning disability services in the community. These services include: Dudley learning disabilities specialist health service (based at The Ridge Hill Centre); Walsall integrated learning disabilities service for people with learning disabilities requiring health and social care support. There are two locality teams in Walsall. Walsall learning disabilities health facilitation team help people with a learning disability access primary and secondary health care. The team works with the community learning disability nursing team. The Trust also provides support to the Sandwell integrated support service, run by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council. This is a service for children and young people (aged 0 to 25 years) who have profound learning disabilities. We have a team within the service which can support children and young people with mental health needs. Wolverhampton learning disabilities specialist healthcare service supports adults in Wolverhampton with a learning disability to access mainstream services. The team is based within Pond Lane, Wolverhampton. 1.4.3 Children, Young People and Family Services (CYPF) We provide children's community healthcare services in Dudley as well as a range of services in Wolverhampton and Sandwell for children and young people experiencing mental health problems. Children's Universal Healthcare Services These services are for children and young people aged 0 to 18 years, and their families, living in Dudley. Services are delivered in a range of settings. Services include: Additional Needs Services: The Children's Assessment Unit o The children's assessment unit provides a multi-disciplinary assessment of pre- school children with varying special needs. The unit, which is staffed by a specialist health visitor / unit coordinator, is now based at the Sunflower Centre in Dudley, having transferred from Russells Hall Hospital during the year.Performance Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201810 Children attend the unit for a four week period following introductory visits. The assessment takes place in the nursery with planned daily activities and care carried out by experienced nursery nurses. During the assessment the children are seen by a range of healthcare professionals including a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, orthoptist (for eye problems) and audiologist (for hearing problems). They may also be seen by staff in the specialist early years-service and a psychologist. Following assessment a care plan for the child is decided between all those involved including parents and carers. Speech and Language Therapy o The speech and language therapy services supports children and young people up to the age of 16 years-old, or 18 / 19 years-old if in special school. The service provides assessment, diagnosis, advice, and therapy for children and young people with all types of communication difficulties or difficulties feeding and swallowing. Speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) might include problems with; making/discriminating different speech sounds understanding spoken language putting words together and/or making sentences voice (such as persistent hoarseness) stammering social communication skills eating and drinking difficulties The Children's Community Nursing Team (previously See-Saw Team) providing children's palliative care o The team supports children and young people up to the age of 18 years and their families, who have life limiting conditions and complex healthcare needs. Support is usually provided in the child's own home. The team includes specialist children's nurses and nursing assistant staff and is supported by a Citizens Advice Bureau worker. Paediatric Physiotherapy Service o The paediatric physiotherapy service is provided by a team of skilled, specialist paediatric physiotherapists and physiotherapy assistants based at the Sunflower Centre in Stourbridge. Therapy is offered for children with developmental delay, cerebral palsy, neurological disorders, musculoskeletal problems and developmental disorders, amongst other conditions. Treatment, advice and information is provided wherever it is most appropriate - in the therapy department, at home, in nurseries or schools. Haemoglobinopathies Services (for children and young people with blood disorders) o The haemoglobinopathy service works with children and young people who live in Dudley and who have been diagnosed with a haemoglobinopathy disorder such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia major o The team screens, counsels, supports and educates individuals with a haemoglobinopathy disease. Referrals can be made via the GP or directly to the team's haemoglobinopathies specialist nurse / counsellor. Children's Occupational Therapy o Occupational therapy staff work with children to develop their ability to carry out all daily activities, thereby promoting independence and quality of life. Occupational therapists see children between the ages of 0-18 years who have physical, sensory or perceptual difficulties, which affect their daily activities and occupations. This may include: Self-care Dressing Eating and drinking Toileting, bathing and personal hygiene Mobility and seating School and nursery activities Organisational skills Leisure, play sports and hobbiesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201811 Performance Report The service also provides individual and group therapy sessions using graded activities in a supportive environment, leading to improved skills, confidence and self-esteem. Information and advice on equipment or strategies to enable participation in daily activities include: Activity advice to be carried out at home or school Liaison with parents, teachers and other professionals Treatment approaches used include: Neurodevelopmental therapy Sensory integration Perceptual motor therapy Developmental approaches Skills training and cognitive approaches Asthma Nurse Specialist for children and young people o The paediatric asthma nurse educator works in partnership with professionals from health, education and social care to enhance care management and health/educational outcomes for children and young people with asthma, and will predominantly support professionals who work with patients who are at risk of developing, or who are diagnosed with asthma. The paediatric asthma nurse educator will organise, develop and deliver training and on-going educational advice and support to professionals who are involved in diagnosing, treating and managing patients with asthma conditions, who are registered with a Dudley General Practice. Pre-School Services: The Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) o The family nurse partnership is a voluntary home visiting programme for first time young mums, aged 19 or under (and dads or other family members, if mums want them to take part). Structured, individually tailored home visits are delivered by a specially trained family nurse who visits the young mum from early in the pregnancy until the child is two. The FNP programme aims to enable young mums to: have a healthy pregnancy improve their child's health and development plan their own futures and achieve their aspirations The FNP is a preventive programme which has the potential to transform the life chances of the most disadvantaged children and families, helping to improve social mobility and break the cycle of disadvantage. Health in pregnancy, and the quality of the caregiving babies receive during the first years of life, can have a long lasting impact on a child's future health, happiness, relationships and achievement of their aspirations. The family nurses deliver a tailored individual programme mostly in the home to first time mums under the age of 20 years with proven positive outcomes for parents and children. There is a central referral pathway from midwives, GPs and other health and education colleagues. However, self- referrals are also accepted. Health Visiting o Health visitors offer a universal service for all families with children aged 0 - 4 years. Their aim is to empower families to provide the best possible start in life for their children and offer health and wellbeing support and advice for the whole family, from pregnancy through to the child entering school in their reception year. Many health visitors have special interests and additional qualifications so can help with issues like smoking cessation, postnatal depression, behaviour management, sleep problems, baby massage, domestic violence and contraception.Performance Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201812 All new born babies are automatically referred to the health visiting service by the hospital at which they are born. However, referrals of new families into an area can also be made by a GP , hospital or maternity unit. As a minimum, new mums can expect to receive the following contact from the health visiting team: o from 28 weeks of pregnancy - in the antenatal period o within 14 days of a child being born o when baby is 6-8 weeks of age o when baby is 8 - 10 months of age o between 2 - 2\u00bd years of age Special Health Visiting The family inclusion service works with vulnerable families that have pre-school children, who are homeless or living in refuge accommodation, asylum seekers and refugees, or travellers. The team also leads the Care of the Next Infant (CONI) programme. The family inclusion service provides enhanced and intensive health interventions as part of the universal plus and partnership plus service offered across the Dudley borough. Staff aim to address the health needs of vulnerable children and families by improving access to health, social care and community services. Specialist health visitors assess need and manage care of vulnerable children and families through involvement of partner professionals and agencies, utilising the common assessment framework where appropriate. Anyone can refer into the service, including making referrals to the CONI programme. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) These services are for young people up to the age of 16 years, and those aged from 16-18 years in full-time education. Where possible, pre-school children (aged 0-4 years) are put in touch with health visitors and children's centres where they can receive appropriate support. Our staff work across Sandwell and Wolverhampton to reach children and young people who have severe mental health difficulties.Sandwell specialist CAMHS is for children and young people with complex mental health needs. The service also aims to support their families and carers. Specialist CAMHS also run the Sandwell deliberate self-harm service for children and young people who enter Sandwell District General Hospital's paediatric unit showing signs of deliberate self-harm. The Trust also employs CAMHS staff based in services outside the organisation. For example, there are mental health workers in Sandwell integrated support service, the youth offending team, looked after children and the Multi Agency Team Around the Child (MATAC). In Wolverhampton, the child and family service provides assessment, diagnosis and treatment to children and adolescents experiencing mental health difficulties. The Wolverhampton CAMHS crisis and home treatment team provide a more intensive service with the aim of treating child and adolescents with more severe illnesses in their homes. The key team provides a specialist CAMHS service to hard to reach children and young people and their families. The INSPIRE team, based at the Gem Centre, Wolverhampton, supports children and young people who have a learning disability, and their families. Early Intervention The Trust provides early intervention services in Sandwell and Wolverhampton for young people and adults who are going through a first episode of psychosis, or who seem at risk of going through a first episode of psychosis. The service provides diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Eating Disorders We have services in Sandwell and Wolverhampton for adults, and young people aged 16-18 who are in full time education, who are dealing with an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. The service offers a recovery programme to help people get better psychologically and physically. 1.4.4 Carers Services The Trust's carers team gives carers the chance to have their own caring, physical, and mental health needs considered. The team gives support to people, who must be Sandwell residents, caring for someone aged 18-65 years, living in or on the boundaries of Sandwell.The support comes in many forms including Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201813 Performance Report offering a daily drop-in service; various psycho- educational and training sessions for carers; care assessments and health screening for carers, and access to carers social events. During 2017/18 a Carers Team review took place with the new service specification they will now accept carers for patients with a learning disability and older adult presentation. The service will also now accept referrals from Primary Care. 1.4.5 Therapy Services We have a number of therapy services which play a key part in the care and support we provide to people. There are various counselling teams, a family therapy team, occupational therapists and psychologists working across the Trust, and speech and language therapists and physiotherapists working with older people and people who have learning disabilities. 1.4.6 Black County Liaison Diversion Service This service has been designed to improve the health and justice outcomes for adults and children who come into contact with the youth and criminal justice system. This service has three distinct arms: Outreach Team Custody Team Youth Pathway Team 1.5 Our performance in 2017/18 - Overview of the Chief Executive 1.5.1 Over the past two years, the strategic focus of the Trust was to ensure the sustainability of its services, which was anticipated last year to culminate in their acquisition as part of the Transforming Care Together Partnership. Certainly, at the beginning of 2017/18 it was very much anticipated that the acquisition would proceed as planned by 1st October 2017. An enormous amount of work was being undertaken in preparation for a safe transfer of services and I believe it is right to recognise the contribution of our staff in corporate departments for their contribution to that work programme during such a challenging period. 1.5.2 Against this background therefore I am delighted to be able to report on a highly satisfactory performance across the Trust.1.5.3 When the Board of Directors set its plan for 2017/18 it recognized that it would face severe financial pressures but resolved to retain its focus on the quality of services, which has remained a key priority, maintaining and building on the Care Quality Commission rating of \"good\" following its inspection in November 2016. 1.5.4 Very good progress has been made by our operating divisions in implementing their quality priorities for the year; the quality report in section three of this report provides a comprehensive account of our quality improvement agenda during 2017/18, and our plans for 2018/19. 1.5.5 Encouragingly, our financial performance for the year was \u00a30.3m better than planned, having ended with a deficit on our revenue account (before accounting for the impairment in asset values) of \u00a32.9m. 1.5.6 The Trust continued to deliver against its obligations in the provision of NHS services under contracts with our commissioners, though was unable to meet all its Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) targets and consequently fell about \u00a30.2m short in income. 1.5.7 The Trust also met all of its nationally mandated access and outcomes targets, including the target for reducing delayed transfers of care for inpatients an area which had proved difficult in the previous year. 1.5.8 Against the prospect of imminent change and uncertainty associated with the Transforming Care Together Partnership a much lower response to the annual staff survey was not unexpected but nonetheless disappointing, though overall there have been marginal changes to the highest and lowest ranking scores between years. 1.5.9 Unfortunately our sickness rate rose again during the year to 6.01% primarily due to increases in long term sickness for a number of staff. The Trust remains committed to support staff through illness and more significantly to promote good health in and outside the workplace.Performance Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201814 1.5.10 The Trust made excellent progress with key service developments and improvements during the year, including:- continued progress with the Transforming Care Programme (TCP) model of care for learning disability services; - the development of joint clinics with the Romany Gypsy community in Lye; and - the introduction of 'Baby Steps' post-natal group following recommendations from Health Visiting Research. 1.6 Risks going forward 1.6.1 The Board of Directors has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the overall system of internal control, and this is referred to in more detail within the annual governance statement in section two of this report. 1.6.2 In reviewing the position of the Trust following the demise of the Transforming Care Together Partnership, the Board of Directors has identified the following key risks which are to be managed during the coming financial year:- Financial and clinical sustainability: the Trust continues to operate with a financial deficit and has already received approval from the Regulator to access distressed funding facility of short term borrowing to maintain service provision, though further deterioration in the revenue position could impact on the quality of services; - Workforce; the results of the staff survey, soft intelligence from our staff generally and other workforce indicators has identified a multi-dimensional risk that will require us to refresh our approach to staff engagement, enhance our offer for recruitment and retention and promote the health and well-being of our workforce; - Reputation of Trust: there is a risk that the reputation and credibility of the Trust may be damaged following the demise of the Transforming Care Together Partnership and with it the Trust's then sustainability plan;- Changing environment: there is a risk that the ever changing health and social care environment could result in increased focus on the development of accounting care organisations which could compromise the sustainability of Trust services; and - Dudley MCP: linked to the changing environment the potential establishment of the Dudley MCP could result in loss of services and income in the short and medium term and result in non-Dudley commissioned services becoming unsustainable. 1.6.3 The most significant of these risks relate to the Trust's ongoing financial sustainability, which has been considered by the Board of Directors when determining whether the financial statements have been prepared on the 'going concern' basis. 1.7 Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.International Accounting Standards (IAS1) requires the Directors to assess, as part of the accounts preparation process, the Foundation Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. In accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual, paragraph 2.12, the financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis unless the Directors either intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the Foundation Trust without the transfer of the services to another entity, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Directors have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. The Directors have also considered the advice in the Government Reporting Manual that states: \"The anticipated continuation of the provision of a service in the future, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in published documents, is normally sufficient evidence of going concern\". After making enquiries, the Directors have concluded that there is sufficient evidence that services will continue to be provided and that there is financial provision within the forward plans of commissioners. Local Clinical Commissioning Groups and NHS England have Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201815 Performance Report recently all confirmed the status of 'commissioner regulated services' provided by the Trust for 2018/19 and signed contracts remain in place for such services. Directors will also rely on the assurance of continued support from NHS Improvement in the future. The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that service continuity will be the case and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis. The current economic environment for NHS organisations remains challenging with ongoing internal efficiency gains necessary due to annual tariff (price) reductions, cost pressures in respect of national pay structures, non-pay and drug cost inflation, and a national shortage of clinically trained staff. Following a detailed review of the Trust's financial sustainability during 2015 the Board of Directors developed a Sustainability Action Plan to address the local issues and ensure sustainability of the services provided. On 15th December 2015 the Trust confirmed its intention to enter into a Partnership arrangement with Birmingham Community Healthcare Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust, locally referred to as \"Transforming Care Together\" (TCT). In February 2018 the individual Boards concluded that the integration of the three trusts into one organisation under TCT was no longer a viable option. The key factors taken into account in reaching this decision were:- Strategic fit - recent NHS planning guidance for 2018/19 highlighted the strengthening role of Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) in developing models of care appropriate to their geographical footprints, and the TCT proposal would have operated across two (namely Birmingham & Solihull and the Black Country); Clinical concerns - discussions around how best to integrate the three Trusts' clinical areas raised a number of challenges for all three organisations; Financial - the financial plan for the integrated organisation could not meet the requirements that were set for the transaction. NHS Improvement has been supportive of the decision to cease the TCT partnership for the above reasons.The Board of Directors is currently reviewing the strategic options that are available to the Trust to ensure the continuation of services to local users and carers. As part of this process the Trust will reflect on the lessons learnt from TCT. However, the main aim of TCT was the integration of clinical services across the Black Country STP and whilst TCT as an organisational form will not now progress, this remains our key strategic objective and much valuable joint working with our partners will help to stabilise these services for the future. The Trust is continuing to work collaboratively with colleagues in Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Trust towards developing integrated Black Country Mental Health, Learning Disability and associated Community services. The Chief Executive Officers and the Chairmen of both Trusts met on the 10th April 2018, and our respective Executive Teams on 26th April, to continue discussions around establishing a common strategic approach and timescale. The Trust is further refreshing its stakeholder engagement strategy, post TCT, which will look to re-establish other partnerships which could strengthen existing services, and may identify further opportunities for strategic development in the future. In parallel to the collaborative working and stakeholder strategy development, the Trust will be focused upon the delivery of recovery plans for Mental Health. In addition, the Children's, Young People and Families Division will develop strategies to ensure resilience against the potential impact of the Dudley Multispecialty Community Provider (MCP) tendering process. The Learning Disabilities Division will work to implement the ambitious local Transforming Care Partnership (TCP) initiative. The review and analysis of service line management information will be key to ensure that there are service specifications in place for each service line, which is matched by income to cover the cost of delivery of that specification or a revised specification drawn up to reduce costs, in partnership with commissioners. At the same time the Trust will benchmark overhead costs and develop a plan to reduce overheads. The Trust has incurred a deficit before impairment of \u00a32.9m for the year ended 31st March 2018 - (2.9% of turnover). The deficit before impairment for 2016/17 was \u00a30.6m. The Directors consider that the outlook presents significant challenges in terms of cash-flow and the need to deliver significant efficiency savings in year.Performance Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201816 The Trust has prepared its financial plans and cash flow forecasts on the contractual income agreed with commissioners in signed contracts and forecast non-contract activity based on previous experience. In addition, the Trust has negotiated the provision of short term cash support from NHS Improvement. These are expected to be sufficient to enable the Trust to meets its obligations as they fall due in the short term. However, the Directors have identified that there are material uncertainties which casts doubt over whether the Trust can continue to exist in its current form, and to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, in the longer term. The Trust has continued to develop and maintain several cash management initiatives during the past year to provide early warning of any working capital risks. The Trust foresees a requirement for cash support during the year ending 31st March 2019 commencing during quarter 2. Preparatory discussions have taken place with NHS Improvement and the outcomes confirm that cash support will be made available. The significant risks facing the Trust are summarised as follows: The Trust has submitted a cash flow plan which shows a closing position at 31st March 2019 of \u00a31.3m - incorporating \u00a32.1m of funding drawn down from NHS Improvement in quarter 2. There is uncertainty over whether the Trust will achieve its efficiency savings of \u00a34.2m which have been incorporated into its financial plan. This level of savings is challenging and must be supported with adequate operational engagement to deliver against agreed detailed plans. As of April 2018 schemes totalling \u00a31.4m (33%) of the total target have been identified - \u00a30.8m (60%) recurrently. There is a reasonable expectation that normal staff turnover will yield further savings of \u00a32m; The cessation of the Transforming Care Together strategic partnership has resulted in the Trust needing time to be able to reform its identity as BCPFT and develop a new sustainability plan for the future. The Dudley MCP procurement process (impact in 2019/20) is still ongoing with the Trust requesting to be a sub-contractor. Currently the Trust is awaiting completion of the procurement process and confirmation of sub-contractor status. The Trust has entered into negotiation with the Local Government Pension Scheme regarding the forced withdrawal from that scheme of a small number of Trust employees in 2018/19. The Trust could be liable to meet a share of the Fund' deficit if such a transfer progresses. There are thus material uncertainties which may cast doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern in the longer term, when it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required if the going concern basis were not appropriate. The following factors could potentially impact the Trust's performance and position: 1. Increasing demand for mental health, learning disabilities and universal children's services for which the Trust is not remunerated; 2. Commissioners' ability to pay for increasing demand for services; 3. Unplanned capital investment required to maintain the Trust's estate and infrastructure; 4. Ability to attract and retain highly skilled staff. 5. Development of the Dudley Multispecialty Community Provide Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201817 Performance Report 2 Our performance in detail 2.1.1 The quality report in section 3 provides a wealth of information about the range of quality improvement initiatives and associated work programmes across the Trust. 2.2.1 The Trust is also obliged to meet certain targets relating to nationally agreed standards for access to services and outcome of service delivery. As illustrated in the table below the Trust achieved all its mandated targets. Target Threshold 2017/18 Incomplete Pathways- % Patients waiting less than 18 weeks for consultant led services92% 97.8% Improving Access to Psychological Therapies - % of patients treated within 6 weeks75% 94.1% Improving Access to Psychological Therapies - % of patients treated within 18 weeks95% 99.6% Early Intervention - % of patients treated with a NICE approved care package within 2 weeks50% 75.0% Care Programme Approach (CPA)- 7-day follow-up 95% Approach (CPA)- 12 month formal review 95% 98.2% Assessment by Crisis Team prior to hospital admission 95% 99.5% Delayed Transfers of 91.0% 2.2.2 Performance against the measures in the table and other measures relating to both the quality of services (as referred to in the quality report in section 3), the workforce (as referred to in the staff report at section 2), the financial performance (as reflected in the financial statements in section 6) is reported to and monitored by the Board of Directors at each of its meetings. Relevant performance measures are also referred to within the Board Assurance Framework as forms of assurance of controls or mitigation of key strategic risks. 2.2.3 The Trust does not own or have any interest in any trading subsidiary or overseas operation. 2.3.1 The results of this year's annual staff satisfaction survey showed little movement between years in the highest and lowest ranking scores. Though the overall response rate of 34%, whilst not wholly unexpected given the uncertainty surrounding the Transforming Care Together Partnership was disappointing and served as a timely reminder of the need to engage more closely with our staff. 2.3.2 We have continued to make improvements in our efforts to recruit, retain and develop our staff, though recognise that challenges exist across all areas and closely monitor key indicators relating to our workforce, including safe staffing levels. Our sickness absence rate at 6.01% remains higher than we would like, mainly due to increased long term sickness, but we remain committed to both the promotion of good health and the support of our staff through episodes of ill health as outlined in our Staff Health and Well-Being Strategy.Performance Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201818 2.4.1 The following table is a summary of the financial position for 2017/18: Plan \u00a3mActual \u00a3mVariance \u00a3m Operating Expenses (98.9) (97.8) 1.1 EBITDA 0.4 1.8 1.4 Depreciation (1.8) (2.8) (1.0) Non-Operating Expenditure (1.8) (1.8) 0.0 Net Deficit (excluding impairment of assets) (3.2) (2.8) 0.4 2.4.2 The deficit of \u00a32,834k is stated before a net impairment of assets of \u00a340k, resulting in a technical deficit of \u00a32,874k in the Trust Accounts. The net deficit reported is favourable to plan and is largely due to the settlement of the Oracle license dispute resulting in \u00a3586k non cash benefit to the financial position. 2.4.3 Excluding the impairment of assets, the difference to the planned deficit for 2017/18 was \u00a3344k. The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the year was \u00a31,797k (1.8%), which was \u00a31,407k favourable to plan. This improved performance was primarily caused by; operating income favourable to plan by \u00a3358k due to income received for clinical activities, operating expenditure favourable to plan by \u00a31,049k resulting from the Oracle License dispute benefit (\u00a3586k), impairment of receivables benefit (\u00a3730k) and operational non pay reductions (\u00a3190k) offset by a net pay overspend (\u00a3457k). Depreciation was above plan due to 2016/17 valuation saving assumptions included within the annual plan being greater than the actual depreciation saving realised, and the identification of a number of assets on the fixed asset register not depreciating. In order to bring the assets net book value in line with their useful economic lives, an accounting adjustment was made, and assets under construction were reclassified to being in use with depreciation backdated to the date of purchase. Non-operating expenditure was in line with plan. 2.4.4 During 2017/18 the Trust received 97% of its planned income for NHS commissioned services. Other operating income amounted to \u00a32,940k and includes education and training (\u00a31,969k), research and development (\u00a3112k), national vanguard (MERIT) funding (\u00a3154k), Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs national insurance refund (\u00a3153k), and canteen provision (\u00a3157k). 2.4.5 Overall, Income received was \u00a3358k higher than plan, due to funding received for in-patient observations (\u00a3700k), Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) (\u00a3236k), winter pressures monies (\u00a3100k), staff recharges (\u00a3128k) and service developments (\u00a31,111k) offsetting the lower than planned bed occupancy levels (\u00a32,307k) within our Learning Disabilities and Mental Health in-patient units. 2.4.6 Further, overall income received was \u00a31,759k lower than the previous financial year, due to a \u00a31,151k reduction in revenue as a result of STF funding being non-recurrent in 2016/17 and \u00a3608k relating to clinical activities.

Observation income received from commissioners and pay budget underspends only partially offset the costs of temporary staff engaged. Meanwhile, non-pay costs were \u00a31,506k favorable against plan due to \u00a3508k of benefits arising from favorable contract reductions and a \u00a3998k net favorable movement against reserves in the year. Included within this sum is the settlement of the Oracle License dispute. 2.4.9 A desktop property revaluation was completed at year end resulting in a net impairment charge of \u00a340k and a \u00a32.0m revaluation gain in the revaluation reserve. In total, the Trust's property revaluation has increased land and buildings value by \u00a32.0m (4.0%) 2.4.10 The cash flow summary for 2017/18 is in the table below: Plan \u00a3mActual \u00a3mVariance \u00a3m EBITDA 0.4 1.8 1.3 Net movement in Current Receivables 0.1 1.3 1.2 Net movement in Current Payables 0.6 (2.1) (2.7) Net cash inflow/(outflow) from operating activities 1.1 1.0 (0.1) Capital expenditure (2.0) (1.4) 0.6 Net cash inflow/(outflow) before financing (0.9) (0.4) 0.5 PDC dividends (paid) (1.3) (1.2) 0.1 Funding received 1.0 0.0 (1.0) Capital payment of PFI (0.2) (0.3) (0.1) Interest payment (0.5) (0.5) 0.0 Net cash inflow/(outflow) (1.9) (2.4) (0.5) Period Start Cash 2.1 4.2 2.1 Period End Cash 0.2 1.8 1.6 2.4.11 The higher than anticipated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), accompanied by a decrease in capital payments and a net cash outflow from working capital led to a cash outflow in the period.

At 31st March 2016, the Trust generated 4,497 tonnes of carbon emissions, and the target within the plan was to reduce this by 8% by 2018 in line with the national target of a reduction of 28% over a seven year period. 2.5.2 The main source of its carbon emissions is through energy (i.e. gas and electricity) consumption at 85%, and many of the actions within the plan, including good housekeeping practices are aligned to reduction in such consumption. 2.6.1 A key condition of the Trust's operating licence is that it remains compliant with all relevant legislation, including the Bribery Act 2010, and the Trust's governance arrangements (as described in the Annual Governance Statement in section 2 of the report) are established with this in mind. Assurance of compliance is obtained from a range of sources, including the Care Quality Commission, the Information Commissioner, the Trust Auditor and the Trust's Internal Auditor. 2.7.1 The Trust made excellent progress with key service developments and improvements during the year, including:- the development of a new service specification for Sandwell Carers Service following a review in 17/18; - a relaunch of the Recovery College; - continued progress with the Transforming Care Programme (TCP) model of care for learning disability services; - the development of joint clinics with the Romany Gypsy community in Lye; - the introduction of 'Baby Steps' post-natal group following recommendations from Health Visiting Research; and - the launch of an accessible CAMHS website and the 'Participant Council' 3.

As is mentioned elsewhere in the report it was anticipated that the services of the Trust would be acquired during 2017/18 and the Trust then dissolved. In light of this and in acknowledgement of the outcome of the Care Quality Commission inspection of November 2016 which assessed services as \"good\" across the \"Well Led\" domain, it was determined that no assessment of the Board's effectiveness was necessary. However, plans are in place to undertake a review using the Well Led Assessment Framework in the first part of the new financial year. 1.2.4.2 In May 2017, the Board of Directors confirmed its ongoing compliance with specific licence conditions relating to corporate governance and continuity of service provision and confirms there are no material inconsistencies between its certification and other disclosures. 1.2.5 Profiles of members of the Board of Directors in office at 31st March 2018 Andrew Fry: Chair Andrew joined the Trust in July 2014 as an Associate and commenced as a NED in June 2015.

A full register of Directors' interests is published on the Trust's website, www.bcpft.nhs.uk, or may be obtained on application to the Company Secretary. 2. Quality Governance arrangements 2.1 2.1 The quality report in section three of this report gives a comprehensive account of the work undertaken during the year to improve the quality of service provision across the Trust. 2.2 The Medical Director and Executive Director of Nursing, AHP's and Governance have provided executive leadership of the quality governance arrangements within the Trust.2.3 The Quality and Safety Steering Group brings together executives and operational clinical leaders to ensure robust oversight of the delivery and development of quality improvement plans across the Trust, and each operating division has its own sub group of clinical leaders to manage and deliver their respective quality improvement agenda. 2.4 The involvement of our service commissioners in quality improvement is significant and regular \"contract review meetings\" are held between our senior clinical leaders and commissioners to review delivery of services. 2.5 In 2017/18, the Trust agreed a number of \"CQUIN\" (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) targets, some of which were nationally mandated, with service commissioners, the value of which amounted to approximately \u00a32.0m. Unfortunately the Trust was unable to achieve all its targets, only partially achieving those related to staff health and well-being initiatives, improvements to physical healthcare for patients with serious mental illness, and initiatives to prevent ill health caused by alcohol and tobacco, resulting in a shortfall of income of \u00a30.2m. 2.6 Improving the patient experience remains a priority for the Trust. In the national Friends and Family Tests during the year Trust again received encouraging responses from over 1700 people, where 95% of were likely to recommend mental health services, 84% were happy with the care in learning disabilities services; and 96% would recommend children's services to their friends and family. 2.7 The Trust received 102 formal complaints in the year, compared with 116 in the previous year. Four complaints were referred to the Parliamentary Health Services Ombudsman during the year, one of which was withdrawn by the complainant, one which was closed with no further action and two which remain under investigation.Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201828 3. Stakeholder relations 3.1 Developing partnerships, and engaging with our stakeholders is critical to ensuring that our services are designed, developed and delivered in the best interest of our local communities - to deliver the right care, at the right time, in the right place, by the right people long into the future. In the short time since the decision was taken not to pursue our partnership through Transforming Care Together (TCT) we have reviewed our stakeholder relationships. Initially we have ensured there is strong engagement with key health and care partners across the Black Country, and as we move forward we will more proactively engage with a wider range of stakeholders keeping everyone regularly informed and offering opportunities to work more closely with us. Key programmes that we are committed partners in include, but are not limited to: Healthwatch - we are meeting jointly with Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Walsall and Dudley Healthwatch to listen, and work with our partners to ensure that their voice is heard in how we manage and develop our services going forward. We are expanding this to include Dudley & Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (DWMH) to ensure there is joined up thinking and planning across the Black Country. Our intention is to develop a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure that our discussions lead to meaningful involvement; Black Country Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) - we are working with our health and care partners across the Black Country to develop a system approach to deliver clinically and financially sustainable services for our communities, which addresses three key themes - Better Care, Better Value and Better Outcomes. Through a shared vision we will address unwarranted variations and make the best use of resources to work as a system to deliver the best care for the population. There is a well-developed mental health and learning disabilities work-stream which builds on the strong partnership built up between us and DWMH to enhance services for our communities; Mental Health Excellence, Resilience, Innovation and Training (MERIT) - the new model of care (Vanguard) programme formally closed on 31st March 2018, however, the partners have committed to continue to work together to enhance mental health service across the West Midlands. This will give us an opportunity to learn from each other and develop partnership responses where appropriate. During the last two year programme we have improved IT, records, bed management systems, and training; Transforming Care Programme (TCP) - partnership with all Black Country NHS and Local Authority commissioners and NHS England to reduce NHS Learning Disability inpatient bed numbers, which has enabled us to develop a stronger community offering supported by specialist bed provision where appropriate; Dudley Multi Specialty Community (MCP) or All Together Better - another new model of care vanguard programme between local NHS and care organisations, GP's and the voluntary sector in Dudley that seeks to improve health and wellbeing for local people through more closely linked health and care services, based around GP practices, allowing easier access to care that is consistent and better coordinated; and Wolverhampton Integrated Care Alliance (ICA) - has been developed through collaborative work with all health and care partners in Wolverhampton with a shared vision to work together for the population of Wolverhampton to live well longer. GPs are fully engaged with this programme, and we are working as partners with the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals (RWT) NHS Trust, Wolverhampton CCG, City of Wolverhampton council, and the Health & Wellbeing Board wider stakeholders.Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201829 4.

Private Finance Initiative The Trust's Hallam Hospital, used for Adult Mental Health and Learning Disability Services, is a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) development. The unit was opened in February 2000, as the first PFI in the West Midlands. Since 2012/13, the PFI has been classified as on-balance sheet in the Trust Accounts.Within the PFI Project Agreement, Ryhurst Ltd, the project company provides hard facilities management services to the Trust.

Audit arrangements The external Auditor to the Trust is Deloitte LLP , 4 Brindley Place, Birmingham, B1 2HZ. The Auditor was appointed by the Assembly of Governors in September 2012 following a competitive tendering exercise. Tenure for the appointment was for an initial term of three, extendable to five years years. As part of the governance arrangements surrounding the Transforming Care Together Plan, and in anticipation of a then imminent dissolution of the Trust, the Assembly of Governors approved that the Auditor be appointed for a further one year term to September 2018. Remuneration of the Auditor for 2017/18 was \u00a353,500 (excluding VAT). Additional work relating to the Trust's annual quality report was conducted at a cost of \u00a310,000 (excluding VAT). Where the Trust's Auditor provides non-audit services, these would be considered on a case by Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201830 case basis, by the Board of Directors to ensure the Auditor's independence would not be compromised. Such appointments are reported to the Audit Committee which receives reports on the outcomes of the work, and generally involve a different team to ensure independence. 8. Risk in use of financial instruments There are no significant risks identified in the use of financial instruments. 9. Statement as to disclosure to Auditor As far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware, and the Directors have taken all of the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Auditor is aware of that information. 10.

Annual Statement on Remuneration 2.1.1 In 2013, the then remuneration committee agreed the policy for the remuneration of executive and other very senior management, and in particular to use benchmarking information to inform its decisions. 2.1.2 No changes were made to the policy during the 2017/18 year. 2.1.3 The policy was referred to when determining the remuneration of the interim Chief Executive Officer and in reviewing the remuneration of other executive and very senior managers for 2018/19. 2.1.4 No changes were made to the remuneration of the clinical directors. 2.2.1 Non-executives also are remunerated on a per session basis for each panel hearing they attend in the course of their duties as hospital managers under the Mental Health Act 1983; the rate of remuneration remained the same during the year. 3. Senior Managers Remuneration Policy 3.1 The tables overleaf provide details of both the remuneration and pension benefits of the board members and other very senior managers, 3.2.1 The remuneration policy for executive directors provides that remuneration could include basic salary, performance related pay and other benefits. 3.2.2 The policy has at its core the main principle within the Code of Governance for NHS Foundation Trusts (Monitor, 2014) which states that: \"Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the NHS Foundation Trust successfully, but the NHS Foundation Trust should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose\".3.2.3 The remuneration committee has not introduced performance related pay for any position that falls under its remit. 3.2.4 Other benefits within the policy may include reimbursement of travelling and subsistence expenses incurred whilst on duty, the provision of a mobile telephone and the provision of a vehicle for undertaking business travel (where the cost of private usage is paid for by the individual). No changes have been made to this policy. 3.2.5 Whilst benchmarking data is used to determine levels of remuneration, the remuneration committee also considers agreements relating to the pay and conditions of the Trust workforce and wider NHS and public sector in determining the final remuneration. 3.2.6 The benchmarking data referred to in 3.2.5 above is provided via the annual survey of board member remuneration conducted by the \"NHS Providers\" organisation. 3.3.1 The remuneration of non-executive directors, including the chair and associate non-executive directors is agreed by the Assembly of Governors. 3.4 In all cases compensation for loss of office is made in accordance with the terms and conditions of either the contracts of employment for the executive directors and other very senior management positions or the service contracts of the chair, non-executive and associate non-executive director positions. 4. Other disclosures 4.1 The Board of Directors confirms that no executive director held other non-executive directorships within other bodies during 2017/18. Had this been the case then the remuneration policy provides that: \"it will be for the remuneration committee to determine whether or not that individual will retain the associated remuneration and whether or not there will be any amendment to the substantial remuneration of the individual concerned.\"Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201833 4.2 One of the board members or other senior management in office during 2017/18 were remunerated \"off payroll\" as outlined below. 4.3 Pension benefits apply to executive directors and other very senior management only; non-executive directors are not employees and are not therefore entitled to pension benefits.

This is 4.02 times the median remuneration of the workforce, which is \u00a324,848 (2016-17: 4.62 times the median remuneration of the workforce, which is \u00a324,441). There were 24 employees that received remuneration in excess of the highest-paid director in the range of \u00a3100-195k (2016-17: 17 employees banded as \u00a3115-185k).

In addition work continues with regards to supporting opportunities for development through leadership and education programmes. The Trust has key policies in place in respect of the above, and others including local security management and counter fraud, both which are reviewed by the Internal Auditor.

Source: Electronic Staff Records (HC = Headcount) Recruitment During 2017/18, the Trust has experienced an increase in the overall vacancy rate. This is due to a rise in our turnover rate, although this does remain below our key performance indicator and adjustments to our establishments. This increase does reflect the on-going recruitment and retention challenges that the NHS as a whole is facing, in particular within specialist services as provided by the Trust. In response to the challenges faced during this period the Trust has taken a targeted and focused approach to reduce vacancies and reduce agency costs including working with NHS Improvement to develop a targeted retention plan for our registered nursing workforce. During 2017/18 we have also begun to work with local partner Trusts and medical colleagues to consider international recruitment overseas and will be an area further explored and developed during 2018/19.Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201840 The Trust has also continued to improve by streamlining processes within the overall recruitment service and is now reporting below the Trusts internal key performance indicator for 'Time to Hire'. The Trust is actively pursuing a range of recruitment and retention initiatives including a targeted incentive package for newly qualified nurses. The Trust actively promotes and undertakes national recruitment campaigns, job fairs and career fairs within our local community proactively working with local education providers. Equality and Diversity The Trust serves an ethnically diverse area made up of people from many different cultures, communities and backgrounds. During 2017/18 the Equality and Inclusion Board continued to focus on ensuring that the Trust has a diverse workforce, representative of the population it serves, with a number of key programmes, including the Workforce Race Equality Standard and the new Workforce Disability Equality Standard, to support inclusion at all levels within the organisation. Over 27% of our staff are from a Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) background, which compares favourably with the BME population of 26% (based on the 2011 Census) across the four Boroughs of the Black Country. We aim to encourage applicants from the widest range of backgrounds to come and work for us, and to ensure our employment policies promote the equitable treatment of candidates and staff, irrespective of their background. The Trust continues to use the Guaranteed Interview Scheme for applicants with disabilities, is signed up to the national government Disability Confident Scheme and engages specialist advice in the design and implementation of adaptations to the working environment for staff with disabilities including learning disabilities. Retention, Health and Wellbeing Whilst it is recognised that some turnover of staff supports is necessary for a healthy organisation, as part of our focus during 2017/18 the Trust has strengthened how it monitors turnover and retention in order to explore the reasons that staff leave and to fully understand any trends or issues linked to turnover including health and wellbeing.Whilst turnover remains within our key performance indicators during the latter part of 2017/18 the Trust committed to a programme led by NHS Improvement with a specific remit for improving the staff retention of our Registered Nursing workforce. The retention plan over the coming 12 months will focus on three drivers; Continual Professional Development; Staff feeling valued and supporting the reduction of violence and aggression. In addition targeted work has continued to develop closer links with our local education providers and universities. Following its launch The Health and Wellbeing Strategy continues to be embedded through different approaches, ways of working and access to staff benefits. The Health and Wellbeing Committee throughout 2017/18 have found innovative approaches to health and wellbeing - using lifestyle assessments for staff to help maintain their resilience at work and improve their overall mental and physical wellbeing. A number of targeted campaigns such as 'cycle schemes' have taken place as well as providing a signpost to free and local fitness and wellbeing classes external to the Trust to enable staff choices on improving their health and wellbeing. In addition all our staff have access to a comprehensive occupational health service and staff support service. Our sickness rate for the year was 6.01% against the intended target of 4.5%. Whilst we have not achieved the target, the Workforce team continue to work proactively with Divisions to reduce with targeted support in areas where we have higher absence rates. Workforce reporting has been further strengthened during 2017/18 and forms an integral part of the Trusts performance management enabling triangulation of quality, safety and workforce indicators. In addition the Trust has implemented the Electronic Staff Record Management Self Service which enables improved 'real time' reporting and auditing. Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201841 A breakdown of the sickness absence across the last three years up to 31st March 2018 is included in the table below.

The L&D deliverables for compliance on training is aligned to the wider workforce strategy, HR development including new models of care and the overall business and performance support to our Divisions. New training management systems have been introduced to improve recording and reporting for mandatory and specialist training including the Mental Health Act and Safeguarding. Opportunities for training include face to face and eLearning introduced in January 2017. Learning and Development has improved outcomes on aligning BCPFT training to the National Core Skills Framework and contributed to Career Pathways including TCT Nursing Associate Programme. Future developments will be focused on strengths of working in partnership and sustainable ways of training and developing staff across the organisation. Staff Engagement The Trust has a long standing commitment to working and involving staff, and has continued to develop good relations with staff and their representatives at all levels. This has been delivered through a range of staff engagement events, especially those related to the Transforming Care Together Partnership, and various communication media, as well as the formal consultation framework through the Staff Forum and Medical Local Negotiating Committee. The Staff Side Leads work in partnership with the Trust to support all agendas affecting staff with the overarching aim of improving the staff experience. Phil Cole, our Staff Side Chair says: \"The joint trade unions have continued to actively represent our workforce throughout the year. We have different unions working together for different groups of people. Some can choose which union they join, for others professional bodies are affiliated to particular unions. All unions within BCPFT have reps who volunteer within the workplace. We are always looking for more people who have an interest in learning more and taking a more active role within the UNIONS. They support, represent, negotiate and influence at a Local and National level.\"Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201842 Table 3a: Staff Survey Response Trusts Top Five Ranking Scores 2016 2017Trust Improvement/ deterioration Top 5 Ranking Scores Trust TrustNational Average KF11.

BCPFT is provided national average with a benchmark result comparing us to 28 other similar Trusts in the Mental Health / Learning Disabilities and Community Trust Sector. The NHS Staff Survey offers the opportunity to understand the views of our staff and their experiences of working for the Trust. Obtaining feedback from staff and taking account of their views and priorities is vital for driving real service improvements in the NHS. During 2017, the Trust undertook a full census of staff using a mix mode methodology of 80% electronic and 20% paper copies provided to staff within Learning Disabilities and Estates and Facilities. The overall return from BCPFT was 34% showing a decrease compared to 40% from the previous year; the national average response rate within our sector was 45%. Tables 3a - 3d outline survey response rates, the Trust's top five and bottom five ranking scores and the Trust's largest local changes since the 2016 survey. All key findings within the staff survey results are rated and comparisons made with both the previous year's results and the national average for other combined mental health/ learning disability and community trusts. Interestingly most results had little difference to 2016 results with 2 bottom scores and 4 top scores remaining the same as 2016.Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201843 Table 3c: Trust's Bottom Five Ranking Scores 2016 2017Trust Improvement/ deterioration Bottom 5 Ranking Scores Trust TrustNational Average KF15 Percentage satisfied with the opportunities for flexible working patterns52% 52% 58% No Change KF14 Staff support3.28 3.24 3.33 0.04 deterioration KF30 Fairness and effectiveness of procedures for reporting errors, near misses and incidents3.60 3.57 3.77 0.03 deterioration KF32 Effective use of patient /service user feedback3.52 3.45 3.69 0.08 deterioration KF18 Percentage of staff attending work in the last 3 months despite feeling unwell because of the pressure from their manager, colleagues or themselves55% 58% 53% 3% deterioration Overall the Key findings of the bottom ranking 5 scores the Trust have shown deterioration with a lower score than the national average.

This is below the national average of 3.79 for combined mental health, learning disability and community trusts. This overall indicator has been calculated using the key findings related to the following aspects of staff engagement: KF1. Staff recommendation of the Trust as a place to work or receive treatment; KF4. staff motivation at work; and KF7. staff ability to contribute towards improvements at work. Interestingly the indicators relating to Workforce Race Equality (WRES) have significantly shifted in the Trust result, suggesting that \"white\" staff now experience discrimination in career progression. KF21 and Q17b identify white staff reporting lower results which in comparison to 2016 have 'tipped' the results rather than closed the gap. Key priorities and plans going forward The essence of our plan is to take a holistic view to improving the overall staff experience by making staff experience a part of our daily business and aligning it into other strategic plans and objectives. Rather than responding to individual survey questions, the plan is themed and has actions in the following five categories; your job; your manager; your health and wellbeing; your personal development; and your organisation. There are organisational wide actions designed to increase the outcome in each of these areas and operating divisions add to it with their own local context to ensure we are addressing what's important to the staff in their environment. Additionally the plan specifically looks at those areas ranked bottom by implementing an immediate \"you said we did\" campaign focussing on non-mandatory development, flexible working and the process and fairness or errors and incidents. Likewise the plan also focusses on positive and improved scores to enhance and share the processes and practices of these. Equality indicators will be intrinsic to the survey plan and also as part of the Equality and Inclusion Board (EIB), WRES action group and internal Workforce Committee. Freedom to Speak Up The Trust supports all staff in raising concerns at work at the earliest reasonable opportunity about safety, malpractice, wrongdoing at work or where quality or standards of care have diminished or have reached a level that would cause major concern. There is a publicly available document called Raising Concerns at Work (Whistleblowing) Policy which outlines the Trust approach. In line with the policy the Trust has a Freedom to Speak Up Guardian supported by five local Freedom to Speak up Champions who will all be working to support and encourage people to raise concerns in order to address issues and support future service improvement.Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201845 Trades Union representation The following information is provided in accordance with recently introduced legislation Table 4a: Relevant union officials Number of employees who were relevant union officials during the relevant periodFull-time equivalent employee number 10 2.27 FTE Table 4b: Percentage of time spent on facility time Percentage of working hours spent on facility time Number of employees 0% 1 1-50% 7 51%-99% 1 100% 1 Table 4c: Percentage of pay bill spent on facility time Values Provide the total cost of facility time \u00a3114,650 Provide the total pay bill \u00a382,285,000 Provide the percentage of the total pay bill spent on facility time, calculated as: (total cost of facility time \u00f7 total pay bill) x 100 0.14% Table 4d: Paid trade union activities Values Time spent on paid trade union activities as a percentage of total paid facility time hours calculated as: (total hours spent on paid trade union activities by relevant union officials during the relevant period \u00f7 total paid facility time hours) x 100 100%Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201846 D: Corporate Governance 1. Membership 1.1 Eligibility The Trust has two constituencies of membership, public and staff. Our public constituency includes service users and carers and is drawn from the Black Country areas of Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley, and Birmingham, and other areas that fell under the responsibility of the former West Midlands Strategic Health Authority. Our constitution dictates that the minimum age for becoming a member of the Trust is 12 years old. All staff who are employed by or seconded to the Trust for at least twelve months automatically become members of the Trust, unless they choose to opt out. 1.2 Membership profile The tables below provide analyses of our membership at 31st March 2018. Membership by Constituency and area at 31st March 2018 PUBLIC STAFF Area Number Class Number Sandwell 2676 Generic 1843 Wolverhampton 985 Walsall Wider West Midlands 943 TOTAL: 5920 TOTAL: 1843 Public Membership by gender, age and ethnicity at 31st March 2018 Analysis Number % Gender Male 2240 37.8 Female 3651 61.7 Not stated 29 0.5 Age12-16 6 0.1 17-21 131 2.2 22 and over 5466 92.3 Not stated 317 5.4 EthnicityWhite 3952 66.8 Mixed 197 3.3 Black 791 13.4 Asian 521 8.8 Other 93 1.6 Not stated 366 6.2Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201847 1.3 Representative membership When comparing with the relevant demographic data within the 2011 Census, there remains under representation in white people and the male population, but most significantly within the age range of 12 to 16 year olds. 1.4 Movements in membership The changes in membership within the year are provided in the table below: Public Staff Total At 31st March 2017 5,970 1,815 7,785 Add Members joining 93 130 223 Less Members leaving 143 102 245 At 31st March 2018 5,920 1,843 7,763 1.5 Engagement with membership During 2017/2018 the majority of our engagement with our public membership was focused around our planned Transforming Care Together (TCT) partnership. A number of general drop-ins were held in service and public locations, along with general stakeholder events themed around: mental health; learning disability; and children, young people and families' services. The drop-ins were attended by: staff; service users and carers; trust members; and members of the public. The themed stakeholder events were attended by these and also: commissioners; local councillors; partner organisations; and governors. These events asked participants to contribute in mixed groups so there was good conversation around how we could develop our services for the benefit of our patients and local community. A dedicated TCT website (www.transformingcaretogether.org) and newsletter enabled us to jointly engage with members, stakeholders and the public about the proposals. During this time, we took the decision to pause the Membership Strategy Steering Group (MSSG), whose membership is primarily the Governors, to focus on TCT engagement and because a new membership strategy would be developed with our TCT partners. The annual member event and Annual General Meeting took place in September 2017 at the Copthorne Hotel in Dudley. The member event was supported by a number of service areas within the Trust, external partners and Governors. It was held alongside the annual staff awards which helped to increase staff participation. The Trust has now taken the decision not to continue with the TCT partnership. Therefore, the focus for 2018/2019 will be to review our membership strategy and plans, and increase engagement with members as Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. We have developed a partnership and network meeting with our local Healthwatch organisations, and this will help us to work with our local partners to develop our membership and public engagement. The Trust website (www.bcpft.nhs.uk) contains details of how members can contact their constituent governors.Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201848 2.

The Assembly did not exercise its power to require one or more directors to attend a meeting for the purpose of obtaining information about the performance of the Trust or the directors' performance of their duties. The Chair of the Trust continues to lead the Assembly of Governors and ensures a sound and open working relationship is maintained between the Assembly and the Board of Directors.Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201852 The Senior Independent (Non-Executive) Director also attends meetings of the Assembly and its sub committees and groups and is accessible to Governors should they need to obtain his advice. Any disputes that may arise between the Assembly of Governors and the Board of Directors will be addressed in accordance with the Constitution of the Trust; no disputes arose during the financial year. Governors used an online survey tool \"Governor Gauge\" developed by the Trust but managed independently to assess the ongoing skills and knowledge needs of governors. Outputs from the survey were reviewed by the Assembly of Governors at its meeting in May 2017. 3. The Chair The Chair leads the Board of Directors and ensures it effectively fulfils its primary duties. The Board of Directors confirms that both Jo Newton, the Chair until 30th November 2017, and Andrew Fry, the Interim Chair from 1st March 2018 remained independent in character and judgment throughout the year and had no interests which might impair their judgment. The Board of Directors recognised and approved the situational conflict that presented with the appointment of Mr Tom Storrow as interim Chair for the period 1st December 2017 to 28th February 2018. Each appointed Chair declared their full interests which were managed in accordance with the Constitution of the Trust. 4.

He was succeeded by David Stenson. The role of the Senior Independent Director is undertaken by Mrs Kathy McAteer Non-Executive Director.5. Role and Independence of Non-Executive Directors In addition to their role as board members, Non-Executive Directors also undertake the duties of Hospital Managers in accordance with the Mental Health Act 1983. They are assisted in these specific duties by duly appointed Associate Hospital Managers. The Board of Directors considers that all its Non-Executive Directors and the Associate Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgment and have no relationships which may affect their judgment. 6. Evaluation of the Performance of the Board Sub Committees The Audit, Finance and Investment and Quality and Safety Committees undertook separate internal evaluations of their effectiveness, again using member self-assessment questionnaires. Analysis of the feedback was reported to each committee which in each case reflected a high degree of satisfaction in the effectiveness of the committees and no significant improvements were required. The Chair and Non-Executive Directors have annual appraisals in accordance with the process approved by the Assembly of Governors. The appraisals of the Non-Executive and Associate Non-Executives are conducted by the Chair, and the appraisal of the Chair by the Senior Independent Director. The outcomes of the appraisals are reported to the Assembly of Governors. Executive and board level directors are appraised annually by the Chief Executive Officer, and these are reported to the Non-Executive led Appointments and Remuneration Committee. 7.

The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201856 E: Regulatory matters 1. NHS Improvement: Single Oversight Framework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvement capability (well-led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. Segmentation At the time of preparing this report the Trust was placed in in segment 2. This segmentation information is the Trust's position as at 4th May 2018. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Finance score The finance score theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance score is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here. Area Weighting 2017/18 Q4 Score Capital Service Capacity 20% 4 Liquidity (days) 20% 4 I&E Margin 20% 4 I&E Margin distance from Plan 20% 1 Agency Spend - Distance from Cap 20% 2 Average Rating 100% 3 Overriding rules applied - Yes Overriding Risk Score 3 Is the Trust in Special Measures - No Revised Overriding Risk Score - 3 The overall finance score is a mean average of the scores on five individual metrics, however a score can have overriding rules applied to it if the following scenarios occur: if a provider scores 4 on any individual finance metric, their overall finance score is at least a 3 triggering a potential support need; if a provider has not agreed a control total: where they are planning a deficit their finance score will be at least 3 (i.e. it will be 3 or 4), where they are planning a surplus their finance score will be at least 2 (i.e. it will be 2, 3 or 4). 2. Care Quality Commission The Care Quality Commission undertook an inspection of Trust services in November 2016 and published its report in February 2017. The overall rating provided for Trust services was \"good\", with community based mental health services for older people deemed as \"outstanding\". The Care Quality Commission has not taken any enforcement action against the Trust during the year.Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201857 F: Statement of Accounting Officers Responsibilities Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the Accounting Officer of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust The NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the Accounting Officer of the NHS Foundation Trust. The relevant responsibilities of the Accounting Officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the affairs of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: Observe the Accounts Directions issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis; Make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis; State whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements; Ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance; and Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basisThe Accounting Officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS Foundation Trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS Foundation Trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. Signed............................................................... Lesley Writtle Chief Executive Officer 23rd May 2018 Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201858 G: Annual Governance Statement Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Foundation Trust's policies, aims and objectives whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. Capacity to handle risk The Trust remains committed to ensuring that risk management forms an integral part of its philosophy, practices and development, where responsibility for its application is accepted at all levels within the Trust. At a collective level, the Board of Directors is responsible for approving the Risk Management Strategy and monitoring and reviewing its implementation. I as the Chief Executive Officer, have overall responsibility for establishing internal control systems and have delegated certain risk management responsibilities to Executive Directors and other senior managers within the Trust. For the eleven month period to 28th February 2018, executive responsibility for the development, maintenance and oversight of the organisational risk management systems and associated policies rested with the Corporate Governance Director and thereafter with the Director of Nursing. Governance arrangements within the Trust provide for the identification, assessment, analysis and management of risk at appropriate levels representing a systematic approach to risk management and thus enabling a fair, responsible and learning culture to develop. Staff at all levels are required to undertake mandatory training which includes a module on risk management, and associated policies, though an internal audit review noted a need to provide more robust risk management training across the Trust and this will be addressed during the new financial year. More specific training (for example physical intervention skills) appropriate to individual roles and responsibilities is provided in accordance with the risk management and learning and development strategies of the Trust. Mandatory training also covers responsibilities and duties in the areas of health and fire safety, infection prevention and control, information governance, local security management, and counter fraud, and staff have access to specialists who lead in these areas within the Trust. During the year, it was recognised that specific fire safety training for staff working on in-patient areas should be enhanced and additional training continues to be provided to ensure compliance. The Trust seeks to learn from good practice in a number of ways including incident reporting and reviews, complaints and claims management and the review of safety alerts, the outcomes of which are cascaded through the Trust's governance structure, including reviews by the Quality and Safety sub-committee of the Board of Directors, and through the publication of regular bulletins via the Trust intranet and email system. Care Governance Facilitators provide risk management support within the operating divisions and provide an interface with the corporate Governance Assurance Unit and co- ordinate the dissemination of divisional briefings on learning from incident and complaint reviews. Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201859 Improvements to systems and practice are included within service quality improvement plans developed by the Quality and Safety Groups at divisional level and are reviewed corporately by the Quality and Safety Steering Group. The risk and control framework The Risk Management Strategy and Policy describes in detail the approach to risk management and defines clearly where responsibility lies at each stage of the process. All staff are required to report risks, including hazards that they encounter in their work, through well-defined incident reporting procedures. Risks are recorded on the Trust's electronic risk management system, which is in turn used to populate divisional and corporate risk registers and the board assurance framework. Risks are also identified from the review of complaints and concerns, through clinical and operational audit and from research and development activities. Management and internal audit reviews of functional control systems against mandated and other standards of good practice and the ongoing assessment of our performance against plans also provide mechanisms for the identification of clinical, operational, financial, strategic, non-compliance and external risks. Once identified, risks are recorded and evaluated for their potential to adversely affect service delivery and the objectives of the Trust. Evaluation of the risk includes an assessment of both the likelihood of the occurrence and the consequence of the risk being realised, using a risk matrix adapted from the former Australian/New Zealand risk management standard (AS/NZS 4360:1999). The descriptions allocated to each level of likelihood and consequence within the risk matrix enable a consistent approach to risk evaluation across the Trust. The authority to treat risk is determined by the level of risk assigned, and treatment plans will be reviewed and monitored at relevant managerial levels, both individually, e.g. Director or Service Manager, and collectively, e.g. Quality and Safety Steering Group. All risks, as recorded in the risk register are reviewed by the Risk Management Group, which was established during the year to provide regular oversight of the risk registers.Those high level risks are then reported to and reviewed by both the Executive Management Forum, and the Quality and Safety Steering Group. Risk mitigation plans, the identification of lead directors responsible for the execution of mitigation plans, indicative timescale for mitigation to be implemented, and an assessment of the residual risk are identified in relevant risk management reports. The board assurance framework identifies the strategic objectives, the controls and assurances in place and actions to address any gaps in control or assurance that are identified. The above reporting and review process enables both the co-ordination and review of all risks and the ongoing identification of high level risks and monitoring the progress of mitigation plans. Both the Quality and Safety, and Finance & Investment sub-committees of the Board of Directors undertake assurance of the high level risks through their respective business agendas, and any exceptional matters arising are reported directly to the Board. The board assurance framework is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors to both ensure the adequacy of mitigation plans and to determine any further action to be taken. The Audit Committee has a key responsibility to review the adequacy of the organisational systems of risk management and internal control and in so doing reviews and considers the adequacy of the board assurance framework, together with reports from Internal Audit as to the adequacy of the controls in place for its production and ongoing maintenance. The Audit Committee also receives reports of reviews undertaken by Internal Audit as its major source of assurance. None of the internal audit reviews conducted during the year concluded there was insufficient assurance as to the effectiveness of the controls, though the review of WEB access and Local Area Network security identified areas for improvement which have already been addressed. It is worthy to note however that the Trust was not affected by the global \"WannaCry\" ransomware attack that took place during the year. Actions to address the recommendations of all Internal Audit reviews are in place, and progress in implementation is reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee. Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201860 The Quality and Safety Committee regularly reviews detailed reports which provide an overview of risk management activity, including incident reporting and analysis, investigations into serious untoward incidents and complaints management. An internal review of the Trusts approach to managing investigations of serious incidents found some common issues and areas of non-compliance during the year. Recommendations and actions to improve the process for investigations into serious incidents review have been implemented and the process is monitored via the Trusts Risk Management Committee. In December 2016, the CQC published its review, \"Learning, candour and accountability: A review of the way NHS trusts review and investigate the deaths of patients in England\". Subsequently, the National Quality Board published its guidance to NHS Trusts on establishing learning from deaths frameworks, and in response the Trust established its own Mortality Review Group, chaired by the Medical Director, to ensure compliance with the national guidance in respect of the identification, reporting, investigation and learning from deaths of patients whilst under care of the Trust. The Board of Directors receives reports on mortality and any exceptional risk management issues arising at its meetings. In May 2017 the Board approved its corporate governance statement confirming compliance with its governance obligations going forward. In developing its operational plan for 2017/18, the Board identified the following key risks to maintaining compliance with its licence conditions: - the possibility that the Trust would be unable to achieve the required level of recurrent cash releasing efficiency savings which would impact adversely on its ability to deliver core services to required standards; - the potential inability to afford and deliver timely transformational change programmes would lead to deterioration in financial position and compromise delivery of services to required standards; - reduced levels of cash held by the Trust could lead to the Trust being unable to finance its ongoing activities; - capacity and capability within the Trust could be compromised if senior clinical staff and managers chose to leave the Trust in advance of potential significant organisational change; and - any delay in the timescales for the delivery of the Transforming Care Together Partnership could compromise the short term financial sustainability of the Trust. The Board of Directors regularly reviewed these risks and associated mitigation plans at its meetings. In reviewing the position of the Trust following the demise of the Transforming Care Together Partnership, the Board of Directors has identified the following key risks which are to be managed during the coming financial year: - Financial and clinical sustainability: the Trust continues to operate with a financial deficit and has already received acknowledgement of the Regulator for the need to access the distressed funding facility of short term borrowing to maintain service provision, though further deterioration in the revenue position could impact on the quality of services; - Workforce; the results of the staff survey, soft intelligence from our staff generally and other workforce indicators have identified a multi-dimensional risk that will require us to refresh our approach to staff engagement, enhance our offer for recruitment and retention and promote the health and well-being of our workforce; - Reputation of Trust: there is a risk that the reputation and credibility of the Trust may be damaged following the demise of the Transforming Care Together Partnership and with it the Trust's then sustainability plan; - Changing environment: there is a risk that the ever changing health and social care environment could result in increased focus on the development of \"accountable care organisations\" which could compromise the sustainability of Trust services; and - Dudley Multi - specialty Community services Provider (MCP): linked to the changing environment the potential establishment of the Dudley MCP could result in loss of services and income in the short and medium term and result in non-Dudley commissioned services becoming unsustainable.Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201861 The Assembly of Governors has received reports from directors about the annual operational plan, noting that the plan for 2018/19 is a modification of that submitted in the previous year, and has received reports concerning the strategic risks as monitored by the Board of Directors. Details of risks, incidents and complaints are also shared with the Trust's main service commissioners through the regular contract quality review meetings. Ultimate responsibility for ensuring the quality and safety of services provided rests with the Board of Directors, which regularly reviews reports on quality performance using a dashboard of key quality performance indicators, together with performance reports on quality initiatives, such as performance against \"CQUIN\" (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) targets. The Board also receives reports from its Quality and Safety sub-committee, which has a duty to obtain assurance as to the delivery of services to the national and local standards of safety and quality expected. In furtherance of its aim to seek more positive, independent assurance as to the quality of services provided, the Board continues to receive both direct and indirect accounts of service users, carers and staff as to their experience of using Trust services; Board members also take full participation in regular visits to operational units. The Director of Nursing, (AHP's) and Governance holds executive responsibility for quality governance. The Medical Director and Director of Nursing, AHP's and Governance are key members of the Quality and Safety Steering Group which oversees quality performance, the implementation of the quality strategy and the development and monitoring of the quality governance framework. Other members of this group include the Clinical Directors from each division, the Chairs of each sub-group (which are described below) and key specialists, e.g. Associate Director of Safeguarding, etc. Each division has its own Quality and Safety Group reporting to Quality and Safety Steering Group and has representatives on subject specific corporate groups, such as the Infection Prevention & Control Committee, the Health and Safety Group, and the Medicines Management Committee, thus ensuring consistency in the development of policy. These sub groups also provide oversight of relevant risks and provide regular reports on exceptional issues to the Quality and Safety Steering Group. The Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. The Care Quality Commission undertook a full inspection of Trust services in November 2016 and published its report in February 2017. The overall rating provided for Trust services was \"good\", with community based mental health services for older people deemed as \"outstanding\". Action plans to address recommendations following the Mental Health Act inspections of the Care Quality Commission are monitored by the corporate Governance Assurance Unit in order to ensure implementation within required timescales. Oversight of these plans is provided by the Quality and Safety Steering Group. As at 31st March 2018, all action plans, arising from visits during the year had been completed or were on target for completion by their relevant due dates. The Mental Health Legislation Scrutiny Committee has a duty to gain assurance as to compliance with all aspects of mental health legislation. Non-Executive Directors are members of this committee and its meetings are regularly attended by the Executive Medical Director and the Mental Health Act Administration Officer. Non-Executive Directors have delegated the responsibilities for hearing appeals under the Mental Health Act 1983 to independent Associate Hospital Managers. Meetings of the Hospital and Associate Hospital Managers Group take place twice a year and report to the Mental Health Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Board is aware of its obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and has arrangements in place to ensure the Trust not only complies with the legal requirements but more importantly harnesses and embeds the principles of equality into everyday operations. Significantly the Trust uses Equality Impact Assessments (EqIA) as a proactive approach to positively promoting equality, challenging discrimination, and creating accessibility for staff, for those who use our services, and for the local community. Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201862 An EqIA is carried out whenever the Trust is developing or amending strategies, policies, projects and services. Managers have a responsibility to complete the EqIA and to ensure that other relevant staff are involved in the process so as to provide different perspectives and challenge the established way of doing things. The EqIA process and accompanying online forms are kept on the Trust Intranet to provide easy access for staff. The Head of Diversity reviews each completed EqIA to ensure it has been completed appropriately, is added to the corporate register and that any overarching themes which arise are addressed at Divisional level and as necessary are brought to the attention of the Equality Inclusion Board. It is the responsibility of the Division in which the EqIA has been undertaken, to ensure that any resulting actions are incorporated into the ongoing delivery and review of services. All completed EqIAs are published on the Trust's Intranet and website. In addition, any proposal for achieving cash releasing savings is assessed not only for the impact on quality but also whether there are any equality impacts. In accordance with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010 the objectives of the Trusts equality strategy are published on the Trust's website. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and the member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and a carbon reduction plan has been developed in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that this organisation's obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaption Reporting requirements are complied with.Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resourcesThe Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring systems are in place to maintain the economic, efficient and effective use of resources within the Trust. An integrated performance report, covering finance, workforce, compliance targets, contractual targets and service line activity is regularly presented to and reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Management Board whose membership includes Executive, Clinical and Divisional Directors met on a monthly basis and had a duty to monitor the performance of the Trust, against the agreed financial, contractual, and service targets as set by the Board of Directors. In the new financial year, the functions of the Management Board have been subsumed by the newly formed Executive Committee. The Quality and Safety Steering Group monitors the quality performance of the Trust and reports to the Quality and Safety sub-committee of the Board. At operational level, the group management boards meet regularly to review operational and financial performance, and any exceptional matters are escalated to the executive directors via the Performance and Planning Management Boards. The Finance and Investment Committee reviews and assures the rationale and adequacy of investment and cost improvement plans, and the Quality and Safety Committee reviews the adequacy of the Quality and Equality Impact Assessment process. The Audit Committee approves and monitors at each of its meetings the progress in implementation of the work programme for the Local Counter Fraud Specialist. The Board of Directors had previously established a plan to address the medium and longer term sustainability of the Trust, the outcome of which was the establishment of the \"Transforming Care Together\" partnership with the Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and the Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust with the aim of securing future delivery of qualitative and economically sustainable NHS commissioned services. Subsequently, in November 2016, the Board approved an outline business case supporting the formal merger, by way of acquisition by Birmingham Community Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201863 Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust of the other two Trusts. The full business case was approved by the Boards of the three Trusts in the summer of 2017 and integration plans put in place. However in November 2017 it became apparent that further work was required to address a number of issues; subsequently in February 2018, the Board of Directors, being cognizant of feedback that the case for the planned acquisition would not meet Regulatory approval, decided that the Transforming Care Together Partnership be immediately dissolved; the Boards of Directors of the other two partner Trusts independently arrived at the same decision, which was supported by the Regulator. In light of the termination of the Transforming Care Together partnership, the Board of Directors resolved to terminate the service agreement with Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for the provision of services from the Chief Executive, Director of Finance and other directors under secondment to the Trust and interim appointments to the resultant executive vacancies were made by the Non-Executive Led Appointments and Remuneration Committee. These appointments were made with the knowledge and support of the Regulator and the interim appointment of the Chief Executive Officer was subsequently approved by the Assembly of Governors in March 2018. The Board of Directors has now committed to developing alternative plans to secure the future sustainability of service provision in alignment with the Black Country Sustainability and Transformation Plan, which it has been actively engaged in. The Trust has been a party to a nationally approved \"vanguard\", (as referred to in the NHS Five Year Forward View) known as \"MERIT\" (Mental Health Alliance for Excellence, Resilience, Innovation and Training), working with three other neighbouring provider Trusts. At its meeting in April 2018, the Board of Directors determined whether or not the financialstatements for the year ended 31st March 2018 should be prepared on a going concern basis. This is referred to in the Performance Report at section 1 of this Annual Report. In determining that the financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis, it identified material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the ability of the Trust to continue to exist in its current form, and to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the longer term.Whilst the Board noted that the Trust has continued to develop and maintain several cash management initiatives during the past year to provide early warning of any working capital risks, it foresaw a requirement for cash support during the year ending 31st March 2019 commencing during quarter 2, support for which has been acknowledged by the Regulator. The significant risks facing the Trust are summarised as follows: The Trust has submitted a cash flow plan which shows a closing position at 31st March 2019 of \u00a31.3m - incorporating \u00a32.1m of funding drawn down from NHS Improvement in quarter 2. There is uncertainty over whether the Trust will achieve its efficiency savings of \u00a34.2m which have been incorporated into its financial plan. This level of savings is challenging and must be supported with adequate operational engagement to deliver against agreed detailed plans. As of April 2018 schemes totalling \u00a31.4m (33%) of the total target have been identified - \u00a30.8m (60%) recurrently. There is a reasonable expectation that normal staff turnover will yield further savings of \u00a32m; The cessation of the Transforming Care Together strategic partnership has resulted in the Trust needing time to be able to reform its identity as BCPFT and develop a new sustainability plan for the future. The Dudley MCP procurement process (impact in 2019/20) is still ongoing with the Trust requesting to be a sub-contractor. Currently the Trust is awaiting completion of the procurement process and confirmation of sub-contractor status. The Trust has entered into negotiation with the Local Government Pension Scheme regarding the forced withdrawal from that scheme of a small number of Trust employees in 2018/19. The Trust could be liable to meet a share of the Fund' deficit if such a transfer progresses. Information Governance The Trust has in place appropriate governance arrangements for data and information security in accordance with the standards laid out within the national Information Governance framework; at 31st March 2018 the Trust declared compliance at level 2 of the standards of the national Information Governance toolkit.Accountability Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201864 An Information Governance Steering Group, which is chaired by the Senior Information Responsible Officer and whose membership includes the Caldicott Guardian, the Information Governance Manager and other key professional leads is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of information governance policy across the Trust. During the year the Information Governance Steering Group co-ordinated and monitored the action plan to ensure the Trust was prepared for the introduction of the anticipated new Data Protection Act which incorporates the European General Data Protection Regulations. The roles of Caldicott Guardian and Senior Information Responsible Officer are undertaken by the Medical Director and Director of Nursing, AHP's & Governance respectively, and the job requirements of other key corporate officers include relevant responsibilities associated with information and data security. All staff within the Trust receive relevant training at induction and throughout their employment in accordance with national information governance standards. Any incidents and/or risks associated with data and information security are reported and dealt with in accordance with the Trust risk management and incident reporting policies. There were four incidents identified during the year that were reported to, but resulted in no action being taken by the Information Commissioners Office. Annual Quality Report The Directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual. The development of the Annual Quality Report is led by the Director of Nursing, AHP's and Governance. The report contains performance data on specific measures of quality that have been agreed by the Board of Directors and as necessary for external audit review, the Assembly of Governors.The majority of the measures rely on data and information that is already known and captured by the Trust in its everyday operations. Some of the metrics used are identical to those used within the mandated performance targets of the compliance regime, e.g. \"Care Programme Approach\" 7 day follow up\" and are subject to the same data and information management policies and validation procedures that the Trust relies on for its performance reporting. Where other local and new measures are required, for example following requests for additional monitoring data from NHS service commissioners, then these have been consulted on, the systems have been developed to ensure correct capture and staff have been trained as necessary in recording of such data. During the year assurance as to the reliance of these systems has been provided by internal audit, and through the limited assurance report undertaken by the external auditor. The Annual Quality Report has, in accordance with directions by the Secretary of State, also been shared with local commissioners, \"Healthwatch\" bodies, and overview and scrutiny committees of local councils, and comments received by these bodies have been included in the report. In accordance with directions from \"NHS Improvement\" (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor), the external auditors published their limited assurance report to the Assembly of Governors which for 2016/17 the Auditor provided a qualified conclusion on the accuracy of data relating to the \"Care Programme Approach 7 day follow up\" indicator, having identified errors in its calculation. However the report concluded that except for the qualified conclusion nothing had come to its attention to suggest that the Quality Report had been presented other than compliant with guidance. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the Accountability ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201865 content of the Quality Report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, the Audit committee, and other sub committees of the Board, and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. With regard to the specific processes applied in maintaining and reviewing the Quality Report, over and above those cited below, these include: the regular reports on quality metrics within the integrated performance reports submitted to the Board of Directors; the limited assurance report of the External Auditor in 2016/17, acknowledging the qualified conclusion of one indicator; the assurance provided by Internal Audit through their reviews; and the views and comments received from external organisations. In addition, other processes applied in maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control include the following: regular reviews of the board assurance framework by the Board of Directors; reviews of the board assurance framework by the Audit Committee; the reports of inspections regarding compliance with mental health legislation undertaken by the Care Quality Commission; the reports of any ad-hoc quality inspections by Clinical Commissioning Groups; the work of the Audit Committee and in particular its assurance of the adequacy of the risk management arrangements and wider system of internal control including quality governance arrangements; the duties of the Quality and Safety Committee in its assurance of quality governance; the duties of the Mental Health Legislation Scrutiny Committee in its assurance of compliance with mental health legislation; sources of positive assurance as to the quality of service provision considered by the Board of Directors, in particular direct and indirect accounts of service user experience and quality assurance visits to service areas by board members; the role of the Finance & Investment Committee in both assuring the adequacy of plans to mitigate high level business, financial and strategic risks, and reviewing the financial and performance reports and forecasts; the ongoing application of the risk management strategy and processes by Executive Directors and other senior management; and the work-plan and associated reviews conducted by Internal Audit, which due to the anticipated and subsequently abandoned acquisition was restricted to core systems, and the opinion of the Head of Internal Audit which states that \"....significant assurance can be given, based on a limited scope review, that there is a generally sound system of internal control designed to meet the organisation's objectives, and that controls are generally being applied consistently. However, some weaknesses in the design and/or inconsistent application of controls could put the achievement of particular objectives at risk.\" Conclusion Other than the issues relating to improvements required to address the financial sustainability of the Trust, there are no other significant internal control issues that have been identified in the reporting period, or are anticipated to occur in the future, that require disclosure in this statement.

The first trace of 'The Black Country' as an expression dates from the 1840s, when it was one of the most industrialised parts of Britain with coalmines, iron foundries and steel mills producing a high level of air pollution and the name was used to portray the soot from these industries that covered the area. The Black Country area covers the 4 local authority areas of Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, Walsall Council and Wolverhampton City Council in the West Midlands, with a population of almost 1.2 million people. We provide:- Mental health and specialist health learning disabilities services to people of all ages in Sandwell and Wolverhampton Specialist learning disability services in Walsall and Dudley Community healthcare services for children, young people and families in Dudley There are over 2000 staff working in the Trust. Our staff carry out a wide range of roles, working together to provide integrated care and support to all those using our services. Frontline staff working in the Trust include:- - mental health nurses - psychiatrists - healthcare support workers - health visitors - psychologists- occupational therapists - speech and language therapists - physiotherapists- dieticiansOur vision is to improve health and well-being for people of all ages across the Black Country. We want to provide better services for our communities, to improve their choice and access, and make the most efficient use of our resources so we can reinvest in patient care. What is a Quality Report? Quality Reports are annual reports to the public from providers of NHS healthcare about the quality of services they deliver and their priorities for improvement. The report allows our directors, clinicians, governors and staff to demonstrate their commitment to continuous, evidence-based quality improvement, and to explain their progress to the public. We welcome this opportunity to place information about the quality of our services into the public domain, and for our approach to quality to be subject to scrutiny, debate and reflection. How we produce the Quality Report The format, content and order of the quality report are determined by NHS Improvement, the regulator for all NHS Trusts in England, in their publication 'Detailed Requirements for Quality Reports 2017/18.' The Executive Director of Nursing, Quality, Allied Health Professionals and Psychology, is the Trust's Executive Lead, with responsibility for quality and the production of this report. Clinical staff from mental health, learning disabilities and children's services are involved in producing the content of the report. The report provides a summary of our performance and our progress against the quality priorities we set last year and looks ahead to those we have set for the coming year. The report reflects the sixth full year of operation as the Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The Trust routinely reports quality measures to both executive and board level. Data quality is assured through the Trust's data quality governance structures, with the Board of Directors confirming a statement of compliance with responsibilities in completing the quality report. However, there are a number of inherent limitations in the preparation of a quality report, which may impact on the reliability or accuracy of the data reported. These include:-Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201869 - Data is derived from a large number of different systems and processes. Only some of these are subject to external assurance, or included in internal audits programme of work each year. - Data is collected by a large number of teams across the Trust alongside their main responsibilities, which may lead to differences in how policies are applied or interpreted. In many cases, data reported reflects clinical judgement about individual cases, where another clinician might have reasonably classified a case differently. - National data definitions do not necessarily cover all circumstances, and local interpretations may differ. - Data collection practices and data definitions are evolving, which may lead to differences over time, both within and between years. The volume of data means that, where changes are made, it is usually not practical to re-analyse historic data. Our key stakeholders are given the opportunity to review and comment upon a draft of the quality report. The Trust's Audit Committee also reviews the draft report as part of their review of the Trust's Annual Report. The Board of Directors are responsible for final approval of the quality report. The quality report is also subject to detailed scrutiny by external auditors. NHS Improvement requires the auditors to provide a limited assurance report on the content of the quality report. This includes whether anything has come to their attention that leads them to believe it has not been prepared in line with the requirements set out in NHS Improvement's 'NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual' and/or, it is not consistent with the other information sources set out in the detailed guidance. Part One 3.1 Statement on Quality from the Chief Executive On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am delighted to introduce the quality report to you. The quality report shares a wealth of information about our performance and our progress against the priorities we set last year and looks ahead to those we have set for the coming year. The aim of the report is to provide an honest account of the quality of the services we provide. In last year's report we informed you of the inspection of our services by the Care Quality Commission and their decision to award the Trust an overall rating of 'Good.' This was a tremendous vote of confidence in our dedicated and hard working staff and since then there has been a renewed focus on driving quality and productivity to deliver improved services and better outcomes for patients. You may have seen coverage in the media about the NHS in relation to its finances and the growing demand, and like many healthcare organisations, we have had another challenging year on the financial front. While we continue to strive to live within our means, we have been considering the future and how best to protect the services we deliver to patients. We have therefore spent time exploring different options and talking to other local NHS trusts about the potential of working together. Following consultations with our commissioners, stakeholders, the general public and their local representatives, we announced last year the decision to form a partnership with two neighbouring NHS trusts. 'Transforming Care Together' (TCT) was the title of the partnership the Trust formed with Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. Over the last year, the boards of each trust worked together to define more detail about the partnership, and to inform and involve people about these plans. After spending time reviewing the proposals and after careful consideration, the boards of the three trusts involved in TCT have agreed that the integration of the three trusts into one organisation will now not happen. The key factors taken into account in reaching this decision were:-Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201870 Strategic fit - recent NHS planning guidance for 2018/19 has highlighted the strengthening role of Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) in developing models of care appropriate to their geographical locations, and the TCT proposal would have operated across both Birmingham & Solihull and the Black Country; Clinical concerns - discussions around how best to integrate the three trusts' clinical areas have raised a number of challenges for all three organisations; Financial - the financial plan for the integrated organisation would not meet the requirements that are set for the transaction. I am very aware and extremely appreciative of the considerable work that staff have put into TCT over the last year and I am determined to ensure that we capture as much learning as possible and continue to share good practice. In reviewing the benefits identified through the hard work in developing the TCT proposal, it is clear that the clinical case identified from working collaboratively on the benefits of a Black Country-wide approach to mental health, learning disabilities and children's services should continue to be developed further, by the two Black Country Trusts working closely with our commissioners and the STP . This is something that we will work on with Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and our other partners. As Chief Executive, I consider it a privilege to be leading such a caring organisation and to be playing my part to improve the quality of services for people with mental illness, learning disabilities, and for children, young people and families, living in the Black Country. Throughout this report, you can learn about both our performance and the range of activities that we have undertaken across the Trust during 2017/18, to improve the quality of the services we provide. The report also gives us the opportunity to share some of the challenges we have faced during the year and the efforts we have made to overcome them. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our staff and formally thank them for their support, dedication and commitment to provide high quality services. I hope you will enjoy reading about their achievements and the progress they have made over the last year. In publishing the report, the Board of Directors have reviewed its content and verified the accuracy of the details contained therein. I therefore confirm, in accordance with my statutory duty, that to the best of my knowledge, the information provided in this Quality Report is accurate. Signed............................................................... Lesley Writtle Chief Executive 23rd May 2018 Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201871 Part Two 3.2 Priorities for Improvement We begin this part of the report with a review of the priorities for quality improvement that we identified in last year's report and to explain the rationale behind the quality improvement priorities we have chosen for the year ahead. The priorities were chosen following a process of reviewing our current services, consulting with our key stakeholders and listening to the views of our service users and carers. 3.3 Looking Back - Review of Priorities 2017/18 Below are brief summaries of the progress made over the last year by our divisional services with the quality improvement priorities they identified in last year's report. Table 1 below lists the priority for each division: Table 1: Quality Improvement Priorities for 2017/18 Division Priority Adult Mental Health ServicesIntroducing a Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) outcome measure Older Adult Mental Health ServicesImproving discharge notifications Learning Disabilities ServicesThe management of epilepsies across inpatient units Children's ServicesLearning and improving from complaints 3.3.1 Adult Mental Health Services - Introducing a Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) outcome measure Why this was a priority for improvement Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL) is a new patient reported outcome measure, developed to assess the quality of life for people with different mental health conditions. ReQoL was developed by a scientific group led by the University of Sheffield and funded by the Department of Health Policy Research Programme for use in the NHS. A patient-reported outcome is a health outcome reported by the person who experienced it, in contrast to an outcome reported by a health professional such as a doctor, nurse or psychologist. ReQoL is a short, easy to use questionnaire developed by service users, with inputs from clinicians, national and international experts, to capture how their mental health affects their quality of life. The introduction of ReQoL into routine practice will provide immediate, measurable feedback and focus clinical interventions and services on personal recovery and improving the quality of life of people with mental health problems: o To educate staff and integrate an outcome measure that captures the presence of key mechanisms for recovery for the service user o To have a recovery focused tool that is integrated into team and service dashboards to enable monitoring of the focus of the interventions delivered by services o Feedback from the use of the tool is used at team and clinician level, through team meetings, caseload management and clinical supervision to revise and improve recovery practices within services o Improve decision-making on what support and services people using our services, experiencing mental health problems require Progress in 2016/17 - Service users and staff from adult mental health services were involved in the national research programme that developed the ReQoL outcome measure - Service users, carers and clinicians began to collaborate on refocusing adult mental health services in order to embed recovery - Development of a skills based approach that makes explicit the behaviours required from staff to trigger the recovery mechanisms Progress in 2017/18 An implementation group 'Refocus on Recovery' was established and meets monthly with relevant stakeholders to maintain an overarching view of the strategic development of a recovery focus across mental health services. Three subsequent groups were developed locally to establish specific recovery focused culture within urgent care, planned care and older adult mental health services. Each group Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201872 meets monthly to address local service specific needs. Community mental health teams based in West Bromwich were selected to be the first wave to be trained in 'Refocus on Recovery' and the use of ReQol, identifying the training needs of staff to understand the processes/pathways involved and establishing supervision and clinical systems to support this process. The first wave of 'Refocus on Recovery' training has been completed and the trained staff are acting as the leads/mentors for their teams in the pilot implementation sites. In addition, education and training sessions have taken place within the teams and with service users and stakeholders, including a recovery launch event at Quayside, the West Bromwich community services base, in September 2017. Two further launch events took place at Hallam Street Hospital, West Bromwich and Penn Hospital, Wolverhampton. All events were successful in 'starting the recovery conversation' and asked all participants 'what recovery means to them'. Events were supported and promoted by the Trust communications team and on social media. Plans for ReQoL to be incorporated into electronic data collection systems to facilitate regular reporting arrangements have been delayed pending the rollout of electronic health records across the Trust. Work is continuing to ensure the questionnaires are ready and staff are reviewing the current paperwork and processes for the Care Programme Approach (CPA) to include ReQOL. Data collection using the tool and the outcomes identified is currently taking place by the first group of staff trained in use of the tool. Outcomes will be reported initially through local recovery practices groups, then to the trust-wide implementation group and divisional quality and safety group. The reports will ensure the project is monitoring the transfer into routine clinical practice at every level from clinical supervision to team meetings to service- wide committee meetings. Next Steps The use of data currently being collated for the first wave of ReQoL will be evaluated to review processes and pathways before implementation into second wave teams ReQoL will be embedded into evaluation of courses for all students attending the Recovery College. Work will continue to embed a recovery and safety focus into the ongoing review of CPA, care planning and assessment paperwork and processes across all services. We will continue to work towards electronic data collection systems that support the use of ReQoL in clinical practice. 3.3.2 Older Adult Mental Health Services - Improving discharge notifications Why this was a priority for improvementPaper based discharge notifications can be problematic if they are incomplete or received too late for the information to be considered clinically useful. Following discussions with local commissioners, it was agreed there was a need to improve discharge notifications to general practitioners (GPs). A number of improvements would be made to the current notification form to make it more comprehensive and clinically effective, in particular, changes which will ensure that any risks have been clearly assessed and highlighted to GPs and any other agencies in a timely manner. Medical secretaries currently type discharge notifications on the day of discharge and fax them to the patient's GP . In future, the completed discharge form will be sent electronically to GP surgeries using nhs.net emails (a secure email service approved by the Department of Health for sharing patient identifiable and sensitive information within the NHS). This is considered the most effective method of communication in the absence of electronic networks connecting secondary mental health services to primary care. The discharge notification will be sent on the same day of discharge for all planned discharges. The improvements we wanted to make o GP surgeries will receive notification of all discharges of elderly inpatients on the same day of discharge in a safe and effective manner o Longer term, the service will work towards the use of an electronic discharge system to further improve the quality of information sharing between primary and secondary care servicesQuality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201873 Progress in 2016/17 - Discussions were held with local commissioners to discuss the current weaknesses in discharge notifications and to explore ways to improve them - Work began on developing a new standardised discharge notification template Progress in 2017/18 A list of nhs.net email addresses of all GPs surgeries in Sandwell and Wolverhampton was provided to medical secretaries and ward clerks in April 2017 The new discharge notification form was approved by local commissioners and implemented at both Penn Hospital, Wolverhampton and Edward Street Hospital, West Bromwich in June 2017 Discharge notifications have been sent via NHS net email on the same day of discharge since June 2017; the only exception is when a discharge occurs after office hours when it is sent the next working day An audit of discharge notifications was undertaken for the month of September 2017 to assess how well the changes were working. The results of the audit showed that all notifications were sent on the same day of discharge during the month of September 2017 with the exception of one patient who was discharged on a Sunday. The discharge notification was completed the next working day but because the ward doctor was new in post, the discharge was required to be signed off by the consultant in charge and was sent two days after discharge. To monitor how well the improvements made were working a further audit was undertaken six months later. The results showed that all notifications were sent on the same day of discharge during the month of March 2018 except for one when the discharge occurred after office hours and this was sent the next working day. Next Steps Progress will continue to be reported to and monitored by the older adults mental health quality and safety group The service will continue to work towards the use of an electronic discharge system to further improve the quality of information sharing between primary and secondary care services3.3.3 Learning Disabilities Services - The management of epilepsies across inpatient units Why this was a priority for improvement pilepsy is a tendency to have recurrent seizures and is considered one of the most common serious neurological conditions. Epilepsy is not a single condition. There are over forty different types of epilepsy and those affected may have one or several different seizure types. Accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence are difficult to achieve but the prevalence rate of epilepsy amongst people with learning disabilities has been reported as twenty times higher than for the general population. Quality reviews and audit feedback showed inconsistencies in practice across our learning disabilities inpatient units, in relation to the national guidance for the management of epilepsies produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the national good practice recommended by the Joint Epilepsy Council. The improvements we wanted to make o All inpatients with epilepsy will have a comprehensive care plan for the management of this condition, to include standardised documentation for use across all learning disabilities inpatient units o Every plan will be agreed with each patient, their family and/or carers as appropriate o The learning disabilities inpatient service will be able to evidence safer practices in care for patients who are at risk of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) Progress in 2016/17 - Best practice review of the recommendations from Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust's independent investigation report into the tragic death of Connor Sparrowhawk - Benchmarking against the NICE standards for epilepsy management - Snap shot audit of current practice across all areas showed inconsistencies in relation to epilepsy care plans, risk assessments and protocols - Matrons' audits confirmed that inconsistencies remainQuality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201874 Progress in 2017/18 An epilepsy improvement group was established, led by the Head of Nursing for Learning Disabilities, to oversee this priority A baseline audit was undertaken to review the quality of epilepsy care plans in place using standards from the NICE clinical guideline on epilepsy (CG137) i.e. all children, young people and adults with epilepsy should have a comprehensive care plan agreed between the person, family and/or carers; the plan should include lifestyle issues as well as clinical matters The audit of epilepsy care plans indicated a compliance rate of 38% against national standards Local epilepsy champions were introduced across all inpatient units The improvement group devised a new standardised documentation epilepsy pack which includes forms for completing initial assessments, risk assessments, seizure recording tool, seizure recording chart, a flowchart for the administration of buccal midazolam (medication used to control seizures) The new epilepsy documentation pack was formally approved for use across all inpatient areas and includes setting timescales for completion following a patient's admission The epilepsy documentation pack has been distributed across all inpatient areas A further audit of epilepsy care plans was carried out in March 2018 to measure improvement and the results showed 73% compliance against national standards. Next steps Inpatient nursing staff will continue to receive training and support with the new documentation pack in order to work collaboratively with patients, relatives and carers, to co-produce each comprehensive care plan Further audits will be undertaken to measure improvement and compliance against national standards The epilepsy improvement lead will provide regular updates to the divisional quality and safety group which will be responsible for monitoring compliance against national standards3.3.4 Children's Services - Learning and improving from complaints Why this was a priority for improvementHealthcare complaints offer a valuable insight into a patient's experience and an opportunity to learn why we failed to meet their expectations. They primarily identify areas of concern and acting upon these concerns can help us to improve and deliver services, which are responsive to the views of children, young people and families. While the numbers of complaints received are relatively low, work undertaken over the previous year suggests it is perhaps even more important to ensure that our processes are robust and responsive so we take every opportunity they provide to learn from them. The improvements we wanted to make o The principles of good complaint handling are followed and actions taken to address any areas for improvement o Action plans are developed for every partially or fully upheld complaint and completed within specified timescales o Lessons learned are always recorded for every partially or fully upheld complaint o Lessons learned are routinely shared through the quality and safety group and across all services Progress in 2016/17 - A review of complaints was undertaken in line with the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman's principles of good complaint handling - The review identified scope for improving the recording and sharing of lessons learned and the development and monitoring of action plans for complaints which are upheld or partially upheld - Improvements were made to the Trust's incident recording system to collate information relating to complaints more effectively Progress in 2017/18 Quarterly complaints audits were completed and presented to the quality and safety group Each complaint was categorised using a nationally recognised complaints analysis tool to record each complaint. The categories are set out in Table 2 on next page. Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201875 Table 2: Categorisation of complaints Clinical Problems: Quality: Clinical standards of healthcare staff behaviour Safety: Errors, incidents, and staff competencies Management Problems: Environment: Problems in the facilities, services, clinical equipment, and staffing levels Institutional Processes: Problems in bureaucracy, waiting times, and accessing care Relationship Problems:Listening: Healthcare staff disregard or do not acknowledge information from patients Communication: Absent or incorrect communication from healthcare staff to patients Respect and patient rights: Disrespect or violations of patient rights by staff An assessment of the impact each of the issues raised in a complaint had on the service user and their family was added to indicate if it was low, medium or high. Table 3 below provides examples of the levels of impact for the seven categories of complaints. Table 3: Examples of the level of impact Level Low Medium High Quality: Patient was not involved in their care planAspect of a patient's care plan overlookedFailing to heed warnings in patient notes Safety: Slight delay administeringmedicationStaff forgot to administer medicationIncorrect medication was administered Environment: Appointment cancelledand rescheduledChasing departments for an appointmentRefusal to give appointment Institutional Processes: Patient notes not readyfor consultationPatient notes temporarily lostAnother patient's notes used as the basis for the consultation Listening: Staff ignored questionStaff ignored mild patient painStaff ignored severe distress Communication: Patient received incorrect directionsPatient received conflicting diagnosesPatient given wrong test results Respect and patient rights:Private information divulged to the receptionistPrivate information divulged to family membersPrivate information shared with members of the publicQuality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201876 Figure 1 below shows an analysis of the ten complaints received during the period 2017/18 by both category and impact. In addition to recording and the analysis of complaints, the quarterly audits assessed adherence to internal timescales for acknowledging and responding to complaints, whether action plans had been developed in response to partially upheld or upheld complaints, and whether lessons learned had been recorded for each complaint. Next Steps - The audits indicate that possibly due to the relatively low number of complaints, clinical leads require and will receive greater support to consistently meet the timescales for responding to complaints - Quarterly complaints audits will be completed and presented to the quality and safety group to ensure timescales to respond to complaints are consistently met - All complaints received will continue to be analysed by category and impact to collate information relating to complaints more effectively Lessons learned will be extracted for every partially or fully upheld complaint and routinely shared through the quality and safety group and across all services Action plans and lessons learned from complaints will be included in monthly quality and safety reports, so they can be shared at quality and safety meetings with local commissionersQuality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201877 3.4 Looking Forward - Priorities for 2018/19 The Trust's divisional services have listened to feedback from service users, staff and stakeholders over the past year in order to determine their quality improvement priority for the year ahead (see Table 4 below). Other Trust quality priorities and goals are set out in detail in the Trust's Annual Plan on the Trust's website www.bcpft.nhs.uk. Table 4: Quality Improvement Priorities for 2018/19 Division Priority Adult Mental Health ServicesTranslating risks identified into risk management and care plans Older Adults Mental Health ServicesThe management of patients at higher risk of falls Learning Disabilities ServicesThe management of epilepsies by community learning disabilities teams Children's ServicesPersonalised care plans for children and young people 3.4.1 Adult Mental Health Services - Translating risks identified into risk management and care plans Why this is a priority for improvement Patient safety is at the centre of all good health care and clinical risk management is integral to the co-ordination and delivery of effective and safe care. Risk assessment is linked to the practice of risk management whereby a mutually agreed plan aimed at reducing identified risks is negotiated between each service user and their mental health professional.The plan incorporates specific therapeutic strategies and is a collaborative, interactive and dynamic process within a multi-professional context that involves other relevant disciplines. From a mental health perspective, risk fluctuates and is influenced by the experiences, perceptions and interactions that an individual is subject to at any point in time. Therefore, risk management plans must be constantly evaluated and amended for the minimisation of risk and the prevention of harm or further harm. The improvements we want to make o Every service user has an individualised risk management care plan, appropriate to their needs, with their risks identified through specific relevant risk assessments and translated into their individualised care plan o Devise a measurable question to gain assurance that identified risks are translated into individualised care plans o Record keeping audits carried out across all mental health services will include the measurable question to gain assurance that risk management care plans are reflective of identified risks Progress in 2017/18 - Record keeping audits were completed across services on a weekly basis and reported through the quality and safety reporting structure - Examination of themes and trends arising from investigations into patient safety incidents through root cause analysis, indicated a quality gap around the translation of risks into care plans - While record keeping audits are quite extensive it was identified that they do not include a measurable question for this aspect of care delivery to gain assurance How we will monitor, measure and report on progress during 2018/19 Audits will be undertaken to review progress and make any adaptations as required Audit results will be presented to the mental health quality improvement sub-group Success will be measured by whether current practice reflects that risks identified are translated into individualised risk management care plans across all services Actions to address underperformance will be assigned to nominated leads as necessary Completion of action plans will be monitored by the mental health quality improvement sub-group Updates will be provided via the monthly quality and safety report. Oversight and monitoring will be undertaken by the divisional quality and safety groupQuality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201878 3.4.2 Older Adults Mental Health Services - the management of patients at higher risk of falls Why this is a priority for improvement Inpatient falls are common and remain a great challenge for the whole of the NHS. Older people with a mental health condition are at increased risk of falling during their inpatient stay as they often have additional risk factors such as cognitive, visual impairment and continence problems and other health problems that may increase their risk of falling such as their medication, postural instability, mobility and balance. These circumstances mean that not all falls are preventable. Prevention depends upon prompt assessment to identify potential risk factors followed by clinical responses to put appropriate interventions in place. This is a complex task requiring a multidisciplinary team approach. We will strive towards better falls risk assessment and management of patients at higher risk of falls through the re-launch of the 'Robust Falls Prevention Strategy' in our older adult wards at Penn Hospital in Wolverhampton and Edward Street Hospital in West Bromwich.The improvements we want to make o Falls screening tool and falls bundle to be consistently applied so there is a detailed analysis of each patient's falls assessment together with a small set of evidence- based interventions that, when performed collectively, reliably and continuously are proven to reduce inpatient falls o Utilise technology and equipment effectively to prevent falls o Improve the way we map and analyse incidents of falls to identify any environmental or other factors on our wards so we can move quickly to take preventative action o Adopt the audit tool used in the 2015 National Audit of Inpatient Falls for acute hospitals to better assess all of the possible factors that contribute to falls o To reduce the number of falls occurring on older adult psychiatric wards by 10% in 2018/19 Progress in 2017/18 - Continual monitoring of incidents of falls, as shown on Figure 2 below, indicates that an average of sixteen falls per month occurs across all older adult psychiatric wards. Figure 2: Monthly falls recorded on Older Adult Psychiatric Wards How we will monitor, measure and report on progress during 2018/19 Falls champions will be re-launched with clear roles, training and links to clinical forums Falls improvement meetings will continue to meet monthly to explore new initiatives and monitor all falls incidents Collaborate with other NHS trusts who have achieved a reduction in falls on their wards over the past year The divisional quality and safety group will have oversight and responsibility for this project Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201879 3.4.3 Learning Disabilities Services - The management of epilepsies by community learning disabilities teams Why this is a priority for improvement Accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence are difficult to achieve but the prevalence rate of epilepsy amongst people with learning disabilities has been reported as twenty times higher than for the general population. You will have read earlier (3.3.3) of the work that has taken place to improve the management of epilepsies across our inpatient units. This quality improvement priority is intended to build on the work undertaken over the last twelve months to ensure our learning disabilities community services are meeting national standards and recommendations. The improvements we want to make o All community patients with epilepsy will have a comprehensive care plan for the management of this condition, to include standardised documentation for use across all learning disabilities community teams o Each plan will include lifestyle issues as well as clinical care o Every plan will be agreed with each patient, their family and/or carers as appropriate o Learning disabilities community teams will be able to evidence safer practices in the care of patients who are at risk of sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) Progress in 2017/18 - A comprehensive review of the management of epilepsies was undertaken across all inpatient units How we will monitor, measure and report on progress during 2018/19 Epilepsy link nurses working in the community will join the epilepsy improvement group to continue this work A baseline audit of community records for patients with epilepsy will be undertaken to review the quality of epilepsy risk assessments and epilepsy care plans in place against national standards This will inform the need to make any adjustments to the documentation pack developed for inpatient areas The new epilepsy care plan will be formally approved for use across all community areas Staff will receive training and support as part of the implementation plan An audit will be carried out to measure improvement and compliance against national standards The epilepsy improvement lead will provide regular updates to the learning disabilities quality and safety group, who will monitor this priority each month until completion. 3.4.4 Children's Services - Personalised care plans for children and young people Why this is a priority for improvement Personalised care planning encourages health professionals to work together with children, young people, their parents and carers to clarify and understand what is important to each child's or young person's development and progress. Effective planning can transform an individual's experience from a largely reactive service, which responds when something goes wrong, to a more helpful proactive service centred on the needs of each individual. \"It means professionals seeing me as a whole person not simply focusing on a list of conditions to be treated. It means designing my health care and support in partnership with me to help me manage my own health and live the life I want.\" We wish to ensure that every child and young person has a current care plan appropriate to his or her needs and development. Objectives are set and evaluated and they and their family are engaged in the formulation of the plan, the delivery of identified goals and when reviews take place. The improvements we want to make o Every children's service will ensure there is a personalised approach to care in place o Health professionals in each service are clearly planning, monitoring and reviewing plans in a time- framed manner for each child or young person on their caseload o Each plan is discussed and agreed with the child or young person where appropriate and the person with parental responsibility o The plan is clearly documented and communicated with those involved in their care Progress in 2017/18- Record keeping audits for all children and young people receiving care were completed on a quarterly basis. - Care planning, risk assessments and patient, family, carer involvement formed part of the audit criteria. Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201880 - The audits identified variations in compliance across children's services How we will monitor, measure and report on progress during 2018/19 Care planning \"champions\" will be recruited within each children's service An improvement group will be established and meet on a quarterly basis The group will review existing evidence of good practice and make recommendations Quarterly audits will be undertaken and presented to the group Actions to address underperformance will be assigned to nominated leads as necessary Completion of relevant action plans and lessons learnt will be monitored by the governance team Success will be measured by auditing the levels of compliance against professional standards and whether practice is being embedded or not Updates will be provided via the monthly quality and safety report Oversight and monitoring will be undertaken by the divisional quality and safety group 3.5 Statements of Assurance from the Board of Directors The aim of this section is to provide information to the public, which will be common across all quality reports, thereby enabling the public to gain a more informed and transparent view about what different healthcare organisations have reported. The statutory statements in this section aim to offer assurance from the Board of Directors to the public that the Trust is:- Performing to essential standards Measuring our clinical processes and performance Involved in national projects and initiatives aimed at improving quality 3.5.1 Review of Services During 2017/18, Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust provided and/or sub-contracted fifteen relevant NHS services:- - Adult mental health inpatient services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Specialist male adult mental health inpatient services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Older adult mental health inpatient services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Adult mental health community services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Specialist electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Older adult mental health community services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) services for people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Counselling services for adults living in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Eating disorders services for young people and adults in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Early intervention services for young people and adults in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Specialist learning disabilities inpatient services for people in Dudley, Walsall, Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Specialist learning disabilities community-based services for people in Dudley, Walsall, Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) for children and young people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Specialist learning disabilities community-based services for children and young people in Sandwell and Wolverhampton - Community healthcare services for children, young people and their families in Dudley All of the above services also provide some cross-boundary activity outside of their designated areas The Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in all of these relevant NHS services. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed for 2017/18 represents 100% of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by the Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for 2017/18. 3.5.2 Participation in Clinical Audit and National Confidential Enquiries Commissioners, regulators and royal colleges all recognise clinical audit as an effective way to continually learn about the services we provide. Clinical audit is a quality improvement process that can be used to check whether a service is meeting the standards that people who use it should receive. It is also a valuable component of each health professional's knowledge and skills set to evidence how quality improvement is an integral part of their professional practice. Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201881 National confidential enquiries are undertaken to detect areas of deficiency in clinical practice and devise recommendations to resolve them. They are 'confidential' as details of the patients remain anonymous although reports of the overall findings are made public. The confidential enquiry process goes beyond audit as the details of each death or incident are critically reviewed by a team of experts to establish whether clinical standards were met and that the right clinical decisions were made in the circumstances. During 2017/18 five national clinical audits and two national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services that Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust provides.During that period, Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust participated in 100% national clinical audits and 100% national confidential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national confidential inquiries, which it was eligible to participate in. The national clinical audits and national confidential enquiries that Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust was eligible to participate in, and for which data collection was completed during 2017/18 are listed in Table 5 below, alongside the number of cases submitted to each audit or enquiry as a percentage of the number of registered cases required by the terms of that audit or enquiry.

Psychotropic medication is commonly used to calm a severely agitated patient in order to reduce the risk of imminent and serious violence to self or others, rather than to treat the underlying psychiatric condition. Use of medication in these circumstances is part of a comprehensive approach to managing disturbed behaviour, alongside other strategies for de-escalation and the use of therapies to assist patients who are agitated and unsettled. The importance of preventing and appropriately managing such behaviour is addressed by the NICE clinical guideline NG10: violence and aggression: short-term management in mental health, health and community settings. They define rapid tranquillisation as the 'use of medication by the parenteral route (usually intramuscular) if oral medication is not possible or appropriate and urgent sedation with medication is needed.'The audit findings were reviewed by the Trust's Medicines Management Committee. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE) recommend oral medication for behavioural disturbance, wherever possible, which our clinical teams implemented in 93% of cases. Clinical Directors have written to clinical teams to reiterate the importance of physical monitoring (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature) of the patient for at least every hour until there are no further concerns if ever intramuscular medication is administered. An improvement group has been established to review the Trust policy and to make any additional recommendations as necessary to ensure full compliance with the standards for the administration of intramuscular medication. The Trust is taking part in a re-audit organised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in March 2018. POMH-UK Report Topic 1g and 3d: Prescribing high dose and combined antipsychotics on adult psychiatric wards A high-dose is defined as a prescribed total daily dose of a single antipsychotic, which exceeds the upper limit stated in the British National Formulary (BNF), or a prescribed total daily dose of two or more antipsychotics, which exceeds the BNF maximum using the percentage method. The percentage method converts each drug dosage to a percentage of the respective maximum recommended dose; where the percentages added together are above 100%, this constitutes a 'high-dose'. While there is considerable evidence for the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of psychosis (Lehmann and Ban, 1997), there is no evidence to suggest that doses of antipsychotics higher than the recommended dosages are more effective than standard doses (Lehman et al, 1998).The audit findings were reviewed by the Trust's Medicines Management Committee. The results were positive and showed a high level of compliance with the NICE standards for prescribing high dose and combined antipsychotics on adult psychiatric wards. The Trust's Pharmacy team will undertake periodic local audits to monitor the level of compliance for high dose antipsychotic prescribing.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201883 The Trust also uses local clinical audit as a way of improving the quality of its services. A sample of 6 local clinical audits reviewed by the Trust in 2017/18 are set out in Table 7 below and it intends to take/has taken the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided:- Table 7: Local Clinical Audits reviewed in 2017/18 Title Action Taken/to be taken Health Visiting Antenatal Pathway To assess whether the antenatal pathway for the Health Visiting Service is followed so that women using this service receive clinically effective interventions in accordance with national guidance and Trust policy. The aim of this re-audit was to ensure that the recommendations from the audit undertaken in June 2016 had been implemented. The recommendation was for the Health Visitors to document on the antenatal reference card the date of discussion with the midwife / GP . 10 antenatal reference records were randomly selected from each Health Visiting Team equating to 50 records in total. The findings from the audit were positive and demonstrated the antenatal pathway for Health Visiting is being followed. There had been an improvement from 61% to 94 % of the records where the date of discussion with the midwife /GP had been documented in the antenatal reference cards. Whilst completing the audit, it was noted there was a difference between the electronic lists of pregnant women received from Dudley Group and the list of pregnant women received when the Health Visitor meets with the midwife. This anomaly will now be the subject of a future audit. Social Anxiety Disorder: Recognition, Assessment and Treatment for children and young people NICE Clinical Guideline (CG159) This audit was undertaken by Sandwell Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), to assess compliance with the guideline, and to identify any recommendations to improve their service for children and young people presenting with a social anxiety disorder. Ten sets of case notes were retrospectively audited against the twenty-nine standards of the guideline.The overall results indicated good compliance but three standards where further action was required to achieve full compliance:- Standard 7: Improving the identification and recording of \"safety-seeking\" behavioursStandard 15: The use of formal instruments to assess social anxiety symptoms, the service currently utilise a range of other tools e.g. HONOSCA and SDQ. Standard 27: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to include psychoeducation and skills training for parents Following a period to improve, the three standards will be re- audited to assess if compliance has been achieved. Record Keeping Audit This audit was undertaken by Walsall's Community Learning Disabilities teams. Two sets of notes for each practitioner were audited against forty-two standards based on Nursing & Midwifery Council standards and the requirements of the Trust's Record Keeping Policy in relation to documentation and assessments. A total of twenty notes were audited. The results of the audit revealed a good level of compliance for thirty-eight of the forty-two standards. Team leaders have discussed the four standards requiring further improvement, with staff who are not meeting the required standard and this will be monitored during supervision. A re-audit has been scheduled to measure improvement.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201884 Title Action Taken/to be taken Standards of practice and communication between Learning Disabilities psychiatric services and local GPs This audit was undertaken by Learning Disabilities Psychiatrists in Wolverhampton. The purpose of the audit was to assess compliance against the Royal College of Psychiatry standard for sending outpatient letters to GPs, to improve the quality of letters where possible and so improve communication with local GPs.An initial audit was undertaken of twenty cases which identified deficiencies in the documentation of essential clinical information. Changes were recommended and implemented. An unannounced re-audit of sixty cases was subsequently undertaken to complete the audit cycle and ascertain whether standards had improved. The re-audit revealed significant improvements on key parameters:-- ICD-10 code documented from 0% (0/20) to assessment from 10% 100% Changes to medication (13/20) to 98% (59/60) The impact of dysphagia awareness training on everyday practice This audit was undertaken by the Older Adult Mental Health Speech and Language Therapy Team. The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) highlight that one of the key roles for Speech and Language Therapists working in dementia care is providing training in dysphagia. Dysphagia is the clinical term for swallowing difficulties. The RCSLT states that 'It is crucial that those responsible for providing food and drink to people with dysphagia have the necessary understanding to follow the recommendations from a swallow assessment. The aim of the audit was to assess the impact of dysphagia awareness training on staff behaviour/practice during mealtimes5 key standards based on dysphagia awareness training session content were audited. 15 mealtimes were randomly selected for the audit, 7 at breakfast and 8 at lunchtime. The results showed good compliance with three of the standards with the following action taken to improve adherence:-- At every handover, ward staff to be reminded of patients' swallow recommendations, where to refer to for information and signs of difficulty with swallowing and eating/drinking to look out for - Additional time in training spent on food/fluid consistencies to support staff to identify correct consistencies/increase awareness - Staff reminded to ensure they report all incidents for diet/fluid consistency errors in order to support the ward manager to identify which members of staff require more training and/or additional support - Re-audit to be undertaken to measure improvement NICE Clinical Guideline CG133: Longer-term care and treatment of self-harm in adults Self-harm refers to any act of self-poisoning or self-injury carried out by an individual irrespective of motivation; self-harm is associated with many mental health disorders. The aim of the audit was to measure current practice in the longer-term management of self-harm against the recommendations in the NICE guideline and to identify areas for improvement in order to enhance patient care and services.15 patients with a history of self-harm were selected for the audit. Four standards in respect of each patient's care plan were the focus of the audit. The results of the audit showed that in every case, the aims of longer-term treatment were discussed and agreed with each individual and documented in the care plan and shared with their GP . Please refer to section 3.7.2.1 for a more detailed description of the work undertaken on self-harm during 2017/18Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201885 Clinical Audit improvement action plans are monitored by the four divisional quality and safety groups that cover Trust services; each group is chaired by a Clinical Director. 3.5.3 Participation in Clinical Research Research enables the NHS to improve the current and future health of the people it cares for. 'Clinical research' is research that has received a favourable opinion from a research ethics committee, to ensure the interests of those who participate have been fully considered and protected. The Trust continues to be research active and has an established Research and Innovation Group which meets every month. Senior clinicians attend representing their different services and professions. The Trust is a member of the Clinical Research Network, West Midlands and this collaborative approach enables the Trust to participate in national large-scale research projects, to improve the quality of care we offer and to contribute to the wider health economy. The Clinical Research Network, West Midlands set a target of 304 for the number of participants voluntarily taking part in national large-scale research projects in 2017/18. The number of patients receiving NHS services provided by Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee was 412 (136%) - see Figure 3 below. The Clinical Research Network (CRN), West Midlands, part of the National Institute for Health Research, supplied this information. Figure 3: Recruitment of voluntary patients taking part in clinical research network projects Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201886 3.5.3.1 Patients' stories of taking part in research Edwin, who receives services from the Trust took part in our DAPA (Dementia and Physical Activity) research project about the impact of exercise on dementia. Edwin said, \"Being part of this research has helped me and I am happy to share my experience with others. Before I took part in the research I was provided with lots of information that gave me the confidence to say 'yes' and take part in the trial. I was happy to do it. I decided to take part as I could get out of the house and I enjoyed the company of the exercise group. I got on well with the other people who attended the group. The physiotherapist who ran the group was lovely and even telephoned me after the trial had finished to see how I was after I'd been in hospital. The research has helped me to get out of the house and see other people, which also took my mind off my health problems. The physical exercises were beneficial to my body as well. It didn't cost me anything to take part in the trial as transport was paid for and we sometimes had free refreshments at the exercise class as well. As part of the trial, I had to complete memory tasks at home, which didn't take up too much time and it took my mind off things. I was happy to do the memory tasks and I was happy that the researcher visited me. The instructions for the memory tasks and at the exercise group were easy to follow and I cannot fault them. I would definitely recommend taking part in research to friends and family\" Barry and Judy from Wolverhampton were invited to take part in the MADE (Minocycline in Alzheimer's Disease Efficacy) research trial by a nurse at the memory clinic that Barry attends. They had never taken part in research before and were not aware of medication trials for dementia but after discussing it with the research team and Barry's consultant agreed to take part. Every day Barry remembered what trial tablet he had to take in the morning, and which one to take in the evening. Judy explained that it was hard to tell if the trial medication had an impact on Barry, as he had been having a slight decline in memory for the last two years but felt the daily routine of taking the medication was helpful. Overall Barry and Judy had a positive experience of the MADE trial and in particular they both enjoyed the regular contact with the research team at the hospital and during home visits. Judy told us that being involved in the trial meant a lot to them and how nice it was to deal with such friendly and kind staff. When asked about taking part in research again and recommending research to others, both Barry and Judy agreed they would be involved in studies again, and would encourage people with dementia and their families to take part. 3.5.3.2 Journal of Geriatric Care and Research Dr. Nilamadhab Kar, Consultant Psychiatrist at Penn Hospital, Wolverhampton, edits this international research journal covering all areas related to the care of the elderly. The journal is affiliated to the international Geriatric Care and Research Organisation and publishes articles from all fields relevant to old age such as geriatric medicine, psychiatry, neurology, nursing, end of life care, public health and related fields like gerontology, sociology, psychology, culture and law. 3.5.3.3 Research celebrated in Annual Event Colleagues and service users from across Black Country Partnership, Dudley and Walsall Mental Health and Birmingham Community Healthcare gathered together to attend the Research and Innovation Annual Event at The Village Hotel, Dudley. The annual event provides a chance to showcase research taking place across the three Trusts, promote research involvement and innovation and for guest speakers to update on the progress of studies. The day also hosts the R&I annual awards and celebrates the research successes throughout the year.

A proportion of each NHS provider's total contract value is made conditional on the provider achieving nationally agreed quality improvements with their commissioners. A proportion of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's income in 2017/18 was conditional on achieving quality improvement and innovation goals agreed between Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and any person or body they entered into a contract, agreement or arrangement with for the provision of relevant health services, through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Payment Framework (CQUIN).

The CQC regulates, monitors and inspects hospitals, general practices and other care services, to make sure they provide people with safe, effective and high-quality care. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission and its current registration status is registered with no conditions attached to the registration. The Care Quality Commission has not taken enforcement action against Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust during the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2018.Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has not participated in any reviews by the Care Quality Commission during the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2018. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust did not receive an inspection by the Care Quality Commission during the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2018. Table 10 below shows the ratings given by the Care Quality Commission published in February 2017. Table 10: CQC Ratings Grid Services shown as 'not rated' in the grid were assessed as 'good' in the previous inspection.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201890 Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has addressed all but one of the issues the CQC rated as 'requires improvement', further details can be found in our 2016/17 Quality Report. There are two longer-term projects which will continue into 2018/19:- The introduction of electronic health records - the Board of Directors Board have agreed to progress this in collaboration with Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust in order that the introduction of electronic health records will take place in 2018 3.5.6 Data Quality Data is generally considered high quality if it is fit for its intended uses in operations, decision-making and planning to provide better patient care, wellbeing and safety. Poor data quality puts organisations at significant risk of weakening frontline service delivery incurring financial loss and providing poor value for money. 3.5.6.1 NHS Number and General Medical Practice Code Validity Everyone registered with the NHS has a unique patient identifier called NHS Number, which helps healthcare staff and service providers identify each person correctly and match their details to their health records, to ensure they receive safe and efficient care. The General Medical Practice Code is the organisation code of the GP Practice that each patient is registered with. The Secondary Uses Service is the single comprehensive repository for healthcare data in England. When a patient is treated or cared for information is collected which supports their treatment. This information is also useful to commissioners and providers of NHS-funded care for 'secondary' purposes i.e. purposes other than direct or 'primary' clinical care such as healthcare planning, commissioning of services and development of national policy. Hospital Episode Statistics is a data warehouse containing details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and A&E attendances at NHS hospitals in England. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has submitted records during 2017/18 to the Secondary Uses Service for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics which are included in the latest published data. The percentage of records in the published data, which included the patient's valid NHS number and General Medical Practice Code are provided in Tables 11 and 12 below. April 2017 - March 201891 3.5.6.2 Information Governance Assessment Report Information governance is the way in which the NHS handles all of its information particularly personal and sensitive information relating to patients and staff. Good information governance means the public can depend on their data being handled legally, securely and effectively in order to deliver the best possible care. The information governance assessment report is an online system, which allows NHS organisations to assess themselves annually against forty-five requirements set by NHS Digital. The online system allows the public to view overall percentage scores and grade for each NHS organisation's published assessment. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's Information Governance Assessment Report overall score for 2017/18 was 70% and was graded green. The results of the assessment are provided in Table 13 below. Table 13: Information Governance Assessment Report Initiative2013/14 Coding Error Rate Clinical coding translates the medical terminology written by clinicians to describe a patient's diagnosis, treatment, or reason for seeking medical attention, into standard, recognised codes. The accuracy of this coding is a fundamental indicator of the accuracy of patient records. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to a Payment by Results clinical coding audit. The Trust still commissions an independent clinical coding audit of inpatient records every year to check that diagnosis and procedures are coded correctly and consistently across the Trust. The audit covered adult mental health, older adult mental health and learning disabilities services. The results of the audit are provided in Table 14 below. Table 14: Clinical Coding Error Rate Clinical Coding 2013/14 2014/15 Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201892 The clinical coding results should not be extrapolated further than the actual sample size audited. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality:- Joint procurement of an Electronic Health Record with Dudley & Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust including:o pre migration data cleansing o alignment of configuration and documentation across services and localities Assess and implement a new data warehouse and data reporting tool to ensure data is processed and reported consistently 3.5.7 Learning from Deaths A review by the Care Quality Commission in 2016, found there was no single framework for NHS trusts that sets out what they need to do to maximise learning from deaths that may be the result of problems in care. There were a range of systems and processes in place but practice varied widely across providers. As a result, learning from deaths was not always given enough consideration in the NHS and opportunities to improve care for future patients were often missed. Following the review, all NHS trusts are required to ensure their processes give due focus to the review, investigation and reporting of deaths, including those deaths that are determined more likely than not to have resulted from problems in care. There is no standard definition of an avoidable death and each trust makes its own judgment but each trust is required to use the same methodology to determine whether a death was preventable or not. During the period 1 April to 31 March 2018, 321 of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 59 in the first quarter; 69 in the second quarter; 83 in the third quarter and 110 in the fourth quarter. By 31 March 2018, 0 case record reviews and 24 investigations have been carried out in relation to 24 of the deaths recorded above. In 0 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was 4 in the first quarter; 7 in the second quarter; 6 in the third quarter and 7 in the fourth quarter. NHS Improvement in their publication 'Detailed Requirements for Quality Reports 2017/18' have requested that the statements in the table below are also included and for the Trust to report on this information. [Number] representing % of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: [Number] representing % for the first quarter; [Number] representing % for the second quarter; [Number] representing % for the third quarter. These numbers have been estimated using the [name, and brief explanation of the methods used in the case record review or investigation]. A summary of what the provider has learnt from case record reviews and investigations conducted in relation to the deaths identified above. A description of the actions which the provider has taken in the reporting period, and proposes to take following the reporting period, in consequence of what the provider has learnt during the reporting period. An assessment of the impact of the actions described above which were taken by the provider during the reporting period. [Number] representing [number as percentage of number of the relevant document for the previous reporting period]% of the patient deaths before the reporting period, are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. This number has been estimated using the [name, and brief explanation of the methods used in the case record review or investigation]. [Number] representing [number as percentage of number of the relevant document for the previous reporting period]% of the patient deaths during [the previous reporting period] are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201893 We are unable to provide the information requested in the statements above as we do not carry out investigations with a view to determining whether the death was wholly or partly due to problems in the care provided to the patient. The purpose of the investigations we do carry out, called root cause analyses (RCAs), is for learning and to understand what we can do differently in future rather than to determine whether problems in care directly caused a death. The new policy therefore requires an additional judgment to be made once an investigation is complete. The Royal College of Psychiatrists have been commissioned by NHS England to propose a methodology to provide clarity about how mental health services should interpret this aspect of an investigation but this will not be concluded until later in 2018.3.6 Reporting against Core Quality Indicators In this section, we report our performance against a core set of quality indicators using data made available to the Trust by NHS Digital, the national provider of health care information in England. NHS Improvement, the regulator for NHS foundation trusts, has refreshed the list of indicators from previous years. Table 15 below provides a summary of the indicators for 2017/18. A more detailed explanation and analysis of each indicator is also set out below. Table 15: Core Quality Indicators 2017/18 Target Achieved Patients on Care Programme Approach followed up within 7 days of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care95% 98.6% Admissions to inpatient services that had access to the Crisis Resolution Team prior to admission95% 99.6% Patients aged 16 years or over re-admitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge <15.3% 13.9% Patient experience of community mental health services - - Patient safety incidents and the percentage that resulted in severe harm or death (there is no specific target, the percentage is the national average)1.0% 0.2% 3.6.1 Patients on Care Programme Approach followed up within 7 days of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care The Care Programme Approach (CPA) is a method used by mental health professionals to assess, plan and review someone's mental health care needs. All patients on CPA discharged from psychiatric inpatient care to their place of residence, care home, or residential accommodation must be followed up within 7 days of discharge, either by face to face contact or by telephone to reduce the risk of neglect, self-harm, or suicide. The national target for this indicator is to follow up 95% of patients within 7 days which the Trust achieved for all four quarters of the year. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described in Table 16 on next page for the following reasons:- - this information has been supplied by NHS Digital (columns 4-7) - in line with Board assurance requirements, the Trust is required to publish internally reported information for this indicator (column 3*). There can be a slight variance between internally reported information and that available from NHS England Statistics website due to post-submission validation arrangements Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201894 Table 16: Percentage of patients followed up within 7 days of discharge Reporting PeriodsNational TargetBCPFT achievedBCPFT achieved*National AverageHighest Trust Lowest 98.1% 93.7% Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this percentage and so the quality of its services by:- o ensuring our staff understand the clinical evidence underpinning this target and are committed to maintaining a high level of compliance o promote the standard operating procedure in place that clearly explains the roles and responsibilities for both community and inpatient staff in respect of 7 day follow up o continue to monitor performance each month and review those occasions where follow up has not been possible to see if we could do anything differently in the future. 3.6.2 Admissions to inpatient services that had access to the Crisis Resolution Team prior to admission Crisis Resolution teams (CRT) offer intensive short-term support for people in mental health crises in their own home to prevent hospital admissions to a psychiatric inpatient ward. The national target for this indicator is for teams to assess 95% of all patients prior to their admission to a psychiatric inpatient ward, which the Trust achieved for all four quarters of 2017/18. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described in Table 17 be low for the following reasons:- - the information below has been supplied by NHS Digital (columns 4-7) - in line with Board assurance requirements, the Trust is required to publish internally reported information for this indicator (column 3*). There can be a slight variance between internally reported information and that available from NHS England Statistics website due to post-submission validation arrangements. Table 17: Percentage of Admissions to psychiatric inpatient wards via Crisis Teams Reporting PeriodsNational TargetBCPFT achieved*BCPFT achievedNational AverageHighest Trust Lowest 99.6% April 2017 - March 201895 Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this percentage and so the quality of its services by:- o continuing to monitor this indicator and review any occasion where this did not happen as we aim to achieve 100% every quarter 3.6.3 Patients aged 16 years or over re-admitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge Some patients discharged from an inpatient stay can find themselves back in hospital within a short period. Some of these re-admissions may be planned; others part of the natural course of treatment for specific conditions but most hospital re-admissions are thought of as avoidable and indicators of poor care or missed opportunities to better co-ordinate care. This indicator is to help trusts monitor potentially avoidable re-admissions by reporting their performance throughout the year. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described in Table 18 below for the following reasons:- - it is based on a locally produced percentage in the absence of information available from NHS Digital - we are therefore unable to compare our performance against other trusts for this indicator - NHS Improvement do not provide a national target for this indicator and local commissioners no longer monitor our performance so the Trust uses an internal target of less than 15.3% to monitor this indicator Table 18: Re-admissions within 28 days Reporting PeriodsLocal TargetBCPFT Achieved Qtr. 4 January - March 2018 3 October - December - - June 2017 <15.3% 14.6% Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this percentage and so the quality of its services by:- o ensuring that discharge planning and community treatment following discharge are kept under continual review to look at ways to minimise the chance of a re-admission being required 3.6.4 Patient experience of community mental health services Every year, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) undertakes a national survey of community mental health services across England by sending out a questionnaire to a representative sample of people, to obtain their views on the service they receive from their local mental health provider. The survey assesses people's experiences of the care and support they receive such as in clinics and in their own homes for conditions ranging from mild depression to psychosis. The survey asks for their views on aspects of their care such as whether they felt they were treated with dignity and respect and whether they felt involved in decisions about their care. Black Country Partnership has always taken part in the survey but the CQC were unable to include the Trust in the survey for 2017. The Trust has always operated with two different patient administration systems in Sandwell and Wolverhampton but during 2016 the data was migrated on to one system. The CQC recognises that it is good practice for trusts to employ consent systems to record the wishes of service users around the use of their personal information. However, following the migration of data, the CQC concluded that a bias would be introduced to the survey results due to the apparent number of service users who had Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201896 indicated they did not wish to be included and decided it was best if we did not take part this year to clarify this anomaly. Following the decision by the CQC, the Trust reviewed its processes to ensure it would be eligible to take part in the 2018 survey. A new process was introduced so the patient administration system shows all community mental health patients 'opting in' unless they specifically ask their clinician to be \"opted out\" from mailing. A new flag was created on the system for clinical staff to be able to record patients who want to 'opt out' of taking part. A notification was sent to all clinical staff detailing the new method and how this could be put into practice. Clinical staff working in community teams were asked to check when they next saw a patient what the 'opt out' status should be and update the patient administration system via the new flag if anyone still does not wish to receive communications by post. Workforce training on the patient administration system for new and existing clinical staff was reviewed to highlight the importance of accurately recording the 'opt in' and 'opt out' communication status. The 'opt out' rate is now continually monitored through the number of community patients seen each month in preparation for the 2018 community survey. Posters were displayed in all public facing areas such as receptions and consultation rooms across the Trust to promote participation in the 2018 Community Mental Health Survey but also to inform those patients eligible for the survey if they do not wish to take part of their right to opt out. Following these actions, the CQC has confirmed our eligibility to take part in the 2018 survey.3.6.5 Patient safety incidents and the percentage that resulted in severe harm or death The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) is a central database of patient safety incident reports. All NHS trusts are required to report patient safety incidents to the NRLS every week. All information submitted is analysed to identify hazards, risks and opportunities to continuously improve the safety of patient care. This greater level of transparency provides an opportunity for the NHS at both local and national level to share experiences and learn from them. NRLS publish this information every six months in March and September. This indicator covers patient safety incident reports for all incidents including those that resulted in severe harm or death. The target for this indicator is to be below the national average for the percentage of incidents that resulted in severe harm or death. Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described in Tables 19 and 20 below for the following reasons:- - this information is provided independently by NHS England and offers a comparison of the Trust's performance against forty seven other mental health providers across England - the information provided covers the period 1 October 2016 - 30 September 2017 as more current data was not available from NHS England - the approach taken to determine the classification of each incident will often rely on clinical judgement so this judgement may, acceptably, differ between health professionals - the classification of the impact of an incident may be subject to a lengthy investigation which may result in the classification being changed; this change may not be reported so the data held by a trust may differ to that held by NRLS Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201897 Table 19: Patient safety incidents resulting in severe harm or death Oct 16 - Mar 17 Reporting period: 1 October 2016 - 31 March 2017 Patient safety incidents that resulted in severe harm or deathTotal Number of Reported IncidentsReporting Rate per 1000 bed daysNo. resulting in severe harm or death% resulting in severe harm or death Black Country Partnership 863 27.8 8 0.9% National Average 3,126 46.6 36 1.2% Trust 3,912 77.4 2 0.1% Table 20: Patient safety incidents resulting in severe harm or death April - Sept 17 Reporting period: 1 April 2017 - 30 September 2017 Patient safety incidents that resulted in severe harm or deathTotal Number of Reported IncidentsReporting Rate per 1000 bed daysNo. resulting in severe harm or death% resulting in severe harm or death Black Country Partnership 1,652 54.6 2 0.2% National Average 3,159 47.6 33 1.0% Trust 57 3.7% Trust 2,253 42.4 1 0.0% Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to improve the above percentages and so the quality of its services by:- o A review of the data submitted to NRLS for the period 1 October 2016 - 31 March 2017 shown in Table 19 above indicated that the Trust's low patient safety incident reporting rate was due to an administration error, whereby low harm and no harm incidents were deemed not to meet the criteria for uploading to NRLS. Following a review of our internal processes, the uploading of incidents is monitored every week to ensure consistency with the application of the NRLS criteria. Table 20 above shows a return to previous reporting rates for the period 1 April 2017 - 30 September 2017. o All serious incidents are reported to our commissioners and regulators via the Strategic Executive Information System (STEIS), NHS England's web-based serious incident management system. The Trust will continue to work with local commissioners and regulators to learn lessons and to prevent the likelihood of recurrence of harm o The Trust has established a Mortality Review Group to oversee the introduction of a new policy for identifying, reporting, investigating and learning from deaths in care, setting out the process for staff to follow to ensure all deaths are reviewed appropriatelyQuality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201898 Part Three 3.7 Reporting against Local Quality Indicators In this section of the report, we present information on our performance against three local indicators for each of the three recognised domains of quality - patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience as set out in Table 21 below. Table 21: Local Quality Indicators 2017/18 Domain Indicator Patient Safety Influenza Vaccinations Patient Safety Thermometer Infection Prevention and Control Clinical Effectiveness Self-harm Improving services for people with mental health needs who present to Accident & Emergency Transitions out of Children and Young People's Mental Health Services Patient Experience Complaints Friends and Family Test Patient Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) Following the theme of previous years, the Board of Directors in consultation with stakeholders, provide a mix of new and established indicators to reflect both their ongoing priorities and to highlight progress on other quality initiatives. Data from previous year(s) are provided for each indicator where applicable to give greater context, and where possible, data provided from an independent source has been used. The results of our performance against all nine indicators are set out below:- 3.7.1 Patient Safety 3.7.1.1 Influenza Vaccinations The Department of Health and Social Care recommends that healthcare workers directly involved in patient care are vaccinated annually; it is also encouraged by the General Medical Council and by the British Medical Association. This year it has been particularly important with Public Health England revealing that since the beginning of this year's flu season, the number of cases is almost 10 times higher than the same point in 2015 with more than 1.7m patients seen by GPs across the country during this flu season.The Trust began planning well in advance for this year's flu vaccinations taking the following actions:- We teamed up with our TCT partners to share best practice, exchange ideas and produce promotional materials to be used across all three organisations - A flu coordinator was recruited for the first time to help with the flu campaign - Jane Ridd (pictured with Non-Executive Director, Fayaz Malik) - Patient Group Directions were authorised i.e. written instructions by which specific medicines can be supplied and administered without a doctor - A 'Health and Wellbeing Day' was held on 28 September 2017 to officially launch the flu vaccination programme - A Flu Vaccination Tour Bus visited the different sites across the Trust to make it easier for staff to receive their vaccination - A monthly draw for the prize of an extra day's annual leave was held for the first four months of the campaign to incentivise staff to be vaccinated - The Trust's electronic staff records (ESR) system was utilised for the first time to identify any teams/sites/services where there was less uptake so extra effort could be directed to these areasQuality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 201899 - As part of the incentive to encourage staff vaccination, the Trust is helping children around the world by making a donation to UNICEF for their 'get a jab, give a jab campaign' and we are pleased to have contributed over 5,700 vaccines. Table 22 below shows the success of these initiatives and the progress made over the last three years encouraging staff to receive their influenza vaccination. Table 22: Staff Vaccination Rates Year % of staff vaccinated 2017-18 70.1% 2016-17 60.6% 2015-16 38.1% 3.7.1.2 Patient Safety Thermometer The Patient Safety Thermometer is a national initiative used by our frontline staff to check basic levels of care to identify where things are going wrong and take action. It is called a 'safety thermometer' because it is a quick and simple method to measure and track the proportion of patients in our care with the 'four harms' of:- 1. Pressure ulcers (bedsores) are ulcerated areas of skin caused by irritation and continuous pressure on part of the body. They can be very painful and can take a long time to heal. They can look different so they are graded depending on their severity ranging from grade 1 to grade 4, the most severe. 2. Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are infections that can occur in the kidneys, the tubes that that take urine from the kidneys to the bladder or in the bladder. The longer a 'catheter tube' remains in place, the more likely an infection is to develop. To reduce the incidence, we monitor all patients with urinary catheters very closely and ensure that staff follow national best practice guidelines. 3. Falls a fall is defined as unintentionally coming to rest on the ground, the floor, or a lower level regardless of whether or not an injury has occurred that takes place mainly within inpatient settings 4. Venous thromboembolisms often referred to as VTEs (a patient may be defined as having a new VTE if they are being treated for a deep vein thrombosis (a blood clot in the calf), pulmonary embolism, (blood clot in the lung) or any other recognised type of VTE with appropriate therapy such as anticoagulants (medication to prevent the blood from clotting). We successfully surveyed all at risk patients in all appropriate settings on a set day in each month and all our submissions were received by the NHS Information Centre. We achieved above 95% of all patients who were 'harm free' for the four harms explained above for every month during 2017/18. NHS Improvement provides the information in Tables 23 and 24 below independently of the Trust.

We want our patients to feel they are safe and receiving the best possible healthcare with us. While the risk of an infection is small, continuing to reduce the risk of infections remains of paramount importance. The Trust has a zero tolerance to healthcare associated infections. Our Infection Prevention and Control Team use a surveillance system to monitor and record data on Alert Organisms and Alert Conditions found in the patients that we care for. Alert organisms and alert conditions are those that may give rise to outbreaks. The tables below are based on locally produced information in the absence of information available from an independent source. Alert Organisms are those bacteria responsible for several difficult to treat infections in humans e.g. MRSA, MSSA & E-Coli bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile diagnosed through laboratory tests. Preventing outbreaks depends on prompt recognition of one or more infections with alert organisms and instituting special control measures to reduce the risk of spread of the organism. Table 25 below shows our performance. Table 25: Alert Organisms YearMRSA BacteraemiaE Coli BacteraemiaMSSA BacteraemiaClostridium Difficile 2017/18 0 0 0 2016/17 0 0 0 0 2015/16 0 0 0 0 Alert Conditions are identified through clinical diagnosis, not laboratory tests and staff in clinical areas alert the infection prevention and control team of any suspected occurrence of these conditions at the earliest opportunity. Alert conditions include chickenpox, shingles, diarrhoea, vomiting, mumps, measles, and scabies. The most challenging alert condition for the Trust continues to be cases of diarrhoea and vomiting as recorded in Table 26 below. Table 26: Diarrhoea and Vomiting Cases Year Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 Totals 2017/18 3 5 4 16 28 2016/17 4 7 6 12 29 2015/16 26 4 1 7 38 Between 600,000 and 1 million people in the UK catch Norovirus every year, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug, the most common stomach bug in the UK, which can affect people of all ages. As there are so many different strains, we do not develop immunity and staff are equally susceptible as patients. The classification of an outbreak of a serious infectious illness occurs when an unusual number of patients with similar symptoms present in the same area or with a shared exposure. A marker for diarrhoea or vomiting outbreak is 2 or more patients with the same symptoms in the same area within 24 to 48 hours or 3 or more patients within one month. Respiratory viruses such as Seasonal Influenza and Rhinovirus (common cold) occur worldwide and can quickly spread in a closed environment such as a hospital. Table 27 below shows our performance:Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018101 Table 27: No. of Outbreaks of Serious Infection Illness Year Quarter 1 Quarter 2 Quarter 3 Quarter 4 2017/18 0 0 0 1 2016/17 0 0 0 0 2015/16 0 0 0 0 Our Infection Prevention and Control Team manage all outbreaks of infection. Weekly surveillance helps with the early identification of potentially transmissible infections enabling early implementation of prevention and control measures to limit spread. There was 1 outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting (presumed Norovirus) in Quarter 4 affecting 9 patients and 7 members of staff. This resulted in the closure of the affected ward for a period of 9 days. In the case of possible/confirmed outbreaks specific actions are taken in order to try and contain such infections and minimize the risk to patients, staff and visitors:- - Closure of affected ward/unit(s) to stop the spread of the outbreak until all patients and staff are symptom free for at least 48 hours - Isolation of affected patients to their rooms as much as reasonably practical - Staff use of personal protective equipment e.g. aprons and gloves for all contact with affected patients and/or their immediate environment - Minimise as much as possible the movement of patients and staff between affected and unaffected areas - Observation of practice undertaken to ensure the risks of transmission is reduced as far as possible - Communications to all staff and visitors informing them of a potential or confirmed outbreak and advice on minimising the risk of transmission to themselves and others - Thorough cleaning of affected areas using the most effective chlorine releasing disinfectant, through liaison with the Facilities Team - Strict hand hygiene for all patients, staff & visitors, before meals, after toileting, before and after any patient/environment contact and before entering and leaving the ward - using soap & water. - Detailed investigations and tests for each outbreak to determine where possible the cause of the outbreaks3.7.2 Clinical Effectiveness 3.7.2.1 Self-harm Self-harm is a broad term to describe behaviour associated with a range of other symptoms and psychological disorders which results in acts that cause personal harm. Patients who engage in self-harm behaviour do so for a range of different reasons including, as a demonstration of anger, a way of finding relief and distraction from significant and unrelenting life problems, or difficulties managing a range of emotions, including anxiety, sadness, shame, guilt and humiliation. Self-harm is poorly understood in society and even people who regularly encounter cases of self-harm through the course of their work such as social workers, police officers and health professionals may find the care of people who have harmed themselves particularly challenging. The management of self-harm behaviours is a difficult and emotive aspect of giving care. All incidents of self-harm including the level of severity are reported and recorded on the Trust's incident reporting system. Patient safety monitoring of self-harm incidents showed there were notable differences in rates of self-harm incidents across psychiatric wards. We decided to investigate the rates of self-harm occurring across psychiatric wards and to review the Trust's 'Management of Self Harm' Guidelines produced two years ago, to investigate whether they provide a useful framework for staff. A number of methods were used to achieve these aims including a detailed analysis of local incident reporting, discussions with groups of ward staff, medical staff and interviews with managers, modern matrons and the lead nurse. Patients used a variety of ways to self-harm across all wards including cutting or scratching, ligature tying, self-poisoning or burning. For every incident Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018102 reported, staff are required to rate the severity of each incident from level 1 (negligible) through levels 2 (minor), 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe). Most incidents across all wards were rated at levels 1 or 2. Table 28 below shows the breakdown of severity by ward and for 329 out of 334 incidents i.e. 98.5%, the level of harm was assessed as negligible or minor in severity.

Incident reporting of these events supported this impression that often one patient was accounting for many of the episodes. An analysis of incident rates on Dale Ward showed that just three patients accounted for 76% of the self-harm incidents between March and June on that ward. There was no evidence suggesting that the clustering was related to particular staff factors such as sickness or annual leave. Incident reporting data showed that patients used a wide variety of everyday objects to carry out their self-harm. Examples included a catheter belt, a strip of towel, a jumper lace, a ring pull off a can of pop, a bin liner, broken plastic spoons, torn bed sheets, underwear, clothing, a broken pen and a comb. Staff adopt a mixture of two separate approaches to the management of self-harm, a protective approach and a therapeutic approach. A protective approach involves direct actions such as close observation, room searches, removal of potentially harmful objects and patient searches on return from leave. A therapeutic relationship with patients allows patients to build trust and ventilate their feelings so they are more likely to talk to staff first before they self-harm. During the assessment of the Trust's guidelines, when staff who had not read them were asked to describe what they would find helpful to have in self-harm guidance, they cited content that already exists in the current guidelines. The review found the guidelines are in line with national and professional guidance, they were evidence based and provide a useful framework for staff assessing, formulating and managing self-harm in ward environments. We plan to relaunch the Trust's 'Management of Self Harm' Guidelines to ensure they are embedded into current practice and support staff to develop their knowledge and confidence when dealing with people who self-harm. Our patient safety team will continue to monitor all incidents of self-harm and investigate any rise in the number of incidents3.7.2.2 Improving services for people with mental health needs who present to Accident & Emergency People with mental ill health are three times more likely to present to Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments than the general population. Bridging the gap between physical and mental health care is essential as a busy, often noisy, emergency department can be a frightening and disorientating place for a person suffering a mental health crisis. Black Country Partnership provides dedicated mental health liaison staff to support the A&E departments at Sandwell General Hospital and Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital, who are able to manage a diverse range of mental health problems. Evidence from a range of sources suggests that while these services really help people with mental health problems there is still further work to do to reduce the frequency with which a significant number continue to attend A&E. They typically include people with complex mental health needs, older people with a combination of multiple and deteriorating physical health problems, people with complex social needs including housing, domestic violence, loneliness/social isolation and financial difficulties. Together with our partners, we wanted to introduce a new era of working collaboratively to reduce frequent attenders. We decided to identify those people who attended each A&E most frequently during 2016/17 (people who attended 10-15 times or more making adjustments for deaths, relocations out of area etc.) Improving collaboration with A&E departments and our other partners e.g. police, ambulance, social care, the voluntary sector, to provide a more integrated service has the potential to reduce the number of attendances by those people who attend A&E departments most frequently. The benefits could include improved health and social outcomes for this group, reduced healthcare usage and a reduction in avoidable pressures on A&E departments and GP services. Abbie Gogarty, the Trust's clinical project lead, attended a national conference at the Birmingham City Football Club ground in October 2017, to present the Trust's strategy to reduce frequent attendance to A&E departments by patients with mental health problems. Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018104 Abbie said, \"The conference which featured delegates from all over the country created a lively discussion on this topic and it was a great opportunity to share good practice and talk about how we can work together to overcome these challenges.\" Working with our partners, Abbie identified a subset of people who attended 10-15 times or more during 2016/17 to set a baseline as shown in Tables 30 and 31 below. Table 30: Frequent Attenders Sandwell General Hospital Number of patients of attendances 2016-17 Table 31: Frequent New Hospital of patients Subset Number of attendances 2016-17 483 The number of attendances to A&E by this selected group of frequent attenders in 2017-18 and 2016-17 are shown in Tables 32 and 33 below. Two patients left the area during 2017/18 requiring a re-calculation of the number of attendances in 2016/17 to reflect this. Table 32: Reduction in attendances Sandwell General Hospital Number of attendances 2016-17 284 Number of attendances 20% Table 33: Reduction in attendances New Cross Hospital of in 419 Number 311 Reduction in no. of attendances 26%The results indicate that through collaboration with our partners and providing frequent attenders with alternative options to going to A&E departments, a 20% reduction in the number of attendances was achieved. We will continue to work with our partner agencies and organisations to build on this progress. 3.7.2.3 Transitions out of Children and Young People's Mental Health Services We use the term 'transition' to describe the process of preparing, planning and moving young people from young people's mental health services to adult mental health services. The age of transition can vary with most young people transitioning at 18 years of age. The point of transition can be a time of potential upheaval for young people, who may find it difficult to manage their mental health following discharge, or the move into adult mental health services. It is a vulnerable point in their development as they leave secondary education, move towards more independent living and gain legal responsibility for their choices. We decided to review our processes to ensure this group of young people are properly prepared for their transition. The aim was to improve young people's experience of transition and the outcomes for them during this difficult period in their lives. We started by developing a transition pack, with a step by step guide, standard referral template and transition checklist to improve the transition process. We refreshed our implementation plan so that once it is appropriate for a young person to transition to adult mental health services, the clinician within young people's mental health service starts the transition process at least 6 months beforehand, to ensure a gradual and smooth transition. A joint meeting is arranged for the most complex/ high risk cases between consultants and clinical managers from young people's mental health service and adult mental health services. If the young person is on a 'child in need' or 'child protection' plan the will liaise with the 'safeguarding lead' for adult mental health services so that automatic transfer of safeguarding responsibility takes place. Young people with lower level mental health needs are supported by psychological interventions such as Improving Access to Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018105 Psychological Services (IAPT). Those with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requiring continuing mental health care are referred to Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust, who have a specialist service for treating adults with ADHD. All young people with a learning disability are referred to the Trust's adult learning disabilities services; for the most complex cases, a joint meeting is arranged with the adult learning disabilities team, with a specialist liaison nurse in attendance specifically to support each young person. During the period September 2017 to March 2018 twelve young people transitioned out of young people's services to a specialist adult mental health service. We carried out an audit of their case notes to check how well transitioning had been implemented. a) 100% of young people approaching transition who had been with young people's mental health services longer than six months had a meeting to prepare for transition at least six months before transitioning. However for those who were less than six months from transition age when they came under young people's services only 40% had a meeting at least one month before transition. b) A transitional meeting should include the young person, the appropriate key worker and where appropriate and the young person agrees, the young person's parent(s)/carer(s). One young person whose mental health deteriorated at transition asked to be excused so their parents attended on their behalf while another young person requested for professionals to meet without wanting to be present. There were two cases where medical staff made referrals via telephone and letter without a pre-meeting with the young person and arrangements were subsequently made for this to take place post transition. c) 92% of the transition plans audited included the young person's personal transition goals and the contact details of the key worker had been shared with the young person. d) 75% of transitions plans contained evidence that they had been agreed and signed off by the young person, or where appropriate and where consent was given they had been signed off by the young person's parent(s).To further assess whether these arrangements were working well, we designed questionnaires for young people to complete both before and after transition. During the period January - March 2018, 57% of the pre- transition questionnaires sent out were received back. However, the audit offered no clear evidence that clinicians were handing out post-transition surveys for young people to complete. These results show that while we have made progress over the last year, more work is required to ensure that each young person has a positive experience when they transition from young people's mental health services to adult mental health services. 3.7.3 Patient Experience 3.7.3.1 Complaints We recognise that sometimes things go wrong and people will wish to complain and have that complaint investigated. All complaints are taken seriously and treated in the strictest confidence. We use information gathered from complaints as a way of improving services and the effectiveness of the organisation. We look to identify learning points that can be translated into positive action and provide redress to set right any shortcomings that have occurred. Our approach to dealing with complaints follows the 'six principles for remedy' recommended by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman:- getting it right to be patient focused open and accountable act fairly and proportionately put things right seek to make continuous improvements We monitor all complaints and concerns closely noting any recurring themes, trends and increases and share this information with our local commissioners to make sure we are doing everything we can to prevent their re-occurrence. Reviewing complaints is a central part of the independent inspections of hospitals carried out by the Care Quality Commission. Just one complaint is one too many, but in relation to all the work our clinical staff carry out each year (see Table 34 below), the complaints we receive amounts to 0.05% of all Trust activity.

However, if someone is not happy with the outcome of the complaint, they may take this to the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman. During 2017/18 the Trust received notification that four complaints had been referred to the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman for review. One was subsequently withdrawn by the complainant, one was closed as requiring no further action by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman while two cases remain under investigation. The Trust also collates and analyses all compliments received in respect of the services it provides. Figure 4 below shows the Trust received a total of 914 compliments during 2017/18. 248 compliments were received for care, 131 for the attitude of staff and 16 for communication.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018107 Figure 4: Analysis of Compliments 3.7.3.2 Friends and Family Test The NHS Friends and Family Test (FFT) is a national scheme introduced by NHS England. The scheme helps both providers and commissioners to understand whether patients are happy with the service provided or if improvements are needed. FFT is embedded in the Trust's strategic objectives and is a key deliverable with the patient experience and involvement strategy and quality and safety agenda. It is an important feedback tool that supports the fundamental principle that people who use our services have the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience. It provides a quick and anonymous way for people to give their views and results are available for the public to view at any time on the NHS Choices website. The FFT does not produce results that can be used to directly compare our performance against other providers due to the flexibility of data collection methods and the variation in local populations. All answers are voluntary but we value and respect each person's feedback as it provides valuable information for our services to celebrate and build on what is working well and to identify areas where improvements could be made. FFT does not replace the complaints procedure or other forms of feedback that we use to learn about our services.In last year's report we stated that after receiving high levels of feedback for the first two years the numbers of people providing feedback using this method has tapered off. We therefore decided to review our approach in conjunction with the NHS England Lead for the Friends and Families test, to explore new ways to encourage people to utilise this method of feedback. The result was that in June 2017, the Trust launched a new combined friends and family test and patient experience and involvement form, to enable our patients to give confidential feedback about our services. This feedback enables teams to make improvements that really matter to patients. 1,092 patients responded to the Mental Health services Friends and Family test. A breakdown of their responses is shown in Figure 5 below.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018108 Figure 5: Friends and Family Test Mental Health Services Figure 6: Friends and Family Test Learning Disabilities Service 97 patients responded to the Learning Disability Friends and Family test. A breakdown of their responses is shown in Figure 6 below. 572 people responded to the Children, Young People and Families Friends and Family test.

The assessment covers environmental, cleanliness, food, privacy and dignity, access and dementia for the Trust's four main hospital sites. The results provided in the charts below were produced independently by NHS Digital. Each year changes are made to the criteria and questions to make them as relevant as possible so it is not practical to directly compare results with previous years. However the following results show the progress made to improve the patient experience for each of the Trust's inpatient areas.

NHS Improvement has refreshed the list of indicators required to be disclosed in this section for 2017/18 to reflect developments in the Single Oversight Framework. Performance is reported as the arithmetic average for the year of the monthly reported performance during the year. Table 36 below provides a summary of all the relevant quality indicators for 2017/18. A more detailed explanation and analysis of each indicator is set out afterwards. Table 36: Summary of Other Quality Indicators 2017/18 Indicator Target Achieved People experiencing a first episode of psychosis are treated with a NICE approved care package within two weeks of referral 50% 74% Ensure that cardio-metabolic assessment and treatment for people with psychosis is delivered routinely in the following service areas: a) inpatient wards b) early intervention in psychosis services c) community mental health services (people on care programme approach) 90% pending * 90% pending # 90% pending * Improving access to psychological therapies - people with common mental health conditions are treated within 6 weeks of referral75% 94.2% Improving access to psychological therapies - people with common mental health conditions are treated within 18 weeks of referral 95% 99.6% Improving access to psychological therapies - proportion of people completing treatment who move to recovery 50% 60.8% Admissions to adult facilities of patients under 16 years old Zero Zero Inappropriate out-of-area placements for adult mental health services (average number of bed days per month patients have spent out of area)- 72 * The data for these indicators has been collected from the National Audit of Psychosis by the Royal College of Psychiatrists; the results are not expected until later in 2018 # The data for this indicator has been collected from self-assessments collected by the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Early Intervention in Psychosis Network; the results are not expected until later in 2018 3.8.1 People experiencing a first episode of psychosis are treated with a NICE approved care package within two weeks of referral The World Health Organisation indicates that schizophrenia and other forms of psychoses which affect young people represent a major public health problem. Despite the availability of interventions that can reduce relapses not all affected young people have access to them in a timely and sustained way. Failure to engage and intervene effectively in early psychosis leads to poorer outcomes for individuals and their families and high levels of expenditure for both NHS and other public services. The provision of evidence based care recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) can prevent the development of psychosis in a significant proportion of cases, preventing much illness, disability and distress to young people and their families.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018114 The Early Intervention in Psychosis Access and Waiting Time standard requires that more than 50% of people with first episode of psychosis are treated with a NICE-approved package of care within two weeks of referral. Table 37 below shows Black Country Partnership's performance as the arithmetic average for the year of the monthly reported performance for 2017/18 based on information provided by NHS England. Table 37: Percentage of patients treated within two weeks of referral (data provided by within two weeks of referral6 4 7 2 7 3 4 4 0 5 7 2 51 4.3 No. still waiting after two weeks from referral1 0 0 3 1 0 2 1 2 4 2 2 18 1.5 % treated within two weeks 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% NHS Improvement has selected this indicator for substantive sample testing by independent external auditors as part of the assurance process for the quality report. The auditors will provide a limited assurance report to the Trust's Assembly of Governors on whether this indicator has been reasonably stated in all material respects. 3.8.2 Ensure that cardio-metabolic assessment and treatment for people with psychosis is delivered routinely in the following service areas: a) inpatient wards b) early intervention in psychosis services c) community mental health services (people on care programme approach) People with severe mental disorders on average tend to die earlier than the general population. The vast majority of these deaths are due to chronic physical medical conditions such as cardiovascular, respiratory and infectious diseases, diabetes and hypertension. Many of these deaths are preventable so increasing access to quality care for patients with severe mental disorders and improving the treatment of coexisting physical conditions is an important indicator. Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018115 This indicator requires providing regular physical health checks for patients on inpatient wards, under community mental health teams and receiving early intervention in psychosis services. The range of checks include smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index and blood pressure to assess their cardio-metabolic risk factors that determine the chances of developing diabetes, heart disease or stroke. In addition, when this group of patients are screened for these measures and where it is clinically indicated, they are provided with interventions or referred to other services for interventions to improve their physical health. The national target for this indicator is to ensure that 90% of patients in the defined audit sample have both a completed assessment for each of the cardio-metabolic parameters with results documented in the patient's record, and a record of interventions offered where indicated, for patients who are identified as at risk. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has collected the data for inpatients and people under the care of community mental health teams through the National Audit of Psychosis. The results are not expected to be published until later in 2018 and will be included in next year's report. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' Early Intervention in Psychosis Network has collected the data for patients under the care of early intervention in psychosis services. The results are not expected to be published until later in 2018 and will be included in next year's report. 3.8.3/4 Improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) for people with common mental health conditions Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is an NHS programme which provides services across England offering low and high intensity interventions approved by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for treating people with depression and anxiety disorders. Psychological therapies involve working with a trained professional to understand and deal with emotional and mental health problems. Therapy starts with a detailed assessment that aims to identify the main problems that are currently holding people back in their lives followed by learning new ways of managing these problems. The national targets for these two indicators are to ensure that 75% of people with common mental health conditions referred to the IAPT programme are treated within 6 weeks of referral and 95% within 18 weeks of referral. Tables 38 and 39 below show Black Country Partnership's performance as the arithmetic average of the monthly reported performance during 2017/18. It is based on a locally produced percentage in the absence of information available from NHS Digital. Table 38: Referrals made and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018116 Table 39: Referrals of Governors have selected the 6 weeks indicator for substantive sample testing by independent, external auditors as part of the assurance process required for the quality report. The auditors will provide a limited assurance report to the Trust's Assembly of Governors on whether this indicator has been reasonably stated in all material respects. 3.8.5 Improving access to psychological therapies - proportion of people completing treatment who move to recovery This indicator shows the proportion of people completing treatment who have shown significant improvement and recovered. To achieve reliable recovery, a person's symptoms will have improved by a significantly large margin from the start to end of treatment for people who were considered a clinical case at the start of treatment. This is important in showing the proportion of people completing treatment who have shown significant improvement and recovered. This indicator identifies the proportion of people who showed a change in symptoms from above a clinical threshold (defined by a cut-off point in the outcome questionnaires PHQ-9 and ADSM) at the start of treatment to below this threshold at the end of treatment, for whom this change was significantly reliable. PHQ-9 is a questionnaire used to measure the severity of depression based on the frequency with which relevant symptoms are experienced. ADSM (anxiety disorder specific measures) are used to measure the severity of anxiety disorders. There are several ADSMs and the relevant one is chosen in each case based on the specific type of anxiety being experienced (e.g. social anxiety, generalised anxiety, etc.). The national target for this indicator is to ensure that 50% of people completing a course of IAPT treatment moved to recovery. Table 40 below shows Black Country Partnership's performance as the arithmetic average of the monthly reported performance during 2017/18. It is based on a locally produced percentage in the absence of information available from NHS Digital.

When the Government reviewed the Act, it pledged that children and young people under the age of 18 are to be treated in an environment in hospital which had suitable regard to their age, and the inappropriate admission of children and young people to adult acute mental health wards would be avoided. There is no national target for this indicator but progress should be in line with the Government's pledge that the inappropriate admission of children and young people to adult acute mental health wards should be avoided. In accordance with the Government's initiative, it is the policy of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust not to accept a referral of a young person under the age of 16 years of age for admission to an adult acute mental health ward. Table 41 below shows Black Country Partnership's performance as the arithmetic average of the monthly reported performance during 2017/18. It is based on locally produced data in the absence of information available from NHS Digital. Table 41: Admissions to adult facilities of patients under 16 years old during 2017-18 facilities of patients under 16 years oldnone none none none none none none none none none none none none 3.8.7 Inappropriate out-of-area placements for adult mental health services When local services cannot meet the needs of an individual who requires adult mental health acute inpatient care, an 'out of area placement' is found elsewhere, outside of the usual local network of services. This group of service users can sometimes remain in a high-cost placement, often many miles away from where they once lived, when they should be treated in a location which helps them to retain the contact they want with family, carers, friends and their local environment. The Government has therefore set a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate out of area placements (OAPs) in mental health services for adults in acute inpatient care by 2020/21. Sending providers determine if a placement is classed as an OAP . The definition necessarily allows providers to apply knowledge of local catchment arrangements and the patient's circumstances in taking a decision if a placement is an OAP . The decision tree in Figure16 below is for the sending provider to use when determining whether an admission is an out of area placement. However, an out of area placement may be appropriate when: the person becomes acutely unwell when they are away from home (in such circumstances the admitting provider should work with the person's home team to facilitate repatriation to local services as soon as this is safe and clinically appropriate) there are safeguarding reasons such as gang related issues, violence and domestic abuse the person is a member of the local service's staff or has had contact with the service in the course of their employment there are offending restrictions the decision to treat out of area is the individual's choice e.g. where a patient is not from the local area but wants to be near their family and networks This list is not exhaustive. There are other reasons why treatment in an out-of-area unit may be appropriate. In these cases, discharge and/or return to an appropriate local unit should be facilitated at the earliest point.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018118 There is no national target for this indicator but progress should be in line with the agreed trajectory for the elimination of inappropriate adult acute out of area placements by 2021. The process for agreeing trajectories has been jointly led by the NHS England and NHS Improvement regional teams. They are currently working with clinical commissioning groups and mental health providers to develop provider level baselines and trajectories. Table 42 below shows Black Country Partnership's performance as the arithmetic average of the monthly reported performance during 2017/18. The total number of bed days patients have spent out of area each month during 2017/18 is based on locally produced data in the absence of information available from NHS Digital. Table 42: Out of area placements Out of days patients have spent out of area each month54 90 102 78 76 74 176 87 50 39 9 28 72 NHS Improvement has selected this indicator for substantive sample testing by independent external auditors as part of the assurance process for the quality report. The auditors will provide a limited assurance report to the Trust's Assembly of Governors on whether this indicator has been reasonably stated in all material respects.Figure 16: Out of area placements decision treeQuality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018119 3.9 The Wider Quality Improvement Agenda In this section of the report we provide brief summaries on the progress we are making to embed and improve quality across the range of services we provide. This is a continuation of the process to integrate the quality report with our wider quality improvement agenda and for quality to be at the heart of everything we do. MERIT (Mental Health Alliance for Excellence, Resilience, Innovation and Training) ORIGINS: MERIT was established following a successful joint bid to be part of the latest wave of NHS England's New Care Models Vanguard programme. The purpose of the vanguard programmes is to develop radical new care models as outlined in the NHS Five Year Forward View. PARTNERS: Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust and Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. In early 2018, we welcomed a fifth partner: Forward Thinking Birmingham, the city's mental health partnership for people aged 0-25. AIM: The MERIT Vanguard programme is an innovative partnership of mental health organisations in the West Midlands which have come together to develop new ways of working to improve the way mental health services are provided for the future. The programme aims to deliver greater resilience, innovation and training across the metropolitan West Midlands and Warwickshire, covering a population of some 3.4 million people. FOCUS: MERIT is focusing on three priority areas where the greatest challenges for urban mental health services exist. These are: every day services (previously known as seven day working) crisis care and reduction of risk recovery and rehabilitation Where possible we will use the same systems across our four organisations to make sure our work is consistent. By sharing the way we do things we can make it easier and simple for our patients and staff. PROGRESS: Over the last year, the four trusts have continued to work together and created a 'ME in MERIT' initiative, to establish a network of experts by experience across the West Midlands to help public engagement across each of the MERIT work streams. The vanguard has also established a non-executive director assurance group consisting of one non-executive director from each trust. MERIT is developing a co-ordinated bed management system across its four partners. This will use an electronic bed viewer to enable bed managers from each trust to see bed availability in real time across all four trusts. A shared patient record system is being developed to support this which enables patient records to be accessed The shared bed management system has not yet been fully implemented. However, even without full implementation bed managers report that the improved relationships developed as part of the programme has meant that they have begun to informally allocate beds from within the MERIT trusts. This has resulted in seven patients being admitted to a bed at another partner trust who would previously have been sent out of area - saving a total of 93 out of area bed days. It is expected that once the system is fully implemented the impact will be significantly larger. Reducing the reliance on agency staff is another driver and MERIT is developing a flexible staff bank for clinical and non-clinical staff across its four partners. Reviewing the training needs and skill-mix of staff, including developing a training 'passport', helps staff to move more flexibly between organisations. The Vanguard forecasts this will help partners achieve annual reductions in agency staff costs of between \u00a33-4 million. NEXT STEPS: Central funding from NHS England for the MERIT programme draws to a close in Spring 2018 but the work will continue. Following agreement of the most senior clinicians and managers in the four organisations, work will continue on five key areas over the coming year: 1. Further development of the MERIT Bed Finder which allows bed managers in the partner trusts to see the status of each other's beds 2. Adding further data to our innovative Electronic Health Record Viewer so that clinicians have more background on those service users who are seen outside their 'home' trust 3. Developing our Crisis Care website to make it a standalone productQuality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018120 4. Expanding our Staff Training Passport, which allows staff to transfer more easily between jobs in different organisations, and associated work on the skills staff need to work in mental health roles. 5. Working with our partners to offer Mental Health First Aid training across the West Midlands For the last two quality reports we have provided information on our commitment to the 'Sign up to Safety' campaign, a national initiative to make the NHS the safest healthcare system in the world. Below details our progress against two of the key pledges we made. Reduce the number of medication errors by 10% over the next three years Medicines are a central component in the delivery of high quality healthcare for patients and their effective use contributes to achieving positive outcomes for patients. The effective use of medicines is dependent on staff administering them correctly and that staff undertaking this important task are suitably trained and work to the required standard. The number and complexity of prescriptions written in mental health trusts is considerable and as administration of medicines is a high volume, high risk activity, it can sometimes unfortunately go wrong. Figure 17 below illustrates the reduction in the number of medication errors since the start of the initiative in July 2015. Figure 17: Medication Incidents Since that time, the number of medication incidents reported per month has continued on a downward trend from 68 to 37 per month, a positive reduction exceeding the target of 10%. The increase in the last couple of months was mainly due to administration errors whereby doses of medication had been missed. No harm was reported for any patient. All medication incidents are reported on the trust's electronic incident reporting system and collated centrally. This allows clinical managers and modern matrons to identify and monitor the frequency and places where errors occur and to provide enhanced training programmes for staff. Reduce the number of physical violence and aggression incidents by 10% over the next three years This continues to prove a demanding target to achieve due to the challenging behaviour of a small number of patients with particularly complex needs and new admissions that present with challenging behaviour until they have received appropriate care and treatment.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018121 Figure 18 below illustrates the number of physical violence and aggression incidents since the start of the initiative in July 2015. Figure 18: Violence and Aggression Incidents In May 2017, the Trust's Quality and Safety Group considered the continued levels of aggressive incidences across the organisation and established an improvement group to examine the issue further. The group led by the Deputy Director of Nursing was given the following remit: - collate information regarding individual pieces of work that address violence and aggression taking place within inpatient areas - oversee the implementation of 'Safewards' (a new model of care to reduce conflict and containment on acute adult mental health inpatient units developed by Professor Bowers at the Institute of Psychiatry) - revisit and refresh the existing 'restrictive interventions reduction plan' - consider and support a possible piece of research entitled 'REsTRAIN Yourself' within the region led by Professor Duxbury - identify and support any further pieces of work that may reduce violence and aggression More recently, the group carried out a confidential three week staff survey to ascertain staff opinions on what they think works well to manage aggressive behaviour on the ward and how safety could be improved further on the wards. Sixty-six replies were received. The Trust arranged a Quality Improvement Summit in March 2018 on the theme of violence and aggression to which front-line staff, senior clinicians and managers were all invited. The work of the improvement group, the feedback from the staff survey and the consideration of new initiatives were the basis for the event. Three common themes were identified, boundaries and team working; how to bridge the gap between substantive staff and bank staff; working closer with the police and restorative actions following an incident. These themes formed the basis of workshops on the day. Feedback from the workshops together with presentations and discussions at the summit will be used to both inform and renew our determination to reduce current levels of aggression over the next year. Duty of Candour is a legal duty on NHS trusts to be open and transparent and to inform and apologise to patients if there have been mistakes in their care that have led to significant harm. Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018122 Verbal apologies are essential because they allow face-to-face contact between the patient, their family and carers and the healthcare team. A verbal apology should be given as soon as staff are aware an incident has occurred and a face-to-face meeting offered within 5 working days of the incident where possible. This will be followed within 10 working days by a letter from the appropriate manager. The letter will include a sincere apology which clearly states the Trust is sorry for the suffering and distress resulting from the incident. Triggers for the statutory duty of candour are:- The death of a patient when due to treatment received or not received (not just their underlying condition) Severe harm - in essence permanent serious injury as a result of care provided Moderate harm - in essence non-permanent serious injury or prolonged psychological harm The Trust has added its own trigger, that the duty of candour will apply to all self-harm incidents resulting in moderate or above harm to patients in Trust in-patient settings All incidents are reported via the Trust's electronic incident reporting system and when any of the above triggers are met, duty of candour is initiated. During 2017/18, there were 24 incidents where the criteria for duty of candour applied. The Trust fulfilled the requirements of duty of candour in 24 of the 24 incidents, a compliance rate of 100%. The Board of Directors monitor duty of candour every month through the Quality Performance Report to ensure it is embedded into everyday practice and the Trust fulfils its statutory requirements Every adult has the right to live their life free from violence and abuse. This right is underpinned by the duty on public agencies under The Human Rights Act 1998 to intervene proportionately to protect the rights of their service users. The NHS has a positive obligation to uphold these rights and protect patients who are unable to do this for themselves as set out in the NHS Constitution. The Care Act 2014 placed adult safeguarding on a statutory footing and Section 11 of The Children Act 2004 places a legal duty on all health organisations to ensure that in discharging their functions, they have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Through this mandatory guidance, health and social care organisations have a duty of partnership to work together to put in place services which act to prevent abuse of vulnerable adults and children, provide assessment and investigation of abuse and ensure people are given an opportunity to access justice. The development of multi-agency policies is led by local authorities with agreed commitment to them by partner agencies. As a partner agency, Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is committed to West Midlands Adult Safeguarding Policy and Procedures. The Trust's philosophy in safeguarding children and adults in our care is based on the 'think family' model. This approach aims to improve outcomes for families and focuses on children and adults and the multiplicity of needs of these individual service user groups and how best they can be dressed when services, 'think child, think parent and think family.' To embed this model, the Trust has a dedicated safeguarding structure led by the Associate Director of Safeguarding. The team consists of a Head of Children's Safeguarding, Head of Adult Safeguarding and specialist practitioners focusing on safeguarding children, looked after children, domestic abuse, safeguarding adults, paediatric liaison and the child death review process. This structure is designed to provide advice, support training and supervision to clinicians in this often complex and challenging area of practice. The Trust has its own Safeguarding Forum which provides strategic and operational direction for safeguarding in line with national, regional and local guidance to ensure the Trust is meeting all of its commitments. A safeguarding strategy is also in place and staff training is organised as set out in Table 42 on next page:Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018123 Table 42: Staff Safeguarding Training Q4 2017/18 Level of Training Frequency Target Audience TargetMarch 2018 One - Basic Awareness Induction / SupervisionAll staff 85% 98.2% Two - Awareness, recognition and responses3 yearlyAll non-clinical and clinical staff who have any contact with service users85% 95.0% Three - Assessment and specialist referral3 yearlyAll qualified clinical staff85% 92.7% Four/Five - Specialist roles 3 yearlyAll named professionals85% 100% Eva Rix, Associate Director for Safeguarding Children and Adults writes, \"Safeguarding is everyone's business, and as an organisation that looks after some of the most vulnerable groups of people, our safeguarding training for both children and adults improves quality of care, patient safety and supports patient experience.\" The Trust is a member of 7 local safeguarding Boards and the sub groups addressing quality, performance, learning and serious cases reviews. Additionally, the safeguarding team actively participates in weekly multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) sharing relevant and proportionate information relating to service users who may be experiencing or perpetrating the highest level of domestic abuse, with the local police, health colleagues, child protection and other specialists. Mental Health Act Safeguards and Scrutiny The Mental Health Act 1983 provides the legal framework for the assessment, treatment and rights of people with mental health problems. In particular it provides the legislation by which people at risk of harm to themselves or others can be detained in hospital and have their condition assessed or treated against their wishes. Our doctors and other health professionals only consider admission to hospital against someone's will after reviewing all other treatment options first and when it is essential to ensure their well-being or safety or for the protection of other people. This section provides a brief summary of the how the Trust discharges its responsibilities under the Act and the range of safeguards in place, to protect the rights and dignity of people admitted to hospital. The Mental Health Act Code of Practice 2015: The Code provides guidance to health professionals on how to carry out their responsibilities under the Act to provide high quality and safe care. There are five overarching principles our practitioners consider when making decisions under the Act. They are: Least restrictive option and maximising independence - wherever possible each patient's independence is encouraged and supported with a focus on promoting recovery Empowerment and involvement - patients are fully involved in decisions about care, support and treatment and the views of families, carers and others if appropriate are fully considered when taking decisions Respect and dignity - patients, their families and carers are treated with respect and dignity Purpose and effectiveness - care and treatment has clear therapeutic aims, promotes recovery and is performed to current best practice national guidelines Efficiency and equity - to work in conjunction with other services to facilitate timely, safe and supportive discharge from detention Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018124 Independent Mental Health Advocates (IMHA): When someone is detained in hospital it can be a very confusing and distressing experience. An Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA) is a specialist advocate, independent of mental health services who will help patients get their opinions heard and make sure they know their rights under the law. Our staff foster good working relationships with IMHAs as we recognise they can make a big difference to people's experience of detention. Hospital Managers' Hearings: People who are subject to detention under the Mental Health Act can ask for their case to be reviewed by Hospital Managers for possible discharge. Hospital managers are independent of the hospital and the Trust which runs the hospital because they cannot be officers or employees. This is an important and responsible role as it helps the Trust ensure people's rights under the Act are upheld, provide support and the opportunity to talk to an independent person about any issues they may have. The Trust arranged 128 hearings during 2017/18. Mental Health Tribunals: If someone feels the decision to treat them against their will is unfair or unnecessary they can challenge the decision to stay in hospital and a mental health tribunal will be held. This is an independent panel of three people, a judge who is in charge of the tribunal, a tribunal doctor and a specialist lay member who has detailed knowledge of the Mental Health Act. The tribunal can order a patient's release, recommend their transfer to a different hospital, ask that their doctor considers treatment in the community, or that they are allowed to leave the hospital for periods of time to see if they are ready for life in the community. The Trust arranged 188 tribunals during 2017/18. Mental Health Act Administration Team: The Trust employs a dedicated administration team with specialist knowledge of the Mental Health Act, Code of Practice and associated policies and procedures. They support Hospital Managers and the continued improvement of services for people detained under the Act. They ensure there are robust trust-wide systems and processes in place and compliance with the legal requirements of the Act. Mental Health Legislation Forum: The Forum is chaired by the Trust's Medical Director and includes clinicians, managers and staff representing their different services and professions. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss quality improvements and developments relating to the application of the Mental Heath Act in practice. The forum monitors the training, support and skills provided to staff to promote safe and legal practice. Mental Health Act training is an integral part of ensuring that our staff are confident and competent in this area of their practice. Table 43 below provides a summary of the training provided during 2017/18.

Care Quality Commission (CQC): The CQC provide external assurance to the public that patients' basic human rights are maintained while they are being cared for or treated under the Act. Specialist CQC inspectors called Mental Health Act Reviewers check that the powers of the Mental Health Act are used properly. Reviewers can visit patients detained in hospital and meet with them in private to find out about their experiences, listen to their issues, raise problems with ward managers, help patients write letters or complain, check documentation and publish reports on wards. In addition the CQC provides a second opinion appointed doctors (SOADs) service which safeguards the rights of patients detained under the Act who either refuse the treatment prescribed to them or are deemed incapable of consenting. The role of the SOAD is to decide whether the treatment recommended is clinically defensible and whether due consideration has been given to the views and rights of the patient. The CQC are responsible for the appointment of SOADs and manage the SOAD service. Promoting Staff Health and Wellbeing The Trust recognises that promoting the health and wellbeing of our workforce plays a vital role in ensuring that staff feel valued, involved and supported which is essential to the delivery of good patient services. In 2017, the Trust launched the 'Staff Health and Wellbeing Roadshow' to help make staff more aware of the support and advice available on their doorstep to help them keep healthy and well. A range of organisations and support services were on hand to talk to and help staff improve their health and wellbeing including:- Cycle to Work scheme Occupational Health Flu campaign Human Resources to discuss flexible working, childcare and staff benefit policies Catering stand with health goodie bags Staff Support services Diversity and Spirituality Angie Dunkley, Human Resources Advisor said \"One of the key aims of the roadshow is to ensure that staff have access to information and support so they can better manage their own health and care more easily. By bringing together different stands in this way, we've been able to showcase what's available locally and help staff to make those connections in a relaxed and informal environment.\" In last year's report, we gave details of how the Trust responded to 'Freedom to Speak Up' an independent review into whistleblowing in the NHS in England, chaired by Sir Robert Francis QC. As a Trust, we believe that openness and honesty is important, and we are working hard to develop an open, inclusive and collaborative culture. Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018126 Andy Green, Company Secretary, is the Trust's Freedom to Speak Up Guardian. The Guardian is an independent and impartial source of advice for staff who will facilitate raising issues at the highest level in the Trust. The Guardian will also support a focus on safety, learning and proper handling of cases, and be an honest broker by monitoring separation of human resource issues from raising concerns under the freedom to speak up process. Andy is ably assisted by our Freedom to Speak Up Champions, based in different parts of the Trust who work alongside the Guardian to raise awareness of how to raise concerns. Allied health professionals (AHPs) are the third largest workforce in health and care in England. Allied health professionals in Black Country Partnership consist of three professional groups; Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy and Speech and Language Therapy and work across all clinical divisions. Our allied health professionals are an important presence within regional and national professional groups with many staff being members of both their professional bodies and specialist groups within these. Examples include: Dudley physiotherapy colleagues are key members of the regional Cerebral Palsy Integrated Pathway and the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists. Our Principal Occupational Therapist and AHP Lead is a member of the national executive committee of the Royal College of Occupational Therapists Specialist Section Mental Health. Our Speech and Language Therapy professionals are represented at a number of regional and national forums within the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists these include; West Midlands Learning Disability Clinical Excellence Network, the Adult Neurology Midlands Clinical Excellence Network and the National Adult Learning Disability Network. The Trust also hosts the regional Adult Learning Disability Lead Network meetings. The Trust has established an Allied Health Professions Board to support well led high performing teams at all levels of the organisation in order to best achieve the Trust objectives. The board promotes discussion and monitoring of overarching professional issues for example, governance of professional registration, development of career pathways, student education and professional leadership development. Its purpose is not to discuss local divisional issues as processes are already in place for this and AHPs are represented at local divisional level. Key issues in 2017 were: Recruitment and retention of AHPs, to include succession planning, career pathway development, leadership and management - Four priorities for AHPs were identified: 1. Physiotherapy recruitment / recruiting difficult to fill posts: Whilst this remains a challenge nationally, by working collaboratively we are taking part in regional and national discussions around this issue and wider conversations with education providers. 2. Developing an allied health professions bank: We have identified and recruited AHPs and AHP support staff to the Trust staff bank with successes in particular within urgent care mental health occupational therapy services. 3. Apprenticeships: Work is currently taking place to identify the opportunity to establish a level 3 AHP apprentice role within the mental health division. 4. The role of the Assistant Practitioner: AHPs are currently the only professional group within the Trust to employ Assistant Practitioners, both uni-professional Occupational Therapy Assistant Practitioners and multi-professional Assistant Practitioners. Work is currently taking place to align the posts already in the Trust with the national assistant practitioner agenda. Having a Five Year Forward Vision - 'AHPs into Action' is a paper written by NHS England aimed at service leaders and decision makers 'to inform and inspire the system about how Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) can be best utilised to support future health, care and wellbeing service delivery'. The paper defines how AHPs can support the implementation of the triple aim set out in the Five Year Forward View. AHP Board members, working alongside nursing and psychologist colleagues, have been instrumental in contributing to the development of 'Leading Change, Adding Value: Professions into Action' a multi-professional response to the five year forward agenda for the Trust.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018127 Leading Change, Adding Value 'Leading Change, Adding Value' is a framework that enables all health professionals to lead change and add value, wherever they work, whatever their role. The framework is directly aligned with the Five Year Forward View to develop new ways of working that are person focused and provide seamless care integrating health and social care services. The aim is to target three crucial gaps in:- - Health and wellbeing - Care and quality - Funding and efficiency In response to the Leading Change, Adding Value and 'AHPs into Action' initiatives, the Trust has established four key areas that our range of health professionals can work together to improve: Clinical Leadership - ensure there is trusted leadership across all systems, that evidenced based care is at the fore of all we do, that clinical leadership is embedded at all levels, collaborative teams and like-minded teams are working concurrently where viable and appropriate and that clinicians are empowered within their roles Safe Staffing - an approach to safe staffing that is multi-professional, quality driven and has safety at the fore of all we do, good clinical governance structure and management, and the right workforce with the right skills, attitudes, behaviours at the same time Integrated care pathways delivery systems - clinically led care and clinical quality outcomes Service development and improvement tools - a single framework with a consistent approach to staffing ensuring improvement to our recruitment and retention and ensuring that we are achieving best practice The Trust held an event in December 2017, led by Stacy McCann, Head of Nursing Strategy and Commissioning from the Chief Nursing Office, NHS England, to hear about the work currently taking place via case studies or best practice examples. Joyce Fletcher, Executive Director of Nursing, AHPs, said: \"Everyone can influence and lead improvement and we are really excited about this integrated approach and commend teams for working together.\" Always Events - What Matters Most to You? Always Events are an initiative developed in the United States by the Picker Institute, now led by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Always Events are aspects of the patient experience that are so important to patients and families that health care providers must perform them consistently for every patient, every time. For our Always Event, we decided that we would always base and develop our yearly service delivery plans on what matters most to our service users and carers. We will do this by engaging with service users and carers at the start of each service development by asking them 'What matters most to you?' This was achieved by the insertion of the question into all mental health service development plans from September 2017: \"Please evidence how you have engaged with service users and carers to find out what matters most to them, and how you have/will use this in the planning, design, delivery and improvement of your service.\" Sue Ralph, an Expert with Lived Experience and Ruth Harvey-Regan, Head of Patient Experience, presented this work at a national conference organised by NHS England in November 2017. Sue and Ruth are supporting our clinical teams to use the Always Events methodology in their areas to act on the feedback they receive, to inform and shape the way they plan changes and developments to their services moving forward. 3.9.1 Quality Developments This section of the report presents brief summaries of other areas of quality development over the last year. New outside gym for Macarthur patients A new and improved outdoor therapies area has been unveiled at Macarthur Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit at Heath Lane Hospital. The space includes a gym, therapeutic garden and games area, is now in full use. Michelle Young, Matron, said: \"Originally the garden was used as a designated smoking area Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018128 for patients so it was associated mainly with smoking rather than it being a therapeutic area. It was a priority that we changed the use to encourage therapeutic use of the space and promote recovery.\" Tom Reader, Clinical Exercise Instructor, said: \"We really wanted to refocus our use of the area to create a space for service users to enjoy. It took 12 months of planning, hard work and collaboration from everyone involved with the project, and the team is pleased to say there has been a total transformation. The space has been designed to work with the other outside spaces at Macarthur and has enhanced activity opportunities to include sports, gardening and relaxation. All activities harness the benefits of engaging in outdoor pursuits that patients can continue after discharge as part of their on-going recovery and reintegration into the community.\" Recovery College Open Day The Recovery College Open day on 4th September 2017 was a day full of learning and discovery that saw 58 students enroll into the college to take their next step to recovery. At the event, the new college prospectus was launched featuring more than 27 courses taking place between September and December. They include mindfulness, alcohol and substance misuse, budgeting, bills and savings, and mental health first aid. Kerry Wilkes, Recovery College Lead, said: \"The event has been a great opportunity to meet staff and volunteers, who can explain more about what the recovery college does and how we help local people in the community improve their mental and physical wellbeing. We were really pleased by the turnout on the day and want to express our appreciation to volunteers and staff that helped to make the day a success.\" Kerry added, \"We are looking forward to developing the college to offer hope and opportunities to people who otherwise may not get this chance. We aim to continue offering our relaxed and welcoming setting to help people make real progress on their recovery journey, and help to reduce the stigma that surrounds mental health.\" Trust celebrates opening of garden space for community service users A new natural 'green space' has been officially opened. The green space garden based at Meadow Field 5, Warwick Close, Oldbury, is an outdoor space intended to be used for a range of therapeutic groups including, creative, woodwork, sensory, and social activities, all aimed at promoting recovery through the use of therapeutic activity. More than 30 people attended the launch, organised by the Community Occupational Therapy Team based at Quayside House, to celebrate the opening and learn more about the outdoor space. Sarah Cottingham, Occupational Therapist said: \"I feel this project is much more than the traditional allotment group, by facilitating activities outside, we hope to increase attendance and effectiveness.\" Carl Simpson, Occupational Therapist added: \"This Green space gives us a real opportunity to offer evidence based interventions and assessments away from traditional mental health settings. We hope this project will be truly service user led, allowing the environment to facilitate the development of their own interests and skills. The enthusiasm already generated is exciting to see and all the team are looking forward to seeing it take shape as the weather improves.\" Tommy on Tour: Dementia awareness The Trust was delighted to welcome Tommy Whitelaw, a dementia campaigner, to speak to staff about his experience of care in the NHS gained whilst caring for his late mother, Joan. Tommy Whitelaw, who after travelling the world running global merchandising operations for the Spice Girls, Kylie and U2, became a full time carer for his late mum, Joan, who had vascular dementia. Tommy brought his 'You can make a difference' tour to The Metalforming Centre in West Bromwich, hosting three sessions on Monday 4th December. Among the many valuable messages Tommy shared with staff was the importance of asking 'What matters to you?' rather than 'What's the matter with you?' He said it is the small acts of kindness that make all the difference to the care our NHS staff provide.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018129 Joyce Fletcher, Executive Director of Nursing said: \"Having met Tommy some time ago, I felt compelled to invite him to come to our Trust to share his story about his late mother Joan with our staff. Tommy's heartfelt passion for caring for his mother and his experiences was such an eye opening and moving experience.\" Joyce added, \"I believe everyone that attended the event was moved and went away with the key message of changing the narrative to 'what matters to patients?' and knowing that we can make a difference for improving patient experiences and outcomes. Let's all pledge to make a difference every day.\"Summary Care Records pilot success The Trust's Pharmacy Team successfully went live with a pilot of Summary Care Records (SCR) in 2017. SCR provides pharmacy staff access to key patient information held at a GP practice which allows a faster and better service to be provided to our patients. The information provided includes: current medication allergies and details of any previous bad reactions to medicines the name, address, date of birth and NHS number of the patient \"SCR has already been a huge benefit to the Trust and patient safety.It has enabled pharmacy to quickly check medication for high-risk patients such as epileptics and diabetics on admission.This is a big improvement on waiting days for GP surgeries to fax back lists of medications.\" Amanda Nicklin Senior Technician Medicine Management and Clinical TrialsSCR provides a real opportunity to reduce missed doses of essential medicines when a patient is admitted, as it provides real time, up to date medication histories for our patients. SCR is available 24/7 and we do not need to wait to contact GP's during opening times - so for patients admitted out of hours or over weekends, this provides assurance that we can admit patients and manage their medicines more effectively. Gurj Bhella Chief PharmacistImmediate access to current prescribed medication and previous prescriptions from the GP , this should make it clear what medication must be prescribed in the first instance. Medication can then be supplied in a timely manner reducing the possibility of 'missed dose' and keeping patients well. The classification of medicines previously prescribed may also give Doctors an insight into medical conditions the patient has not disclosed on admission. Carolyn Ogden Senior Pharmacy Technician Annual Suicide Prevention Symposium The Annual Suicide Prevention Symposium took place on Friday 8th September 2017 and was attended by over 50 colleagues from mental health services across the Black Country.There was a rich variety of presentations on different topics. The speakers included Dr Rachel Upthegrove from Birmingham University and Professor Safi Afghan from Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Trust; and Judy McDonald, Dr Andrew Griffiths, Dr Jayashree Viswanathan, Maxine O'Brien and Dr Nilamadhab Kar from Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. There were also short videos played, all of which were very well received, particularly the Kevin Hines film, which recognised that it is never too late to intervene for some people. Cultural Ambassadors Programme Pilot The Trust is excited to announce we are part of the Royal College of Nursing's Cultural Ambassador Programme pilot, which has the aim of ensuring that staff from a black and minority ethnic (BME) background are treated fairly in the disciplinary and grievance process. The pilot is a 12-month programme designed to help provide staff from a BME background with more confidence in the formal disciplinary and Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018130 grievance processes. Cultural Ambassadors will, through their training, identify and challenge any cultural issues or cultural bias that may occur during the formal process. The Cultural Ambassadors will play a crucial role and be an equal member of an investigation team / panel, acting in a capacity that supports the process they are part of. Our Cultural Ambassadors Phil Cole, Staff Side Lead, said: \"The aim of the cultural ambassador is to act as a critical role focusing on the detail of the disciplinary and grievance process to make sure that it is fair, equitable and bias free.\" \"Cultural ambassadors are allowed to ask questions for clarity and within their roles included and regarded as part of the investigation teams and grievance / disciplinary hearing panels.\" \"It is hoped that the introduction of the role brings about fewer cases proceeding toward disciplinary hearing and has a positive impact on cultural behaviour through word-of-mouth dissemination as Cultural Ambassadors share their understanding amongst colleagues.\" Health Visiting team supports Dudley Play Week Health Visitors supported Dudley Play Week in July and August 2017 to help raise the profile of the service and what it can offer to parents. Dudley's popular play week event aims to keep children entertained in five borough parks. Invited young people of all ages come along and enjoy a range of play activities on offer. During the week, there were group games, sports and stalls. Most of the activities on offer are free of charge. Joy Williams, Service Manager, said: \"Play week is always hugely popular and sees thousands of children and families come along to enjoy the activities on offer. It's a great way for children to enjoy traditional activities, learn new skills, make friends and most importantly have fun.\" \"As a service we aim to empower families to provide the best possible start in life for their children. We encourage parents to drop into our stall and ask any questions they may have about the early years.\" Abbey Ward summer event success Staff, patients and patient relatives enjoyed a fun-filled day of celebration and singing as Abbey Ward held their annual summer party for the second year running! The day was full of joy, laughter, delicious food - some of which was kindly donated by staff - and dancing. This year's event also saw the return of DJ Jag - former service user - who helped guests boogie the afternoon away and keep spirits up. Fauzia Khan, Assistant Psychologist said: \"Following the success of last summer's cultural awareness event, the team really wanted to host a similar event this year to really bring everyone together and help to create a real community feel, promote cohesion and integration among everyone at Abbey House. The day was a great success and we want to express thanks to staff that supported the event and gave up their free time to help make it happen!\" Liz Smart, Ward Manager for Abbey House added, \"We have received a lot of positive feedback from our patient community meeting about events like these allowing us to see how big of a component they are in aiding recovery and making everyone feel like an important part of the ward community. Having seen the benefits we are planning to host similar events in the future to celebrate the amazing work that everyone is doing and help to bring everyone together!\" Coping with Voices Group Guest Speaker Staff and patients at Hallam Street Hospital were visited by a guest speaker to discuss the experience of hearing voices and the diversity of experiences among the group's members. The guest speaker - Rufus May - was invited by Samina Allie, Chartered Psychologist and Fauzia Khan, Assistant Psychologist to the weekly 'Coping with Voice' Group at Hallam Street Hospital. The group is designed to give patients the space to explore difficult feelings and experiences with fellow service users and trained professionals by giving meaning to the voices that they hear through the use of voice dialogue work and other creative means. Rufus is a Clinical Psychologist and Mental Health Trainer well known for his TV programme 'The Doctor who Hears Voices.' He has also published numerous literature materials and is actively involved in promoting recovery. He was joined by his partner Elisabeth Svanholmer who is a voice hearer and is involved in numerous projects affiliated with the Danish Hearing Voices Network.Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018131 Samina Allie, Chartered Psychologist, added: \"Patients really appreciated the open space and meeting our guest speakers last week. They have provided some great feedback, letting us know how helpful and informative the day was and how having speakers that are understanding and supportive helps with developing coping strategies to aid recovery. We hope to see more guest speakers like Rufus joining the group.\" Smoking Cessation Success at Hallam Street In September last year, Health Exchange Sandwell was asked to start a 'Living Well, Taking Control' smoking cessation clinic at Hallam Street Hospital. The clinic provides an opportunity for both patients and staff looking for expert advice and information about stopping smoking, and the response across all wards at Hallam has been really positive. A variety of support is available including: a drop- in smoke free clinic; weekly rounds on every ward; community follow-up; support post discharge; nicotine replacement therapy; emotional psychological support and CBT approaches are offered over the 12-week course. The results are shown below: Sign-ups to smoke Patients 48 free course since September 2017 (6 months) Staff 23 Total 71 Carbon monoxide measurer: 47 out of 71 sign-ups (66%) were smoke free by week 4 against a national average of 46% Kayleigh Gibbins, Occupational Therapy Lead said, \"We are delighted with the response to our smoke free clinics, and we will continue to raise awareness of the benefits of going smoke free to offer advice and support. We will look to recruit more sign-ups to the next 12 week course as we work towards achieving a smoke free future.\" 3.9.2 Time to Shine - Staff achievements to improve quality This section of the report highlights our staff's continuing commitment to quality and excellence to improve patient care. Trust's Liaison and Diversion team presented with excellence award Congratulations to Bernadette Light who works within the Trust's Liaison and Diversion Team as a CPN for receiving the Excellence in Service Delivery Award from West Midlands Police.The nomination was given to Bernie based upon her work within an ongoing project with Wolverhampton Central Custody to identify individuals who have mental health, learning disability or substance misuse vulnerabilities when they come into contact with the criminal justice system. Speaking about the nomination and the event, Bernie said: \"It is great to be recognised by a partner agency like West Midlands Police.

Trust name caf\u00e9 in tribute to catering team leader The caf\u00e9 at Heath Lane has been re-named in tribute to a catering team leader who has worked for the Trust for over 40 years. Hillary Stanfield, the lady behind the newly named 'Hillary's' caf\u00e9, still works full time at Heath Lane where she is fondly thought of by patients to whom she acts as \"Mum\", knowing them by name and their likes and dislikes. She has been working in catering for 47 years in total. Speaking about the caf\u00e9 being named after her, Hilary said: \"Over the years I have seen a lot of people come and go but there has always been a friendly face to make me and the team smile.

Julie was invited to attend the conference to present a paper on their research project entitled 'An integrated targeted intervention to prevent obesity in infants born into a diverse community'. Director of Nursing has tea with the Prime Minister Joyce Fletcher, Director of Nursing, Quality, Allied Health Professionals and Psychology was invited to afternoon tea with Prime Minister Theresa May in October to mark the 30th anniversary of Black History Month. At the event attended by numerous dignitaries, the prime minister pledged her commitment to 'making a difference in addressing the uncomfortable truths highlighted in her recently published audit of public services reflecting how a person's ethnicity affects their experience of public services and how that affects their daily lives. Joyce said, \"I was very excited to be invited to attend the Prime Minister's celebrations, to reflect on my personal journey, and to have met so many inspirational people. The afternoon was thought provoking and made me proud to be celebrating the achievements and successes of our black and minority ethnic communities.\" Happy 70th Birthday to Eileen Congratulations to a remarkable member of our catering team at Penn Hospital, Eileen Howell, who celebrated her seventieth birthday this year. Eileen has worked for the Trust as a cook for over Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018133 thirty years. What is even more amazing is that Eileen works full time hours, has a near perfect attendance record and is definitely not thinking about retirement! Colleagues and friends gathered to mark this momentous occasion giving Eileen a lovely surprise when she was presented with flowers and gifts. Needless to say, we all think the world of Eileen both as a colleague we look up to and as a friend. Everyone at Penn wants to wish Eileen many more happy years. Eileen said, \"It was a lovely surprise to see so many people gathered to help me start my weekend of celebrations. Penn is like my second home and I've got no intention of retiring. This place keeps me young and I'm not sure I would know what to do with myself if I didn't have work to turn-up to every day.\" Trust's Occupational Services receives national accreditation The Trust's occupational health and wellbeing provider has been recognised for the high standard of service it provides to staff with a nationally recognised re-accreditation. The team was awarded with the Safe Effective Quality Occupational Health Service (SEQOHS) Accreditation following a formal assessment by independent assessors. SEQOHS is a scheme run by the Royal College of Physicians in association with the Faculty of Occupational Medicine. The accreditation criteria is measured against a set of comprehensive standards designed to help raise the level and quality of care provided by Occupational Health and Wellbeing providers. Staff article published by Nursing Times An article written by Fauzia Khan, Assistant Psychologist and Samina Allie, Chartered Psychologist has been accepted for publication by the Nursing Times Journal. The paper explores the benefits and importance of nursing staff co-facilitation in acute inpatient based hearing voices groups, and how involving nurses in supporting such groups is not only beneficial but an important need. The group was supported by Nurse Julie Locke whose reflections have been cited in the article. Julie shares that she found the group to be enlightening in changing the way that she viewed the voice-hearing experience and the way she worked with patients. Before supporting the group, Julie thought that engaging with patients about their voice-hearing experience would potentially \"make things worse\" and would reinforce their delusional beliefs. However, the group challenged her beliefs and she was able to recognise the benefits that patients experienced as a result of talking about their experiences in the group. Furthermore, Julie found that as well as improving her understanding of voice hearing, she was also able to develop her skills and confidence when working with this presentation. Annual Staff Awards 2017 Staff were recognised for their contribution at the Trust's annual staff awards on 12 September 2017. More than 100 staff and guests gathered at The Copthorne Hotel, Dudley for the awards ceremony hosted by Martyn Jinks, Trust Chaplain. Opening the ceremony, the Chief Executive congratulated all those shortlisted. \"These awards recognise dedicated teams and individuals in both clinical and non-clinical areas who exemplify our Trust's vision and values, and go all out to make Black Country Partnership a place where people really do matter.\" Staff who had reached the milestone of 25 years' service were also recognized along with those who had achieved a range of qualifications and participated in training programmes enhancing their skills. The highlight of the awards ceremony was the presentation of a Special Recognition Award to Liz and David Gratwick for their tireless work within Older Adult services. Staff joined together in paying an emotional tribute to Liz, who sadly passed away earlier on in the year, thanking her for her support in championing Trust services.Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018134 Sandwell and West Birmingham CCG Co-Ordinating Commissioner Comments - Black Country Partnership's Foundation Trust Quality Account 2017/18 This Quality Account, prepared by Black Country Partnerships Foundation Trust (BCP), is a true reflection of the work undertaken during the 2017/18 contract year. BCP engage fully and openly with its CCG commissioners, providing opportunity for dialogue at both a contract and locality level, via CQRM, and CRM meetings. BCP has demonstrated its commitment to quality by the introduction of a number of quality improvement schemes during the year, including: the production of a revised Safeguarding Quarterly report (developed in conjunction the Safeguarding teams at Wolverhampton and Sandwell and West Birmingham CCG), the development of more effective lines of communication with external organisations (such as Acute Trusts, GPs and Local Authorities); the continued implementation of the Physical Health Strategy; revision of the cost improvement programme, the implementation of the 'Caring Counts' strategy, and the introduction of the 'See, Think, Act' programme to reduce the risk of violence and aggression incidents. During the 2017/18 contract year, the CCG wishes to acknowledge and congratulate BCP on their continued success in relation to, and meeting services quality standards in regard to, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) programmes; as well as sustaining long term reductions in medication safety incidents, physical restraints and instances of self-harm. In addition to this, excellent progress has been made within the Trust to ensure mandatory training targets are consistently achieved, particularly in relation to Safeguarding, DOLS, and PREVENT. The CCG also wishes to acknowledge the good results achieved by the Trust in relation to the Friends and Family Test during 2017/18. The CCG also wish to acknowledge the Trust's success in achieving most Local Quality Indicator targets and National and Local CQUIN schemes for 2017/18, particularly in respect of the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), which achieved all its local quality requirements. The CCG also wishes to acknowledge the good performance of the Trust in regard to the National CQUIN (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) schemes of 2017/19, with excellent results being achieved in the programmes pertaining to: Improving services for people with mental health needs who present at A&E, incentivise improvements to the experience and outcomes for young people as they transition out of Children and Young People's Mental Health Services (CYPMHS), and Improving physical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in people with SMI. Cardio Metabolic assessment and treatment for patients with psychoses. The CCG also wishes to recognise and acknowledge the challenges faced by BCP to improve the regional and national issue of staffing vacancy rates within wards, units and teams. The Trust has developed short and long term strategies/mitigations to address this issue going forward, with performance closely monitored by Commissioners at monthly Clinical Quality Review Meetings. Looking forward, the CCG welcome the Trust's Quality Plan Objectives for 2018/19, as well as its aspirations to deliver against its commitments to the Transforming Care Programme (TCP) in accordance with the Black Country STP (Sustainability Transformation Plan). Andy Williams Accountable Officer Sandwell & West Birmingham CCG Annex 1 Statements from the Trust's Key Stakeholders Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018135 WCCG feedback on Black Country Partnership Foundation Trust Draft Quality account report 2017-18 Wolverhampton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) welcomes the opportunity to comment on Black Country Partnerships Foundation Trust 2017/18. The Quality Account provides information across a wide range of quality measures in relation to patient experience, clinical effectiveness and patient safety and Commissioners have monitored these domains within the service provided by BCPFT during 2017/2018. The Trust's engagement in the CRM/CQRM's monitoring process provides the basis for commissioners to comment on the quality account including performance against quality improvement priorities and the quality of the data included. The CCG believe that the Quality Account for 2017/18 meets the required content as set out in national guidance and is a good reflection of the quality of services provided by the Trust. During 2017/18 commissioners have worked closely with BCPFT, meeting regularly to review the Trust's progress in implementing its quality improvements initiatives including production of revised safeguarding reporting and the continuous implementation of \"physical heath\" and \"caring counts\" strategy. WCCG would like to congratulate the trust for achieving significant reductions in pressure injury and instances of self-harm. In addition, the trust has made significant progress in constantly achieving most of the local quality indicators and national and local CQUIN schemes for 2017/2018. The information provided within this account represents a balanced overview of the quality of care, patient safety and safeguarding at the Trust. The Quality Account clearly articulates where BCPFT has achieved good progress and identifies areas where further improvements are required. The priorities that have been identified by the trust for 2018/19 are fully supported by WCCGs but consideration of the following areas is also encouraged:- Ensuring safer staffing and workforce strategies Reduction in number of patients slips, trips and falls Improving staff experience and improvements in the annual staff survey In conclusion, whilst we recognise that the Trust has made progress in a number of areas, we also acknowledge the improvement that is still required in order to deliver, safe, effective and efficient patient care for our population. This will require capacity and capability at all levels and key to this is a leadership team who are responsive, visionary and resilient to make change in care delivery at the pace demanded. Looking forward, this includes changes to models of care and collaborative approaches for future care delivery. We support the priorities identified by the Trust for 2018/19 to further improve the quality, safety and experience for the population of Wolverhampton. We will continue to support the Trust in achieving these priorities. Dr Helen Hibbs Chief OfficerWolverhampton CCG Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018136 Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018137 Quality Report Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018138 Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Quality Accounts 2017/18 1. Does the draft Quality Account reflect people's real experiences as reported to the Health Scrutiny Panel during the period 2017/18 by witness evidence? The panel considers that the draft Quality Accounts report 2017/18 gives an accurate reflection of the experiences of people with a mental illness or learning disability who have been referred to the service based on reports to the panel. This view is supported by a recent report by CQC - The state of care in mental health services 2014 to 2017. The report stated that Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (BCPFT) is delivering a high-quality service and is continuing to improve. 2. From what people have told the Health Scrutiny Panel, is there evidence that any of the basic things are not being done well by the provider? The panel has not received any evidence to suggest that the BCPFT are not providing a quality service to the residents of Wolverhampton. A councillor led review of mental health commissioning services report published in February 2018 supports this conclusion. The panel has representatives from Royal Wolverhampton Hospital Trust, Wolverhampton CCG, Wolverhampton Public Health who attend regularly attend health scrutiny meetings. The panel have no evidence to suggest that there are any major concerns about the quality of services offered. The panel is aware of the pressure on mental services at all levels and support the work being done to respond to this challenge by a range of different organisations. In addition, representatives of Healthwatch Wolverhampton, who regularly attend panel meetings, have not provided any evidence to suggest there were any concerns about the quality of care provided from their discussions with the public. The Healthwatch Wolverhampton Annual Report 2016/17 details the experiences of service users and it is clear from the evidence presented that the Trust responds positively when concerns about the quality of care have been highlighted. 3. Is it clear from the draft Quality Account that there is a learning culture within the provider organisation that allows people's real experiences to be captured and used to enable the provider to get better at what it does year on year? There is good evidence presented to the panel that BCPFT is a learning organisation and making great effort to encourage service users and their carers to share their experiences. The active involvement of the public has led to improvements in the quality of the mental health services offered and helped to identify areas for improvement. The panel is satisfied that the Board and staff of BCPFT are committed to improving the deliver and quality of mental health services to the residents of Wolverhampton. The panel welcomed the opportunity to be consulted on plans to create a partnership with two neighbouring NHS trusts with the aim of delivering better mental health services. The plan for the establishment of a partnership with two neighbouring NHS Trusts with the title Transforming Care Together. However, following a public consultation with members of the individual trust boards and other key groups it was decided not to pursue the proposal further. Quality ReportAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018139 4. Are the priorities for improvement as set out in the draft Quality Account challenging enough to drive improvement and it is clear how improvement has been measured in the past and how it will be measured in the future? The panel support the areas suggested are priorities for improvement and consider the methods for measuring progress are appropriate - in particular, the improvement in the quality of provision of mental health services to children and young people receiving care. The issue of mental health provision for young people has been an important focus of the panel work programme during the year. The panel is aware of increased demand on mental health service at all levels and published evidence from the CQC highlights the issue, that many people referred for specialised mental health treatment continue to face long waits. The panel would like a user-friendly section added to the front of the document which gives a summary of areas for improvement and details about how performance will be measured and monitored during the year. The panel would welcome the addition in the Quality Account draft a section setting out specific actions aimed at reducing access and waiting times to mental health services for young people and also those with a dual diagnosis; with the aim of working to meet national best performance standards for providing 24-hour crisis cover. The panel would like a commitment to achieving the vision and aims detailed in THE FIVE-YEAR FORWARD VIEW FOR MENTAL HEALTH and specifically the challenge for all providers to deliver the 7-day NHS - right care, right time, right quality by 2020/21. The panel would like to see details of how the actions below will be achieved included in the final draft of the Quality Accounts reports: People facing a crisis should have access to mental health care 7 days a week and 24 hours a day in the same way that they are able to get access to urgent physical health care. People experiencing a first episode of psychosis should have access to a NICE-approved care package within 2 weeks of referral.

Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, applicable at 31 March 2018 and appropriate to Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. NHS Improvement has directed that the financial statements of NHS Foundation Trusts shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM) which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2017/18 issued by the Department of Health. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and HM Treasury's 2017/18 Financial Reporting Manual to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to NHS Foundation Trusts. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a tr ue and fair view has been selected. The policies adopted have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. International Accounting Standards (IAS1) requires the Directors to assess, as part of the accou nts preparation process, the Foundation Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. In accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual, paragraph 2.12, the financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis unless the Di rectors either intend to apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the Foundation Trust without the transfer of the services to another entity, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The Directors have therefore prepared these financia l statements on a going concern basis. The Directors have also considered the advice in the Government Reporting Manual that: \"The anticipated continuation of the provision of a service in the future, as evidenced by inclusion of financial provision for that service in published documents, is normally sufficient evidence of going concern\". After making enquiries, the Directors have concluded that there is sufficient evidence that services will continue to be provided and that there is financial provi sion within the forward plans of commissioners. Local CCGs and NHS England have recently all confirmed the status of 'commissioner regulated services' provided by the Trust for 2018/19 and signed contracts remain in place for such services. Directors will also rely on the assurance of continued support from NHS Improvement in the future. The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that service continuity will be the case and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern b asis. The current economic environment for NHS organisations remains challenging with ongoing internal efficiency gains necessary due to annual tariff (price) reductions, cost pressures in respect of national pay structures, non -pay and drug cost inflatio n, and a national shortage of clinically trained staff. Following a detailed review of the Trust's financial sustainability during 2015 the Board of Directors developed a Sustainability Action Plan to address the local issues and ensure sustainability o f the services provided. On 15th December 2015 the Trust confirmed its intention to enter into a Partnership arrangement with Birmingham Community Healthcare Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust, locally referred to as \"Transforming Care Together\" (TCT). In February 2018 the individual Boards concluded that the integration of the three trusts into one organisation under TCT was no longer a viable option. The key factors taken into account in reaching this decision were: - Strategic fit - recent NHS planning guidance for 2018/19 highlighted the strengthening role of Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) in developing models of care appropriate to their geographical footprints, and the TCT proposal would have operated across two (namely Birmingham & Solihull and the Black Country); Clinical concerns - discussions around how best to integrate the three Trusts' clinical areas raised a number of challenges for all three organisations; Financial - the financial plan for the integrated organisation could not meet the requirements that were set for the transaction. NHS Improvement has been supportive of the decision to cease the TCT partnership for the above reasons. Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018162 185 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounti ng Policies (Continued) The Board of Directors is currently reviewing the strategic options that are available to the Trust to ensure the continuation of services to local users and carers. As part of this process the Trust will reflect on the lessons lea rnt from TCT. However, the main aim of TCT was the integration of clinical services across the Black Country STP and whilst TCT as an organisational form will not now progress, this remains our key strategic objective and much valuable joint working with o ur partners will help to stabilise these services for the future. The Trust is continuing to work collaboratively with colleagues in Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Trust towards developing integrated Black Country Mental Health, Learning Disability and associated Community services. The Chief Executive Officers and the Chairmen of both Trusts met on the 10 April 2018, and our respective Executive Teams on 26 April 2018, to continue discussions around establishing a common strategic approach and timescal e. The Trust is further refreshing its stakeholder engagement strategy, post TCT, which will look to re -establish other partnerships which could strengthen existing services, and may identify further opportunities for strategic development in the future. In parallel to the collaborative working and stakeholder strategy development, the Trust will be focused upon the delivery of recovery plans for Mental Health. In addition, the Children's, Young People and Families Division will develop strategies to ensu re resilience against the potential impact of the Dudley Multispecialty Community Provider (MCP) tendering process. The Learning Disabilities Division will work to implement the ambitious local Transforming Care Partnership (TCP) initiative. The review and analysis of service line management information will be key to ensure that there are service specifications in place for each service line, which is matched by income to cover the cost of delivery of that specification or a revised specification drawn up to reduce costs, in partnership with commissioners. At the same time the Trust will benchmark overhead costs and develop a plan to reduce overheads. The Trust has incurred a deficit before impairment of \u00a32.9m for the year ended 31st March 2018 - (2.9% of turnover). The deficit before impairment for 2016/17 was \u00a30.6m. The Directors consider that the outlook presents significant challenges in terms of cash -flow and the need to deliver significant efficiency savings in year. The Trust has prepared its fina ncial plans and cash flow forecasts on the contractual income agreed with commissioners in signed contracts and forecast non -contract activity based on previous experience. In addition, the Trust has negotiated the provision of short term cash support from NHS Improvement. These are expected to be sufficient to enable the Trust to meets its obligations as they fall due in the short term. However, the Directors have identified that there are material uncertainties which casts doubt over whether the Trust ca n continue to exist in its current form, and to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, in the longer term. The Trust has continued to develop and maintain several cash management initiatives during the past year to provide early warni ng of any working capital risks. The Trust foresees a requirement for cash support during the year ending 31st March 2019 commencing during quarter 2. Preparatory discussions have taken place with NHS Improvement and the outcomes confirm that cash support will be made available. The significant risks facing the Trust are summarised as follows: The Trust has submitted a cash flow plan which shows a closing position at 31st March 2019 of \u00a31.3m - incorporating \u00a32.1m of funding drawn down from NHSI in in qua rter 2. There is uncertainty over whether the Trust will achieve its efficiency savings of \u00a34.2m which have been incorporated into its financial plan. This level of savings is challenging and must be supported with adequate operational engagement to deli ver against agreed detailed plans. As of April 2018 schemes totaling \u00a31.4m (33%) of the total target have been identified - \u00a30.8m (60%) recurrently. There is a reasonable expectation that normal staff turnover will yield further savings of \u00a32m; The cessat ion of the Transforming Care Together strategic partnership has resulted in the Trust needing time to be able to reform its identity as BCPFT and develop a new sustainability plan for the future. The Dudley MCP procurement process (impact in 2019/20) is st ill ongoing with the Trust requesting to be a sub-contractor. Currently the Trust is awaiting completion of the procurement process and confirmation of sub - contractor status. The Trust has entered into negotiation with the Local Government Pension Scheme r egarding the forced withdrawal from that scheme of a small number of Trust employees in 2018/19. The Trust could be liable to meet a share of the Fund' deficit if such a transfer progresses. The following factors could potentially impact the Trust's perfo rmance and position: Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018163 186 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) Increasing demand for mental health, learning disabilities and universal children's services for which the Trust was not remunerated; Commissioners' ability to p ay for increasing demand for services; Unplanned capital investment required to maintain the Trust's estate and infrastructure; Ability to attract and retain highly skilled staff; Development of the Dudley Multispecialty Community Provider (MCP). There ar e thus material uncertainties which may cast doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern in the longer term, when it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statemen ts do not include any adjustments that would be required if the going concern basis were not appropriate. 1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of propert y, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.1.2 Consolidation of Charitable Funds Black Country Partnership Foundation Trust Charitable Funds is the Trust's charity. The Trust has determ ined that it controls the charity but due to the level of charitable funds being immaterial, the Trust has not consolidated these funds into the annual accounts. 1.2 Income recognition Income in respect of services provided is recognised when, and to the extent that, performance occurs and is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners in respect of healthcare services and the main types of income this relates to are co st and volume income, block contract income and clinical partnerships providing mandatory services. At year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year where payment is yet to be received. Where income is received for a spe cific activity which is to be delivered in the following financial year, that income is deferred. Income from the sale of non -current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. 1.3 Expenditure on Employee Benefits Short -term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment -related payments are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry -forward leave into the following period. 1.4 Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are cov ered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefor e, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined bene fit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, wit h approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the repor ting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous NOTES Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018164 187 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.4 Pension costs (continued) accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2018, is based on valuation data as 31 March 2017, updated to 31 March 2018 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of th e scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Offi ce. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The last published actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed for the year ending 31 March 2012. The Scheme Regulations allow for the level of contribution rates to be changed by the Secretary of St ate for Health, with the consent of HM Treasury, and consideration of the advice of the Scheme Actuary and employee and employer representatives as deemed appropriate. The next actuarial valuation is to be carried out as at 31 March 2016 and is currentl y being prepared. The direction assumptions are published by HM Treasury which are used to complete the valuation calculations, from which the final valuation report can be signed off by the scheme actuary. This will set the employer contribution rate pay able from April 2019 and will consider the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap. There are provisions in the Public Service Pension Act 2013 to adjust member benefits or contribution rates if the cost of the Scheme changes by more than 2% of pay. Subject to this 'employer cost cap' assessment, any required revisions to member benefits or contribution rates will be determined by the Secretary of State for Health after consultation with the relevant stakeholders. Local Government Superannuati on Scheme Some employees are members of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme (LGPS) which is a \"final salary\" defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme assets and liabilities attributable to these employees can be identified and are recognised in t he Trust's accounts as part of 'IAS 19 Employee Benefits' accounting requirements. The assets are measured at fair value, and the liabilities at the present value of future obligations. Staff who transferred to the Care Trust on 1st March 2003 from Sandwe ll Metropolitan Borough Council contribute to the LGPS locally administered by the West Midlands Metropolitan Authorities Pension Fund. From 1st April 2010 to 31st March 2018, the Care Trust paid employer's contribution of 14.5%. The contribution rate is determined by the Fund's actuary based on 3 yearly valuations, with the last review being 31 March 2016. The LGPS is subject to a full actuarial valuation every three years. Between the full valuations the LGPS is subject to an IAS 19 Employee Benefits v aluation every year. The purpose of this valuation in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the LGPS taking into account its recent demographic experience and to recommend t he contribution rates to be paid by employers and LGPS members. From 1 April 2008, employee's contributions are on a tiered scale from 5.5% up to 7.5% of their pensionable pay depending on total earnings. Further information can be found in the Pension Fund's Annual Report which is available on request from The West Midlands Metropolitan Authorities Pensions Fund, Care of Wolverhampton City Council, Civic Suite, St Peter's Square, Wolverhampton, WV1 1SL or the Fund's website at www.wmpfonline.com. The increase or decrease in the liability arising from pensionable service earned during the year is recognised within operating expenses. Actuarial gains and losses during the year are recognised in the pensions reserve and reported in the Statement of Comp rehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income/ (expense)'. LGPS Provisions as at 31 March 2018 Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018165 188 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (continued) 1.4 Pension costs (continued) The LGPS is a \"career average revalued earnings\" scheme. Annual pensions are normally based on 1/60th of the best of the last 3 years pensionable pay for each year of service. No lump sum is payable on membership accrued from 1 April 2008 and previous membership rights prior to this date were frozen a t that point with certain protections being applicable to some employees. Annual increases are applied to pension payments at rates defined by the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 and are based on changes in consumer prices (CPI) in the twelve months ending 3 0 September in a previous calendar year. On death, a pension of 50% of the member's pension is normally payable to the surviving eligible beneficiaries. Early payment of a pension, with enhancement, is available to members of the LGPS who are permanently incapable of fulfilling their duties effectively through illness or infirmity. A death gratuity of three times the final year's pensionab le pay is payable for death in service. For early retirements, other than those due to ill health, the additional pe nsion liabilities are not funded by the LGPS. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the statement of comprehensive income at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. The LGPS provides the opportunity to members to increase their benefits through money purchase Additional Voluntary Contributions provided by an approved life company. Under the arrangement the employee can make contributions to enhance their pension benefits. The benefits payable relate directly to the value of the investments made. 1.5 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair valu e of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non -current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 1.6 Property, Plant and Equipment Recognition Property, Plant and Equipmen t is capitalised where: It is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; It is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided; It is expected to be used for more than one financial year; and The cost of the item can be measured reliably. Tangible assets are capitalised if they are capable of being used for a period which exceeds one year and they: individually have a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or collectively have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 a nd individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or form part of the ini tial equipping and setting -up cost of a new building, ward or unit irrespective of their individual or collective cost. Measurement All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost (for leased assets at fair value), representi ng the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary fo r it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at fair value . For all categories of non -property assets, the Trust considers that depreciated historical cost is an acceptable proxy for current value in existing use, as the useful economic lives used are considered to be a realistic reflection of the lives of assets a nd the depreciation methods used reflect the consumption of the asset. Land and Buildings are restated to fair value by undergoing a full valuation by external professionally qualified valuers every five years with an interim valuation to take place annua lly. The interim valuation is carried out by Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018166 189 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.6 Property, Plant and Equipment (continued) external professionally qualified valuers unless the Trust can provide sufficient evidence that the valuation could be carried out by a professionally qualified valuer employed by the Trust. Valuations are carried out by professionally qualified valuers having regard to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applied to the United Ki ngdom public sector and in accordance with HM Treasury guidance, International Valuation Standards and the requirements of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Standards - Global and UK (7th Edition). A full valuation was undertaken during October 2016 to assess the existing use value of the Trust's properties using the depreciated replacement cost method assuming assets would be replaced with a modern equivalent asset and not on a like for like basis. A further desktop valuation was undertaken as at 31 March 2018 for the year end valuation. Operational equipment is carried at current value. Where assets are of low value and, or have short useful economic lives, they are carried at depreciated historic cost as a proxy for current val ue. Assets under construction are valued at cost and are subsequently revalued by professional valuers when brought into use or when factors indicate that the value of the asset differs materially from its carrying value. Subsequent expenditure Where sub sequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment enhances an asset beyond its original specification, the directly attributable cost is added to the asset's carrying value. Where subsequent expenditure is simply restoring the asset to the specification assumed by its economic useful life then the expenditure is charged to operating expenses. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carry ing amount of the part replaced is de -recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Items of Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their remaining useful economic lives in a manner consistent wi th the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. The useful economic lives of assets are reviewed on an annual basis and the effects of any change are recognised on a prospective basis. The economic life applied to buildings is dependent on the building it relates to. In accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment the Trust uses the following economic lives to depreciate its assets on a component basis: Estimated useful / remaining economic lives Minimum life (Years) Maximum life (Yea rs) Buildings (excluding dwellings) 4 77 Plant and Machinery 5 15 Information Technology 5 8 Furniture and Fittings 7 10 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use. Revaluation gains and losses Reval uation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income/ (expense)'. Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018167 190 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.6 Property, Plant and Equipment (continued) Impairments In accordance with the Department of Health Gro up Accounting Manual, impairments that are due to a loss of economic benefits or service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amou nt equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment arising from a loss of economic benefit or service potential is rev ersed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating income to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been re cognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluati on reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. De-recognition Assets intended for disposals are reclassified as 'Held for Sa le' once all of the following criteria are met: the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; the sale must be highly probable i.e.: o management are committed to a plan to sell the asset; o an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale; o the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price; o the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'Held for Sale'; and o the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be dropped or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged. Assets are de -recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as 'Held for Sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's economic life is adjusted. The asset is de -recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. Donated, government grant and other grant funded assets Donated and grant funded propert y, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation or grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation or grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met. The donated and grant funded assets are subseq uently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 1.7 Intangible assets Recognition Intangible assets are non -monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of th e Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measure d reliably. Intangible assets are capitalised when they are capable of being used in the Trust's activities for more than one year; they can be valued, and they have a cost of at least \u00a35,000. Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018168 191 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.7 Intangible assets (continued) Purchased computer software licences are capitalised as intangible fixed assets where expenditure of at least \u00a35,000 is incurred. They are amortised over the shorter of the term of the licence and their useful e conomic lives (3 -5 years). Internally generated intangible assets Internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and similar items are not capitalised as intangible assets. Expenditure on research is not capitalise d. Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: the project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use; the Trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it; the Trust has the ability to sell or use the asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic or service delivery benefits e.g. the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used fo r internal use, the usefulness of the asset; adequate financial, technical and other resources are available to the trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset; and the Trust can measure reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during development. Software Software which is integral to the operation of hardware e.g. an operating system is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware e.g. ap plication software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Measurement Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operati ng in the manner intended by management. For all categories of intangible assets, the Trust considers that depreciated historical cost is an acceptable proxy for current value in existing use, as the useful economic lives used are considered to be a reali stic reflection of the lives of assets and the depreciation methods used reflect the consumption of the asset. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at fair value. Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where and to the extent that they reverse impairment previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Decreases in asset values and impairments are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other compr ehensive income/ (expense)'. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or 'fair value less costs to sell'. Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over a range of useful economic lives in a manner consistent w ith the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits and charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 1.8 Revenue government and other grants Government grants are grants from Government bodies other than income from Clinical Commissioning G roups or NHS trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018169 192 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.9 Protected and non- protected assets Property needed for the purposes of providing mandatory goods and services and mandatory training and education is protected. The Trust may not dispose of any protected property without the approval of NHS Improvement. The Trust shall establish and maintain an asset register in respect of protected property, in accordance with guidance to be issued by NHS Improvement. Assets which are not required for the provision of mandatory goods and services and the mandatory train ing and education are not protected and may be disposed of by the Trust without the approval of NHS Improvement. 1.10 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first in, first out basis. High turnover items suc h as drugs are held in the financial statements at cost. 1.11 Financial instruments and financial liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities which arise from contracts for the purchase or sale of non -financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements, are recognised when, and to the extent which performance occurs i.e. when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. De-recognitio n All financial assets are de -recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de -recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Classification and Measurement Financial assets are categorised as: Fair Value through Income and Expenditure; Loans and receivables; or Available - for-sale financial assets. Financial liabilities are classified as 'F air value through Income and Expenditure' or as 'Other Financial liabilities'. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non -derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets. The Trust's loans and receivables comprise: current investments, cash and cash equivalents, NHS receivables, accrued income and 'other receivables'. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions costs , and are measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or when appropriate a sh orter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest on loans and receivables is calculated using the effective interest method and credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Other financial liabilities All other financial li abilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future cash paym ents through the expected life of the financial liability, or when appropriate a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. They are included in current liabilities except for amounts payable more than 12 months after the Stat ement of Financial Position date, which are classified as long -term liabilities. Interest on financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method and charged to Finance Costs. Interest on financial liabilities taken out to finance property, plant and equipment or intangible assets is not capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018170 193 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.11 Financial instruments and financial liabilities (continued) Impairment of financial assets At the Statement of Financial Position date, the Trust assesses whether any financial assets, other than those held at 'fair value through profit and loss' are impaired. Financial assets are impaired and impairment losses are recognised if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and which has an impact on the estimated future cash -flows of the asset. 1.12 Finance leases Where substantially a ll risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the NHS Foundation Trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair val ue of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of prop erty plant and equipment. The annual rental is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability, is de -recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 1.13 Operating Leases Land operating leases - Trust as lessee Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the bu ilding component and the classification for each is assessed separately. Building operating leases - Trust as lessee Building operating lease rentals are charged to operating expenses on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease incentives received are added to the lease rentals and charged to operating expenses over the life of the lease. 1.14 Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) transactions Recognition HM Treasury has determined that government bodies shall account for infrastru cture PFI schemes following the principles of the requirements of IFRIC 12. Where the government body (the Grantor) meets the following conditions the PFI scheme falls within the scope of a 'service concession' under IFRIC 12: The grantor controls the use of the infrastructure and regulates the services to be provided to whom and at what price; and The grantor controls the residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the arrangement as service concession arrangements. The Trust therefore recognises the PFI asset as an item of property, plant and equipment on the Statement of Financial Position together with a liability to pay for it. The PFI asset recognised is the 'Hallam Street Hospital' as detailed in note 10.5. The services received under t he contract are recorded as operating expenses. Measurement The PFI assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, when they come into use, in accordance with the HM Treasury interpretation of IFRIC 12. The assets are measured initially at fair value in accordance with the principles of IAS 17 Leases. HM Treasury guidance for PFI assets is the construction cost and capitalised fees incurred as at financial close, disclosed in the PFI contract. Subsequently, the assets are measured at fair value , which is kept up to date in accordance with the Trust's approach for each relevant class of asset in accordance with the principles of IAS 16, as detailed in accounting policy note 1.6 'Property, plant and equipment - measurement'. For specialised buildi ngs this is depreciated replacement cost. A PFI liability is recognised at the same time as the PFI asset is recognised. It is measured initially at the same amount as the fair value of the PFI assets and is subsequently measured as a finance lease liabil ity in accordance with IAS 17 Leases. The PFI lease obligations due at the reporting date are detailed in note 16. Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018171 194 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.14 Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) transactions (continued) Subsequent expenditure The annual unitary payments are apportioned, using appropriate estimation techniques between the repayment of the liability, a finance cost, lifecycle replacement and the charge for services. The element of the annual unitary payment that is allocated as a finance lease rental is applied to meet the annual finance expense and to repay the lease liability over the contract term. The annual finance cost is calculated by applying the implicit interest rate in the lease to the opening lease li ability for the period, and is recognised under the relevant finance costs heading within note 7. The fair value of services received in the year is recognised under the relevant operating expenses headings within note 3. Lifecycle replacement Lifecycle costs in respect of components of assets replaced by the operator during the contract ('lifecycle replacement') are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. 1.15 Cash and cash equivalents Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorde d at the current values of the balances in the NHS Foundation Trust's cash book. These balances exclude monies held in the Foundation Trust's bank account belonging to patients (see \"third party assets\" - note 13). Account balances are only set off whe re a formal agreement has been made with the bank to do so. In all other cases overdrafts are disclosed within other creditors. Interest earned on bank accounts and interest charged on overdrafts is recorded as, respectively, \"finance income\" and \"finance cost\" in the periods to which they relate. Bank charges are recorded as an operating expense in the periods to which they relate. 1.16 Provisions The NHS Foundation Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk -adjusted cash flows are discounted using HM Treasury's published rates. Clinical negligence costs The NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the NHS Foundation Trust pays an annual contribution to the NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cas es, the legal liability remains with the NHS Foundation Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the NHS Foundation Trust is disclosed at note 17 but is not recognised in the NHS Foundation Trust's acc ounts. Non- clinical risk pooling The NHS Foundation Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in re turn receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 1.17 Contingencies Contingent assets These are assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control and are not recognised as assets. Contingent liabilities These liabilities are not recognised, but are discl osed in note 18, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: Possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain fu ture events not wholly within the entity's control; or Present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018172 195 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.18 Public dividend capital Public Dividend Capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time the Secretary of State can issue new public dividend capital to, and request payment of public dividend capital from the Trust. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the NHS Foundation Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net ass ets of the NHS Foundation Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for; (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii) average daily cash balances he ld with the Government Banking Services (GBS), and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short -term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accord ance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the 'pre -audit' version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calcu lated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result of the audit of the annual accounts. 1.19 Value Added Tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.20 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currencies of the trust are sterling. A transaction which is denominated in a foreign currency is translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Where the trust has assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the Statement of Financial Position date: monetary items (other than financial instruments measured at 'fair value through income and expenditure') are translated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March; non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction; and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated using t he spot exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains or losses on monetary items arising on settlement of the transaction or on re -translation at the Statement of Financial Position date are recognised in income or expense in t he period in which they arise. Exchange gains or losses on non -monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the same manner as other gains and losses on these items. 1.21 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on b ehalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the NHS Foundation Trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts (see note 13 ) in accordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM. 1.22 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are Accounts and Associated NotesAnnual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018173 196 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.22 Losses and special payments (continued) therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had NHS trusts no t been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). However the losses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. ( See note 23 ). 1.23 Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that p eriod or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The main areas which require the exercise of judgement are in accounting for: Valuation of non -current assets - see note 10 Actuarial ass umptions in respect of post -employment benefits - see note 21 Assumptions underlying the likelihood and outcome of material provisions The Trust has considered key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. None were found to be material. 1.24 Accounting standards that have been issu ed but have not yet been adopted The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC but are not yet required to be adopted: Standards issued or amended but not yet adopted in FReM Financial year for w hich the change first applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted.

Accounts and Associated Notes Annual Report, Quality Report and Accounts April 2017 - March 2018174 197 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting Policies (Continued) 1.24 Accounting standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted (continued) The Trust has considered the above new standards, interpretati ons and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Trust or that they would not have a significant impact on the Trust's financial statements, apart from some additional disclosures. Following the release of the 2018/19 Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual in May 2018, the Trust is assessing the likely impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 (and the adaptations included in the GAM). 1.25 Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations issued that have been adopted early The Trust has not early adopted any new accounting standards, amendments or interpretations. 1.26 Transfers of functions to/ from other NHS bodies / local government bodies For functions that have been transferred to the Trust from another NHS/local government body, the assets and liabilities transferred are recognised in the accounts as at the date of transfer. The assets and liabilities are not adjusted to fair value prior to recognition. The net gain/(loss) corresponding to the net assets/ (liabilities) transferred to be recognised within income / (expenses), but not within operating activities. For property plant and equipment assets and intangible assets, the cost and accumulated depreciation/ amortisation balances from the transferring entity's accounts are preserved on recognition in the Trust's accounts. Where the transferring body recognised revaluation reserve balances attributable to the assets, the trust makes a transfer from its income and expenditure reserve to its revaluation reserve to maintain the transparency within public sector accounts. For functions that the trust has transferred to another NHS/local government body, the assets and liabilities transferred are de -recognised from the accounts as at the date of transfer. The net (loss)/gain corresponding to the net assets/(liabilities) transferred is recognised within (expenses)/income, but not within operating activities. Any revaluation reserve balances attributable to assets de -recognised are transferred to the income and expenditure reserve. Adjustments to align the acquired function to the Trusts accounting policies are applied after initial recognition and are adjusted directly in taxpayers' equity.

Financial instruments and related disclosures IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures require an explanation of the r ole that financial instruments have h ad during the period in creating or changing the risks an entity faces in undertak ing its activities. A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financ ial asset of one body and a financial liability or equity instrument i n another body. The Trust does not have any complex financial instruments and does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and because of the continuing service provider relationship the Trust has with Clinical Commissioning Groups, and the way those Cli nical Commissioning Groups are financed, the Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of the listed companies to which IFRS 7 mainly applies. Due to the Trust's terms o f authorisation it has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds 213 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day -to-day operational activ ities rather than being held to change the risks facing the Trust in undertaking its activities. The Trust's financial instruments comprise provisions, cash at bank and in hand and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that ari se directly from its operations.
