This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract The research is aimed to explore the distinct molecular signatures in discriminating the rheumatoid arthritis patients with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)cold pattern and heat pattern. Twenty patients with typicalTCM cold pattern and heat pattern were included. Micro-array technology was used to reveal gene expression pro-Wles in CD4+ T cells. The signal intensity of each expressed gene was globally normalized using the R statis- tics program. The ratio of cold pattern to heat pattern inpatients with RA at more or less than 1:2 was taken as thediVerential gene expression criteria. Protein-protein inter- action information for these genes from databases wassearched, and the highly connected regions were detected by IPCA algorithm. The signi Wcant pathways were tool. Twenty-nine genes di Verentially regu- lated between cold pattern and heat pattern were found. Among them, 7 genes were expressed signi Wcantly more in cold pattern. Biological network of protein-protein interac-tion information for these signi Wcant genes were searched and four highly connected re gions were detected by IPCA algorithm to infer signi Wcant complexes or pathways in the biological network. Particularly, the cold pattern was related to Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The follow- ing related pathways in heat pattern were included:Calcium signaling cell adhesion molecules;PPAR signaling pathway; fatty acid metabolism. Theseresults suggest that better knowledge of the main biological processes involved at a given pattern in TCM might help to choose the most appropriate treatment. Keywords Protein and protein interaction \u00b7 Genomics \u00b7 Pathway \u00b7 Rheumatoid arthritis \u00b7 Traditional Chinese medicine Introduction Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic in Xammatory disease of unknown etiology. Its world wide prevalence is approximately 1% [ 1]. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is widely used in China and was found to be e Vec- tive in the treatment of RA [ 2]. Pattern diVerentiation in TCM, as the key term in TCM therapeutic theory, is basedon the physiology and pathology of TCM [ 3]. The eYcacy of TCM is entirely based on patterns di Verentiation, since the pattern guides the herb al medicine prescription [ 2, 4, 5]. Furthermore, our previous study showed the e Vective rate of the biomedical combinatio n therapy was higher in the patients with a cold pattern than in patients with a hotC. Lu \u00b7 G.

Following the TCM clinical practice, the patients with RA can be classi Wed into two main patterns: the cold pat- tern and the heat pattern. The cold pattern can be describedas severe pain in a joint or muscle that limits the range ofcomfortable movement which does not move to other loca-tions. The pain is relieved by applying warmth to theaVected area, but increases with exposure to cold. Loose stools are characteristic as well as an absence of thirst and clear profuse urine. A thin white tongue coating is seen,combined with a wiry and tight pulse. In contrast, the heatpattern is characterized by severe pain with hot, red,swollen and in Xamed joints. Pain is generally relieved by applying cold to the joints. Other symptoms include fever, thirst, a Xushed face, irritability, restlessness, constipation and deep-colored urine. The tongue may be red with ayellow coating and the pulse may be rapid [ 5, 6]. Nearly, every aspect of a disease phenotype should be represented in the pattern of genes and proteins that areexpressed in the patient. The molecule signature typically represents characteristics and subtypes of the disease [ 7]. The advent of microarray technology has provided a pow-erful tool to gain insight into the molecular complexity ofthe diversity. Moreover, this technology facilitates to iden-tify comprehensively the genes and biological pathway thatare associated with di Verent pattern in TCM. Preliminary work supports that CD4+ T cell plays a fundamental role in pathogenesis of RA [ 8, 9]. Hence, the identi Wcation of diVerentially molecule characteristic in CD4+ T cell can help to reveal the heterogeneity of the pattern in RA. Here, in the present study, we applied gene expression proWling to CD4+ T cells from RA patient with cold pattern or heat pattern in TCM to try to indentify underlying bio- logical and molecular di Verence of the pattern. Materials and methods Patients Twenty female patients with RA from the Sino-Japan friendship hospital, aged from 12 to 68 years old (1 casewas at age of 12, 7 cases were from age of 30 to 50, and 12 cases from age of 50-68) were eligible to participate if they met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteriafor RA for at least 1 year with functional Class at level I, II,or III [ 10]. The patients with typical TCM cold pattern and heat pattern diagnosed according to TCM theory (RA withcold pattern showed no color change in joint, severe pain in cold condition; RA with heat pattern showed red joint,severe pain in hot condition) were collected in the study. Patients continuously receiving non-steroidal anti-inXammatory drugs, corticosteroids for over 6 months, or receiving the above-menti oned medicine with 1 month were not included in the study. Patients with severe cardio- vascular, lung, liver, kidney, hematologic, or mental dis- ease and women who were pregnant, breast-feeding, orplanning to become pregnant in the next 8 months wereexcluded. The study was condu cted according to the guide- lines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles ofGood Clinical Practice (China). Sample preparation A volume of 6 ml venous blood was collected from all 20 participants (ten patients with heat pattern, ten patients withcold pattern) and 1 control before breakfast. CD4+ T cells were extracted and puri Wed from the whole blood by RosetteSep\u00ae Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail(StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada). TotalRNA was isolated from the CD4+ T cells using Trizolextraction method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Canada) asdescribed by the manufacturer. mRNAs ampli Wed linearly using the MessageAmp aRNA Kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, USA) in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. cRNA was puri Wed with RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) based on a standard proce-dure. All arrays had the same label: Cy3 for Genome Microarray Kit, 4\u00a344 Technologies) was used in this study. Microarray hybridizations were carried out on labeled cRNAs. Arrays were at 65\u00b0C for 17 h in Agilent's microarray hybridization chambers and subse-quently washed according to the Agilent protocol. Arrays were scanned at 5 /afii9839m resolution using GenePix Personal 4100A (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Auto photomultiplier tube (PMT) gains were adjusted to obtain a ratio of Cy3 and Cy5 channels intensities. Statistics and function analysisAll data were analyzed on a SAS9.1.3 statistical package (order no. 195557). The signal intensity of each expressed gene was globally normalized (LOWESS) using the Rstatistics program [ 11]. The ratio of cold pattern to heat pat- tern in patients with RA at more or less than 1:2 was takenas the diVerential gene expression criteria. Statistical adju sted by Power Procedure ofRheumatol Int (2012) 32:61-68 63 123SAS software, which controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR). For the contrast, a gene is considered di Verentially expressed if the Power value is more than 0.85. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) can be considered the basic skeleton for living organism self-organization and homeostasis [ 12]. In this study, information on human PPI network from these signi Wcant genes was obtained from Databases, including BIND (Biomolecular InteractionNetwork Database), BioGRID (The General Repository forInteraction Datasets), DIP (Database of Interacting Pro-teins), HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database), IntAct (Database system and analysis tools for protein interaction data), and MINT (Molecular Interactions Database), andcomplemented with curated relationships parsed fromLiterature using Agilent PPInetwork was visualized using cytoscape [ 13]. We integrated the database and the networks (above mentioned) and then used IPCA to analyze the characteris- tics of the network. The IPCA algorithm can detect highlyconnected regions (or clusters ) in the interactome network [14]. Interactomes with a score greater than 2.0 and at least four nodes were taken as signi Wcant predictions. Further analysis of gene ontology categories was per- formed to indentify the function of each highly connected region generated by IPCA individually. The latest versionof Biological Network Gene Ontology (BiNGO) tool [ 15] was used to statistically evaluate groups of proteins withrespect to the existing annotations of the Gene OntologyConsortium. The degree of functional enrichment for a given cluster was quantitatively assessed ( Pvalue) by hypergeometric distribution, implemented in BiNGO tool.We selected the 5 GO biologi cal categories with the small- est Pvalues as signi Wcant. Results Using a ttest, we identi Wed a combination of 29 genes (IFI27 appeared 4 times) di Verentially regulated between cold pattern and heat pattern (Fig. 1, Table 1). These genes clearly separated cold pattern from heat pattern in RA. Among these 29 genes, 7 genes were expressed signi W- cantly more in cold pattern. Biological network of protein-protein interaction infor- mation for these signi Wcant genes was searched and visual- ized using Cytoscape (Fig. 2). Four highly connected regions were detected by IPCA algorithm to infer signi W- cant complexes or pathways in the biological network(Fig. 3). We used BiNGO tools to statistically evaluate groups of the genes with respect to the present annotation categoriesof the Gene Ontology Consortium. The most relevant func- tion and pathways extracted fr om these 4 highly connectedregions were involved in I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade, inXammatory response, protein kinase cascade, innate immune response, defense response, immune systemprocess (Table 2), integrin-mediated signaling pathway, cell adhesion, biological adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cell-substrate adhesion (Table 3), antigen processing and presentation of peptide, antigen processing and presenta-tion, immune response, immune systems process, responseto stimulus (Table 4), sterol transport, cholesterol transport, phospholipid e Zux, cholesterol e Zux, phospholipid trans- port, lipid transport (Table 5). Particularly, the cold pattern was related to Toll-like receptor signaling pathway(Fig. 3a). The following related pathways in heat pattern were included: Calcium signaling pathway (Fig. 3b); Cell adhesion molecules (Fig. 3c); PPAR signaling pathway, Fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 3d). Discussion The clinical experience in TCM over its long history suggested that pattern di Verentiation has some role in the pathogenesis of disease and determination of treatmenteYcacy. The previous study suggested that the pattern diVerentiation in TCM in patients with RA had similar clas- siWcation as those obtained from statistical-based clinicalFig. 1 Cluster diagram of the expression of 29 signi Wcantly expressed genes in 10 RA patients with heat patterns and 10 RA patients withcold patterns.

Red repre- sents relative expression greater than the median expression levelacross all samples, and the green represents an expression level lower than the median 64 Rheumatol Int (2012) 32:61-68 123data [ 16]. Our study also showed this pattern di Verentiation in RA could a Vect the eYcacy of the biomedical therapy [6]. This unprecedented information has implied the distinct basis of the pattern. Herein, we showed the gene expression proWling of the pattern di Verentiation in patients with RA revealed biological signi Wcance during the course. In our study, a di Verential expression of 29 reference sequence genes (22 down-regulated and 7 up-regulated incold pattern compared with th e heat pattern) was observed. We identiWed a remarkably elevated expression of a spec- trum of genes involved in collagen VI, pathogen recogni-tion and activation of innate immunity in CD4+ T cell ofcold pattern in patients with RA, whereas up-regulatedgenes in heat pattern participated in proliferation and/ordiVerentiation, cholesterol e Zux, regulation of cellular functions, regulation of protein sorting and membranetraYcking, immunoregulatory processes. Further analysis with PPI approach reveals two major interesting Wndings. First, the Toll-like receptor (TLRs) signaling pathway was found to be related to the cold pattern. A previousreport [ 17] showed the TLRs have been implicated in various inXammatory arthopathies. They recognize patho- gen-derived factors and also products of in Xamed tissue, and trigger signaling pathways that lead to activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF- /afii9837B) and the interferon regulatory f actors. These in turn lead to induction of immune and in Xammatory genes, including such important cytokines as tumor necrosis factor-alphaTable 1 DiVerentially expressed genes in cold pattern versus heat pattern in patients with RA Feature num Probe name Gene name Genbank accession interac- tion biological network about the signiWcant genes.

Diamonds repre- sent seed node 66 Rheumatol Int (2012) 32:61-68 123and type I interferon [ 18]. Data also suggest that activation by endogenous TLR ligands may contribute to the pro-in Xammatory cytokines by macro- phages and the joint damage to cartilage and bone thatoccurs in RA [ 19]. The TLR4 can engage with a pathway leading to the activation of the transcription factor inter-feron regulatory factor-3. The interferon regulatory factor-3is required for the induction of a wide range of pro-in Xam- matory cytokines [ 17]. The elevated found in the rheumatoid synovial [ 20]. Moreover, in human macro- phages and Wbroblasts from synovial of individuals with RA, tenascin-C induces synthesis of pro-in Xammatory cytokines via 22] provethat TLR3 and TLR4 are most abundant among the TLR family in synovial Wbroblasts in early RA patients, and stimulation of synovial Wbroblasts with TCR3 ligand poly (I-C) led to the most pronounced increase in IL-6,MMP-3, and MMP-13. In our study, it implied that the inXammatory response is more pronounced in cold pattern than in the heat group. This Wnding correlates well with the fact that the eVective rate of anti-in Xammatory drugs in RA patients with cold pattern is higher than those with a heatpattern [ 6]. Interestingly, the NF- /afii9837B (Table 2), which can be acti- vated by TLR, is an inducible transcription factor that is controlled by the signal activation cascades. NF- /afii9837B con- trols a number of genes involved in immunoin Xammatory responses, cell cycle progression, inhibition of apoptosis,and cell adhesion, thus promoting chronic in Xammatory responses. It induces gene expression of physiological inhibitors of apoptosis such as cIAPs, Bcl-X L, and cFLIP [23]. Moreover, NF- /afii9837B can attenuate the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosi s in the absence of de novo protein synthesis [ 24] through PPI with p53 and proapop- totic protein 53BP2 [ 25, 26]. In contrast, the TRPC3 (Fig. 3b), which up-regulated in heat pattern, plays a role in the calcium ion transport. Overexpression TRPC3 can increase sensitivity to high extracellular calcium-induced apoptosis [ 27]. In the meantime, three in apoptosis, CABLES1, WWOX, and IFI27 are upregulatedin RA heat pattern. Overexpression of CABLES1 results ina signiWcant decrease in cell proliferation rate, which was associated with an increase in apoptosis [ 28]. WWOX is essential for TNF, UV, staurosporine, and p53-mediatedapoptosis [ 29, 30]. Transient expression of IFI27 led to decrease viable cell numbers and enhance sensitivity toDNA-damage-induced apoptosis [ 31]. The results showed the diVerences in the regulation of apoptosis between cold pattern and heat pattern in patients with RA, which was already posed by our previous Wnding [ 32]. Owing to the induction of apoptosis of synovial or lymphocytes, either through suppression of signalingpathways or inhibition of the expression of anti-apoptotic molecule, could be therapeutically bene Wcial in RA [ 33]. The heat pattern with a signature of induction of apoptosisimplied a more brightly prognosis than the cold pattern. Secondly, we also found calcium signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, PPAR signaling pathway, and fattyacid metabolism were related to heat pattern. Ca2+ signals are essential for diverse cellular functions including di Ver- entiation, eVector function, and gene transcription in the immune system. In lymphocytes, sustained Ca2+ entry isnecessary for complete and l maintain a concentration of Ca2+. However, engagement of antigen receptors inducesTable 2 The gene ontology analysis of the sub-networks-A Innate immune response 8.06E-196952 Defense response 1.65E-15 Table 3 The gene ontology analysis of the sub-networks-B GO ID Description of the sub-networks-C GO ID Description Pvalue 2504 Antigen processing and presentation of peptide 8.19E-42 19882 Antigen processing and presentation 1.36E-326955 Immune response 1.32E-212376 Immune systems process 7.36E-2051869 Response to stimulus 7.11E-12 Table 5 The gene ontology analysis of the sub-networks-D GO ID Description from the extracellular space by entr y following antigen-receptor engagement, and their function is essential for driving the program of gene expression that underlies T-cell activation by antigen [ 36]. Cell adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of immune cells transduce a variety of cell-activat-ing signals and mediate important interactions by bindingto multiple speci Wc counter-receptors expressed on other cells or components [ 37]. T-cell extravasation into rheumatoid synovial is a critical aspect of rheumatoid in Xammation. Adhesion receptors play central roles in the pathogenesis of RA by mediatingT-cell interactions with the endothelium and with the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), as well as by delivery of co-stimula-tory signals to the cells [ 38, 39]. Regulation of signal transduction mediated by adhesion molecules on lympho- cytes may be the possible e Vective way for controlling the pathological in Xammatory process in RA [ 40]. Both calcium signaling pathway and cell adhesion moleculesimplied that T-lymphocyte interactions are of more impor-tance in the heat pattern, and it could be a potential target for therapy. Peroxisome pro liferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPAR has threesubtypes (PPARalpha, beta/delta, gamma) showingdiVerent expression patterns in vertebrates [ http://www. genome.jp/kegg/ ]. Literature indicates that sophisticated manipulation of essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolism may have a role in rheumatological disorders [ 41]. The results suggest that PPAR signaling pathway and fatty acid metab-olism might be directly or indirectly involved in RA patho-genesis in heat pattern, but the exactly e Vect is not well understood. Additional work is needed to investigate the mechanism. In summary, our results show that the biological pro- cesses corresponding to the heat pattern in patients with RAmainly include apoptosis induction, T-cell interaction, andfatty acid metabolism. The results suggest that gene expres- sion proWling could be used to some extent in discriminat- ing groups of RA patients with cold or heat pattern. Thediscriminative power was partly validated by the clinicalpractice based on the clinical manifestations in TCM pat-tern diVerentiation, which is important for further strati Wca- tion of disease [ 42]. This study is a step forward in TCM pattern diVerentiation study with distinctive biological markers. Complex designs that include sample pooling, biological and technical replication, sample pairing, and dye-swappingare performed to reduce the systematic sources of variationin microarray experiments [ 43]. The repeated dye-swap experiment is useful for reducing technical variation, and thereplicated dye-swap experiment is useful for comparing independent biological samples. It may be more di Ycult to achieve statistical signi Wcance using the replicated dye-swap experiment, especially if the biological variation is substan-tial [ 44]. In our study, the biological replication was used since the biological variation between cold pattern and heat pattern is the focus of the array design. Conclusions RA patients with TCM cold pattern and heat pattern have distinct molecular signatures with di Verent biological pro- cesses participating. These results suggest that betterknowledge of the main biological processes involved at agiven pattern in TCM might help to choose the most appro-priate treatment.
