The review was made up of three distinct parts: a con sultation with children with CHCN and their families a review of relevant research a survey to identify examples of good practice in service provision. There is no agreed definition of 'complex healthcare' needs among policy makers or professionals and the definition used in this review included children who are disabled, children with special educational needs and children with life-limiting or life threatening conditions. The definition remained flexible enough to allow for the fact that children with CHCN might fit all or none of these categories. This study has contributed to the growing knowledge base by focusing on the priorities of children and young people with CHCN and their families. While this study supports many aspects of current policy and guidance, it raises some additional challenges and suggests that certain issues remain overlooked. Service user and carer involvement Strenuous efforts were made to ensure that the definitions, expectations and experiences of children and young people with CHCN themselves were central to the review - research in this field has to date tended to focus on parents' views. The methodology was jointly developed by the review team and the multi-disciplinary Advisory Group, which included as researchers young people with CHCN and their parents. One of the core group members was also a young person with CHCN. The consultation was conducted expressly to allow an open enquiry into 'social care needs' and good practice, from the perspectives of chil-dren and young people with CHCN as well as those of their families and friends. xCHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES The 25 families involved had 68 children between them; 25 of these children had CHCN and 18 took part directly. They ranged in age from two to 24. Most had multiple health conditions. All used a range of communication methods and six relied solely on non-spoken com-munication. Eleven siblings and seven other relatives and friends also took part. Information gathered from the consultation was used to define the criteria for 'good practice' that the practice survey set out to identify. Rethinking needs; attending to the 'Necessary stuff' The central finding challenges the very foundations of service provision and practice. Much research, policy and guidance has been based on the assumption that needs for health, social or educational services can be separated out and provided by different agencies. The research review and consultation clearly demonstrated, however, that this assumption does not tally with the experiences of children with CHCN and their families, whose healthcare needs are so much part of their everyday lives that they are inextricably linked with other needs. Attending to the 'Necessary stuff', therefore, requires a blurring of standard professional roles and boundaries. This knowledge review has not solved these definitional problems but it is clear that we need further work on how we can use the criteria of 'ordinary life' or 'ordinary needs' to underpin services. Key findings from the practice survey Many examples of 'good practice' on the part of professionals and paid support workers were identified, which illustrate ways of meeting CHCN with minimal disruption to the 'ordinary' lives/needs of the children and their families. According to children with CHCN and their families, good practice in service provision: dem onstrates flexibility and responsiveness to families' individual needs act ively safeguards their 'ordinary' lives and needsx\u0018Executive summary works in partnership with families, valuing their knowledge and ex- pertise wor ks with wider networks, including family, friends, other services and settings. Eight services that fulfilled these good practice criteria were selected. Common features included: fam ilies were perceived as competent experts the child and family were acknowledged as partners in defining need a hig h value was placed on individual relationships different aspects of a child and family's identity were actively recog - nised and accommodated aut onomy was delegated to front line staff high levels of flexibility and responsiveness were provided tasks such as 'navigating', 'signposting', 'way-finding', 'advocating' or 'key working' were included within the function of the service vol unteers were creatively used within programmes The survey also highlighted common difficulties faced by the sample of service providers in their attempts to innovate. Invisibility of social care work There was a mismatch between providers' formal remit and the actual services they provided. This meant that neither social care needs nor services were formally acknowledged. Consequently, workers' formal roles were overly restrictive. This led them to 'break the rules' in order to respond flexibly to families' needs. Planners, commissioners and man-agers need to ensure a better fit between what services are supposed to achieve and what is actually provided. They need to ensure that staff roles are adequate to the remit of their work. Power and responsibility in commissioning arrangements Another barrier identified was current commissioning arrangements and associated contracts that focused narrowly on specific needs, usu-x\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES ally clinical. These further led to social care needs and services being overlooked and restricted the power of service providers to redress this imbalance . Planners and commissioners need to consider how services can be commissioned so that flexibility and responsiveness can be built in at the service design stage. They need to be clear about where re-sponsibility for developing services lies in commissioning arrangements. Feedback loops also need to be in place to allow commissioners to learn from service providers in order to improve practice. Durability of funding arrangements A third barrier was the short-term nature of funding arrangements. This affected the continuity of service provision and familiarity with professionals that matters so much to families. Planners and commission-ers need to explore creative solutions that would allow for longer-term provision of services for children with CHCN and their families. Key findings from the research and consultation What matters most Children and young people with CHCN have the same 'ordinary' wishes and needs as other children. What matters most to them is being able to live at home, go to school, spend time with friends and participate in leisure and community activities with family and peers. This is also important to their families. Other priorities for children and their fami-lies include: - pra ctical issues, such as accessing facilities, getting the right equip- ment and securing the necessary finances - the clinical and organisational competence of staff recruited to carry out aspects of care requiring specialist skills. The priority given to these issues needs to be matched in guidance and practice.x\u0018\u0018\u0018A family-centred approach The findings strongly support a 'family-centred' approach, which considers the needs of all family members, including siblings, both as individuals and as a unit. There is inevitably tension between child and family-centred practice, however, including the potentially conflicting needs of siblings. In order to provide practitioners with examples of good strategic work in action, further exploration of this issue is required. The current allocation of services to specific children and young people, and not to the family as a whole, means that children with CHCN are unable to enjoy play, leisure or child care with their siblings. Providers need to consider changing these restrictions on service allocation. Flexibility and responsiveness Families' consider flexibility and responsiveness to be very important, including: con trol and direct access to services, where and when health needs should be met the accommodation of family events, preferences and emergencies. Providers need to consider how such flexibility and responsiveness can be built into care plans and provision from the beginning, and supported organisationally. Practitioners need flexibility to work out their roles and responsibili- ties, so that any one professional can respond appropriately. However, current service configuration tends to reinforce professional boundaries. Providers need to think about how they can change professional roles to allow such flexibility and ensure the training of staff reaches the level and range of skill required. Inadequate or irrelevant policies, staff training, supervision and sup- port to facilitate flexibility made it difficult to be clear about the worker's responsibility and accountability. These issues need to be addressed by organisations and in each child's plan.Executive summaryx\u0018vCHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES Manner and style of service delivery There is strong evidence that the way in which professionals provide services is as important as the service itself. Parents feel emotionally supported by helpful and compassionate relationships. Organisations need to pay attention to the inter-personal aspect of services and support the development of the skills required. Duration of services Families value services they can rely on over longer periods of time, as well as needing services that can respond rapidly when they are in crisis. They want services that can continue even when their child's needs change, rather than having to keep changing the team or the service. Such continuity in service provision allows for familiarity with professionals and home care providers. This is currently hampered by the short-term allocation of services. Planners and commissioners need to explore creative solutions that would allow for longer-term provision of services. Quality of process Families still often experience services as sources of frustration and despair, rather than support and solace. Notions of 'fighting' and 'struggling' were ubiquitous. Families talk about 'taking on the system'. Services need to protect the quality of the process by building in ways of handling negotiation and disagreement. Key workers There are some indications that families are experiencing benefits from coordinated planning and the keyworker approach, which can relieve families of the burden of coordinating services themselves. However, services need to guard against the risk that key working further mar-ginalises families' participation by relocating the problem one step away from them.xvFurther consideration needs to be given to the particular competencies that key working for children with CHCN and their families might require, due to the complexity of both families' needs and the service sys-tem itself. Organisations need to consider how they can be responsive to families' emotional needs, as well as their practical day-to-day needs. Finally, the benefits of key working must not distract attention from systemic difficulties that key working is not able to address, which in- clude the complexity of funding sources and statutory responsibilities, eligibility criteria for services and geographical differences in service provision.Executive summary\u0018Introduction 1 Introduction 1.1 Aims and approach The overall aim of this knowledge review was to identify what is known about the social care needs of children with complex healthcare needs (CHCN) and their families and about the social care services designed to meet those needs. The difficulties and failures of service provision for children with 'more complex' needs have been extensively researched and reviewed. 1, 2-4 Consequently, we set out to focus specifically on good practice. We also wanted to ensure that the views of children and young people with CHCN and their families were central to the research. Although this principle now guides health and social care policy, research in this field has tended to focus exclusively on parents' views. We wanted to place the definitions, expectations and experiences of children and young people themselves at the heart of the review. The result is a publication that differs from standard Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) knowledge reviews in content and struc-ture. It begins with the results of a consultation that allowed an open enquiry into 'social care' needs and good practice from the perspectives of children and young people with CHCN and their families. A more standard review of relevant research follows. The third section consists of a modified form of practice survey that aimed to identify examples of good practice in service provision. Lastly, an integrative analysis brings together and reflects on the findings from all sources. We compare the emerging themes and findings with current priorities within national policy and guidance across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, draw-ing out implications for policy, practice and research.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00181.2 Policy and practice contexts The knowledge review took place in a rapidly evolving context, which proved both exciting and challenging. In the year leading up to it a number of significant policy initiatives began to impact directly on provision for children with CHCN and their families. Many of these initiatives aimed to improve coordination across services and organisa-tions, following extensive documentation of the difficulties and failures in provision. Over a 25-year period, there has been striking consistency in the way parents report the negative impact on their family life of poor co-ordination and patchy service provision. 1 Commonly reported experiences included: difficult and confusing as-sessment processes; lack of information; lack of joined-up services; serv-ices that focused on a specific need or condition rather than the whole child and family; multiple agencies and confusing funding sources; long delays in funding decisions; finding out about help 'by accident'; and having to fight for support every step of the way. 2-4 Thus many recent initiatives aim to improve service coordination and multiagency working, for example The Children Act 20045 and the Every Child Matters Framework6; National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services ;2 Together from the start ;1 Common Assessment Framework for children and young people ;4 and the Department for Education and Skills' (2006) guidance on multiagency working. Others were designed to improve the accessibility of services, for example the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report on Improving the life chances of disabled people ; 7 and the extension of the Disability Discrimination Act into schools and colleges.8 In the last three months of the knowledge review (November 2005- January 2006), several further major pieces of guidance were launched relating directly to this group of children and families: For the NHS Commissioners commissioning children and young people's palliative care services ; 9 Including me ;10 Complex disability - Exemplar ;11 Removing bar- riers;12 and the White Paper on community health and social care: Our health, our care, our say .13 Again, much of this guidance emphasised the \u0018Introduction need for improved coordination and communication across disciplines and agencies. After we had completed our review and it was in the editing process, a major review of the funding of children's palliative care, led by the Department of Health, reported on evidence of what works in terms of effective funding mechanisms. 14 HM Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills15 also undertook a joint review of disabled children's services, the outcomes of which are very relevant to children with CHCN. This knowledge review thus took place in a rapidly changing context of both policy and provision. This was another reason to focus our work around the priorities of children, young people and their families rather than around specific agencies or services. Some, but not all, of the issues raised in the consultation and the research review are addressed by current initiatives and this is explored further in the Knowledge review conclusions. 1.3 Stakeholder participation The knowledge review as a whole was guided by a multidisciplinary ad-visory group, which included as researchers young people with CHCN, and parents of children with CHCN. One of the core group members was also a young person with CHCN. The review team and advisory group members jointly developed the methodology. Younger children (with and without CHCN) were involved through Triangle's consulta-tive groups in thinking about the issues and about how to approach the consultation with children and their families. The consultation and the research review proceeded in parallel, shar- ing ideas, dilemmas and difficulties throughout and children, young people and parents were centrally involved. They participated in defining the focus of the review question and the methodology of the consulta-tion and the practice survey, reflecting on and analysing themes, and critically reading drafts of the report. The core group met four times across the course of the project; the advisory group met once as a whole group but all members were also involved via email, telephone and individual meetings.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018We wanted the views of children and young people to be central because they are so pivotal and yet have so often been absent. The consultation was conducted expressly to ascertain their views as well as those of their families. The practice survey used information gath-ered from this consultation to define the criteria for the 'good practice' examples of service provision that we subsequently set out to identify. We also searched specifically for children and young people's accounts within the research review, but they were the sole focus of only 9% of the studies analysed, and tended to be the views of more able teenagers and young adults. 1.4 Key definitions Definitional problems related to the key concepts of this review besieged the team from the start. We struggled with terminology at all levels: in our own discussions, in keywording for the research review, in our contacts with children and families and in our approach to different professionals. At various points it was necessary to remind ourselves that exploring the social care needs of children with CHCN did not require us to adhere to existing definitions of 'social' or 'health' care or 'complexity'. In fact, it became apparent that it was important that we did not. 1.4.1 Conceptualising ' co mplex healthcare' needs As noted in the original commissioning brief, there is no agreed defini- tion of complex needs among policy makers or professionals. Our defini-tion of CHCN, therefore, cut across a number of other categorisations, including: children who are disabled, children with special educational needs and children with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. Yet the definition necessarily retains flexibility; children with CHCN might fit all or none of the above categories. For us, the boundaries of the definition proved less challenging than the concept of 'complexity' itself. One family's resources and/or compe-tence, for example, may be much greater than another's. Tube feeding might be seen as a routine, everyday need or as a complex, risky nursing procedure, depending on the skill and experience of the family, where they lived and the services that they used. Thus, the definition of com-\u0018Introduction plexity proves rather un-amenable to rigid classification but is, to an extent, in the eye of the beholder. 1.4.2 Conceptualising 'soc ial care' needs and services Definitions of 'social care' used in the research and guidance and by services also varied widely and families, of course, also had different ways of describing their own and their children's needs. Despite the variety of definitions found in research, guidance and services, they all assumed a fundamental divide between 'health' and 'social care' needs and services. In contrast, from the outset, our discussions with young people and families suggested a much less clear 'division' of needs and serious doubts about the distinction between 'healthcare' and 'social care': 'Social care - that's a tricky one. I must say I don't generally think about it much ... what is a social care need anyway?' (15-year-old with CHCN) 'I don't think of myself as having social care needs. They're just stuff I do.... I don't think of them as a need ... [social care] kind of laps over with things like dressing and eating, I don't really think about it.' (17-year-old with CHCN) 'For me, social care and health care are all bundled together. I need a balance. The social care would include football, computers, going out. The medical care would include meds and nebulisers. If I stop either one of them, the other one gets affected. If I don't go out I get ill. If I don't get medical care, I can't go out.' (22-year-old with CHCN) 'My social care needs are my healthcare needs. When I am eating I need someone to put food in my tube and I need someone to chat with.' (14-year-old with CHCN) Parents also raised concerns about the distinction: 'It's funny isn't it, how parents have to meet health and social care needs at the same time, but services don't?'CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018'... they keep telling me you have to separate out his educational needs and his social needs from his health needs. WELL YOU CAN'T. That's his health needs, that's his disability, that's his educational needs.... I try to explain they don't come as separate bits. I don't care who pays for which bit....' It became evident that the needs of children with CHCN do not fit neatly into the categories of 'healthcare' or 'social care'. The healthcare needs of this group of children and young people are so much a part of their everyday lives that dividing their needs into different categories is deeply problematic. For this group of children and families, therefore, the very idea of 'social care' needs proved difficult to sustain and was often unhelpful. We chose the title of this review 'Necessary stuff' to reflect these definitional problems. It came from a 15 year old who took part in the consultation. She was explaining how fun, friends and a social life were crucial to her quality of life. It became clear that we needed to redefine and reconceptualise the term that was at the very heart of what we had been commissioned to review. Yet we quickly realised that it was neither possible nor desirable to resolve these definitional problems before beginning to review the evidence. Instead, we needed to retain the issue of how best to recon-ceptualise 'social care' needs and services as a question to be answered. This challenged some of the basics of systematic review methodology, not least the formulation of the review questions. 1.5 Review questions The issues around key definitions detailed above had serious implications for our formulation of the review questions to be addressed in this work. We began with the question: 'What is known about the social care needs of children with CHCN and their families and services designed to meet those needs?'. An extremely 'open' question, we were concerned that it was too broad to be adequately answered. Subsequently, we attempted to refine it as follows: What additional social care needs are created when children have CHCN?\u0018Introduction How can social care services best meet these needs in ways that least disrupt an ordinary social life for children with CHCN? What implications follow for policy, practice and research? Through our struggles with the definitions of key concepts, however, it became apparent that, formulated in this way, these questions made assumptions about the nature of needs, and the division of labour associ-ated with meeting them, that were incompatible with and unhelpful to the lives of children and young people we were consulting with. In order to be able to explore these conflicts of definition more fully, it was necessary that we returned to the open question that we had begun with, while keeping the three-part focus: What is known about the social care needs of children with CHCN and their families? What is known about the services designed to meet those needs? What implications follow for policy, practice and research? Consequently, rather than working with predefined terms, a key aim of the knowledge review became to investigate exactly how 'social care' needs and associated services are constituted by children and young people with CHCN and their families on the one hand, and in the research literature on the other. Definitional issues were, therefore, a live concern throughout the life of the project. They are discussed further in the conclusions. 1.6 Remit of the review and limitations In addressing these questions, we limited the focus of the review in various ways: The review focused specifically on children with CHCN in com- munity settings that supported ordinary life in family settings and did not cover children in residential care. Knowledge and practice related to siblings was considered only in as far as it was tied to issues of 'ordinary life', excluding literature about, and services for, siblings rooted in a 'young carers' model. CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018 The needs of children with CHCN during their transition to adult- hood were, similarly, considered only where these linked clearly to 'ordinary life' issues. This tight focus was necessary because the lit-erature on transition is now substantial. The searching for the research review was completed in September 2005 and, therefore, we did not engage in detail with any relevant material published after that date. Further research is warranted in these areas.\u00182 Consultation: What matters? What helps? And what gets in the way? 2.1 Methodology 2.1.1 Making contact We distributed information about the project through a range of routes (clinical, social work and multidisciplinary teams, family support groups, interest groups), using both leaflets for children and young people and letters for families. By these means, families were invited to get in touch with us if they were interested in taking part. We aimed for a diverse mix of families in terms of geographical loca- tion, ethnicity, religion, culture and family make-up. We also aimed for a wide range of children and young people in terms of age, health needs, life experiences and communication methods. We were aware that some families would require specific and innova- tive methods of recruitment and we took steps* to ensure that minority ethnic families, families facing poverty, families who found reading dif-ficult and young people who communicate without speech could find out about the project and take part. * Some children and young people chose to tell us about the things they needed to stay well. We were shown lots of equipment, 'kit' and medicines and several children explained their scheduling to us. Yet several young people chose to tell us little or almost nothing about their health needs or their treatment and care: \"I asked if she wanted to tell me more, she said 'no no no ... it's very boring and annoying' and she didn't want to talk about it anymore\". Due to restrictions in space we are not able to include material specifi-cally on perceptions and experiences of medical interventions and routines.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180Family members participated not as users of any particular service but as citizens in their own right who may or may not currently be receiving formal support of any kind. 2.1.2 Engaging wi t h children, young people and families We were very aware of the pressures already on these families and tried to proceed throughout with respect and sensitivity. We made the as-sumption that time would always be in very short supply and we offered every family member: an absolute guarantee of anonymity total control about whether to contact us and whether to take part free choice about where, when and how to be involved flexibility and responsiveness to changing needs contact at different times contact through different routes: telephone, email, visits provision of skilled care for any children if required a gentle, flexible and responsive 'interview' a process that was easy to stop and restart at any time. Once children, young people and families agreed to involvement we worked carefully with them to plan the best way to gather information about their experiences. This varied from family to family. We saw the majority of children and families in their own home, most often in the evenings or at weekends. Some parents chose to take part by telephone, and/or through email exchanges. Most children and young people were visited individually at home, but some worked in established groups, and others chose to be visited elsewhere (for example, in residential settings, in hospital or at a friend's house). 2.1.3 About t he families We consulted with different combinations of children, young people and parents from 25 families. Between them these families had 68 children, 25 of whom had CHCN, nine male and 16 female with an age range of 2-24.\u0018\u0018Consultation Twenty of the 25 families were White British (English, Irish and Scottish) and five were partly or completely made up of Black or mi- nority ethnic family members (African, Asian and Eastern European). The families lived across England and Northern Ireland. Our sample included four families who had adopted or fostered one or more of their children, and two families where the parents were lesbian. Eleven siblings (aged 4-24, from 10 families) and two friends (aged 5 and 7) took part in group or individual sessions. We actively sought to include boys and men and spent time with fathers (7) as well as mothers (12) and brothers (5) as well as sisters (6). We also spoke with grandparents, aunts and uncles from four families. Seven sets of parents took part without their children because the child was too unwell at the time (3), because it was not a good time (1), because it was not possible to arrange (1) or because the child had died (2). To summarise, in total we consulted with: 18 children and young people with CHCN 11 brothers and sisters 19 parents 7 other relatives or friends. 2.1.4 About t he children and young people Most children had multiple health conditions. Some children were well for long periods but could suddenly become very sick; others had long-term conditions and others had progressive conditions or illnesses. The conditions creating the children's healthcare needs included cer- ebral palsy, epilepsy, leukaemia, brain tumours, cystic fibrosis, injury, spinal injury, diabetes, anaphylaxis, asthma, eczema, im-mune disorders, lung immaturity and various rare genetic or metabolic conditions. Almost all the children had more than one condition creat-ing a CHCN. Many (21 of 25) of the children also had impairments of hearing, learning, understanding, vision, mobility or communication. The children's healthcare needs included gastrostomy and nasogastric tube feeding, assisted ventilation, oxygen via different routes, Hickman lines, emergency medication for seizures or anaphylactic shock, resus-citation, cardiac pace-making, complex medication regimes, catheteri-sation, a range of surgical interventions, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018physiotherapy, postural management and positioning, monitoring and intervention for apnoea and blood sugar monitoring. For many, this means a hard, endless reality of uncomfortable, painful and invasive procedures. Most (23 of 25) of the children with CHCN lived all or most of the time in families (including foster or adoptive families). All children had spent time in hospital, some children had lived away from home and some had regular short breaks from home. We included one young man who was living in a hospital environment but attempting to set up his own community-based service and the views of one family whose young child was just beginning to leave hospital. Eighteen children and young people with CHCN took part directly, ranging in age from 6-24. All used a range of communication methods. Six relied solely on non-spoken communication: signing, eye pointing, gesture and communication boards. The range of healthcare needs was wide and all the children had experienced multiple medical interventions and hospitalisations. In fact, nine of the 18 were hospitalised during the three months of the survey. 2.1.5 The f ocus and methods As stated in the introduction, our initial discussions with children and young people with CHCN and their families made clear that their needs did not fit neatly into categories of 'healthcare' or 'social care'. Equally, it had become evident that the division of services according to this split in needs was highly problematic. In order to avoid imposing these different categories of either needs or services, therefore, in our group sessions and individual visits, we focused on 'needs' more generally. We talked about these in terms of 'what matters' for families, that is, asking about what was important to them and what their priorities were. Concomitantly, rather than predefine the kinds of services to be discussed, we focused more broadly on 'what helps', as well as 'what gets in the way'. We asked about the 'manner' or 'style' of help, as well as the help itself. We were careful not to focus only on the service system and questions were framed as openly as possible. Barriers, for example, could arise directly from a child's condition or illness, or indirectly from \u0018\u0018Consultation barriers in the social world or the service system that made it harder for their needs to be met (however defined). We tried to offer everyone who took part the opportunity to tell as much or as little of their story as they wished.* Often we asked very few questions; we aimed to give the agenda to the children, young peo-ple and families as much as was possible. We aimed for open-minded and evidentially careful questioning** and we did not use a structured questionnaire. We worked with visible blank pieces of paper and as far as we could we gave over complete control of the time, the agenda, the paper and the pens. With children we used a wide range of resources and methods to support communication. *** Some families also showed us or gave us photographs, drawings, care plans, 'passports',**** letters, reports and tributes. Those carrying out the direct contacts had long experience of working with disabled children or children with CHCN; some were parents of disabled children or were disabled themselves. The sibling groups were led by experienced adult facilitators, who themselves also had siblings with significant healthcare needs. * These included: targeting a wide mix of geographical areas; produc-ing information in different formats including using images and symbols; arranging direct approaches and translation and inter-pretation where English was not the family's first language; mak-ing clear that we would work with any communication method; following this through with visitors using sign, communication boards and play-based methods. ** S ome of Triangle's work involves gathering evidence from children for use in civil or criminal court proceedings. From this work we have learnt much about framing questions carefully and in non-leading ways. 16, 17 *** These included laminated photographs of leisure activities, trans-port and familiar places, symbol and image sets, objects of refer-ence, play and art materials. **** Passports are accessible, child-friendly summaries about a child and their needs. 18CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00182.2 The findings We have combined the views of children, young people and their families, structured by the main themes that emerged on the question of 'what matters' for children and young people with CHCN and their families. Two clusters of priorities stood out. The first (a) relates to 'people and relationships' and includes relation- ships with family and friends. These relationships were linked to another important issue both for children and young people with CHCN and their families: (b) individuality and identity, that is, being 'who they are'. With the high levels of support and care needed by these children and young people, relationships with people providing services were also a major part of their lives. The final priorities identified in the consultation relate to issues of boundaries between professional and private relations, that is (c) 'who should care' and (d) the nature of relations with profes-sional care providers. The second cluster of concerns raised by the children and families consulted related to the issue of 'staying well and living an ordinary life'. Here priorities included: (a) professional and organisational competence but also (b) a family-centred approach that is flexible and responsive to an individual family's needs, (c) practicalities and (d) taking on the system. For each theme we have included things that get in the way and some ideas about things that help. Quotations followed only by the age refer to children and young people with CHCN. For the sake of brevity this is not stated each time. Details of the relationship with a child or young person with CHCN are given in relation to siblings quoted. Quotations made by parents of children and young people with CHCN are identi-fied in the body of the text. Where children communicated through signs, symbols or word boards, their communication is reported in their own words, whatever the communication route, as summarised by the person consulting. Children using signs, symbols or word boards are producing their own words they are just not saying them. Where children communicated through play, facial expression, gesture, behaviour, or responding to adult questions, this is clarified in the text, making it clear that the child or young person is the source.\u0018\u0018Consultation 2.2.1 People and relationships Whatever their situation, relationships were crucially important to every single one of the children, young people and families that we met. When asked about their lives, children and young people almost always started with the people that mattered most to them: people they lived with, people they cared about, people who loved them, people involved in their care. 'Family and friends' was also the most common response from parents when asked about what was important in life, what mattered most, what kept them going and where they got their support. Relationships with people providing services were also a major part of the lives of most of the children and families that we met. Many de-scribed professionals who became friends or became 'part of the family'. We explore these different relationships below, and the boundaries are considered in Section 2.2.1.4. 2.2 .1.1 Family Children and young people told us about their families in many different ways. They named, drew and showed us photographs of different family members. Parents were mentioned most often, then siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents: 'Mummy. Daddy. Sam [brother]. Nanny. Granddad. Aunty Jo.' (9-year-old) Relationships with siblings were as mixed as in most families: 'Her little sister winds her up a lot and she sometimes pushes her or pokes her but they also laugh a lot together and like many of the same things.' (parent of a 7-year-old) Some siblings were unhappy about the amount of time or attention given to their brother or sister: 'He gets all the attention. Sometimes ... and I don't want to be his sister.' (8-year-old sister)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Many wished their brother or sister could get better. These quotes are from three different children: 'I would like sometimes to play with her more.' (6-year-old brother) 'You can't play like other brothers and sisters 'cos you have to be careful.' (7-year-old sister) 'If my brother was stronger....' (8-year-old sister) Many siblings were strong defenders of the needs and rights of their brother or sister to be treated 'like everybody else'. For most parents, their wider family was central in their lives, includ- ing but not only as a source of practical support: 'The only way we get a break as a family is my family. I don't think we'd cope without me mum and dad....' 'Her own parents live nearby and are very supportive, but she is concerned that she can only expect this level of support from them for another 5-10 years and is worried about who will help after that.' This section is short because there was absolute agreement across all groups consulted that family relationships were crucially important and usually mattered more than anything else. Relationships with family: things that helped The nurse who did a night shift at granma's, \u001800 miles away, so the child could be bridesmaid at a family wedding. The uncle who surfed the internet for helpful information.The consultant who paid attention to the whole family's needs. The grandparent who \"never judged, even when we wanted to give up\".\u0018\u0018Consultation The social worker who did not try and \"whisk him off to respite\". The physiotherapist who let the little sister join in with exercises too. The nursing team that taught all four grandparents and two aunts to tube feed. The grandfather who read stories in hospital for hours on end.The church who welcomed the whole family, always.The playground that had \"something for everyone\", and safe quiet shade. The home sitting service that cared for siblings as well. 2.2.1.2 FriendsFriends were also extremely important to all the children and young people we met. This was true right across the age range: 'What children need most is a friend to help and play with.' (6-year-old) 'She showed me with her communication book that she had two main friends at school, one in a wheelchair like she is and one who is not in a wheelchair and uses a walking frame.' (8-year-old) 'I didn't want to go to another school with thousands of kids on my own again ... so I chose this school because I knew some kids at this school which is good.' (13-year-old) 'I am an organised person, more organised with friends than with other things in my life, because it is more important to me.' (22-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Younger children listed brothers, sisters, parents, cousins and pets as friends. Many children named current paid workers as friends, particu-larly people who visited them at home or were involved in their play. Parents sometimes noted this as well: 'The nurses were wonderful ... they became real friends with our daughter, they were extremely fond of her ... she spoke about them as her friends.' Some older young people also did this. More often, older young people listed ex-carers/ex-nurses/ex-teachers as friends, describing friendships that had grown out of a previous paid relationship. There was travel in the other direction also, with friends and family who become paid carers. The idea of paid workers as friends was a recurring theme: 'My carers are my friends when I like them, when I don't I see them as a carer.' (21-year-old) Not everyone agreed that this was a good idea. One father was pleased that his son had: '... lots of friends so can go to different people for different types of help or support ... so it's less likely he would need his physiotherapist to be an emotionally supportive friend as well as a health worker.' One family described their sense of loss when a much-valued night sitting service stopped because the child no longer needed tube feeding. Others described how siblings also became attached to carers. This created seri-ous difficulties after a child died: 'Once she died, by and large all the professional people who had been coming regularly to the house stopped coming ... the hydrotherapy swimming stopped ... it was hard to explain to her sister [4-year-old] that these things weren't happening anymore ... it was as if not only had she lost her sister, but some of the people she considered as her friends also went too.' We return to this theme in Section 2.2.1.4.\u0018\u0018Consultation A few parents described their children as having 'lots of friends' or 'a good social life'; however, far more frequently parents raised con- cerns about their child's lack of friends, particularly friends of their own age: 'He's fairly isolated ... his world is pretty much home, plus school when he's well enough, which means about 50% of the time ... we're trying to find some kind of life for him outside of home.' 'She has few friends of her age ... it's hard ... after school she is at home or with her grandparents. She only sees friends at school really ... a social life outside of school, it would make her much happier.' Many families talked about how hard it was for their children to access play or leisure activities: '... she wasn't well enough for the rough and tumble of young children plus there was the risk of infection.' (parent of 4-year-old) Other parents highlighted the reluctance on the part of schools to take necessary risks as a serious barrier: 'He was going to go on a school residential trip; he was very excited. They asked me to do the night sitting, the meds and the tube feeds. I said yes because otherwise I knew he wouldn't be going. Then they sent me this form.... I knew before I filled it in there'd be trouble. They did a risk assessment, they said he couldn't go.' (parent of 13-year-old) 'The school says it can't be responsible for feeding him at lunchtimes in the canteen because they won't take responsibility for his allergies. He is being isolated. He has to sit in the corner in a sterile place....' (parent of 11-year-old) Some families saw the healthcare demands as a major barrier to friend-ships:CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180'At what point do you say he has a social life? There are a certain amount of blocks each day, there are so many things he has to do that he has little choice in the bits that are left.' (older brother of 7-year-old) Others felt things could be handled differently, for example: '... less restriction and isolation ... more freedom at school and his 1:1 not following him around ... having young, \"cool\" support people: he doesn't like having Miss K because she's old, of course he wouldn't say because he is too polite.' (older brother of 13-year-old) Some children and young people also wished for more friends, or more opportunities to be with the friends they had: 'Once school is finished I get in a taxi and go home.' (12-year-old) '[To see friends after school] ... I would have to take my pump, my wheelchair and everything and lots of my friends live in flats.' (13-year-old) 'He talked about friendships being \"two way\" and said it was difficult to get a 50:50 relationship sometimes as it is not always easy to put into a relationship....' (22-year-old) 'She would like to be able to do a sleepover with a friend, she would like more friends but it was difficult to meet people and to keep friend-ships because she needs someone to help her make the arrangements and help her to go out. Being out late at night was also difficult.' (17-year-old) Lunchtimes and playtimes at school were very important times for friendships: 'Most helpful was my class teacher, she fixed it for lunches because I couldn't go out at play and I couldn't go on the stairs until everyone had gone. She let me have three friends have lunch upstairs with me and her.' (9-year-old)\u0018\u0018Consultation 'I need the other children not to tease me, to come to playtime club with me if I can't go outside.' (8-year-old) Relationships with friends: things that helped The dinner lady who made sure the child never sat alone. The friend's mother who learnt how to use the epipen so the child could visit. The physiotherapist who arranged sessions so that the child missed maths instead of playtime. The friends who kept inviting the family over even though they were never invited back. The teacher who ate everyday with the child who could not handle the dining room alone. The friend's family who had nut-free birthday parties so the child could go. The outreach nurse who was \"cool enough to get me into a nightclub\". The youth club that organised a private room for a rest mid- evening. The cousin who set up MSN messenger and a wireless connection so the teenager's laptop worked in his bed. The nursing team who \"worked cheerfully around the hamsters\" in the child's bedroom. The link family where the child's dog could go too.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018The taxi company who offered a flexible, \"ring at the last minute\", after-school pick-up so the child could stay for after-school clubs when they were well enough. The head of year who decided the outing was a reasonable risk. 2.2 .1.3 Individuality and identity Relationships are crucial to people's sense of who they are. Many children and young people and some families talked with us about different aspects of identity, and the things that helped them 'be who they are'. Cultural identity: one young person lived in an environment that actively promoted a different religion to his. Despite protest he had been unable to change things that he found difficult and at times offensive. He told us: '... with me racism is a really big thing.... I hate it. I really hate racism ... other people don't understand that.' (17-year-old) Two other families told of difficulties in having their cultural needs respected, for example, children being given pork to eat in error or not having their hair or skin properly cared for. Where workers were of the same (minority) ethnicity as members of the family, this was found to be invaluable: 'Through direct payments, we have found it possible to address my daughter's cultural needs, for example with her personal assistants [PAs], we specifically plan for her to be part of Black and Asian culture by attending social events, music events, food, reading books, etc. I also try and ensure that at least one of my daughter's PAs reflects part of her cultural identity. So far, this has been possible.' (mother of 14-year-old) Identity as a family member: several children and young people clearly felt valued as contributing members of their families:\u0018\u0018Consultation 'When my little cousin comes [to the campsite] I take him to the club. By myself ... he's only four.' (13-year-old) 'If I was to lose my job, my brother [who supports me] would have to go out to work so it would totally bugger it up basically.' (23-year-old) And some told of family friends who were definitely friends of the child as well as the parents: 'We also have close friends who ... visit her regularly and chat to her and occasionally take her out, all of which gives my daughter a real sense of being valued and loved.' (mother of 14-year-old) Some families felt their child tried to minimise the impact of their needs on the family: 'I think he gets bored but he'd never say.' (father of 13-year-old) 'She described how her daughter will blow kisses when she needs her nappy changing, she thinks this is because she \"doesn't want to be a burden, she knows she is a drain\".' (mother of 9-year-old) Identity as themselves: the children and young people that we met swim against many tides. As well as the direct impact of their conditions and impairments, they live their lives in a very disabling society where it is often a struggle to get their basic needs recognised and met. Yet we found many examples of children and young people actively managing their identities and finding ways to cope. 'When I'm most relaxed with myself ... is when I'm watching football, 'cos then I'm not any different, it's 45,000 people all in blue.... It's when I'm in my element. I wouldn't say it makes me feel normal but it makes me forget.' (22-year-old) 'I'm the kind of guy that would do anything at least once. If I don't like it, I won't do it again.' (17-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018'Fun - life's not just for doing 'Necessary stuff'. If you don't enjoy anything you do your quality of life is zero.' (15-year-old) 'I do things I enjoy, I go out with friends and use my computer, I've learnt how to adapt my life around that. I try and think of different ways to do things.... That's what I try and do, I adapt things so I can do things.' (22-year-old) A younger child was getting increasingly fed up with the things she could not do. Her mother said that she would like to eat sweets, play with toys and look at books by herself like her sister could. The child (aged 9) strongly agreed by nodding, shouting and waving her arms (9-year-old). One mother described the impact her young daughter had had on many of those involved in supporting her until she died at the age of four: 'Having known her, she made such a great impression, they had seen her so visibly enjoying life despite her immense difficulties, they would always feel differently towards other children who might be similarly disabled.' Some young people, particularly those with new or progressive condi-tions, struggled to manage their identities. Help from adults to 'infor-mation manage' was appreciated: \"The teacher helped by telling people about it\" (9-year-old). Managing one's identity in public environments was not an issue for some young people, but others found it difficult and painful, as did their families: 'I don't think they have a clue ... it feels like we're from outer space.' 'I didn't want anyone to know I had a pump ... I didn't really hide it I was in a wheelchair I had it between my feet like a back pack they didn't really see the lead.... I hid it ... because I was embarrassed ... it was because I was really shy. Sometimes I would finish my pump really quick at home so I didn't have to take it in.' (13-year-old)\u0018\u0018Consultation Siblings were often very aware of these issues: 'She needs people to know that she's six so she doesn't like being treated like a baby.' (8-year-old sister) 'I know he has turned the pump up so it goes quicker so he doesn't have to go to school with it, he wants to be like everyone else.' (older brother of 13-year-old) Identity - shared experiences: several families talked of the value of people with shared experiences, who had children with similar needs: '... meeting other families ... the strength in knowing you aren't the only one who goes upstairs every night feeling just so exhausted.' 'There was just such a sense of relief - another child with an epipen! A guaranteed nut-free household!' Some young people also talked about the importance of friends with similar needs or experiences: 'If I've got a problem relating to disability I talk to my disabled friend because she is the only one who understands.... It's helpful we are both in pain quite a lot, it isn't good but it's helpful for each other, for understanding, mutual support, offer suggestions. It's easier to talk to her because she has a disability, I don't see it like that though.' (22-year-old) One young person with a very rare health condition developed scoliosis as a teenager and found that having a more common diagnosis helped her: 'It's good to belong to a group, lots of people have scoliosis.' (14-year-old) Some young people had made friends who were 'different' in other ways: CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018'Her best friend lives 50 miles away. Her mum feels they get on well because they both \"don't fit in\". Because of her different health conditions, her daughter doesn't quite fit in, and her best friend is the kind of child \"who chooses not to fit in most of the time\".' (mother of 10-year-old) Individuality and identity: things that helped The PE teacher who blu-tacked the egg to the spoon on sports day. The occupational therapist who agreed that skipping was an essential life skill. The after-school club that allocated \u0018:\u0018 staffing without question, \"as if it was his right\".The godparents who set up an Easter egg hunt all at wheelchair height. The local education authority who agreed \"staying alive\" as the child's primary statemented need. The children who stuck up for their brothers' and sisters' rights. The consultant who involved same-sex parents \"without skipping a beat\". The clinic who offered interpreters as routine, and extra time when needed. The service that actively sought information about a family's culture and religion as routine, in a low-key, relaxed way.\u0018\u0018Consultation The nursing team who asked the family for skin and haircare guidance. The hospice that linked families together gently, at the right moment. 2.2 .1.4 Who should care All of the children and young people we met needed high levels of sup-port and care to stay well. Most had strong views about who should and should not be involved in providing this support. Many young children wanted their family to carry out most of their care; in fact this was very important to some children: 'A special person should tell mum, dad or the child how to do it and then after that they should be able to do it, then it should always be someone from the family.' (8-year-old) 'Does anyone else (apart from your parents) help you at home? An indignant \"No!\".' (6-year-old) We worked with some young children in a group, thinking about chil-dren with CHCN first starting school: [Interviewer: to go with him.' (7-year-old) Some of these younger children were also wondering how much they should rely on their friends for day-to-day help: 'Children should help with some things. A friend should do it, other kids should do it ... yes, your friends like you and are willing to help you.... Probably.' (8-year-old) These issues, about friends helping, and people helping who then become friends, was a strong recurring theme. Rigid concepts of 'role boundaries' CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018do not transfer easily to this group of children who require high levels of support and therefore have so many relationships to negotiate. Some older young people were more concerned about the potential difficulties of 'mixing' friendship with paid relationships: 'This is the biggest problem of my life ... people ... they're willing to come talk to you, tell you about all their problems. To me that's cool, but then they get the idea we're best buddies. They've got their job to do and I'm trying to live my life.... I don't know what their game is. They're not my friends - they have nothing to do with my life. Don't think we're gonna be calling each other telling problems, that kind of thing - automatically it brings trouble....' (17-year-old) Some young people were very clear that roles should not be blurred: '... I wouldn't have that.... I believe that carers should be carers. Teachers should be teachers - end of story.' (18-year-old) Some families had used different mechanisms for family members to be employed to provide some of their child's support. With children this tended to be more distant family members but we met with several older young people where close family had been successfully employed in this way: 'On the care side you are not supposed to employ family or people living in the same house as you ... but there are special circum-stances.... It should be the young person's choice who to employ, if it's a family member they want, it's a family member they should be able to employ.' (father of 18-year-old) 'My older brother is my primary carer.... He lives in the same house as me, but I have my own living space.... It works.' (22-year-old) Some parents described struggles with their role. As one mother pointed out it is not always appropriate for the young person to rely on a par-ent:\u0018\u0018Consultation 'I end up going too, to youth club for example....' (mother of 13- year-old) And another found that healthcare took a toll on her relationship with her child: 'It's hard being mum making her have all these treatments, and then she doesn't like them and hates me for it.' (mother of 11-year-old) 2.2 .1.5 Relationships with people in 'the system' Most children and families described their relationships with people in 'the system' as very important in their lives. The phrase 'the system' was spontaneously used by a number of young people and families, usually to describe a whole array of services. As set out above, many children and young people named current and previous workers as friends; several parents described workers as 'becoming part of the family'. One parent explained : 'It's not been about ... how any service is organised or delivered ... but is down to individuals who will go that bit extra, not clock watchers more interested in their guidelines than your family.... (mother of 7-year-old) Although there were differences of view, there were some recurring themes about what mattered, in particular continuity and familiarity, kindness and care, and respect and understanding. These are explored below. Continuity and familiarity: children and their families valued services and people that provided continuity over time. Those who had known children for many years were particularly valued, not just for their clinical competence but also for knowing and understanding the child and the whole family, for building a relationship of trust:CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180'At hospital if my doctor is around everything is alright ... he's known me for 15 years ... if I'm given wrong drugs I'm in trouble ... he really understands me.' (13-year-old) One young child (aged 5) was presenting very challenging behaviour because of his condition; his mother explained that people who knew him well could spot the signs and pre-empt the problems, which avoided escalation to behaviours like spitting, hitting, trashing classrooms and escaping. Other parents also valued professionals with experience: 'I trusted him. I think because he saw her in the middle of a really bad reaction, and he stayed with her in ITU until she was settled. So when he told us what she needed I trusted him.' (mother of 9-year-old) Parents also valued people who got to know their children: 'You know, there were so many people at that meeting and most of them had never even met our daughter. And those that have, mostly they just look at her for 10 minutes.' (father of 9-year-old) Children also valued and liked familiar people who they trusted and knew well. Several parents described their young children struggling with meeting so many new people. Older children explained: 'I prefer it when someone I know looks after me.' (13-year-old) 'I would like the person who I most liked to do it because I know them well - it is someone who has been in every single class with me - Mrs C - an education assistant.... I won't cry if she left [sic].' (8-year-old) 'If it's my usual hospital the nurses know me which is helpful ... I would like the same nurse when I go to hospital because if I was ill I wouldn't have to explain everything.' (11-year-old) Some families found it preferable to decline support altogether rather than deal with an unfamiliar person:\u0018\u0018Consultation 'We got to a point where we didn't want a new nurse to come, without knowing that it was likely that she was going to make a commitment to come regularly ... because my daughter found it frightening having a new nurse. If we had a new nurse offered who was only doing a one-off shift, then we would say we would rather do the night ourselves, because it was stressful for us having a stranger in the house for one night, and even more so for our daughter.' (mother of 5-year-old) Children with limited understanding and communication also had very clear preferences for familiar people: 'Her mother told us that three different helpers come to help her get ready for school. She likes them all but gets on best with Daryl. She confirmed this very clearly with eye pointing and facial expressions, when shown photographs of the different helpers.' (9-year-old) Linked to familiarity with individual practitioners was the desire for stability in services themselves; we were told by many families about services that were available for a fixed period of time, usually as a way to manage demand for the service. These short-term interventions were rarely popular. One parent described her fury at a poster offering short-term counselling for families of children with CHCN: '... the idea of \"short term\" just made me want to rip it off the wall. Oh f**k off with your short term ... we'll dibble dabble with you ... five sessions!! They have to be joking.' (mother of 7-year-old) Families valued services that were \"robust\" and \"in it for the long term\" and wanted services that could continue even when their child's needs changed, rather than having to keep changing the team or the service. One young man (aged 13) told us how hard it was to have to change schools when his health deteriorated: \"I went to one school and kept going from school to school\". Another parent described the following: 'When she was two, a Sure Start area was set up covering our road. They offered me a new health visitor and I said no thank you I want to keep the one I've got; she knows us, we trust her. They wrote to me and rang me, and then someone even came to see me to ask me CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018to change over to the Sure Start health visitor and in the end I said NO, this baby has been in hospital 11 times this year, and Sally knows all about it and I do not have the TIME to explain it all again. They didn't come back, and we kept Sally.' (mother of 9-year-old) Another family was in transition from children's to adult's services and felt \"a bit in no man's land at the moment\" (parents of 18-year-old). Erratic contact from professionals was frustrating for several fami- lies: 'We seemed to need to have the idea of weighings to keep her [the health visitor] involved ... there is such an emphasis on having a specific purpose for each family contact.... She made contact again when our child was three because once again she had a role - she was able to tell us about the free nappies.' (mother of 5-year-old) 'Each time he was discharged from hospital they would ring us up, but in between there were long long gaps. I think they had a box to tick.' (father of 9-year-old) Kindness and care: families and children valued people who cared and were kind, thoughtful, and warm. There was a high level of agreement on this: 'I have 1:1 Miss E ... she's very nice helps when I need help. She's new ... reminds me of my nan.' (11-year-old) Some relatively young children were very thoughtful about their criteria for who would be best to help with healthcare needs at school. Here is part of a supported conversation between three children aged 9, 10 and 11: 'I think definitely a nurse or a teacher, or the office people.' 'I would choose a teacher, education assistant or school nurse. I know my teacher well. And the people in the office....' 'No not by their job, you shouldn't choose them by their job. It should be how nice they can be, how kind.'\u0018\u0018Consultation 'Yeah, like the office ... the people in the office at my school, they are mean.' 'No, it should be by - do they know what to do?'Interviewer: 'Can you teach them what to do?''Someone can teach them what to do. Yeah, the nurse taught my LSA what to do.' 'My mum showed the teacher.''Well, I can tell them most of it.'Interviewer: 'Can you teach people to be kind?''You probably couldn't teach them to be kind, if they're not kind in the first place.' Another young child named two different helpers at her infant school: 'One for my \"button\" and one who checks my bloods ... they some-times help me go to the toilet ... Miss F is better, she's more fun.' (6-year-old) Older young people also valued kindness, warmth and people who showed interest in their lives. Parents again spontaneously mentioned the importance of professionals who care: 'One thing that we really liked was those nurses and others who really cared.' (mother of 7-year-old) 'The consultants were all excellent, very caring and very high calibre.' (father of 4-year-old) 'I didn't have to worry leaving my child with her because she loved her.' (mother of 9-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018'... a lovely social worker ... good at listening, creating a safe environ- ment for discussions, ... promoting the wishes of the family.' (parents of 6-year-old) It helped one family that they could ring their social worker and feel safe enough to be very honest: '... and say when we were feeling at the end of our wits.' (parents of 9-year-old) One support worker who came to see a family in her free time, unpaid, rather than leave them without support, is now a close personal friend of the parents: \"She saved my life on more than one occasion\". For example, when there was a crisis at home with another child ill, and their daughter was also very sick in hospital, she rang the worker at home on her day off: 'And she said I'll be there in half an hour, so she came to the hospital and stayed with our youngest so I could go home....' (mother of 7-year-old) Respect and understanding: older young people talked to us about dignity and respect: 'Tricky to measure but an example might be not having personal information blabbed to others.' (15-year-old) One young man spoke about his previous teaching assistant: 'I could tell him anything, he understood me.' (13-year-old) Two of the families we spoke to identified the importance of male workers for young men, their brothers and fathers: 'He [male nurse] is his main support, the only person he can talk to and cry in front of.' (mother of 7-year-old, about her husband)\u0018\u0018Consultation Parents were also very discerning about relationships with profession- als and contrasted the very different kinds of relationships they had experienced: 'Some of them are so jaded ... my daughter knows straight away - she gives me \"the look\" as soon as she's in the door ... [but others] show a real interest, and are warm and attentive, and explain exactly what they are going to do so she hardly needs to give me the look at all, unless maybe they do something that hurts her.' (mother of 10-year-old) '[... the doctor] was young and she listened ... she didn't call me mum and she didn't patronise me ... she didn't say \"calm down you're being neurotic\".' (mother of 9-year-old) 'Our GP is helpful because she listens to me and works in a way that I like.' (father of 9-year-old) '[The doctors' basic approach in consultations was:] There is nothing that can be done about it and by the way, your 10 minutes is up.' (mother of 10-year-old) Relationships with people in 'the system': things that helped The teacher who regularly 'dropped by' the child in hospital on her way home. The GP who was \"calm, collected and helpful and did not just say no\". The consultant who never made the family feel their child was \"on e of \u0018 00s\". The headteacher who \"kept an eye on things\" all the way through primary school.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018The support worker who \"dropped everything\" to be there in a crisis. The carers who \"made it more than just a job\" and \"took time to help\". The secondary school who \"stuck with\" the child, even when his needs changed again and again. The managers who organised steady provision of care through a changeover of services and teams. The worker who worked in three different organisations in order to follow the child. The doctor who \"popped in\" to the family home with results from blood tests. 2.2.2 Staying we l l and living an ordinary life By definition these children and young people need a lot of help to stay well. What mattered for these children and their families, however, was not only staying well, but staying well while, simultaneously, living an ordinary life. Clinical issues of competence related to their healthcare needs were, of course, a matter of great importance. However, flexibility and responsiveness were also heavily emphasised in families' accounts of service provision that would enable them to get on with ordinary life individually and together. This related to a range of issues, including control and direct access to services, where and when health needs should be met, the accommodation of family routines, events, preferences and emergencies and the roles/responsibilities of any one professional. 2.2.2.1 CompetenceClinical competence: clinical competence was highly valued by children and young people: \u0018\u0018Consultation 'I had S [physiotherapist] she was ever so lovely she knew what she was doing.' (13-year-old) 'I think it should be an experienced person.' (9-year-old)'You need someone calm ... ready for it ... not all agitated ... not all stressy.' (10-year-old) Some young people were anxious about an apparent lack of competence, especially in schools. Three staff had been especially trained to do one teenager's medicines at school; we asked why: 'I suppose they are to check one another?.... Miss J and Miss T has to supervise all the medication. Last week Miss T wasn't there and they were looking for someone. Miss A has done the training but she wasn't in that day ... I missed half my lunch.' (13-year-old) '... well if I had a big asthma attack at school they probably don't have what I need. They could ring mum to pick me up, or they could send me to hospital.' (10-year-old) Others were more confident that their school could meet their needs: 'My mum and the teacher ... she was careful what I ate, careful of nuts. She would check the food and see what I could eat and I always showed her the food first and she had the epipen and she was the one who banned the whole school from nuts - because there was a scare, someone gave me a biscuit through the fence [between two playgrounds], and no one knew if it had nuts in. I used to learn when I was in reception so I could tell someone.' (8-year-old) 'In a way sort of because she was a nurse ... and the other lady ... she has a grandchild who has a gastrostomy too.' (13-year-old) Competence was also highly valued by parents; several families described competence as \"infectious\" - competent people could \"spread it about\". One father said he was almost \"bursting with hope\" when he was shown how to set up a home oxygen system:CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018'I thought yes I can do this, I can really do this. Until then I thought no, she'll never be able to come home.' (father of 18-month-old) Parents valued seniority and confidence, especially at times of crisis: 'At a glimpse he [the consultant] could see how sick she was ... it's no good getting stuck with the middle layer, you need somebody who knows.' (mother of 4-year-old) '... we had plenty of places to be listened to ... we wanted someone to tell us what to do.' (mother of 6-year-old) One family was left with lots of 'what if' questions after their child died. The outreach nurse wrote down all the questions the family had and sent them to the professor, who replied with answers and gave them choices for times to meet and talked through every issue: '... until my mind was as at ease as it could be ... and he said if anytime you want to arrange to meet me again it's ok.' (mother of 7-year-old) Several families commented on the differences between specialist and local services, often balancing expertise against local knowledge: 'The local consultant is not as \"expert\" as some people in Manchester, but he looks at the whole picture; how her health issues are affecting her life, family life, what can we do that works for you?' (father of 11-year-old) 'We travel to London every three months for a review and IV antibiot- ics, but then I can do this at home with her for the rest of the time. Because her condition is rare and deteriorating we need the team who know a lot about it.' (mother of 13-year-old) A lack of competence meant children missed out on important parts of life; one child told us that she could only be fed at home or school, another young person told us that there were only two people who could \u0018\u0018Consultation get him comfortably positioned at night. Parents and children told us that incompetence was often worse than nothing at all: '... if they didn't know what they were doing she would get upset and then she would get very sick so it was completely counterproductive.' (mother of 4-year-old) Organisational competence: the basics of organisational competence were also important: '... we've got a little physio room [at school] but I haven't started it yet because they are trying to get their timetables together.... The physio can't organise the time to train the learning support people to do it.' (13-year-old) '... they don't seem to have the help he wants when he wants it.... I think that money should be attached to his head and go with him wherever he goes. They get all that money and all that support when he is only there 20% of the time yet when he is there his allocated helper is helping someone else so for example during swimming he can't go to the deep end because the other child she is helping can't swim.' (father of 9-year-old) Prompt responses were valued, particularly where the child's future was uncertain: '... not knowing how much time you have ahead of you ... you don't know how long you've got.' (mother of 4-year-old) Competence: things that helped The occupational therapist who \"really understood what was possible at her developmental stage\". The outreach team who \"just took it all in their stride\".CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180The nurse who had worked in a hospice and \"had so many ideas for the last stages to keep her more comfortable\". The consultant who immediately made the link between his medical condition and his behaviour. The team of home nurses confident and experienced in respiratory care: \"she felt very safe ... we trusted them, she trusted them\". The GP receptionist who saw straightaway \"how sick he was, and jumped us to the front of the queue\".The multidisciplinary team who shared information \"quietly and quickly, no fuss\". The ex-nurse who did short-term respite in her own home and \"didn't mind about all his extra bits\". 2.2 .2.2 Flexibility and responsiveness Responsiveness to an individual family's needs: many families valued serv- ices that clearly listened to their views and were responsive to their needs. Here are comments from eight different families: '... the help where we wanted it....' '... it worked best for all of us....''... promoting the wishes of the family....''... they were able to be guided by what we found to be the prob- lem....' '... they should find out what works for him....''... being willing to look at her as an individual rather than being \"determined to make her fit the boxes\".'\u0018\u0018Consultation 'And they can fit in with you ... it's much much easier.' 'It means we can work around the medical issues, not let them rule her life.' However, many services still approach families from their own starting point and not that of the family. One mother described having to \"pick a path\" through different people's views on her child and what they felt was important or needed. Another explained that many professionals often had strongly held beliefs, and over the years it had really helped to find people who '... didn't put their philosophy above what worked best for us as a family.' (mother of 15-year-old) For children and young people with CHCN themselves, responsiveness to their individual needs was often linked to a sense of personal autonomy and control. 'She has the help she needs and she was involved in deciding how she was helped, there is usually some choice about which staff help her.' (14-year-old) 'I use them like my hands and I get stressed when they do things how they like not how I would do them.' (21-year-old) Some young people valued their autonomy and contrasted it with previ-ous experience. One teenager who had been a day pupil in a school that also offered residential care said: 'There was a nursing team there ... to me it was too suffocating - in the way that the people there seem to have no life of their own. They go to bed when they say, eat when they say to eat.... Between them and me it was very different. I saw things very differently to them - the other pupils. The kind of life they're used to - I'm not used to that life.... Might as well put a gun to my head and pull the trigger.' (17-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Speaking about having arranged appointments at home, one young man explained: '... so I feel less disabled I guess. It's good for me to be in control.... It's funny, since I've taken full control of my healthcare I've been in much better health. I know my body better than anyone.' (22-year-old) Some other young people were also very clear about their own contri-butions to their health. However, many children also valued family involvement in decisions about their care: '... my sister has a say in my care. And my mum does.' (11-year-old) '... who decides? daddy [thumbs up].' (9-year-old)'That's what mums are for, to help you make decisions.' (sister of 6-year-old) '... mummy knows the right thing to choose.' (7-year-old)'... you should start making decisions sooner, it would get you practice for when you're older.' (15-year-old) A family-centred approach, involving working with whole families, in-cluding siblings, was identified as important many times. One mother told us about the art therapist from the hospital; she said she: '... wasn't sure how wide her brief was but she made home visits as well including for the child's sisters. She would come and paint their nails while I went outside and had a good cry.' (mother of 7-year-old) Flexibility in service provision: flexibility was crucial in enabling children and young people with CHCN to stay well and families to get on with an ordinary life. This related to the roles and responsibilities of any one individual involved in providing care:\u0018\u0018Consultation 'The direct payment scheme has really transformed our family. Previously it was a struggle getting the help we needed but since direct payments, we have been able to employ people who are fit, warm natured, happy to be trained by us and willing to work with our schedules, for example starting later on some mornings or ac-companying us on holidays.' (father of 14-year-old) 'Social services sent a woman who did not want to look after her or do feeds, so she did the ironing and cleaning which was fabulous.' (mother of 6-year-old) 'It helped having \"flexible individuals\" to deal with; some of the people worked in unusual and flexible ways ... people who thought dynamically made a real difference.' (mother of 4-year-old) It also related to organisational flexibility: 'If her [Hickman] line comes out the nurse can come round to see to it ... to fit in with school times. They are really excellent and are very good at working round my daughter and her times.' (mother of 11-year-old) 'They could work flexibly, trade hours across the day or night ... we were able to \"save up\" an hour from each night shift to create two daytime sessions.' (mother of 4-year-old) The importance of flexibility was raised in relation to a number of specific issues, detailed below. Help to stay at home: all of the children and young people had spent much time in hospital; in fact, nine of the 18 directly consulted were hospitalised during the three months of our survey. Hospitals were not popular with the children or their families: 'I asked if you sometimes had to go into hospital, you screwed up your nose and looked the other way. Your mum said you do and that you were there not long ago but it wasn't very nice for you....' (6-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Many children told us that they hated hospital, and many parents found them difficult and stressful places: 'Hospital admissions were always grim, and often led to things \"going completely haywire\".' (mother of 4-year-old) Hospitals were also unpopular with many siblings: '[Do you have any wishes?] If he wouldn't have to go to hospital all the time and I would have more time with him and my mum.' (8-year-old sister) Being able to care for children at home, even when they were very ill, was important to many families: 'The best thing was caring for her at home ... you can do your own thing at home, you can watch your favourite video and listen to your favourite music.' (mother of 9-year-old) 'We didn't want her to die in hospital.... I dreaded the idea of having to bring her home, of cuddling a dead daughter. I thought I was going to have to carry her home....' (mother of 7-year-old) Another child who died at home stayed there until the burial and many family and friends came to see her at home after she had died. The family did not think this would have happened if the child had been elsewhere: 'I think that helped all of us; it helped her sister understand the permanence of it.' (mother of 4-year-old) Assistance with, and breaks from, caring: some children and young people spent time away from home on a planned or ad hoc basis. Sometimes this became a positive part of their ordinary life, for example, a child who goes one Saturday afternoon a month to another family . We asked what she did there; she used her book to show us:\u0018\u0018Consultation '... out/home/out/home/out/home ... mum interpreted that this meant they were out a lot, always on the go at respite. The child agreed strongly.' (9-year-old) Other families had declined short breaks that had been unsuitable or even damaging. Where and when healthcare needs should be met: when thinking about where healthcare needs should be met, one child (aged 7) told us the best place would be at home and the worst place would be at school while another (aged 8) said the worst place would be near crocodiles or in front of school or friends. Privacy and confidentiality were major concerns that seemed to increase with age. Another young person told us the worst place would be somewhere really crowded or at school: 'I don't like anything being done at school. I don't even like it when they line everyone up and look at your teeth.' (10-year-old) 'School could be more flexible.... I would like taxis to be more flex- ible and come when I need them if I wanted to do something after school. I couldn't always let them know before hand if I was late as I sometimes get very tired so might want to go home.' (13-year-old) Decisions had to be made about the things children should miss out on in order for their clinical needs to be met. A number of parents were concerned that children were missing lessons: \"there's a lot of stuff that takes her out of school\". On the other hand, a number of young people told us they were delighted to miss lessons: 'She explained that she could have appointments at times that suited her ... often in school time ... she laughed when asked if that was a problem.' (15-year-old) 'You've got nothing else to do anyway.' (14-year-old, laughing) Although most children and young people reported not minding missing lessons, many preferred not to miss social times at school:CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018'My last teaching assistant used to do it [gastrostomy tube feed]. He was brilliant he didn't care, he did care ... but it didn't worry him if I left 20 minutes early he preferred I missed 20 minutes of my lesson than 20 minutes of my lunch break.... I would choose to leave the lesson a lot earlier so I didn't miss my lunch break.' (13-year-old) 'I always want my hospital appointments in school time.... But not golden time, that's on a Friday.' (9-year-old) Direct access to services: several families valued being able to access services directly, when needed: 'Open access to the local hospital and just go straight to the ward was good.' (mother of 4-year-old) Twenty-four hour availability of support was very important, especially at times of crisis and including after a child had died: 'I was having a low day today and I decided I'll either sand down the fireplace or I'll go up to the children's hospital for a chat and a cry. I'm always welcome there, I can go in and they'll say \"hello D, sit in the nurses station and someone will be with you in a minute\".' One mother told us about a service where, she had been told, there was someone there 24 hours a day, seven days a week, if you ever need it. She contrasted this with the bereavement helpline: 'I've never used it because it's not open when I want it. It's not during the daytime because I'm busy myself then, it's ... when I wake up at two in the morning and its raining and she's buried on top of the hill and I want to get her in because she'll get too wet.' Fle xibility and responsiveness: things that helped The pharmacist who delivered prescriptions until \u00180pm at night.\u0018\u0018Consultation The consultant who fixed appointments by email. The physiotherapist who treated parents' backs in their own home. The hydrotherapy pool that let the child's little brother swim too, every week. The receptionist that \"jumped through the GP appointments system\". The nurse who dropped in the catheter tubes on her way home. The hospice team that provided nursing support at the campsite. The counsellor who visited in the evenings once the children were asleep. The psychologist who offered an 'as needed' service \"just for the bad weeks\". The nurse who organised a cooling machine so a family could keep their child's body at home until the funeral. The hospital that arranged direct admission to the ward whenever needed. The service that took the request at face value and did not need reams of paperwork. The crossroads worker who did all the ironing while the child slept. The worker who gave parent call me anytime permission.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00182.2.2.3 Practicalities: money, resources, things Many families talked about the importance of having enough money, having a suitable place to live and equipment that worked and was use-able. Money was crucial; there were many additional costs and often a reduced family income, and a real sense that the family's financial position was at permanent risk: '... my husband is great but he has to work.' (mother of 9-year-old) '... there are concerns in the long term, particularly if I fall ill as I am a single mother.' (mother of 14-year-old) Parents described how they had to take on the role of coordinator: '... you have to be an incredible organiser.' (father of 22-year-old) They also talked about the additional time and effort that doing ordinary activities involved: 'There's a lot of faffing around. The morning takes twice as long. 'We can't just go out, even the simplest thing is 100 times worse.'I can't get them both up alone in the morning, it just takes so long.' (mother of 9-year-old) Facilities: accessing and using facilities was an issue for many children and their families: '[At school] He has to ask for the key to use the disabled toilet, he has been told to wait to use the toilet because there is no one to take him. That's not right; it's embarrassing besides his condition is such that he needs to go now. Once he messed himself and he still had to wait for a keyholder to take him so he could clean himself up.' (mother of 13-year-old)\u0018\u0018Consultation 'Computers is upstairs in a tower block ... so I can't go.' (11-year- old) 'Here is just school ... at the campsite I walk out and I can get around to the arcade and clubs and you can just go in if you want. I've got about 10 friends there but we always have to come back for appoint-ments.' (11-year-old) 'If my sister could go to more places.... We can't go many places. I get bored. I'd like to go to crazy golf.' (8-year-old) Equipment: we were told by many families of struggles to get equipment that suited the child: 'She indicated strongly that she did not like the picture of the hoist because she did not like being hoisted. Nor does she like using a standing frame.' (9-year-old) 'There is a hoist at home but it's difficult to get her in and out of it.' (father of 13-year-old) The family have had 'bits of equipment supplied but some of it can't be used.... Her bedroom is like a medical centre, and the bathroom ... it all has a big impact on family life.' (mother of 9-year-old) 'The picture of the chair lift into the swimming pool also made her raise her hands and make noises. Her mother explained that she liked to swim but there were no changing facilities at their local pool except ones for babies that had ridges in them that hurt her back and were far too small. I agreed that she was not a baby and much too big to use that kind of changing table. Also the chair lift at the swimming pool had hurt her, so they haven't gone swimming for a long time.' (9-year-old) Even when a child had appropriate equipment it was not always in use:CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180'My laptop, mum fought for years to get it for me to use in every lesson so I don't have to write and it's much better for me because it makes the difference between me writing one line and half a page ... but when they [school staff] say to bring it in and I bring it in they say we'll do it tomorrow....' (13-year-old) 'After school I used to be able to chat to my friends on MSN ... but my computer isn't working.' (15-year-old) Children were often aware that money was tight: 'I love to do horse riding, it's really really good fun ... [but] you have to get a membership and pay lots of money and I don't really want to do that.' (13-year-old) Whereas professionals were not always so aware: '.. the OT [occupational therapist] came up with a bath aid that would have been better, and she said oh you might want to think about getting one of these ... meaning you might want to pay ... we had both given up work to be with our daughter, our financial situation was very insecure.' (mother of 4-year-old) Families appreciated quick responses to requests, and often seemed sur-prised to have their needs responded to promptly: 'They were amazing - they were used to people bawling down the 'phone, but they didn't just say oh yes that's very sad, they provided practical help quickly and without fuss, they supplied a portable suction machine within 48 hours.' (mother of 7-year-old) 'The financial implications of her additional needs were looked at and an adoption allowance was sorted out \"for as long as her needs remain the same\". This made lots of things possible: one parent reducing to part-time work; buying equipment; paying for a registered nurse instead of a babysitter.' (parents of 6-year-old)\u0018\u0018Consultation Practicalities: things that helped The feed company who delivered spontaneously and \"on the dot\" every month. The school caretaker who always remembered to open the wrong (quiet) exit at home time, just for the one child. The occupational therapy service that offered equipment on trial, to make sure it suited the child. The neighbour who regularly accepted deliveries including of a month's supply of tube feed and nappies. The school secretary who always checked the dates on all the child's medication at school without being asked. The disability living allowance fast-tracking system that ensured a response within days.The cinemas that gave free tickets to carers as routine.The cafe that blended any dish on request.The restaurant that guaranteed allergen-free meals.The shopping centre with an accessible toilet that was always open, and clean. The buses easily accessible to buggies.The two teams of undertakers who worked together to organise a child's burial a long way from home.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00182.2.2.4 Taking on 'the system' Even though we actively searched for families with good experiences of services, every single family we met used words like \"fighting\", \"struggling\" and \"battling\" to describe their experience of the service system: 'The only thing that winds us up is when we have to fight for things. When we moved I needed a new toilet; we were asked \"why?\" so I constantly had to justify myself. I've learnt to say \"I need\" not \"I want\". I want to go to America. I need to go to the toilet.' (22-year-old) 'Well you spend your time going down the housing and then the social and then the hospital and then back again, like round and round in a circle. It's such a battle. We just wanted her to come out of hospital, to come home.' (father of 18-month-old) 'It is a continual, exhausting struggle to get her health needs met in school.' (mother of 6-year-old) One teenager told us: 'What will happen is they will argue between themselves - \"this is your responsibility\" - and it will always be someone else's responsibil-ity. They are very powerful people - at the end of the day, you're one person and they're a lot.' (17-year-old) Some families told us of 'successes' in taking on the system: 'One teenager with long-standing healthcare needs developed scolio-sis. The hospital said they would fit a brace in about three months. Her mother \"argued strongly\" that it was needed immediately and it was fitted within two weeks. This made her feel more confident to challenge services in the future - I know that I know what she needs.' (mother of 14-year-old) 'I had to fight with the local PCT [primary care trust] for two years to get physiotherapy ... the key to winning the battle was ... I insisted \u0018\u0018Consultation the person who made the decision came to see me and explain why I couldn't have it. Now I have it. What I do now, is state my needs, state the consequences of them not being met and give them an idea of cost saving over time.' (22-year-old) Even families with successful outcomes found the experience demand-ing: 'Me and my dad have spent hours on the 'phone, and at meetings. My dad does about 10 hours a week paperwork for me with carers, money, appointments - I'm crap at that basically.' (22-year-old) 'The actual paperwork for direct payments was too difficult for me to manage as a full-time parent carer but we now employ someone for a few hours a week to do this.' (mother of 10-year-old) 'The school situation was really tough on her for many years ... we had to go through a tribunal process and as a result we have our say in who is appointed and also an agreement that they are trained up at home before working independently. There is also a proper job description and a more respectable salary reflecting the high level of skills required.' (mother of 14-year-old) Many young people identified the need for \"someone to fight with you\": 'And also, probably most important of all, the person needs somebody that doesn't serve the other side's interests. Everyone has a side. You need an advocate or someone that works purely for your interest.' (17-year-old) 'When we take on the system, I try something and if it doesn't get anywhere my dad tries, if he gets nowhere we go to the solicitors.' (22-year-old) 'Usually I have my brother with me. Sometimes a lawyer. Depends how complicated it's going to get.' (21-year-old)CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Parents also often wished for someone to \"fight their corner with them\". A number of young people and families had used formal processes to fight for what they needed, including complaints procedures, ombuds-men, tribunals and the court system: 'The biggest problem is that people really have got to change towards disabled people. In disabled life, yeah, there are too many excuses ... you could pick up a battering ram. To win like that you need a hell of a lot of lawyers ... that makes them back off and start doing their jobs. A lot of places come down to - what's the word? Bureaucracy.' (17-year-old) Another family had gone to court to fight for their child's rights: 'I knew she would die there [in hospital] then ... we started to fight back ... it takes confidence....' (father of 18-month-old) Taking on the 'system': things that helped The nurse who helped the young person take responsibility for his own health. The chair of school governors who said \"she has a right to be here, we need to sort things out\". The PCT who funded daily taxis to and from hospital so the child did not have to be admitted, and accepted this as a major cost saving. The advocate who \"wrote letter after letter after letter\".The headteacher who took the lead and learned to use the epipen.\u0018\u0018Consultation The charity that developed clear and helpful training materials for schools. The lawyer who said \"it should not be like this, it doesn't have to be like this\". The services that found ways to respond to individual needs, even if it meant bending or breaking the rules. 2.3 Conclusions 2.3.1 What matters? The findings of this consultation show powerfully that having an or- dinary life is, in the end, what matters most to children with CHCN and their families: to 'be themselves' and to be part of a family, to have relationships, to have a life, to do the things that other children and young people do. There is, in this respect, extraordinary consistency in the things that parents/carers and children and young people want from services: support to lead an ordinary life. 2.3.2 What h el ps? Clearly, the conditions and/or illnesses of these children and young peo- ple form one (but not the only) set of formidable obstacles to having an ordinary life. Yet, the consultation brought to the surface many examples of people finding a way around these barriers - where children and young people were not identified exclusively by their CHCN and, together with their families, they had succeeded in having the kinds of relationships and doing the kinds of activities that provide an 'ordinary' life. The findings highlight the crucial part that nuclear and extended family members as well as friends play to this end: meeting ordinary needs alongside their CHCN is something that parents, siblings, friends, cousins and grandparents do every day. In relation to formal service provision, the consultation also identified many examples of good practice on the part of professionals and other paid support workers. Notable in these examples is the significant rear-CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018rangement of standard professional-personal boundaries that is often needed. The extent of children, young people and their families' reliance on support services in the most intimate and the most mundane aspects of everyday life, requires professionals and paid workers to engage with families as compassionate human beings, as much as it requires them to draw on their formal skills. Moreover, the examples of good practice also highlight the redrawing of the boundaries of any one profession that is often necessary. Many examples involved people taking on additional responsibilities and work-ing beyond the formal skill sets usually associated with their role. Lastly, in the examples of good practice the need for a participative, family-centred approach stood out. The need to work in partnership with families is particularly pertinent for this group. Listening and adapting to family preferences about their ordinary needs requires a high level of flexibility and responsiveness. Both creativity and risk taking played important parts. 2.3.3 What g et s in the way? All families consulted were able to describe things that helped, including good experiences of services. However, all families had mixed experi-ences, including examples of things that had not gone well or had gone very badly. The findings of the consultation showed strongly that while ordinary life is often disrupted by a child's CHCN, it is also often disrupted by the service system they then have to navigate. Throughout the consultation, the notion of 'fighting' was ubiquitous. It is resoundingly obvious that services, as currently configured, are often experienced by families as sources of frustration and despair, rather than support and solace. This has implications for defining 'good prac-tice' that we detail in Section 4.1. 2.3.4 Reconceptualising ' soc ial care' Service provision is based on the assumption of separable needs, for example, health, education, social care, palliative care and so on. Yet this consultation has show the way in which the nature of the conditions and/or illnesses of children and young people with CHCN makes any such division of needs untenable. The healthcare needs of this group of \u0018\u0018Consultation children and young people are so much part of their everyday lives that different subsets of needs overlap and merge in complex and changing ways. The way families talked about their lives, then, seems to require re- thinking 'social care' needs as fundamentally linked to something like an 'ordinary life'. One possibility, therefore, is to define 'social care' needs and services using 'ordinary life' criteria, that is, relating to children having as ordinary a family and social life as possible. Thinking about 'social care' needs using 'ordinary life' criteria al- lowed for a recognition of social care needs as overlapping with and even inseparable from their healthcare needs. A child, for example, may not only be technology dependent for their medical care, but also rely on ICT (information and communication technology) for their social networks. Access to ICT, therefore, becomes a social care need, using ordinary life criteria. Concomitantly, it also allows for recognition that social care needs are not necessarily met by social care agencies and 'healthcare' needs are not necessarily met by health services. A further benefit of thinking of social care needs using ordinary life criteria was that it allowed individual preference (or subjectivity) and flexibility to be retained at the heart of the definition. What exactly makes up 'ordinary life' clearly varies from person to person, from fam-ily to family. Yet a basic problem remains. What sense does it really make to talk about 'ordinary lives' in relation to a group of children, young people and families whose lives are clearly far from ordinary? In the course of the analysis we have moved to talking about 'ordinary needs' rather than ordinary lives. 2.3.5 Implications f or policy and practice The findings of the consultation, therefore, also raise various challenges to current policy and practice that are worth clarifying here. Most fundamentally, the fact that 'social care' needs are not neces- sarily met by social care agencies and 'healthcare' needs are not neces-sarily met by health services, is not currently addressed by guidance on interagency working and the associated training, nor the fact that other subsets of need such as emotional, educational, financial, are also likely to be inextricably linked. Consequently, the inevitable negotiation CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018both between agencies and families, and between agencies themselves, is overlooked. Equally, the tension between a child-centred approach and a family-centred approach that this implies currently remains un-discussed. The emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness in the families' ac- counts has implications for organisational culture and management. Prioritising this aspect of care planning and delivery would require sig-nificant alleviation of procedural constraints. It will also be hard to respond to in a risk-averse culture marked by a climate of fear of personal blame for failing to follow rules. The consultation also draws attention to the importance of the tempo- ral aspects of social care delivery and the difficulties caused by rationing the period of time for which families can have access to support services. Families need responsive services when they are in crisis, but they also need services on which they can rely over longer periods of time. Current short-term engagement also precludes the development of relations that allow families to feel that professionals 'really care'.\u0018\u00183 Research review 3.1 Methodology A systematic review method was used to provide an in-depth review and thematic analysis of the research field. A search strategy was designed that could identify empirical research findings relevant to the research questions. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined to select appropri- ate studies that were then categorised ( keyworded) to form a map of the research field. Those that were both particularly relevant and strong methodologically were subject to data extraction and in-depth quality appraisal. Key themes were then analysed thematically. 3.1.1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria St udies were included at the initial search stage if they were: about the social care needs of children and young people who had CHCN, and/or those of their families and services to meet those needs; empirical; in English (resources were not available for the translation of studies in other languages); published between 1987-2005 (some of the major databases do not provide information before 1987; also, prior to this date definitions of CHCN and social care needs correlate less with current defini-tions). Papers that looked solely at the needs of siblings of children with CHCN were excluded as this constitutes a fairly sizeable, complex and disparate body of literature that would benefit from separate study.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u001803.1.2 Initial screening and selection In accordance with SCIE guideline s, 15 databases were systematically searched by two researchers, identifying literature from a number of disciplines (see Appendix A for details). Input from the advisory group (including children, young people, parents and professionals) and pilot-ing of words and phrases on the databases established the search terms to be used. Studies were electronically selected if they contained a term from each of three broadly defined groups, relating to: children and young people CHCN Social care needs and services. This database search identified 6,923 citations, including duplications, in which some combination of these terms appeared (see Appendix B for details of citations on each database). Abstracts for each were read by three reviewers applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten per cent of all abstracts were read by two reviewers for internal quality control. All abstracts identified for inclusion by one reviewer were additionally read by and discussed with another reviewer to determine final inclusion. Any disagreements were referred to a third reviewer. A large number of conceptual and descriptive papers, policy documents and textbooks were excluded at this stage as they did not meet inclusion criteria. This reduced the numbers gained through electronic searching to 222 . Twenty-four additional references were identified through hand searching of key journals, website searching, citation tracking and through recommendations of stakeholders on the advisory group. This brought the total number of studies included for keywording to 246. These were journal articles (168), theses (38), reports (29) and books (11). References were compiled into a database using 'Endnote 7.0'. Figure 1 provides a flowchart with further details of screening. 3.1.3 Forming a m ap through keywording The keywording strategy draws on the EPPI-Centre (Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating) approach to sys-\u0018\u0018Research review Total number of citations found by database search: 6,923 - 6,628 irrelevant citations eliminated in initial screening Total number of citations after initial screening: 295 - 73 duplicates identified and removed Total number of unique citations found by database search: 222 + 24 additional citations found by hand searching or in references Total citations identified: 246 Excluded from keywording: 41Unable to obtain in time: 64Keyworded: 141 - 108 citations did not meet criteria for data extraction 33 suitable for data extraction (10 were in 4 groups of studies) Studies subject to data extraction and in- depth quality appraisal: 27 Figure 1 Flowchart showing screening process at each stageCHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018tematic reviewing (www.eppi.ioe.ac.uk/eppireviewer/guideline_home. aspx?GUIDELINE_ID=GDL146) to form a map of the research field. Information from studies was categorised within a database developed in Microsoft Access using criteria related to both the topic and the nature of the research evidence and concepts presented (see Figure 1). On detailed reading of 41 studies, approximately 20% failed to meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded. One reviewer keyworded every study. Ten per cent of studies were also keyworded by one or other of two additional team members for internal quality control. Any disagreements in keywording were referred to the third reviewer. Sixty-four papers could not be obtained in time (most were unpub- lished dissertations or reports, often from North America). A total of 141 studies were finally keyworded to form the map (shown in Appendix E). Most were North American or UK-based, published as articles in aca-demic journals. The majority were qualitative, with in-depth surveys or interviews with parents and professionals. A quarter focused principally or solely on the social care needs of the child with CHCN, with almost half considering social care needs of the family as a unit and one fifth the needs of parents who were caring for their children with CHCN. The views of children with CHCN were represented in 23% of studies. They were the sole respondents in 9% (mainly older children with less complex needs moving towards independence). 3.1.4 Data e xt raction and in-depth quality appraisal Data extraction and in-depth quality appraisal (using an extended ver- sion of a SCIE format - see Appendix D) was carried out by three team members in respect of a subgroup of studies. Twenty per cent were evalu-ated by two reviewers for internal quality control. Any disagreements were referred to a third reviewer. Papers were included here if: they had high relevance to our research questions; they were replicable, evaluative empirical studies where the report-ing of methodology was sufficiently rigorous and detailed to enable judgements to be made about validity, reliability and the quality of the research design and execution;\u0018\u0018Research review all or most of the children in the study had CHCN, rather than being a small grouping of an overall study. Ten papers clustered into several groups, in that they reported and dis-cussed findings from the same original study. Those linked together were quality appraised as a group and referenced as one study in the thematic analysis. Four groups of studies emerged 19-28. Twenty-seven studies (or groups of studies) were finally included for quality appraisal. The aims, intervention, study design, main findings and conclusions of each of the quality appraised studies are summarised in Appendix F. A thematic analysis in Section 3.2 highlights the main findings and conclusions from studies included in the overall review with those sub-ject to in-depth review discussed first and highlighted in the text by an asterisk *. Appendix G provides a rating (from 1-3) of trustworthiness, appro- priateness, relevance to this review and overall weight of evidence for each study. The weights draw on the EPPI-Centre approach to sys-tematic reviewing (www.eppi.ioe.ac.uk/eppireviewer/guideline_home.aspx?GUIDELINE_ID=GDL160). Three studies were given an overall high quality rating. 29*** 77*** 99*** Thirteen were judged thematic analysis, these ratings will be frequently indicated through use of one, two or three asterisks to denote low, medium and high-quality ratings. However, it should be noted that the team felt these numerical ratings do not fully reflect a study's strengths or limitations and Appendix F should be read for a fuller appraisal of each. More than half of the quality-appraised studies were undertaken in the UK so there is high local relevance.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00183.2 Thematic analysis 3.2.1 Introduction We begin by setting out how the literature defines CHCN and social care needs, then report, through a thematic analysis, the social care needs of children with CHCN and approaches to service provision for them (in Section 3.2.3) and those of their families (Section 3.2.4). The themes chosen to structure this analysis emerged from identifying those that appeared most frequently within papers and/or that had the strong-est empirical evidence. Within each subsection, those with strongest evidence (that is, those subject to in-depth quality appraisal) will be reported first and can be easily identified by an asterisk* after each numbered reference. The wider body of literature relating to that theme will then be described. It will be considered throughout how meeting these social care needs might enable children to achieve the five outcomes that are set for all children within the 2004 Children Act, that is: i) be h ealthy ii) stay safe iii) enjoy and achieve iv) make a positive contribution v) achieve economic wellbeing. 3.2.2 DefinitionsThis section reports the definitions of CHCN and social care needs most commonly used by the empirical studies reviewed. The way in which CHCN bring about social care needs for children and their families is summarised in Figure 2.'Complex healthcare needs': keyworded studies generally report CHCN to be present where there is a health condition or disability that brings about healthcare needs in order to ensure the child's survival or physical health. Some children's needs are continuous, requiring up to 24-hour-a-day medical, nursing or health supervision or intervention. 19* Others are described as moving in and out of a 'zone of medical complexity', with \u0018\u0018Research review health issues moving to prominence after a medical crisis but receding after hospitalisation, monitoring and/or medication adjustments that stabilise the condition. 20 These health needs are seen as complex because they require highly skilled, specialised and often invasive procedures usually by others. 'High-tech' medical equipment may be needed to supplement, replace or monitor bodily functions such as breathing (for example, ventilators or apnoea monitors), eating (enteral and parenteral feeding via naso-gastric tube, gastrostomy and jeujostomy), and kidney functioning (renal dialysis). These children are often said to mainly used by British studies.29** 23** 50-54 Other terms used, particularly in North American include 'medically fragile' and 'medically complex'. 19* 27, 43* 32, 33, 36, 43, 46, 48, 49, 55, 56 Severe or unstable forms of other chronic illnesses or conditions bring about CHCN for some children so were included in this review, for example, sickle cell anaemia, 57** 58* 59, 60 63, 67, 70-72 Figure 2 How CHCN give rise to social care needs in children and families Medical/physical condition Challenge to life and/or death Brings about additional CHCN, eg specialist nursing/medical treatment care tec hnological support mo nitoring Br ings about additional social care needs of child and family that must be met in order to promote their need for/right to an ordinary family and social lifeCHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018 spina bifida, 73* 62, 63, 74 cerebral palsy, 55, 71, 74-88 osteogenesis imperfecta, 71, 89, 90 and muscular dystrophy. 67, 78 Until recently many children born with high levels of CHCN did not survive beyond early childhood. Most who did were cared for in hos-pitals or other institutions. Current medical advances mean that many children now live into adulthood and can remain within family settings if the CHCN and the additional needs that are created for children and families are adequately addressed. 91*** 29** 23** 24** 25* the same 'ordinary' needs as all children. CHCN give rise to a range of additional needs for children with CHCN (for a physically safe environment at home and in school, for attention to emotional, educational and social needs). A consistent message from studies reviewed is that these must be met if children are to have as ordinary a family and social life as possible, enabling them to live at home, go to school, make friends and take part in community and leisure activities. 29** 91*** 99*** This is a focus consistent with both children's rights and wishes.29** 'Social care' needs of parents and carers: while professionals and other paid workers can and do provide direct health and social care services to children, this review will go on to identify how family members (usually mothers) undertake most social and other care for their children with CHCN. The particular demands of this role will be shown to give rise to social care needs for parents and family carers (for preparation for the enhanced caring role, assistance with/breaks from caring, emotional support, financial support). The extent to which social care needs must be met and parents actively supported if they are to continue to meet their children's needs for a stable, safe and positive family and social environment will be discussed. 'Social care' needs of children with CHCN: determining what constitutes social care needs for children with CHCN has not been straightforward in this review. There is considerable ambiguity regarding what might constitute social care needs as opposed to health, mental health, social and educational needs. For example, parents and other workers (such as teachers) who are not medically qualified often need to acquire medically \u0018\u0018Research review specialist skills and knowledge to enable children to live at home 22** 23** and attend school. 91*** 43* This ambiguity matters less to children and families who do not experience their needs as individual elements but rather as part of a seamless whole. Children in a highly rated study who are ventilator-dependent, for example, prefer professionals to work across discipline boundaries so that fewer people are involved with their care. 29*** Where definitions will be seen to have been significant and problem- atic, however, is in relation to responsibility for funding with agencies attempting to distinguish individual needs in accordance with service boundaries in order to determine accountability for provision of re-sources. 29*** 24** 103* 3.2.3 Social care needs of children with CHCN This part of the thematic analysis reports on the social care needs of children with CHCN. Six themes are isolated and analysed: i) c hildren's physical wellbeing ii) emotional wellbeing iii) an ordinary family life iv) school inclusion v) social participation vi) moving towards adulthood. These themes were selected as they appeared most frequently and had most empirical support. Findings from studies subject to data extraction and in-depth quality appraisal are generally reported first within each section, or are at least highlighted. 3.2 .3.1 Physical wellbeing Three quarters of all keyworded studies were concerned, at least in part, with children's physical health (outcome [i], 2004 Children Act). The samples of children reflected a wide spectrum of health and illness. At one end there were children who were medically very fragile with frequent medical emergencies placing their lives at risk 55 and/or who were not CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018expected to live into adulthood.45 At the other were children who were mainly well but needed monitoring and oversight to maintain health or particular interventions as a result of a severe disability (for example, children with severe cerebral palsy who might require tube feeding). 87 In the quality-appraised studies, it was found that, depending on the level of their healthcare needs, children required support and assistance in a number of areas. A study given a high evidential rating found the monitoring of the child's symptoms and bodily functions 92*** to be im- portant. Three studies of medium rating reported how some children needed bodily functions such as breathing, eating and digestion supple-mented through manual caregiver intervention and/or use of specialised equipment (for example, mechanical ventilation, tube feeding). 21** 23** 24** The need for medication (including intravenous) to be provided on both a regular and emergency basis 25** 93* and transportation to hospital for appointments and in emergencies94* were also noted. Supplementation of bodily functions,38 a need for monitoring, 28, 32, 39, 55, 66 provision of medication55, 95 and transportation 59, 75, 96 were also discussed in other keyworded studies. Keyworded studies addi-tionally described the importance of children receiving education and support in learning to understand and manage their condition through modifying their behaviour, controlling their symptoms, complying with treatments and being alert to the meaning of any changes. 60, 70, 72, 97 Despite the immense stresses on parents no studies were identified regarding potential intrafamilial risks of abuse or neglect to children with CHCN. This contrasts with research on disabled children more widely that has considered their particular vulnerability. One keyworded study does, however, assert the importance of professionals at discharge planning ensuring that parents have adequate general parenting skills and that any pre-existing family problems that could mitigate against appropriate and reliable caregiving under stress are dealt with. 32, 98 3.2.3.2 Emotional wellbeing Almost a third of keyworded studies considered children's emotional health and wellbeing, with many identifying sources of stress or dif-ficulty for children. Findings and suggestions relate to outcomes (i), (ii) and (iiia).\u0018\u0018Research review Two quality-appraised studies (one medium-rated, one low) show that most children report good levels of emotional health, have normative global self-worth scales and want the same things as other children to promote their emotional wellbeing: friendships, peer social supports, parental support, to be treated with respect and dignity. 29** 73* However, children also reported stressors that had a negative impact on their well-being. Lengthy hospitalisations caused distress as children were separated from family, friends and community. 91*** Stigma, discrimination, preju- dice, and teasing about being different due to their CHCN were found to be significant. 69*** 91*** 58* Many children felt insufficiently consulted and informed about their care and support.91*** 29** Children felt there to be restrictions on developing their independence due to the demands of their CHCN and felt too reliant on their families to meet their needs. 69*** 29** They often ended up with insufficient opportunities for time alone with friends and restrictions on ordinary leisure/recreational ac-tivities. 29** Pain and fear from their illness/condition and/or healthcare interventions were distressing. 93* Such stressors compromise children's emotional health. Although apathy, low motivation, low self-concept and conduct disorder were not often reported, symptoms of distress and behavioural difficulties such as anxiety, depression, shyness and isolation were found. 58* Children appear to have few outlets or opportunities to describe and express the discomfort and distress they experience. 29** Some parents say they be- come so preoccupied, exhausted and overwhelmed by the physical nature of the CHCN and the attendant stresses that they are unable to suffi-ciently meet their children's other socio-emotional requirements. 97, 99*** Although some children are said to need counselling100 there is little evidence that they receive it.29** While many professionals seem to con- centrate on health needs at the expense of emotional ones, volunteers in one study were found to have helped children more informally with fears and worries and to engage in fun activities. 101** These issues are also discussed in keyworded studies. 21, 39, 44, 63, 87, 102, 103* It would appear that the nature and extent of emotional needs of children with CHCN and how best to meet these needs requires determining further, both in respect of individual children and more globally to aid service planning if 2004 Children Act outcomes (iii), (iv) and (v) are not to be compromised.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u001803.2.3.3 An ordinary family life Children with CHCN have a right to live with their families and affirm strongly that this is their wish. 91*** 29** It has been found that for children's CHCN to be managed in the family home so that they can remain safe and healthy specialist caregiving needs to be in place from carers (paid or family) who are sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable to understand and manage their needs. 91*** 104* Prompt and in-depth assessments are necessary to this, ensuring that efficient resources are available and that all carers are adequately trained and able to meet the child's needs. 91*** 29** Keyworded studies also discuss these issues.32, 38, 55, 89, 98, 105-108 However, there is strong evidence that ordinary family life is often disrupted, with homes becoming 'hospitalised', dominated by monitor-ing, treatment regimes, medical crises and care provision, invaded and intruded on by a range of professionals and paid carers. 91*** 26* 25* 93* 94* This is also discussed in keyworded studies.30, 36, 49, 109, 110 Children and their families provided strong evidence that many chil- dren remain too long in hospital, with delays for no good medical reason but due to insufficiently qualified or trained carers being available or be-cause funding could not be agreed or arranged in time to provide carers, equipment or necessary housing adaptations or moves . 91*** 111** 29** 104* Young people reported that this was unwelcome and distressing; getting home was very important to them, particularly as they did not feel involved in their care or listened to in hospital. 91*** Delayed discharge compromised their capacity to maintain adequate contact with their families, first language, culture, nationality and religion. 91*** This is also described in keyworded studies. 38, 50, 71, 86, 89, 90, 98, 100, 106, 112-115 There was some evidence that children and their families want to be able to spend social and leisure time together but experience difficulty finding recreational and social activities that the whole family can par-ticipate in outside their home. 29** The demands of adhering to treatment regimens mean that extraordinary levels of planning and creative adapt-ability are required to ensure the child's health is not compromised. 93* Some children need holidays to be organised near specialist hospitals in case of a medical emergency. 25* Those who are technology-depend- ent often need cumbersome equipment with them at all times which requires specially adapted transport ; financial support will be needed to purchase an appropriate vehicle or to enable ready access to adapted \u0018\u0018Research review community transportation.25* 93* Some children and parents found it too embarrassing performing procedures like gastrostomy feeding or tracheostomy suctioning in public due to attitudes of the public or staff at facilities. 25* These issues are also discussed in keyworded studies 39, 44, 49, 70, 71, 116-118 and are thought to be important as increased contact with relatives, friends and the wider community is believed to be associated with im-proved emotional and social wellbeing for all family members. 39, 44, 103 Improvements in accessibility and oppressive or prejudicial attitudes from members of the public or staff at social amenities will depend in part on the extent to which local authorities and the private sector meet their responsibilities under the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. It can be seen, then, that failure to provide supports to enable children to achieve the more fundamental outcomes ([i] and [ii]) can seriously impact on 'higher-level' outcomes ([iiia] 'enjoy' and [iv] 'make a positive contribution'). 3.2 .3.4 School inclusion Eleven studies subject to in-depth con- sidered what is required to ensure a child's participation in education. 20, 38, 43, 63, 86, 113, 119-121 Education is a fundamental part of helping children achieve 2004 Children Act 2004 outcomes (iii), (iv) and (v). Until recently children with CHCN could not always participate educationally with their peers as schools were unable to meet their sig- nificant needs for technological, medical and care support.19* 27* Care needs are often substantial. Although on average children were found to need three helpers at school, 29** those attending special schools had up to 14 different professionals providing aspects of their care.107* Positively, three studies report more recent progress in school inclusion through supplying sufficient appropriately trained carers and equipment; 27* 107* in one all children of school age with CHCN were going to school or nursery on a regular basis and most were accessing the full curricu-lum. 29** Coordinated, keyworker -type approaches are reported to have made an important contribution, facilitating multi-agency planning alongside parents and pupils to ensure that all needs are met. 21** 26*CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018However, there is strong evidence of difficulties. Limited finance and funding disputes between health and education cause delays for many re- garding adaptations to buildings to make them more accessible, 91*** 25* 94* provision of equipment, 29** 19* and transportation to school. 21** 26* 94* Just over one third of children in a recent UK study had school inclusion delayed by up to eight months due to a lack of suitable carers being available. 107* In the same study, despite the Department of Health 1996 Health Care Plan approach being described as helpful by parents and school carers, none of the children had the recommended Plan. Illness and pain caused some children to struggle academically and with attendance. 58* 27* Children are often excluded from school trips, in part because of a lack of suitable carers, 107* resulting in parents stepping in to support their children while feeling that schools were not meeting their statutory responsibilities. 27* Many schools have limited experience of including children with some CHCN, (such as ventilator dependence) and must learn anew with each family, so there is strong evidence of a need for training, policies, support and supervision. 91*** Responsibilities for tasks are not always well defined and professional boundaries may be blurred. Whereas school nurses generally provide medications, supervise others in doing so, or provide skilled respiratory care, such as tracheal suctioning, other staff such as teachers are often taught how to provide repetitive, routine yet skilled care, such as gastric tube feedings, or supervising the end of a nebuliser treatment begun by the nurse. 43* Young people say they value such flexibility in professional roles as the number of different caregiv-ers is then limited. 91*** However, unclear policies regarding role and ac- countability may create a lack of clarity with workers being unsure about responsibilities and inadequately trained for tasks, so it is advised that these are clearly identified within each child's plan. 26* 27* Additional needs regarding training for professionals are implied by parents need-ing to train school staff in meeting their children's CHCN to ensure their inclusion. 27* 107* These school inclusion issues are also discussed in seven keyworded studies.20, 43, 63, 86, 119-121\u0018\u0018Research review 3.2.3.5 Social participation Children with CHCN are described as having the same rights to and desires for social inclusion as other children, that is, to have friendships, social stimulation and be able to participate in social activities with all peers, not just other children who are disabled or have CHCN. 40, 63, 75, 100 This supports all five of the 2004 Children Act outcomes. However, there is strong evidence that many children find that their choice of leisure activities is restricted and they have less chance to make friends. 91*** 29** This is also discussed in keyworded studies.21, 63, 71, 87, 117 As well as those reasons given in Section 3.2.3.3, some children are too ill or fragile to participate with peers in social, leisure or community activities, or their parents fear they are and restrict their inclusion. 58* 89 There is some evidence that psychosocial education for parents about the need for their children to develop independence may be useful. 58* Supporting the development of peer relationships is also important here. Some children experienced prejudicial attitudes91*** and teasing58* by peers because they were, or were perceived to be, different as a result of their CHCN. One study advises that children could be helped to cope with these challenges through psychosocial interventions . 73* This is also described by keyworded studies that suggest that these will help children develop social skills and normative friendships that will promote their inclusion in social activities. 50, 54, 70, 122 Teaching children about their condition and helping them explore its meaning for their lives is thought to help with symptom control that has a knock-on effect for how they might more confidently form relationships and interact with their peers. 70 This appears to be easier for children to appreciate and manage as they mature.93* Improving self-esteem and confidence about their difference is found to be necessary58* as children with CHCN need 'higher-than-average levels of self-esteem to counteract the physical and attitudinal barriers they face throughout their lives' 73* (p 172). This is also discussed in70. Work at a larger systems level was also advised to reduce these barriers through challenging all pupils' attitudes and pro-moting inclusive activities in schools. 73*CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00183.2.3.6 Moving towards adulthood Fourteen studies, three of which were quality appraised69*** 91*** 123* and provided good evidence, focused on what enables young people to make successful transitions to independence and/or from paediatric to adult-centred services. 59-61, 67, 72, 74, 124-127, 159 Three quarters of these included the direct voices of young people with CHCN themselves; in just under half they were the sole respondents. All were classed as primarily focused on the needs of the young people rather than their carers/family. Transition services are reported as aimed at increasing young peo- ple's autonomy, responsibility and capacity to manage their illness and meet their own social care needs as adults wherever possible so they can participate as fully as possible in social, community and economic life 59, 60, 72, 126, 127 (meeting 2004 Children Act outcomes [iii], [iv] and [v]). Successful transitions are associated with young people taking re-sponsibility for their health, increased optimism and decreased anxieties about the future, and improved mental and emotional wellbeing 69*** 72 (outcomes [i] and [ii]). The clearest message from young people in one study was that they want the same things as any other young people as they grow into adult-hood - \"friends, sex, money, a place to call their own, and the freedom to do the things they enjoy doing\" - but that the way services are delivered can be a barrier to achieving these things ( 159 p 137). Service coordina- tion is found to be helpful; it can ensure continuity of communication and information between paediatric and adult service sectors 69*** 123* (also suggested in60, 61, 67, 159). However, it appears that there is not always suffi- cient planning for this transition with young people themselves.91*** Many have little or no preparation or opportunity to discuss decisions, plan their transfer to adult services or practice managing their care. 69*** Some young people say they want more up-to-date knowledge of their con-dition and treatment and ways of managing it 59-61 as it makes them feel more independent and autonomous.125 There is evidence that such feelings correlate with improved adherence to treatment and condition management 69*** (promoting outcome [i] into adulthood). There are concerns that young people may hinder their own successful independence by prioritising their social needs above their health needs and treatment regime. They are subject to the same pressures as other \u0018\u0018Research review adolescents to engage in social activities that can negatively affect their health, for example, smoking, drinking, using drugs, but, for them, this may have catastrophic consequences health-wise. 69*** Health and social care workers are advised to recognise this, working in partnership to engage young people in developing and managing their own treatment regimes 69*** This is also suggested in72. Practising life skills required to effectively manage their care, as well as adopting behaviours favourable to their health may be useful and could be more likely within a therapeutic environment that is safe, supportive and encouraging. 60 Professionals believe that lack of funding and access to key staff can impede successful transitions.126 Some suggest that parents, too, may provide barriers if they are ambivalent about their offspring's independ-ence; they may need support and education to encourage them to par-ticipate in autonomy-building activities. 59, 127 3.2.4 Social care needs of family carers of a child with CHCN For all children it is their parents and other family members who have the primary responsibility for ensuring their health and safety in the family and promoting their active participation in school and the wider Figure 3 Types of support and approaches to service provision required by parents Support needed by parents preparation for the enhanced caring role assistance with/breaks from caring emotional support financial support Support needed by parents that their efforts and needs are recognised, valued, and accepted by professionals tha t the services are available (for example, trained staff) that provision of services and resources are coordinated with joint agency funding agreed ant i-oppressive service structures and individual approachesCHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018social world. When children have CHCN these caring responsibilities are significantly increased. If parents and family carers are not supported in this role their capacity to meet their children's social care needs is re-duced with the result that the child's wellbeing is seriously compromised. This review identified the support required by parents and approaches to service provision that might be most effective (summarised in Figure 3). These two aspects cannot be disentangled completely. 3.2 .4.1 Preparing parents to provide specialist care If a child with CHCN is to be safely and adequately cared for in the family home, sufficiently skilled and specialist nursing and personal care must be available to provide the conditions specified in Section 3.2.3. There is evidence that there are insufficient formal services available to fully meet the requirements of children with continuous needs, particu-larly those who are technology-dependent and need a very high level of supervision and care. 26* 104* This is also suggested in.100, 105 Consequently parents, willingly or under pressure, become the primary carers for most children with CHCN as the alternatives appear only to be continued hospitalisation or local authority care for the child. 25* There is strong evidence that parents need to be trained and prepared by nursing or medical staff for the specialist caregiving tasks they will be undertaking in addition to general parenting 92*** 22** 19* 26* 25* 107* (also proposed in109, 122, 129). The level of skills they learn would normally be the province of medical staff, with some CHCN requiring very specialised techniques outside the experience of most GPs, community nurses and even local hospitals. 25* Parental competence in these must be assessed prior to hospital discharge to ensure the child's health is not placed at risk 91*** (also put forward in32, 98). However, not all parents receive train- ing that is sufficient 19* 107* or of the appropriate nature, that is, some was reported as insensitive as, by concentrating exclusively on procedures, the emotional effect of having to do intrusive and often painful tasks to one's own child was ignored. 94* Parents require information and explanations about the child's condi- tion (that is, prognosis and treatment) and practical advice about daily caregiving as well as how to respond to emergencies. 57** 92*** Information needs to be provided in ways that can be understood and may need to be repeated as parents become familiar with their child's diagnosis. \u0018\u0018Research review 93* However, inadequate, inappropriate or contradictory information is often received.25* Many families say they do not know where to find out what they need to know90 and welcome introductory materials such as leaflets and booklets130 and being able to access information through the inter- net.131** 109 However, there are risks of using such information in isolation as it may not be accurate or applicable in a particular instance.131** 130 Verbal explanations and advice are successfully provided by telephone helplines22* and keyworkers.29** 24** 57, 130* 94* Mutual advice/information sharing was welcomed, too, with good evidence for using internet-based support groups. 131** Local parent support groups were also thought to be useful.116, 132 Suggestions regarding information were also made in keyworded studies.52, 62, 79, 85, 110, 116, 122, 130, 133 Provision of such information and advice is associated with enhanced parental emotional wellbeing, improving control, empowerment and coping. 25* 93* 24** It is also thought to improve parental relationships and stability of family life.64 Through this parents become extremely skilled and knowledgeable and can often detect potential health problems earlier than professionals who do not know the child so well 25* (also suggested in116). 3.2.4.2 Assistance with/a break from caring Some parents find life caring for their child with CHCN to be a constant, daily struggle.92*** 22** The rigours of highly scheduled 24-hour treatment regimes, heavy lifting and the need for constant availability to monitor symptoms and manage complications or emergencies can cause sleep deprivation and extreme physical exhaustion. 92*** 68** 29** 21** 25* Where this level of fatigue is not assuaged it can have potential long-term con-sequences for parental health. Not only is this damaging for parents as individuals but it might mitigate against the parents' capacity to continue as caregivers. 92*** Numerous studies discussed the need for parents to have some form of assistance with or break from these ongoing responsibilities and de-mands. 37, 41, 42, 44, 50, 51, 55, 75, 95, 110, 134 As CHCN require particular or special- ised skills on the part of the caretaker, naturally occurring opportunities for assistance or breaks are less available. 21** 25* Relatives and friends are unable or lack confidence to assist50** unless they have undergone CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018formal training,25* and this is rarely available.94* Parents are thought to be reluctant to ask them because of fear of over-burdening them with such physical and technical demands.51 Only where school inclusion is successful do parents receive a natural break from the demands of care in a way that does not disrupt the child's ordinary social and family life. 29** 27* Many parents need additional nursing,26* ancillary care94* or sitting services to be provided in the home29** 143** 25* so that they can cope (also suggested in33, 38, 46, 52, 108). These services enable parents to rest, sleep, have a bath, go shopping, spend time with their partner and participate in work, leisure, religious, cultural, social or community activities. There is very strong evidence that this supports and replen-ishes parental morale, energy, mental health and emotional wellbeing that have been depleted due to the stress and exhaustion caused by the emotional, physical and practical challenges of constant caregiving and vigilance 91*** 92*** 21** 22, 32, 33, 50, 51, 68, 75, 79, 82, 90, 95, 110, 135** 136** 137** 26* 138* (also discussed in32, 33, 50, 51, 68, 75, 79, 82, 90, 95, 108, 110, 135, 139). Some parents found this in-home provision of a break for them to be more flexible, responsive and less disruptive for their children.21** 25* The child remains in his/her own familiar environment; equipment does not have to be transported, the risk of cross-infection is reduced and trust is built up with one carer or a team of carers over time who have been specially recruited and trained, although not all parents receive provi-sion appropriate to their needs. Parents want services to be sufficiently responsive to accommodate family events, preferences and emergencies but this is rarely available, 137** for example, no night-time sitting serv- ices.25* Keyworded studies make similar comments.71, 77 Despite their benefits, the continuous presence of home carers can be stressful and invasive, disrupting family life and limiting families' privacy. 94* 25* There have also been difficulties in identifying enough knowledgeable and skilled home care personnel who are able to meet the child's care needs; this has implications for local authorities' recruitment , training and supervision procedures. 26* 25* 94* Keyworded studies suggest parents need to be confident in formal carers' abilities as a change in worker disrupts routines and provokes anxiety. 49, 88 Multiagency agree- ment about funding these services within care packages needs to be planned early if hospital discharge is not to be delayed or parents required to do more than they can manage while waiting for the appropriate level \u0018\u0018Research review of home care to be agreed.25* 104* 94* Wide disparities have been reported in the amount of home support received by families with similar needs in the UK, possibly relating to local policies.25* Some parents say they carry high levels of responsibility in the absence of sustained support.138 Further national clarity on eligibility criteria appears to be called for to ensure equity of service provision geographically. Such home-based services do not always offer parents a sufficient break away from routines to refresh them emotionally and physically and many parents prefer the child to be cared for outside of the home for a few hours or days 137** (also suggested in51). Pros and cons were reported for different forms of break. Those within alternative family settings, including suggestions for link-family schemes, 50, 95 were generally valued highly by all family members including children with CHCN92*** 21** (also discussed in51, 75). Some parents received personal support through the relationship built up with the carer.92*** Proposals in keyworded studies were that at least one night if not more was generally needed to provide parents with sufficient rest given their potential exhaustion. 51 Pre-planned, 10-day stays away were said to increase mothers' feelings of wellbeing, reduce depression and improve caregiver-child interac-tions. 76 Some families and professions reported that institutionally based short breaks were less preferable due to risks of cross-infection, disrup-tions to children's routines and excluding children from ordinary family life. 21** 25* However, there were indications that parents in a keyworded study preferred their children to stay in a hospice feeling that their chil-dren were safe, comfortable and happy there. 138 They were particularly reassured that the alternative carer would be a nurse and, consequently, have sufficient medical skills. There is evidence that some families have to find, train or orient their own short break carers themselves. 92*** It is advised that the families' need requirements are determined in advance , not in response to a crisis, since the process involved in agreeing funding and recruiting and training specialist carers for particular families is lengthy 91*** 24** 21** 136** 26* 25* (also suggested in37, 44, 50, 77, 89, 96, 140). Some parents and professionals worry that children have been placed in inappropriate settings, and are concerned about physical safety and possible psychological damage to children through a lack of consistent care, and carers. 138* Not all parents took advantage of short-break or sit-CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180ter services as they worried that their child's health needs, particularly medical emergencies, would not be adequately dealt with and their child would find breaks away or changes of carer difficult to deal with 68** (also proposed in44, 95, 141). Some further proposals were made in the keyworded studies. Some parents who objected to the label of carer, perceiving themselves simply as parents, were happy to use child support services but felt if they used a parent-support service it was an admission of failure, that they could not cope. 141 Very few studies discuss the overt advantages or risks for the child of having a break from their usual carer. Time out of the household with a link family 50 or in a holiday play scheme100 is thought to offer children possibilities to participate in community life, have fun, make friends and develop independence. Nurses in one UK study thought children needed as much a break from the usual routines and faces as their parents. 51 The point was continually made by parents and professionals that short breaks do promote family life for children with CHCN as they enable parents to cope and continue successfully with the care-taking role. Only one out of a sample of 10 families said that the situation worked well without any breaks being provided. 90 Another family placed their child in foster care for a year due to parental stress and exhaustion.51 However, much more needs to be known about children's views and preferences here. 3.2 .4.3 Emotional support for parents/primary carers A number of studies report high levels of emotional and psychological stress experienced by parents of children with CHCN. Difficult deci-sions need to be made; 92*** two keyworded studies described decisions about medical treatments being stressful.44, 66 Some parents felt pres- sured to become long-term carers regardless of whatever expectations they might previously have had for gradually relinquishing the caring role as their child matured. 25* Continually meeting the child's physical or medical needs and monitoring their symptoms was said to cause exhaustion, overload and social isolation 57** (this was also discussed in44, 45, 66, 102, 109, 110, 117, 141-143, particularly for mothers who tend to be the main caregiver). 143, 144 A number of issues believed to contribute to this were discussed in keyworded studies: frequent change, unpredictability, fears and uncer-tainty about the future, 37, 39, 102 seeing the child in pain or suffering,141 and \u0018\u0018Research review chronic grief117 and anger about losses, for example, of dreams for their child, of relationships with extended family and friends,145 of privacy and personal space, of the opportunity to be creative and reflective, of freedom of choice in personal and family matters, of leisure activities including holidays. 110 Significant financial strains are reported below (see Section 3.2.4.4). Such continued stress was thought to inhibit parents' capacity to meet certain of their children's needs, for example, giving appropriate boundaries 97, 99*** or providing emotional support.85 While some parents report that their child's needs have brought them closer together, others talk of conflict and disharmony in the parental relation-ship due to limited leisure time together as a couple, arguments about role and task distribution and exhaustion. 33, 36, 39, 84, 97, 102, 103* 141 Some parents asked for their parental relationship to be supported in order to avoid family life being disrupted for children 39 and others relationship counselling .33 There is strong evidence that many parents experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms such as anxiety, anger, frustration, de-spair, powerlessness, depression, exhaustion, irritability, migraines, anae-mia and insomnia 91*** 57** 68** (also considered in 36, 45, 46, 95, 109, 144, 145). Two keyworded studies suggest some symptoms reach clinically significant levels 83, 84) and more than half of respondents in another reported enough symptoms to classify them as needing psychiatric intervention.30 There is some evidence that parents had their own preferred ways of coping that included: gaining concrete and emotional support from fam-ily, friends, others in a similar situation and professionals; comfort from religion, spiritual beliefs and prayer; cognitive techniques (reprioritising lifestyle, normalising, problem solving, information seeking, taking con-trol, planning); physical outlets (for example, crying, drinking, smoking, physical activity); self-maintenance (venting emotional distress, having other interests, self-indulgence); approaches to life (adaptability, taking one day at a time, not dwelling on difficulties, acceptance, hope, compar-ing self to others worse off, refusing to give up, forming positive meanings from the experience, 'getting on with life' and moving forward); a good relationship with the child; helpful policies; own financial resources; and job flexibility 22** 57** 26* (also discussed in36, 39, 46, 102, 141, 144, 146). Improved coping was associated with parents feeling more control in their lives, no longer being overwhelmed by their emotions, improved parent-child relationships and capacity to continue caregiving.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018Some parents report having needed professional counselling .28* 108 Individual, family and group counselling were all thought to be ben- eficial92 with needs at diagnosis particularly mentioned.87 There was strong evidence that parents feel emotionally supported by helpful and compassionate ongoing relationships with professionals and home care providers in which they are able to discuss their feelings and contact them at any time with problems/issues. 29*** 42** 24** 28* This suggests that the way in which professionals provide services is as important as the service, for example, manner, approach, emotional availability and sen-sitivity. It was suggested, however, that boundaries need to be attended to, as uncertainty, confusion and frustration may occur when these are crossed; contracts setting out boundaries 111, 153 and worker self-awareness were proposed.38 Conversely, parents feel unsupported when professionals do not rec- ognise their needs and difficulties, view them as difficult, demanding or manipulative, without recognising the difficulties they face, appear unsympathetic, and/or disinterested in their child's suffering 67** 49* (also discussed in45, 106, 151). Keyworded studies suggested good communica- tion between workers and families was important48 to deal with conflicts about parents feeling need is not addressed,117 where there are disagree- ments about treatment or care approaches, or because parents resent paid professionals being able to go home when they get little break. 40 There was evidence of benefit in assisting mothers to learn skills to help them manage their relationships with professionals. 42** Organisations that enabled parents to mutually share information and give/receive social and emotional support (either face-to-face or 'virtually') were found to be beneficial. 138** 34* 139, 54 One internet group was found to reduce anxiety and depression, helped restore emotional balance or stability and improved caregiver-child relationships for some parents. 138** 3.2.4.4 Financial needs Many families where there is a child with CHCN experience report in- creased financial hardship. The demands of the caregiving role prevents parents putting time and energy into furthering their careers and the majority of mothers give up paid work 20** 24** 28* 101* 103* (also discussed in 51, 53, 63, 125, 147 33, 74, 147 92, 117, 110, 79). The need for home adaptations, house \u0018\u0018Research review moves and equipment has already been reported; many families cannot get charities or the local authority to meet the full costs and have to fund them themselves. 24** Keyworded studies suggest additional costs include travel to, and parking fees for, appointments,106 higher electricity bills to run equipment, higher home insurance, mobile phones in case of medical emergencies and refreshments for home carers. 43 In countries where there is not a national health system to pay for home care and medication (for example, North America) further financial hardship was experienced. 34* 33, 40, 51, 74 This combination of low incomes and car- ing was believed to isolate families and restrict lifestyles, consequently detrimental to the child and family's social inclusion and emotional wellbeing. 79 Provision of additional financial resources that would lessen the stress and impact on the family system were proposed.37, 136 3.2.4.5 Other family support services Families want to do leisure activities together but regimes and equip- ment to meet CHCN often prevent this99*** (also described in 57-59). There is evidence for a family-centred approach to service provision that considers the needs of all family members both as individuals and as a unit, 99*** 42** 24** 152*(also proposed in 40, 63, 73, 154). This promotes positive, loving relationships between parent and child that mediate the stress of being a carer, enabling parents to view their situation more positively and to maintain commitment to caring through difficult times 42** 67** (also discussed in51, 147, 107). Ambivalent and resentful feelings persist when stresses and difficulties are not supported and parents are pushed into being carers rather than choosing this role 67* (also considered in141, 147). It is believed that parents are then less able to provide emotional support to their children, which inhibits the development of children's self-image and self-worth. 93 Conversely, where family support services are boosted parents can cope better and parent-child interactions are seen to improve 82* (also described in93, 147). Suggested services in keyworded studies include early intervention programmes thought to reduce stress and improve parenting skills to deal with particular challenges 155 and home visitors who provide play and educational activities for children as well as supportive conversations, assistance and short breaks for parents that are believed to reduce paren-tal concerns, stresses and fatigue and improve general spirits. 156 A range CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018of other family support needs were also reported, some of which were evidence in quality-appraised studies including advocacy ,28* 63, 86, 106, 151, 157 information on services and benefits available,28* 85, 86, 93, 98 home helps 43, 86 and transport .29*** 79, 90, 115, 125, 126, 124 There are suggestions, however, in one keyworded study, that some parents are reluctant to use support services for themselves if they do not benefit their child directly. 147 Keyworded studies suggest that the needs of the child with CHCN and their siblings may sometimes clash and a whole-family approach to as- sessment is needed to assess these potentially conflicting needs so parents can manage simultaneous demands. 79 Some siblings without CHCN have become carers themselves and are affected by similar stresses and strains to those reported by parents. 117 Others may feel left out of the family and less important to their parents because there is less time, at-tention and energy for them. 40, 151 In some cases their education, social lives, routines, behaviour and emotional and mental health is found to be affected 30* (also described in 40, 53, 126). It is proposed that specified outcomes for children must also be promoted for siblings, too, so costs and benefits need to be weighed not just for the child with CHCN but for the whole family. 40, 59, 73, 147 The particular needs of minority ethnic families for support are not always addressed. There are said to be professional assumptions that serv-ices are not required within minority communities as extended family support is available and preferred. In fact Pakistani and Bangladeshi par-ents were described as having a lower level of extended family support 130 than those in a national study of mainly white families.108 Additional stressors for minority families described included the combination of disadvantaged circumstances and difficulties in securing access to ap-propriate services because language barriers and inadequate levels of communication left families not always able to understand how services and benefits were organised, what was available to them and how to chal-lenge or even negotiate with service providers. 93, 148 South Asian families preferred services that were sensitive to cultural and religious needs.93 Pakistani and Bangladeshi families specified workers of the same ethnic origin so they could speak the same language. 148 It was found that some parents believed that if haemoglobinaopathies (for example, Sickle cell disorder and thalassaemia) affected more white children there would be better service delivery. 67** It seems advisable that agencies consider \u0018\u0018Research review institutional racism as part of anti-oppressive service planning and de- livery.67** 148 3.2.4.6 Service coordination Numerous professionals from a wide range of disciplines become regu- larly involved with families where there is a child with CHCN.28* Many parents have complained that service provision has been fragmented leaving some feeling they are the only ones who are seeing or caring about the whole child. 99*** A lack of coordinated planning means that difficul- ties with accessing services, overload from unsynchronised visits from different professionals and confusion about their roles, insufficient infor-mation and feeling isolated and unsupported are common experiences. 28* Having to organise service provision and equipment themselves leaves parents with little time for ordinary family life and creates additional pressures over and above those of caring for their child. 99*** 28* There is strong evidence that coordinated systems of case management and joint collaborative working that tailor approaches to the child and family's needs rather than trying to fit them into pre-existing unhelpful structures are preferred by families and also considered in41, 79, 108, 136, 151, 158, 85. Disputes between agencies, and sometimes professionals, about re- sponsibility for funding services appear to cause considerable stress to parents 103*and highlight the need for clear responsibilities through Joint funding procedures.28* 86 In the UK NHS guidance EL(95)5 has clari- fied responsibilities for funding technologies, and the use of commercial companies to provide an integrated service directly to families' homes. As a result funding appears to have become more reliable, efficient, responsive and integrated, benefiting families. 29*** 28* Integrated systems of multiagency working are being introduced in the UK in line with the requirements of the 2004 Children Act. Here a lead professional must be identified for each child who should: provide information, signposting and emotional support; coordinate the multi-disciplinary services provided; monitor and review the care plan and ensure its effectiveness; and make proactive contacts with the family to assist in the identification of needs and preparation for review meet-ings, including helping the child to communicate his or her wishes. 55 This more coordinated approach appears to have resulted in observ-CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018able improvements to the system that a number of families feel has become more efficient, effective and simpler to deal with. These include: greatly enhanced coping, 67** a reduction in the negative effects of care routines,20** improved communication, more involvement in the care planning process, solving of previously intractable problems, identifica-tion and addressing of needs, and provision of information, advice, and emotional support 24** (also described in55). One keyworded study also suggests children are being discharged earlier from hospital.60 In one medium-rated study24** there is evidence that parents felt more emotionally supported as they were less exhausted even though keywork-ers were not necessarily dealing directly with their emotional needs. The role expansion and blurring following the adoption of keyworking seems to have been experienced positively by frontline workers as it was providing an opportunity to work in new ways. However, many social workers felt medical and healthcare issues dominated and threatened the social model of disability. The study authors advise alertness to workers stepping too far outside their area of expertise. Another study reports strong evidence that a keyworker should be appointed for every child with CHCN. 52** 3.3 Conclusions 3.3.1 What is the research evidence about the social care needs of children with CHCN and their families and services designed to meet those needs? The findings of the research review are consistent with those of the consultation. In particular both verify that children with CHCN have the same 'ordinary' wishes and needs as other children, that is, to live at home with their families, go to school, spend time with their friends and participate in leisure and community activities with family and peers. Children and their families require any or all of a range of services to enable this, including specialist home care, equipment, housing ad-aptations, transport, psychosocial interventions, emotional support and counselling. Despite some more recent improvements, however, these services are not always provided without significant delays and/or battles on the \u0018\u0018Research review part of families as funding is not always agreed readily or on request. Without this children's health and safety cannot be guaranteed at home or school. The result is that some children still experience significant delays in being discharged from hospital and attending school. Both review and consultation highlight how it is parents who provide most daily care for their children. Ongoing monitoring and caregiving can be stressful and exhausting. Meeting the parental needs outlined in this review can enable them to cope in the longer term and consequently promotes child-focused outcomes. A family-centred approach to service provision is strongly supported empirically; this includes home support services, emotional and relationship support, access to employment and additional financial resources. The implications here, then, relate both to type and amount of services provided to meet needs. Families, however, experience further difficulties regarding the avail- ability and flexibility of such services due to the lack of suitably trained personnel. This suggests issues with both recruitment/retention and training of formal carers. Ordinary family life is frequently interrupted by the fragmented na- ture of service provision currently. Families may fall through the gaps in between and struggle to ensure agencies take responsibility for funding the services they need. A 'postcode lottery' regarding service provision adds further stress to families. Early indications from the moves towards integrated service provision under the Change for Children agenda are positive with some families experiencing benefits from the lead professional approach with coordi-nated planning/commissioning and a coherent 'team around the child'. Improvements are not only in speeding up and simplifying assessment and service provision but in providing the kind of ongoing relational and socio-emotional support so valued by families. One significant limitation of the existing research base is that the voices of parents and professionals have been heard more than those of children with CHCN in this review, particularly in respect of younger children and those with the most complex needs. This does not fit with the aspirations of the current policy and legislative context that emphasises the importance of seeking children's views to inform service planning and delivery to meet social care needs. The achievement of outcomes should arguably be measured by children's desires and aspira-CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018tions, what they want and need, and relate to the policy agenda, rather than what resources currently dictate.62 Further empirical research regarding children's views on their social care needs (for example, in respect of emotional support or how they view short breaks outside of the family home) is recommended to en-sure that children's emotional and social needs are not marginalised by professionals concentrating on their health or on their parents' needs. A separate research review of the needs of siblings in their own right would be advisable to ensure that they are also able to achieve the outcomes specified for all children in the 2004 Children Act. 3.3.2 How d oe s research evidence compare with the findings of the consultation? As stated above, many aspects of 'ordinary life' featured both in the research literature and in the consultation as things that matter most for children and young people with CHCN and their families. 3.3 .2.1 Issues of manner and mechanism, process and outcome In certain respects differences seemed to relate to the framing of issues rather than constituting contradictions in substance. Things that mat-ter in the consultation were sometimes articulated more as matters of process as opposed to the outcome focus of research. For example, the importance of relations with family and friends and access to play and leisure activities were highlighted in both parts of the review. The themes they fall under in each, however, are significantly different: 'people and relationships' in the consultation in contrast to 'emotional wellbeing' in the research review. The consultation generally framed issues with an emphasis to the 'how' or the 'manner' of service delivery as opposed to the mechanisms. For example, flexibility and responsiveness were highlighted in both as matters of importance to families. In the consultation this was a theme in its own right, in contrast to the research review in which these issues featured under 'assistance with and breaks from caring' and 'service coordination'. Consequently, certain priorities stood out more strongly in the con- sultation, compared with the research literature. These include:\u0018\u0018Research review the importance of friends for children the nature of relationships between professionals and families when and where health needs should be met enabling children to have a positive sense of themselves. While these aspects do appear in the research review, they do so among a number of important themes rather than being one of a few key themes in the consultation.Conversely, the weight given to systemic difficulties and solutions in service delivery in the research review tended not to be highlighted in the consultation. For example, the focus on funding issues in the research was not mirrored in the consultation. Again this seems to be a matter of the framing rather than substance of issues because in both the consultation and research review, families rarely talked about who funds or provides services, other than as another barrier to provision. 3.3 .2.2 A 'family-centred' approach Perhaps the most striking differences between evidence produced through the consultation and that of the research review relates to parents and siblings of children and young people with CHCN. While both highlight how it is parents who provide most daily care for their children, parents in the consultation made little of the constant daily struggle and the high levels of emotional and psychological stress linked to caring for a child with CHCN, that featured strongly in the research review. Parents in the consultation made little of their own support needs, compared with the attention this issue receives in research literature. The only issue in common seems to be that of 'assistance with, and breaks from, caring' that features in both. Yet in the consultation it illustrates one aspect of the 'flexibility and responsiveness' that families want from services rather than being a means of stressing the importance of parental support needs as distinct from that of their children with CHCN or their siblings. In relation to siblings, similarly, evidence from the research litera- ture highlighted the clashes that sometimes occur between the needs of the child with CHCN and those of their siblings. Evidence from the consultation gave a more nuanced picture that indicated that rela-tions between siblings were as mixed as in most families. The positive CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180aspects of siblings' understanding of, involvement in and compassion for their brother/sister with CHCN stood out strongly. Equally, the value of services that included siblings whether in hydro-therapy swimming, art therapy or home-sitting, was also central. While a 'family-centred' approach is advocated in both sets of evi- dence, the consultation evidence seems to emphasise the needs of the family unit over and above the needs of individual family members as individuals, while this emphasis is reversed in the research review find-ings. Clearly this difference speaks to the inevitable tension between a discourse of child-centredness (whether child with CHCN or sibling) and one of family-centredness. Unfortunately the findings from the research and consultation indicate that to date this remains under-ex-plored. 3.3.3 Reconceptualising s oci al care Service provision is based on the assumption of separable needs, for example, health, education, social care, palliative and so on. Yet analysis of definitions of social care needs most commonly used in research litera-ture concerning children with CHCN revealed considerable ambiguity regarding what might constitute social care needs as opposed to health, mental health, social and educational needs. This reinforces the urgent need to reconceptualise 'social care'. The way families talked about their lives in the consultation seemed to require rethinking 'social care' needs as fundamentally linked to some-thing like 'ordinary life'. The findings of the research review corroborate this and, therefore, the potential in reconceptualising social care needs from an 'ordinary needs' or 'ordinary lives' perspective. 3.3.4 Implications f or policy and practice The findings of the research review, therefore, also raise various chal- lenges to current policy and practice that are worth clarifying here. The CHCN are likely to give rise to a range of what, in the cur- rent policy context, are termed 'additional' and 'complex' needs.2, 160 However, both review and consultation also remind us that the primary \u0018\u0018Research review focus must always remain on the ordinary needs of these children if children with CHCN are to lead 'ordinary lives'. Barriers to this derive initially from the CHCN themselves but the research evidence indicates various ways in which they reinforce rather than reduce by current service design and delivery. According to the National Service Framework disabled children's standard services should be coordinated, high-quality and family-centred and based on assessed needs in order to promote social inclusion. Yet the research review indi-cates that crucial practice issues related to implementing and embedding such policy and guidance remain. The research review suggests that the coordination remains prob- lematic, particularly related to funding. Yet the current framework for joint planning and commissioning of services (www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/planningandcommissioning) is silent about the complex service needs of this group of children. Current commitments to ensure better integration of service governance and strategy (www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/deliveringservices/integratedworking/), including joint commis-sioning, urgently need to be prioritised and actualised. Joined-up plan-ning at the level of the individual child and family is needed so that families can access seamless services. Research evidence also indicates that the availability and flexibility of services of adequate, let alone high-quality, also remain problematic due to the lack of suitably trained personnel. The Options for Excellence Review of Social Care recommendations (http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4139958) may go some way towards tackling this in a range of ways if they are realised by the Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC)*, for example, promoting career pathways and formalising and standardising training through an Integrated Qualifications structure. Parents' and foster carers' needs for training, advice and information to prepare them for often highly specialist health procedures so that the * The CWDC is one of five bodies forming the UK Skills for Care and Development Sector Skills Council and coordinates the Children's Workforce Network. It aims to ensure that the people working with children have the best possible training, qualifications, support and advice.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018child can be safely cared for in a family setting are also recognised in the Options for Excellence recommendations and must be pursued. As indicated earlier, the research review draws attention to the in- herent tensions at the heart of a 'family-centred' approach. Much more needs to be known about this area if it is to benefit children and young people with CHCN and their families. Lastly, research evidence suggests strongly that the value of basing services on assessed needs is significantly diluted if it is not backed up by universal or eligibility criteria.\u0018\u00184 Practice survey 4.1 Methodology To supplement the research review, the practice survey aimed to identify development work, knowledge and examples of good practice in meeting the needs of children with CHCN and their families. If there is normally a dialogue between the research review and the practice survey in SCIE knowledge reviews, the question of how best to conceptualise social care needs and services at the heart of this particular review required an even more direct connection between different parts, as described below. 4.1.1 Conceptualising ' good practice' Undertaking a practice survey in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to identify services and settings that have made progress on meeting the social care needs of children with CHCN and their families required us first to define 'good practice'. We used findings from the consultation to do this. The practice survey used information gathered from this consulta- tion to define the 'good practice' examples of service provision that we subsequently set out to identify. The key criteria that emerged from the consultation included services that: demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness to the individual needs of families; recognised the ordinary needs of children and families as crucially important; worked in partnership with families, valuing their knowledge and expertise;CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018 worked with wider networks, including family, friends, other services and settings. We excluded services that focused only on one member of the family, who worked only in one setting, or who defined their role as solely clinical. This is not to say there is no place for such targeted services, but our focus was on services who were responding flexibly to the needs of whole families. We also wanted to locate services that had found ways to actively safeguard families' ordinary needs. During the course of the review, we learnt more about families' expe- riences and the barriers they faced in getting their ordinary needs met, in getting the support that would allow them to lead 'ordinary lives'. Consequently, it seemed clear that defining 'good practice' in terms of meeting children's complex needs in ways that least disrupt their ordinary needs no longer seemed adequate. Instead, it became clear that 'good practice' required meeting children's complex needs in ways that actively safeguard their ordinary needs, and those of their families. Lack of dis-ruption to ordinary needs was not enough, because the barriers faced by families in getting their ordinary needs met were so formidable. 4.1.2 Identifying s er vices We gathered information about a wide range of services in our con- sultations with families and our original plan was to use this input to identify examples of 'good practice'. However, this raised challenges in terms of maintaining the anonymity of participants, given that we were targeting such a specific group of children. Consequently, we decided to widen the search base for services by advertising our search on a range of national electronic forums in order that the services identified were no longer exclusively in the areas from which families taking part in the consultation were drawn. We followed up as many of these services as possible and selected eight that fulfilled the criterion of 'good practice' detailed above. 4.1.3 Data c oll ection We spoke in person to a senior or lead person of every service, and read a range of information produced by the service. For almost all, we spoke \u0018\u0018Practice survey directly to at least one family who had used the service. Where possible we met with some or all of the staff team, read internal and independent research about the service, gathered views and stories from families and staff, spoke to commissioners and referrers as well as reading published books and materials. We had hoped that our descriptions of initiatives would cover the background and aims, how they work, what has been learnt, what made them work and their general ability to fit other settings or localities. However, confidentiality issues arose that prevented us from providing this level of detail - as we explain below. 4.2 About the services The eight selected services are provided very differently: from within the NHS (3) local authorities (1) voluntary organisations (4). Some of the voluntary organisations are contracted by statutory authori- ties; some are independent. All the services offer direct provision of some kind to families. They serve very different areas: primarily rural (2) primarily urban (2) mixed (3) national (1). Five are in England, one in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and one works across the UK. All of the services are multidisciplinary, but across an extremely wide range of disciplines: medical, nursing, care, social work, advocacy, fi-nancial and employment advice. Several of the services have volunteers within the teams. There are, no doubt, other services across England, Wales and Northern Ireland that respond flexibly to families' needs, some because this is their designated function, others because individual staff have CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018identified the need for flexibility and responsiveness in their direct work with a family. The methodology adopted by the review team to identify services obviously restricted the services potentially included. Therefore, our selection of eight is not meant to imply that these are the only eight. Below are brief descriptions of the eight services and the features that we found most significant for each.

As stated earlier, input from families involved in the consultation had been used to define 'good practice' and families themselves had identified some of these services as positive examples of good practice. However, matching up the themes that had emerged in the consultation with their working practices turned out to be a far from straightforward exercise. Far from exemplars of organisational arrangements that allowed pro- fessionals and carers to operate in the flexible manner, responding to the individual needs of the child and the family as a whole , as children with CHCN and their families had told us they needed, many of these services faced significant difficulties in doing what they deemed necessary to do. Speaking to people of the various services brought things to the surface that hindered their good practice as much as things that helped. In spite CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180\u0018of the evident dedication, skill and responsiveness of staff to individual and familial need, it proved impossible to use these services to build up a model or models of best practice. 4.2.2 Things th a t help: common features of good practice Despite the difference in purpose and structure of these services, some common features were evident. Across all services, there were similarities in ways that children with CHCN and their families were imagined, that helped in the nature and manner of service provision. Firstly, families were perceived as competent experts. Secondly, there was common acknowledgement of the child and family as partners in defining need. Crucially, many of the services placed a high value on individual rela- tionships and actively recognised and accommodated different aspects of a child and family's identity. What helped notably, in this regard, was the delegation of autonomy to frontline staff. Equally, the inclusion, within the function of the service, of tasks such as 'navigating', 'signposting', 'wayfinding', 'advocating' or 'keyworking' also proved helpful. 4.2.3 Things t ha t hinder: common barriers to good practice Pertinently, not one of the eight services defined its focus as wholly about 'social care'. Indeed, 'social care' is specifically mentioned in the description of only two of the services. However, when asked, all agreed that meeting social care needs was an essential part of their role. This turned out to be more than a simple issue of terminology. We were surprised by how many examples of helpful service interventions seemed to involve people 'jumping the system' in some way: many people providing and managing the services spoke openly with us about 'break-ing the rules' to meet families' needs. For example, as one professional explained of another: 'Not sure how wide her brief is. She wasn't really supposed to take his brother too. Technically not meant to use the system like this. Didn't put that on the timesheet. Bent the rules. Looked the other way. There are always special circumstances. We didn't put that on the timesheet \u00180\u0018either. Some of what we do would be seen as an unacceptable risk ... but what the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve over.' Parents were also aware of this 'rule-breaking' behaviour: 'She told me what to put on the form so we'd be eligible. It wasn't exactly in her job description. He was only meant to work in our house, not at the park. You could see she wanted to get around the system for us. He didn't exactly break the rules....' 'What we do is a sort of informal exclusion, ie I just take him home if school ring up and he goes back the next day or the day after ... technically not supposed to use the system like this ... but it works fairly well.' '... well the school ring me if they know they have a lot of kids off with a bug and then I keep him home.... We're not meant to do that but it works.' Commissioner/provider divisions were often deemed to hinder their work. Many services were navigating complex commissioning arrange-ments on behalf of individual families, and struggled with contracts focusing on specific needs (usually clinical) when they saw that what families needed was much wider than this. Other services had moved towards rewriting the rules of their own service but were finding these actions blocked by commissioning agencies. Another factor that hindered good practice in service provision was the fragility of teams due to short-term funding arrangements. The services selected were not particularly well resourced and many of them have uncertain futures and are dependent on funding that is time limited or renewable annually. This was reported as a major stressor for services, and obviously impacts directly on the continuity and familiarity that matters so much to families. There was awareness among many work-ers and families using the services that resources are not infinite - for example, families recognising the need to have services cancelled to allow crisis intervention for others as well as the need for creative use of volunteers in programmes.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u00180\u0018The sensitive nature of the difficulties faced by these service provid- ers caused a serious conundrum: how to write about these difficulties without compromising providers' anonymity. The result is a broad-brush stroke of practice provided in the tables above, as opposed to the detailed examples we had hoped to provide. 4.3 Conclusions The practice survey confirmed that examples do exist of services that demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness to the individual needs of children with CHCN and their families, use ordinary life criteria to define needs and work in partnership with families as well as working with wider networks of family, friends, other services and settings. Common features of these services included: families were perceived as competent experts; the child and family were acknowledged as partners in defining need; a high value was placed on individual relationships; different aspects of a child and family's identity were actively recog-nised and accommodated; autonomy was delegated to frontline staff; high levels of flexibility and responsiveness were provided; tasks such as 'navigating', 'signposting', 'wayfinding', 'advocating' or 'keyworking' were included within the function of the service; volunteers were creatively used within programmes. Our consultation work identified what helps and what gets in the way of providing the kinds of services that children with CHCN and their families told us they needed. This section, in contrast, has highlighted some points about what helps and what hinders from service providers' perspectives. Three key and common barriers were identified. Firstly, the mismatch between the formal remit of these providers and the actual services that neither social care needs nor services were formally acknowledged. Secondly, commissioning arrangements and associated contracts further led to social care needs and services being overlooked and restricted the power of service providers to redress this imbalance. Lastly, short-term \u00180\u0018Practice survey funding arrangements featured as a barrier to good practice impacting on the continuity of service provision and familiarity with professionals that matters so much to families. 4.3.1 Implications fo r policy and practice Although we engaged only with a very small sample of service providers, taken together with the findings of the consultation, our analysis gives a strong indication of the difference between policy and guidance on the one hand, and practice on the ground on the other. The difficulties faced by this sample of services that are attempting to deliver innovatively raises important questions about where responsibil-ity for developing services lies in current commissioning arrangements. Furthermore, it suggests a need to go back to the drawing board in relation to commissioning services in order firstly, to enable flexibility and responsiveness to be built in at the service design stage. Secondly, planners and commissioners need to explore creative solutions that would allow the adaptation of temporal aspects of service provision for children with CHCN and their families. Minimally, it identifies the need for further research from a service design and delivery perspective.\u00180\u00185 Overall conclusions As explored in the introduction, this knowledge review took place in a rapidly evolving policy context. During the consultation and research review a number of significant policy initiatives and guidance relating to provision for children with CHCN and their families were launched. Others, as stated in the introduction, were published subsequently so we are unable to address them here. We looked at four sources of government guidance that apply to all children: Every Child Matters 6 National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services2 Common Assessment Framework4 the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge for the Children's Workforce (2005) 164 keyworking and multiagency and integrated services. We also looked at five sources of government guidance that apply specifi-cally to children with CHCN: National Service Framework Standard 8 on Disabled children and young people and those with complex needs 160 Complex disability - Exemplar11 For the NHS Commissioners commissioning children and young people's palliative care services9 Including me10 Finally we looked at three sources of recent guidance from non-govern-ment bodies: A guide to the development of children's palliative care services 161CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u00180 A Framework for the development of integrated multi-agency care path- ways for children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions162 Direct experience163 Much of this emphasised the need for improved coordination and multiagency working. As a body of guidance it is strong on child and family-centred care, on social inclusion in a general sense and on flex-ible, responsive services built around family needs. There is also much guidance on meeting children's health needs in a more integrated and coordinated way, often through keyworking. Thus, there was a high level of compatibility with the priorities identified through this knowledge review. However, the knowledge base relating to the social care needs of children with CHCN raises some challenges to current policy and guidance and suggests that certain issues remain overlooked. In this concluding chapter, we summarise key findings from the knowledge review, drawing together the messages for practice improve-ment by elucidating the implications for policy, practice and research. 5.1 Impact of research and consultation-based evidence 5.1.1 What matters most? The findings of the research review are consistent with those of the consultation in terms of what matters most to children and young people with CHCN and their families. In particular both verify that children with CHCN have the same 'ordinary' wishes and needs as other children, that is, to live at home with their families, go to school, spend time with their friends and participate in leisure and community activities with family and peers. Yet getting 'ordinary' things remains extraordinarily difficult. Barriers derive initially from the CHCN themselves but also from the service system and its responses (this issue is addressed further below [[where?]] ). Relationships with family and friends were extremely important to all children and young people consulted. These were closely linked to issues of individuality and identity, that is, 'being who you are'. Research findings indicated that relationships were strongly linked to emotional wellbeing. The priority given to these issues by children and young \u0018\u0018\u0018Conclusions people is not matched in current practice or guidance and this needs to be addressed. The urgency of practicalities for children with CHCN and their families was also evident in research and the consultation. These in-cluded accessing facilities, getting the right equipment and securing the necessary finances. Many families report increased financial hardship with the majority of mothers giving up paid work while the need for home adaptations, house moves and equipment, among others, create additional costs. The issue of both organisational competence and clinical competence is a further concern for children with CHCN and their families. Staff recruited to carry out aspects of care requiring specialist skills can lack the necessary training or qualification needed to provide that specialised intervention. Organisations providing care in this environment may not recognise the need, or lack the resources, to train staff in order to offer the level and range of skill needed. 5.1.2 Reconceptualising ' soc ial care' needs and allocation of agency responsibility The research review and consultation clearly demonstrate that catego- rising the needs of children with CHCN and their families according to service provision is deeply problematic. 'Social care' needs are very difficult to disentangle for this group of children and young people. Their healthcare needs are so much a part of their everyday lives that dividing their needs into different categories is untenable. Moreover, the wider needs of children and families are likely to be inextricably linked, including emotional, educational, financial as well as health and social care needs. Concomitantly, professional roles and boundaries are often and necessarily blurred, that is, 'social care' needs are not necessarily met by social care agencies and 'healthcare' needs are not necessarily met by health services. This issue speaks to the very foundations of service provision and practice. Much research, policy, guidance and practice is based on the assumption of separable needs. The model of 'divided thinking' is so entrenched that it is difficult to step back and see the needs and experi-ences of children with CHCN and their families differently.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018\u0018The knowledge review has not settled these definitional problems and perhaps it should not be expected to have done so. The knowledge base suggests instead that the 'needs' of children and young people with CHCN and their families are simply not amenable to rigid classifica-tion. The review does, however, suggest the potential of understanding 'social care' from an ordinary life or ordinary needs perspective. The use of 'ordinary life' or 'ordinary needs' criteria, to determine needs and attendant services, therefore, requires further exploration. 5.1.3 Putting a n end to the struggle If key definitions are not amenable to rigid classification and professional roles and boundaries are necessarily blurred, negotiation both between families and agencies and between agencies themselves is inevitable. Yet protracted boundary and funding disputes between agencies and delays in the provision of vital services, hospital discharge and school inclusion remain common. Despite evidence of good practice in the consultation, families still often experience services as sources of frustra-tion and despair, rather than support and solace; notions of 'fighting' and 'struggling' are ubiquitous. Families talk about 'taking on the system' and there is an urgent need to replace the adversarial approach that this implies. Disagreement and negotiation need to be built into service planning and provision in such a way as to be attentive to quality of process as well as outcomes. There are some indications that families are experiencing benefits from coordinated planning and the keyworker approach, in that it re-duces the pressure of coordination on families. However, efforts are required to ensure that keyworking does not simply relocate the problem and further marginalise families' participation by relocating the problem one step away from them. Further consideration needs to be given to the particular competen- cies that keyworking for children with CHCN and their families might require, due to the complexity of both families' needs and the service sys-tem itself. Effective key working for these young people requires engage-ment with families' emotional needs as well as their practical day-to-day needs. It requires respect for people as full citizens with rights but also as people living extraordinary lives who can be distressed, exhausted, angry, frightened and lonely. This presupposes personal engagement with, and \u0018\u0018\u0018Conclusions commitment to, children and families. The best ways to support this in practice require further attention. Lastly, caution is needed to ensure that the benefits of keyworking do not distract attention from systemic difficulties that keyworking is not able to address. These include the complexity of funding sources and statutory responsibilities, eligibility criteria for services and geographical differences in service provision. 5.1.4 A f amily-centred approach: flexibility and re sponsiveness A 'family-centred' approach received strong empirical support from research and consultation. While in principle this approach considers the needs of all family members, including siblings, both as individuals and as a unit, the consultation evidence seems to emphasise the needs of the family unit over and above the needs of individual family members as individuals, while this emphasis is reversed in the research review findings. This speaks to the inevitable tension between child-centred and family-centred practice, including the potentially conflicting needs of siblings, which remains under-researched. Further documentation and exploration of this issue is needed in order to provide practitioners with examples of good strategic work in action. In the research and the consultation, flexibility and responsiveness were heavily emphasised in families' accounts of service provision that would enable them to get on with ordinary life individually and to-gether. This related to a range of issues, including control and direct access to services, where and when health needs should be met, the accommodation of family events, preferences and emergencies and the roles/responsibilities of any one professional. The question of how such flexibility and responsiveness can be built into care plans and provision from the beginning is vital. The current allocation of services only to specific individuals rather than families creates difficulties, for example, siblings being excluded from childcare arrangements or play or leisure opportunities. This ur-gently needs to be redressed. Current service configuration rarely allows for the blurring of profes- sional roles and boundaries that children with CHCN and their families CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018\u0018prefer and a way out of this impasse is required. The question of how such role expansion can be accommodated and supported needs attention. Inadequate or irrelevant policies, staff training, supervision and sup- port to facilitate the requisite flexibility are also evidenced, creating a lack of clarity about workers' responsibility and confusion about ac-countability. These issues need to be clearly identified and addressed organisationally as well as individually in each child's plan. Meeting parental support needs can enable them to cope longer term and consequently promotes child-focused outcomes. Research indicates a variety of opinion on the part of parents as to the pros and cons of different kinds of assistance with and breaks from caring, including home-based services (such as additional nursing, ancillary care and sit-ting services), those within alternative family settings and institutionally based breaks. In the face of such a diversity of opinions in the evidence, a flexible approach that respects individual parents and children's wishes is required. Much more needs to be known about children's views and preferences about short breaks, and methods for genuinely involving children in decisions about services need to be developed, particularly young children and children with impairments of communication or understanding. 5.1.5 Manner, s ty le and duration of service delivery For children and families alike there is strong evidence that the way in which professionals provide services is as important as the service itself: the manner, approach, emotional availability and sensitivity, levels of respect and understanding. There was strong research evidence that parents feel emotionally supported by helpful and compassionate rela-tionships. Children and their families greatly valued familiarity with professionals and home care providers. The interpersonal skills impli-cated in manner and style of delivery need to be formally recognised, supervised and appraised. Temporal aspects of social care delivery also came across strongly. Findings indicate that families need services that can respond rapidly when they are in crisis but they also need services on which they can rely over longer periods of time. Families valued services that were \"robust\" and \"in it for the long term\" and wanted services that could continue even when their child's needs changed, rather than having to keep changing \u0018\u0018\u0018Conclusions the team or the service. Combining continuity, familiarity and flexibility is very important to families. This combination is currently hampered by a lack of resources, fragile, temporary funding arrangements, restric-tive eligibility criteria and short-term allocation of services and creative solutions are imperative. 5.1.6 Preparing p ar ents to provide specialist care Parents, willingly or under pressure, become the primary carers for most children with CHCN that requires them to have a level of skills and some very specialised techniques, normally in the province of medical staff. Research indicates that insufficient, inadequate and sometimes contradictory training, information and practical advice is given to parents about daily, specialist care giving tasks and how to respond to emergencies. This training needs to attend to the socio-emotional effects as well as medical procedures involved. Introductory materials available as leaflets, booklets or through the internet need to be substantiated by case-specific verbal explanations and advice, through helplines and keyworkers. Mutual advice/information sharing and local parent sup-port groups are found useful. 5.2 Impact of practice-based findings 5.2.1 Common features of good practice The practice survey confirmed that examples do exist of services that demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness to the individual needs of chil-dren with CHCN and their families, use ordinary life criteria to define needs, work in partnership with families as well as working with wider networks of family, friends, other services and settings. Such examples need to be recognised, disseminated and praised. Common features of these services included: families were perceived as competent experts; the child and family were acknowledged as partners in defining need; a high value was placed on individual relationships;CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018\u0018 different aspects of a child and family's identity were actively recog- nised and accommodated; autonomy was delegated to frontline staff; high levels of flexibility and responsiveness were provided; tasks such as 'navigating', 'signposting', 'wayfinding', 'advocating' or 'keyworking' were included within the function of the service; volunteers were creatively used within programmes. It would be useful to share aspects of good practice more widely. 5.2.2 The i nv isibility of social care work The most important finding from the practice survey, from the point of view of planners, commissioners and managers, is bound to be the invisibility of the 'social care' services provided across a whole range of professions. Of the eight services identified in the practice survey, only two specifically mentioned social care in the description of their services and then, not as a sole focus. However, when asked, people providing and managing the services all agreed that meeting social care needs was an essential, albeit formally unacknowledged, part of their role. This disjuncture between the formal and actual nature of services provided is demonstrated by accounts of workers 'breaking the rules' or exceeding the specified remit of their role in order to meet families' needs. We were told about individual staff who, for example, worked additional hours; switched hours around; undertook tasks that were not in their job description; or worked in places where they were not meant to be working. At the extreme, we learnt about a worker who moved between three different organisations in order to 'follow' a child whose needs were changing. This suggests the need for managers to find out whether such a dis- juncture exists within their own agencies in order to ensure that formal roles and remits are adequate to the tasks at hand, that is, to check that the job specifications that their staff work to designed to be broad enough to meet the needs of children with CHCN and their families and leave scope for staff to respond flexibly.\u0018\u0018\u0018Conclusions 5.2.3 Power and responsibility in commissioning arrangements Linked to the finding about the invisibility of social care service provi- sion, many of the services in the practice survey felt that their hands were effectively tied due to current commissioning practices. Many services were navigating complex commissioning arrangements on behalf of individual families, and struggled with contracts focusing on specific needs (usually clinical) when they saw that what families needed was much wider than this. Other services had moved towards rewriting the rules of their own service but were finding these actions blocked by commissioning agencies. There is an urgent need to find ways out of these kinds of impasse. In broad terms, the findings raise important questions related to commissioning practices. Planners and commissioners urgently need to consider the following: How can services be commissioned so as to enable flexibility and responsiveness to be built in at the service design stage? Where does responsibility for developing services lie in commission-ing arrangements? Are there feedback loops in place to allow commissioners to learn from service providers in order to improve practice? 5.2.4 Temporal a sp ects of service delivery and financial challenges As with most services, the practice survey also found that these services for children with CHCN and their families were not particularly well re-sourced. While attempting to provide services upon which families could rely over longer periods of time, these services often had to be cancelled to allow crisis intervention for others. Short-term funding arrangements were found to compound the difficulties they faced in trying to provide the continuity of services and familiarity of staff that matters so much to families. This suggests that planners and commissioners need to explore creative solutions that would allow the adaptation of temporal aspects of service provision for children with CHCN and their families.CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES' SERVICES \u0018\u0018\u00185.3 Implications for further research One of the key findings of this review is the gap in our knowledge base about social care service provision for children with CHCN and their families. While the medical field is continually reflecting current practice and includes progressive work being carried out with children with CHCN and their families, there is much less published research from a social care service design and delivery perspective or about the social care aspects of other professionals' work. SCIE's practice surveys are designed to redress this. Yet, in this knowl- edge review, rather than providing models of good practice, the survey surfaced major barriers (as detailed earlier). The methodology adopted by the review team to identify services also restricted the services potentially included. Therefore, the question of whether there are any services that are explicitly set up to enable professionals and paid carers to operate in the flexible and family-centred manner that families want, remains un-answered. Research into such services should be a matter of urgency. Equally, further research is needed into the process and impact of change and modernisation as it affects services for children with CHCN and their families, particularly joint funding procedures and keyworkers and/or lead professionals. The impact of short-term funding on service provision for children with CHCN and their families could also usefully be investigated. As the research review demonstrated, further research is also need- ed about the views of children with CHCN themselves, particularly younger children and those with the most complex needs. If this holds generally, the research review also identified the specific need for further empirical research regarding: children's views of their emotional needs and services to meet those needs children's views on short breaks outside the family home. Research is clearly also required into the needs of minority ethnic families with a child with CHCN and models of service that appropriately and effectively meet the cultural and language needs. \u0018\u0018\u0018Conclusions A separate research review of the needs of siblings in their own right is recommended. 5.4 Research and practice: how do they match up? Due to the difficulties faced in identifying service-level examples of good practice, the question of how research and practice match up cannot be answered with any certainty. As stated above, further research is urgently needed on the social care aspects of service design and delivery for children with CHCN and their families, particularly progressive work being carried out. Without this we cannot ascertain whether or not practice is outstripping research in finding ways to overcome the various challenges to service provision for children with CHCN that have been identified in the knowledge review. What the knowledge base does seem to indicate is less a mismatch between research and practice than one between policy and guidance on the one hand and practice on the other. Policy and guidance across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, all seem to be strong on child and family-centred care, on social inclusion in a general sense and on flexible, responsive services built around family needs. There is also much emphasis on meeting children and families' needs in a more coordinated fashion, often through keyworking. Crucial practice is-sues related to implementing and embedding such policy and guidance, therefore, remain. Conversely, as stated earlier, there seems to be relatively little in the available guidance about some of the other priorities identified in the consultation, in particular about the importance of friends for children, about the nature of relationships between professionals and families, about when and where health needs should be met and about enabling children to have a positive sense of themselves.\u0018\u0018\u0018References 1 DfES (Department for Education and Skills) and DH (Department of Health) (2003) Together from the start: Practical guidance for pro- fessionals working with disabled children (from birth to third birth-day) and their families , Early Support Programme, London: DfES and DH (http://www.earlysupport.org.uk/modResourcesLibrary/HtmlRenderer/Makingadifference.html). 2 DH (Department of Health) and DfES (Department for Education an d Skills) (2004) National Service Framework for children, young people and maternity services , London: DH and DfES. 3 Audit Commission (2003) Se rvices for disabled children: A review of services for disabled children and their families , London: Audit Commission. 4 DfES (Department for Education and Skills) (2007) Co mmon Assessment Framework for children and young people: Practitioners' and managers' guide: Integrated working to improve outcomes chil-dren and young people , London: DfES. 5 DfES (Department for Education and Skills) e Children's Act 2004 , London: DfES (www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/children- actreport/#2004). 6 DfES for Education and Skills) (2004) Eve ry Child Matters: Change for children , London: DfES. 7 PMSU (Prime Minister's Strategy Unit) (2005) Im proving the life chances of disabled people , London: DH (www.cabinetoffice.gov. uk/strategy/work_areas/disability/). 8 DfES (Department for Education and Skills) (2006) Im plementing the Disability Discrimination Act in schools and early years settings , London: DfES. 9 DH (Department of Health) (2005) Fo r the NHS Commissioners commissioning children and young people's palliative care services: A practical guide Carlin, J.

No gender difference in self-worth was identified, but it was found to be important that parents continue to have ongoing input into supporting the child, even into early adulthood. Perceived social support from friends and parental support and social support from friends are likely to lead to higher self-worth.Social workers should aim to play a long-term role in the family life of these young people, and devote attention to supporting the parental relationship rather than emphasising the child's independence to the exclusion of that relationship.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Atkin and Ahmad (\u0018000 ) \u0018\u0018\u0018.

Semi-structured int erviews with \u0018\u0018 parents/guardians. Because of the nature of the medical condition, these are non-white familiesImplication that outcomes for children are dependent on their parent's ability to cope. Bad experiences with professionals regarding inappropriate care made coping far more difficult, due to losing trust in workers. Consequent anxiety was not necessarily associated with over-protectiveness. Where there was language difficulties, husbands, children and siblings were often placed in the position of 'gatekeeper' and had to translate difficult medical information for mothers. This was distressing and unhelpful.Coping supported by:\u0018. Man aging and achieving mastery over the condition most common. \u0018. Par ent emphasising the normal aspects of the child's experience. \u0018. Reli gion, as long as this did not cause stereotyping; policy makers must ensure that racism is not codified in policy. \u0018. Sup portive worker (particularly keyworker) who instilled trust, and provided information, emotional support, and help with finances and benefits; particularly important where there was no wider family. These need to be culturally sensitive, ie in terms of language. The nature of the illnesses meant that at times parents were engulfed by the conditions. However, this was seen to be temporary; coping strategies shifted as necessary service commissioners and health professionals need to identify and sustain parents' coping strategies\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Barbarin et al (\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018) \u0018\u0018To examine prevalence of maladjustment in psychosocial functioning among \u0018\u0018\u0018 poor urban children aged \u0018 -\u0018\u0018 with sickle cell anaemia (SCA), and investigate its relationship to age, gender, family income, and severity of illnessExploration of variables within domains of psychosocial functioning, with age, gender, income and illness severity. Data from pre-existing structured interviews from psychosocial assessments by medical or social work staff; log-linear analysis; North AmericaSocial relations, isolation and shyness are of particular concern for these children, at least in the opinions of their parents. Frequency of academic problems higher than in studies of comparable non-ill populations.Severity of pain was positively correlated with frequency of depression or psychological problems. Many parents have unrealistic levels of fear about the child's illness, which could potentially colour their appraisal of the child's capabilities and lead them to limit the child's activities.Family functioning, however, was found to be generally positive, suggesting that these families coped well overall with the strain of chronic illness.Psycho-educational work should be undertaken with families to reduce fears and promote a more realistic assessment of the child's capabilities.

It was on their own terms and without the same social niceties that needed to be upheld in face-to-face support. It was 'a link to the outside world' - important as many found it hard to get out because of their caring responsibilities.Advised that caregivers need to be provided with internet access at home to improve their self-help coping strategies. Workers should find out what IPSGs are available and then have them ready to recommend to parents who have access to a computer/internet. However, practitioners should note that there are can be drawbacks in terms of emotional overload, misinformation and people selling products or therapy via the groups.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Diehl et al (\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018) \u00180A state-wide needs assessment as part of the Special Children, Special Care Project in Florida, designed to develop a training programme for people who care for children with CHCNNot intervention-based; qualitative; focus ions per group, six sites; data analysed through ethnographic and content analysis; North America basedChildren's developmental, emotional and educational needs were often ignored or downplayed by professionals in favour of medical needs.

Equipment needs.The care of the child needed to be shared in the family in order to hold the family structure together. Difficulties were getting time away from caring to go out as a family, and financial stress. Parents need to have their expertise and parenting role acknowledged, and expressed frustration and anger at being dealt with 'disrespectfully' by professionals. Professional must treat parents with respect. Some parents needed to talk about their grief at their child's coming death, but found it difficult to find a listener, or time to do so as the child's needs increased. Support groups immensely helpful in enabling parents to deal with emotional issues.Training was considered essential but was often far too sparse and \u0018\u0018% of the parents received no training at all. Many complained about the lack of information they had been given, about their child's needs or condition, about funding, about using equipment.All the family suffered from lack of public acceptance of the child with CHCN, which caused embarrassment or anger for family members. Some extended family members were afraid of the child, limiting receipt of help.Siblings had to bear with the situation, and parents reported their jealousy, suicidal feelings, and fear of medical procedures as a result of living with a sibling with CHCN.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Edwards et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018\u0018To examine outcomes for tracheostomy-dependent, ventilation-using children, and discuss the complexities of home discharge for \u0018\u0018, of whom \u0018 awaiting dischargeNaturally occurring intervention (discharge home from hospital), and descriptive report; no comparison; basic descriptive statistics; UKDifficulties recruiting suitably trained staff, funding delays and unsuitable housing were found to be the most significant factors hindering discharge. Families were generally found to be committed and capable regarding their children's care. Greater efforts are needed to ensure adequate staffing, possibly using agency care in the interim. Alternative systems of funding are needed to facilitate discharge. Changes to grant eligibility assessment for housing alterations may help to reduce the difficulties associated with unsuitable housing, given the difficulty of finding alternative accommodation.

Data analysis using the 'framework approach'; UKTechnological devices for children with complex healthcare needs improve quality of life, but are also disruptive to family and social life.Greater provision of respite care (trained workers) in the home outside school hours, and breaks away from home for the family, are emphasised as important unmet needs (parents need the opportunity to sleep).Multiagency care planning and a single key worker are also recommended to streamline contact with services.Siblings must also be considered within a holistic view of the family.Better organisation will allow the child more time for educational, play and social activities, which should be 'a pri ority for their development and wellbeing' (p \u0018\u0018 ). There should be greater provision of out-of-hours trained workers for respite work, and assistance should be provided to allow families to take breaks away from home.Practitioners need to devote effort to multiagency working. A designated keyworker is recommended.Families must be seen more holistically, so that the needs of siblings are not neglected.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Jackson et al (\u001800\u0018) \u00180\u0018To assess the psychosocial impact on children and their families of Craniopharyngioma and to evaluate the extent to which existing services had been able to meet the needs of familiesMain project is described as 'multi-method' but this reports qualitative data arising from it.

Also, even if a child appears to be coping well, their parents may not be. Diagnosis period particularly stressful, particularly with rare conditions that often required parents to insist on further tests. Stressful from learning about the illness and how to care for the child. Professionals' failure to provide information about condition and services in useful way a significant contributor to stress. Parents thought the effects on them of their child's condition were greater than on their child. Children, however, were reported to be often afraid of treatments (injections and surgery). Impacts on the family changed over time depending on the stage of the illness so needs reassessing. Financial impact often greatest to start, with travelling costs mentioned and hospital-based accommodation for parents. Most families in the sample had remained \"close and supportive\" throughout the illness - only one couple had separated, and another reported strife in first six months. Siblings were said to be affected in terms of behaviour, school grades, and teasing about their sibling's condition or appearance.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Jardine et al (\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018) \u0018\u0018\u0018To of ch ildren, 0- \u0018\u0018, requiring long-term ventilation in the UK and to establish their underlying diagnoses and needs Quantitative questionnaire sur vey; \u0018\u0018 responses by consultants cov ering \u0018\u0018\u0018 children; basic descriptive statistics; UKIt was found that it is possible to care for children dependent on ventilatory support at home, and that this is happening to an increasing extent.

Children can be cared for at home effectively by parents if multiagency professional support is properly commissioned and provided. However, obtaining services is not straightforward with lengthy disputes between health authorities and social services departments over responsibility for funding short breaks, equipment, medication and home workers with local interpretation/variation in services. Needs advanced planning. Joint funding most effective. Short break services often inappropriate or inadequate because of nature of nursing care needed, eg no night sitting available, family-based care only found in one case. Main support for families was provision of home (and school) care during day or overnight to provide break or to support parents eg where medical needs intensive. Use of non-professional staff acceptable to parents. Arrangements for provision of equipment stressful and unreliable with poor link up between hospital and community services. Services rarely coordinated at operational level. Few families had designated key worker/care manager. Parents often left coordinating services. Created extra pressures. Poorly coordinated discharge planning and beyond so families complained of being visited by too many professionals, undermining ordinary family life and confusing over roles/responsibilities. Communication reactive/problem-focused. Parents over-relied on to pass on information.

Continuity of support was important as it removed the need for parents to continually prove their expertise. Emotional support consisted of having an accessible person who parents knew that they could turn to, being able to talk to that person to share worries and anxieties, and promotion of confidence and reassurance in their abilities to care. Practical support involved advocacy, to help parents to obtain services and benefits needed, 'hands-on' support, which was helpful when available but because of the complexity of the procedures and technologies was sometimes lacking, and the organisation of services and equipment. Provision of practical equipment and services that would provide parents with a break from caring, was most problematic. Parents had to take on a coordination role to ensure they were obtained in time - an additional burden. Provision of information and advice was often inadequate.Attention should be paid to the lead professional or key worker role in order to provide a single point of coordination, support, listening, and advice for parents. This would provide continuity of service, provision of supplies and improve access to short breaks. Professionals need to be reflective of their own strengths and limitations, and be willing to acknowledge and support expert parents in their caring duties.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Kirk and Glendinning (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018To explore the experiences of families caring at home for a technology dependent child; and identify perceived problems and good practice in the purchasing, delivery and coordination of services Qualitative study using semi-structured int erviews with \u0018\u0018 parents of children with CHCN and \u0018\u0018 p rofessionals involved with the family.

On discharge, parents assume 'responsibility for highly technical procedures that would formerly have only been undertaken by qualified pro fessionals' (p \u0018\u0018\u0018 ). They felt that this was not recognised explicitly or negotiated as it should have been. Parents often had to assume roles that they felt unprepared for, ie painful processes for their child. Felt there was an unspoken assumption about the clinical duties involved without any negotiation for the emotionally stressful aspects of caring. Parents felt that their lives were dominated by caring duties, and that it was difficult to get a break from them due to lack of appropriately trained people (friends, family or other) to take their place. Need for short break services. Many parents had given up work in order to become full-time carers - a financial strain. Medicalisation of the home and loss of privacy through equipment, support staff and visits by the professional. Family life revolving around the routines of the technology. This was preferable to parents in the study to having the child based in an institution.

Where agreements existed, discharge became much faster. Sufficient time must be given before discharge to enable supplies and services to be in place. Good coordination and communication between professionals enhanced parents' feelings of support, while being offered information instead of having to seek it out, improved their sense of being in control. The lack of a designated keyworker for families was seen as an impediment. Recommended that a keyworker should be appointed for each child with CHCN. Concerns about a lack of professional clarity about roles and responsibilities, interprofessional communication and lack of service coordination.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Margolan et al (\u001800\u0018) \u00180\u0018\u0018.

Funding for equipment, ongoing care inside the home and at school, and house adaptations was a major issue for all these families and their children. Agencies were unable to agree resource allocation and funding led to the majority of delays to discharge home. Children were often not receiving the education they were entitled to, because of difficulties in agreeing funding for carers between education and health. Joint funding needs to be clearer and the responsibility shouldered and not shoved aside. Keyworkers who can coordinate services and funding for families, as well as provide information and advise, would relieve many stressful situations for families and their children. Parents felt that health professionals had taken them for granted while the child was awaiting discharge, and that training in procedures ignored the emotional side of having to do this to your own child. Nine families received some respite care; the majority found planned respite was inadequate. Because of the complexity of care, extended family and friends were unable to help out unless formally trained. Professionals need to be more aware that families' needs change and require reassessment if families are to stay well.\u0018\u00180CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice McGrath (\u001800\u0018) \u00180\u0018To obtain feedback on the need for a volunteer service for families coping with a child with a life-limiting conditionNot intervention-based.

However, over half of the respondents said that there could be disadvantages to having a volunteer helping, including privacy of the home or shy children, not getting on or the volunteer imposing their own agenda, and the fear of a volunteer's lack of ability and unreliability.

Data analysed from phenomenological view for key themes, and from Pickin's needs framework to see if needs were being met; UKLife as a young 'ventilator-dependent' person was characterised by discrimination, poorly organised and inadequate services, violation of human rights, social exclusion and in many cases inadequate and poor quality education. Funding often a huge obstacle to social inclusion, both in provision of medical equipment that allows the child to be independent as well as safe, in the altering of homes and schools to make them accessible, in the provision of appropriate hospital care when necessary (ie so that children do not have to spend prolonged periods of time in ICUs or adult wards), and in the provision of sufficient and appropriate care at home so that child can be at home with their family, and the SCNs of the family can also be met. Where there were delays to hospital discharge children's basic human needs for attachment, security, communication, friendship, continuity and belonging were not met. Better coordination between services is needed, with clearer guidelines on funding to ensure that responsibility is taken for both health and social care needs.The attitudes of professionals were often a key barrier to children and their families with children often medically objectified by professionals. Their views were not taken into consideration, their education curtailed, their needs for friends and a social life not being responded to. With home care, families felt that carers often imposed their views within the home, laying down unnecessarily strict 'laws' that meant children were not able to do things the carer deemed 'too risky'. Loss of privacy, feeling out of control, not getting on with the carer.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Olsen and Maslin Prothero (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018\u0018To evaluate the views of existing service users of a nurse-led, home-based, respite service for the families of children under five years with CHCN.

Interviews of \u0018\u0018 f amilies at three stages, receiving service ove r \u0018\u0018-month period; framework approach for analysis; UKReceiving respite is important for some families but for many it is one among a variety of factors contributing to family wellbeing. The absence of respite support seen to have little negative impact on those families where the child is getting stronger, achieving some developmental milestones and requiring less hospitalisation. Factors associated with family wellbeing were threefold:\u0018. Chi ld's condition, eg not needing hospital care during period of service \u0018. Ser vice availability, eg attaining age for special nursery \u0018. Other factors, eg better house, parental job security, receipt of welfare benefit. Professionals need to recognise that respite is needed for different purposes - some to support siblings directly or indirectly; differences between wanting a break from the child or 'another pair of hands' alongside to help care (especially where child and parent had been apart because of hospitalisation). Especial need for services to be clear about eligibility (and underpinning value judgements) eg use of respite to support parents working. Tension between spreading service widely and responding quickly to immediate need. Some parents wanted to pre-book and plan others to get flexible/immediate support in response to child's fluctuating health needs or life events. There can be a loss of faith in the service if it is not flexible.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Pownceby (\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018) \u0018\u0018How does cystic fibrosis impact on young people's personal and social lives?

This appears to improve adherence to treatment. Over half the group had not been involved in discussing, decision making or planning around their transfers from child to adult services. In the post-transition group, half had found out through the grapevine rather than through official notification. A more coordinated approach to health and social care needs to be taken. Better transition processes support mental wellbeing, dispel worries and anxieties. Family relationships in terms of caring, cohesiveness and control impact on the young person's perceptions of themselves re loneliness and optimism. Family interventions are warranted to improve treatment adherence and wellbeing of young person and family. Stigma and discrimination are rated worst for young people, being less fit than peers coming second. Many young people will put their social needs above their treatment regime, and a balance can only be achieved by working in partnership with them.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Ray ( \u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018Study is aimed at validating author's conceptual model, PACC (parenting and childhood chronicity), describing the work required to raise a child with a chronic health condition. Aim was to show also that much of the work of parents is not recognised because it moves beyond the medical model of life-sustaining practiceQualitative, interpretive study. Sample of \u00180 int parents regarding the PACC model; North AmericaCaring needs cannot easily be subdivided as changes in one domain often affect the others, therefore services should con sider a wider picture. Caring is a \u0018\u0018 -hour job. Parents had to be constantly on guard for changes to symptoms or problems with equipment. Many accepted that they would have caring responsibility for the rest of the child's life, including social monitoring and providing help with skills and development. The 'invisible' parts of caring (monitoring, balancing chores and time, the administration/advocacy/coordination tasks) need to be acknowledged and taken into account. The more expert parents became in providing these caregiving responsibilities, the more invisible and taken for granted their efforts become until they faltered in their ability to keep up with the workload. Great frustration expressed about the systems in place, seen as a constant struggle, eg lack of information, and coordination. Having one consistent person to whom they could turn to help them with the systems and support was considered important but not often available. All parents had to take an advocacy role for their child to coordinate and improve care. In-home respite help invaluable in order to achieve some rest and also in terms of personal support. In order to cope, most parents take the attitude that they just have to get on with things. Parents have to make clinical decisions about their child's care in the light of the larger family and their needs. Having the extended family and friends involved was invaluable in terms of physical and emotional support. Parents had to make special efforts to do activities with siblings, who they felt perceived themselves as pushed aside by the needs of the child with CHCN. But this was seldom achieved as a family.This study backs up all calls for coordination of services, information sharing and provision of key workers for families with a child with CHCN.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Rehm (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018To describe promotion of safety and health in school of ch ildren aged \u0018 -\u0018\u0018 who are medically fragile/technology dependent (mf/td).To explore perceptions of social and emotional consequences of school participation for the children, their schoolmates, and familiesQualitative: exploratory, interpretive study based on symbolic interaction as the methodological framework.

Data analysed using a constant comparative method; North AmericaSome children were kept out of school by parents during winter months in order to avoid the chance of infection during the cold season, or when a contagious illness was in the school. Although two of the parents in the study had asked for work to be provided at home, all the children missed the social interaction that school provides.Parents had to learn to be persistent, to continue to monitor children's wellbeing and service provision, and to put up with reputations for being difficult. Because of the specialisation needed to look after the children, parents often found themselves to be more knowledgeable than the professionals and had to train them. Some parents resented the extra help that they were expected to provide.Finding a person who was willing to look out for their child's interests and advocate on their behalf was helpful to the parents. Otherwise, they turned to outside advocacy agencies. The provision of a keyworker for parents would help to alleviate some of the advocacy work that parents do on behalf of their child.Educators have an ambiguous role as both educator and care provider. Schools took an individual approach to the provision by teachers of medical care, and within schools, some teachers and nurses drew their own lines of responsibility.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Robinson et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018\u0018To highlight (a) the difficulties families experience in obtaining adequate and appropriate short breaks for their children and (b) the lack of social work monitoring of short break placements Qualitative design using semi-structured interviews gaining parental experiences and professionals' views on short breaks. This research combines the results from two separate studies effectively treating them as one for the purpose of the findings; UKThe boundaries between health and social care are too unclear in situations where a child has CHCN, leading to confusion about who is responsible for the care. Guidance is needed from the Department of Health on what constitutes social, as opposed to health, care and where the respective agencies' responsibilities start and finish. Parents need breaks in order to cope. General lack of support for families with parents carrying high levels of responsibility in the absence of sustained support. Services are not uniformly available, and children are placed in inappropriate settings due to lack of choice otherwise. This raises additional concerns about both child safety and possible psychological damage to children through a lack of consistent care, and carers. Many stressed the safe care in hospices that they believed ensured the child was comfortable and happy. Parents had real concerns about the quality of the care that could be provided by people who were not qualified nurses. There needs to be a more consistent line from local authorities on who can undertake these very complex healthcare tasks.Better guidelines to monitor short break accommodation needed. Eight steps to better practice are recommended, to ascertain how many families within a local authority have a child with CHCN, what their needs are through consultation with the client families, and better funding, information and coordination of services. It is suggested that keyworker systems are put in place to support families.\u0018\u0018\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Smith et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018 \u0018\u0018To identify how many children attend Nottingham schools with a tracheostomy and to determine the support they receiveSimple descriptive naturalistic study collecting quantitative and qualitative data. Sampl e of \u0018\u0018 children aged \u0018-\u0018\u0018 w ith mean of \u0018.\u0018 years. Questionnaires completed by parents and child's carer at school; UKChildren can be readily included in school if there are properly tra ined carers in place. In \u0018 out of \u0018\u0018 cases return to school was delayed by up to eight months due to lack of suitable carers. One child missed six days schooling subsequently as car er absent. Children had between \u0018 and \u0018\u0018 carers including nursery nurses, care assistants and school nurses. One child performed the care himself. Four families were dissatisfied with aspects of child's experience: issues of quality of carer, attitude of staff and funding. Unspecified problems experienced in finding suitable carers for the journey to sch ool. Six out of \u0018\u0018 children were excluded from school trips because of lack of carer. Eight out of \u0018\u0018 required no emergency change of tracheostomy at school and few missed school through ill health.No c h ild had the recommended Health Care Plan (DH \u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018 ). Many parents were involved in the training of school carers and the majority were satisfied with care received by their children. Trained carers need to be in place early.\u0018\u0018\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Sullivan- Bolyai et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018'To provide a detailed description of mothers' actual management behaviours and the meanings mothers attributed to them ... [to] help to design more precise nursing interventions that may assist mothers in the day-to-day man agement' (p \u0018\u0018 )Naturalistic study with qualitative design based on concept of 'constant vigilance', which incorporated cluster of management behaviours. Inte rviews with \u0018\u0018 mothers; grounded analysis used to analyse data, coded on NUD*ST; North AmericaMothers described having to use hyper-vigilant caregiving behaviour to accomplish day-to-day management, ie (a) ongoing monitoring of illness-related care; (b) identifying appropriate and safe resources that could meet child's needs; (c) juggling illness-related care with developmental needs of child.Central theme was burden of 'constant vigilance'. Three aspects of this:\u0018) Day -to-day concerns \u0018) Day-to-day management \u0018) Supportive resources. These were stressful and exhausting. Discharge planning should take account of parental worries and provide follow-up to decrease burden of daily care/health problems. Fathers to be more involved. Importance of nurse working in partnership with family to provide information, guidance, reassurance re management of condition especially in early months after diagnosis. Reassurance/validation of feelings of loss of confidence after severe episodes. Parental empowerment is facilitated by drawing on inner strength.\u001800CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Thorne et al (\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018) \u0018\u0018\u0018How do parents/carers of children with gastrostomy devices perceive the experience of caring for these children?Interpretive descriptive study in conjunction with larger longitudinal study. Semi-structured interviews with \u0018\u0018 p arents and professional carers. Constant comparative analysis to create categories of coping; North AmericaNine categories of coping grouped into three broad themes:\u0018. Eve ryday gastrostomy maintenance \u0018. Dealing with people (handling stigma, advocating for the child, training carers, maintaining vigilance) \u0018. Mai ntaining normalcy (as normal a personal and family life in face of relentlessness of care.

Most families seemed to be doing their own coordination - a source of pressure, families feel 'on c all' \u0018\u0018 hours a day and can get extremely stressed. More than half said multiagency working had improved family quality of life but coordination only effective if there were adequate services to be coordinated. But even in two out of three sites not specifically aiming to teach parents skills/supply equipment. Majority of families had made/were making adaptations but very few families had received a coordinated response and some had organised and paid for adaptations themselves. Three out of four families received less than national average income. All families experienced major difficulties in finding/organising opportunities for themselves and their children to enjoy a break or leisure activity. Need a whole-family approach to social wellbeing, not seen as a set of individuals with separate and non-convergent needs. Many families felt isolated. Families relied on short breaks but there was a lack of suitable and available services. \u00180\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Townsley et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018 and Abbott et al (\u00180 0\u0018) \u0018\u0018 referred to in thematic analysis as Townsley et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018continued ... Almost one out of three said they had no emotional support whatsoever from any source. Some parents had a supportive, open relationship with their keyworker, suggesting that they could be contacted at any time between meetings to discuss problems/issues. Little emotional support offered to children themselves. Many had dislikes related to medical/physical issues especially physical discomfort but faced a lack of emotional support and few if any outlets or opportunities to describe and express pain, discomfort and distress; only one child said he was very unhappy. All children of school age were going to school or nursery on a regular basis. There was no evidence of access problems and children appeared to be well-supported at school. Relationships with family, friends and carers important to children. Little evidence that children were consulted, informed or given choices about who helped with their care. Children want professionals to communicate with them directly and to be treated with respect and dignity. Only some of the keyworkers made a positive effort to get to know the child. General lack of contact with keyworker and experience of being 'talked to' . Social contacts and leisure pursuits important to developing independence but required considerable support to do.\u00180\u0018Appendix FStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Townsley et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018 and Abbott et al (\u00180 0\u0018) \u0018\u0018 referred to in thematic analysis as Townsley et al (\u001800\u0018) \u0018\u0018continued .... Professionals positive about multiagency working. Significant improvements in interprofessional communication. Two out of three created new role of keyworker as a central point of family contact and coordinator of professionals and support services. Access to and sharing of information easier. But some fears about duplication of meetings. Social workers felt medical and healthcare issues dominated and social model of disability threatened by this. Certain health professionals (eg GPs and teachers) more difficult to engage with. Multiagency service structures thought to be better and more effective for coordinating support and services for families and contact with professionals. This said to enhance relationships with families, to have clearer insights into issues for families, appeared a more coherent team to families. Overwhelming belief that all this made positive difference to families' quality of life, especially by enabling healthcare needs to be met in home/community setting. Some concerns about insufficient resources to match raised family expectations\u00180\u0018CHILDREN'S AN D FAMILIES' SERVICESStudy Aims of the study Study design Findings and implications for policy and practice Wilson et al (\u0018\u0018\u0018 \u0018) \u0018\u0018What is the experience of mothers providing home care for their ventilator-dependent child?Naturalistic study, qualitative design developing the concept of 'absolute involvement' as the basic social process around which all other core variables are integrated. Telephone int erviews with \u0018\u0018 mothers; grounded analysis; North AmericaProposal that 'absolute involvement' of the mother is the core variable/central phenomenon at work to facilitate day-to-day family life and to provide for the child's care. Confident caring results in good child experience.Incorporates three categories:a) Attributes of mothering (resources and constraints) b) Meeting the demands (mother's ability to meet caregiving demands by using 'process skills and strategies') c) Appraising impact. Fourfold categorisation: confident, looking to improve, reclusive, distrustful. Suggestion that reclusive parenting ie constant effort to manage day-to-day care was a detriment to family relationships. Successful appraisal occurred when mothers met self-determined standard of care and day-to-day demands. Need to:a) Consider 'life expectancy' of a family caregiving unit and what follows this b) Consider fundingc) Support mothers, who have demonstrated their commitment so they can achieve the dual roles of mother and caregiver rather than fighting for resources/rights for child. Base support on the 'family caregiving system'. Understand function of mother's expectations and promote relationship by initiating ongoing discussion about the 'rules' of engaging in caregiving and 'alleviating con frontation' (p \u0018\u0018\u0018 ). Facilitate mothers' learning of skills/strategies and linkages with professionals to get feedback on these and avoid isolation.
