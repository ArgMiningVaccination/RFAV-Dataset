Signs and symptoms Allergy symptoms usually come on suddenly and last as long as a person is exposed to the allergen. They can include: - Sneezing - Itchy nose and/or throat - Runny or stuffy nose - Clear, running nose - Coughing - Watery or itchy eyes Causes An allergy starts when your immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader. Airborne allergens include: - Pollen - Animal dander - Dust mites - Mold Risk Factors - Have a family history of asthma or allergies, such as hay fever, hives or eczema - Are a child - Have asthma or another allergic condition Treatment - Medications: Depending on your allergy, medications can help reduce your immune system reaction and ease symptoms. Your doctor might suggest over-the-counter or prescription medication in the form of pills or liquid, nasal sprays, or eyedrops - Immunotherapy: For severe allergies or allergies not completely relieved by other treatment, your doctor might recommend allergen immunotherapy When to seek care You might see a doctor if you have symptoms you think are caused by an allergy, and over-the-counter allergy medications don't provide enough relief. Prevention - Allergen avoidance. Your doctor will help you take steps to identify and avoid your allergy triggers. This is generally the most important step in preventing allergic reactions and reducing symptoms - Keep windows and doors shut at home and in your car during allergy season - Take a shower, wash your hair and change your clothes after you've been working or playing outdoors - Consider wearing a dust mask when you're outside, especially on windy days Campus Resources Nebraska Medicine University Health Center offers health care services to help students feel and stay well.
