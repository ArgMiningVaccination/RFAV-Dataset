It is edited by Heo Jun under thecollective support of medical experts and literati according to the royal instruction.The state initiated the synthesis of various medical knowledge and also the setting upand implementation of an innovative public health programme for the commonpeople. In medical respect, Bogam successfully synthesized competing contemporary theories of medicine that had accumulated in East Asia for two millennia and went onto integrate medical knowledge and clinical experiences together in a single collectionof volumes. The work informs the evolution of medicine in East Asia and beyond. Interms of health care system, it developed the ideals of tpreventive medicine uand tpublic health care by the state, uwhich was virtually an unprecedented idea up to the 19th century. Thus, it stands for the historical development of the knowledge andskills of medicine in East Asia and further reflects the human footprints of worldmedicine and culture. As such, the significance and importance of Bogam is incomparable to anything in the world. Bogam is the first-ever comprehensive book on medical principles and practice edited and distributed nationwide, according to the innovative order by state toproclaim the ideals of public health by the state and preventive medicine. Bogam is significant in that the state took the pioneering initiative to proclaim itself as early as in the 17th century to be responsible for public health. The idea ofthe public health services provided by the state is considered to have been introducedin the Western world only in the 19th century. One of the reasons for the state to takethe lead in compiling a set of these volumes was its sense of responsibility for thehealth and well-being of the general public, and this is clearly manifested in the royalinstruction to compile a monumental medical work. As a result, the encyclopedicSUMMARY1. \u0012 6textbook deals with not only specialized medical knowledge and techniques but also easy-to-come-by herbs having medical effects and simple treatment methods in plainlanguage. The Korean alphabet was adopted together with the Chinese characters insome parts of the book for the ready access to and easy use by the uneducated public,for Chinese characters were only understood by the upper class. In other parts of theworld, there was virtually no compilation of this kind at the national level devoted tothe well-being of the common people before the 19th century, rather than to the royalfamily or the aristocrats . Bogam has assembled and amalgamated diverse schools of medical knowledge that had accumulated for two millennia, whether theoretical or experiential, and wenton to synthesize it with a huge amount of clinical skills in one set of collection. Through the ages, East Asia was a witness to the advent and growth of medical schools which effectively combined theoretical principles based on the contemplationon human and nature with the empirical information accumulated from centuries ofclinical and observational experience. The early 17 th-century Bogam brought together and integrated the medical knowledge and techniques collected up to the 16th century in a more unique waythan any other medical volumes of this kind. For this reason, Bogam has servedthereafter as a model of traditional medicine in East Asia. Efforts to preserve andpropagate medical knowledge and skills in this part of the world were to a greatextent focused on reprinting this book, rather than editing a new one. It is asubstantial evidence of this fact that Bogam has been reprinted over 40 times duringthe past four centuries not only in Korea but also in many Asian regions includingChina and Japan. Bogam is the world sss first medical compilation that recognized on a full scale the importance of prevention in medicine based upon the \"Y angsaeng (life-breeding) uu principle. The principle was incorporated into medical practice systematically, and the state disseminated its practical life-breeding techniques through masspublishing and circulation of Bogam by governmental agencies. The philosophy of Yangsaeng (life-breeding) is about adapting one ss life to the changes of nature in addition to controlling emotions and desires so that theconsumption of mental and physical energy can be minimized, thereby enabling\u0013 \u0014 7individuals to keep health and lead a content life. In this philosophy, human diseases do not break out solely by bodily causes; rather, they are a consequence of physical,social and mental factors working in a complicated way. Based on this inference,Bogam looks into the issues of health and disease from the following three perspectives: 1) Holism, which is not a mechanical approach that views health anddiseases as a simple cause-effect issue; 2) socio-medical, in that human health and diseases are closely linked to society; and3) preventive medicine, which biological medicine is still working on. Thephilosophy of preventive medicine in Bogam has embodied these perspectives four centuries ahead of modern medicine, which is beginning to perceive their importance.Bogamss medical vision is significant in the global history of medicine, in that it realized as early as in the 17th century the definition of health by WHO: One is trulyhealthy when he/she is in good condition not only in physical terms but also inmental and social terms. To conclude, Bogam , as a literal embodiment of Eastern Medicine, successfully took in contending theories of medicine that had stored up for two millennia all overthe region and then compiled a coherent system of medical knowledge and skills in asingle compendium of an unprecedented version. Furthermore, it introduced the ideasof prevention into the medicine of actual life and developed the concept of publichealth care by the state, which is viewed to open up the door to the era of a new formof medicine yet untold; and so to have the potential to let modern medicine know ofan old but brand-new road with which to overcome looming-ahead health challenges. 1.

Authenticity a. Edited by a government organization - An ad hoc commission called Pyeonseoguk(The State Agency for Editing) was set up to compile Bogam . Heo Jun, royal physician, compiled it under the collective support of medical experts and literatiaccording to the royal instruction. Yang Ye-su and Jeong Jak, both of whom wereprominent scholars of that time, mainly provided the basic materials for theencyclopedia and completed the whole edition together with Heo Jun. b. Confirmed by the chronological State records documented by the government- Background information on the compilation and authors is found in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (August 6, 1610, during the reign of the 15th king Gwanghaegun), which is already registered on the Memory of the World list. c. Bogam was preserved in the national archives and managed by a designated government authority from the very beginning- After publishing, sets of Bogam were distributed to related government agencies and archives across the country, and continued to be preserved by nationalfacilities even after the end of the Joseon Dynasty. Since the inauguration of thegovernment of the Republic of Korea, they came under the jurisdiction of theauthorities responsible for cultural assets. 2. World significance, Uniqueness and Irreplacebility a. World significance \u0012 Bogam is the first-ever specialized yet easy-to-learn textbook of medicine ordered by the ruler of the state to be edited in order to proclaim theestablishment of public health and preventive medicine as a goal of nationalhealth care project. JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUSION/ ASSESSMENT AGAINST CRITERIA4. 10As early as in the 17th century, Bogam clearly points out that attaining these two ideals are important responsibilities of the government. - One of the reasons for the government to take the lead in compiling this seriesof volumes was its clear understanding of the responsibility for the public healthand well-being. These visions are also seen in the three principles the king made clear when heinstructed to compile the encyclopedic work of medicine: tPut preventive medicine first. utGet the gist of medicine. utContain local and middle-of-the- road herbs rightly and add on the names of medicinal materials in the Koreanalphabet so that the humble public readily secure the way of cure. uThese guidelines were followed by his order not to let his subjects die young due to lackof doctors and medications and to enable them to find herbs easily.- In addition to special medical knowledge, Bogam includes a wide range of ready substances of cure and concise techniques of treatment, with some parts beingwritten in the Korean alphabet so that the uneducated public may easilyunderstand it. \u0013 Bogam is a synthetic compilation of diverse schools of medical or clinical knowledge that had been invented and developed for two thousands year in EastAsia in one set of volumes. - Bogam is the summation of the medical documents written until the end of the 16th century in East Asia.- Bogam cites 120 medical books including 86 that are mentioned in the section of Yeokdae-uibang (List of Historic Medical Books), which is a selectedbibliography of medical texts to which it made reference to. Furthermore, theencyclopedia has indeed amassed the essential information available at that timeby making references to the 500-plus Korean and Chinese medical documentsfrom the royal archive. In other words, Bogam rearranged the key medical knowledge stored up through the millennia, since the very beginning of EastAsian medicine. - Bogam has been used as the source of basic medical information for the treatment of the general public as well as the royal family members, exercisinginfluence to the medical compilations that followed it in Korea. - Bogam was reprinted over 30 times in China and twice in Japan to be widely 11used for the cure of diseases and the education of physicians in this part of the world for the last four centuries. It continues to be republished not only in Koreabut also in a number of Asian nations including China and Vietnam, with someof them are planning to translate it into their own languages. In addition, it was introduced to the Western world through the partialtranslation into English by an American, Dr. Landis in 1897. Consequently,Bogam provides doctors and scholars the advantage of systemized medical information derived from traditional wisdom in tackling diseases or conductingmodern research and development, thereby serving as a cornerstone for theprogress of medicine. \u0014 \u0001Bogam is the unequalled compendium that incorporates on a wide scale the idea of prevention into theoretical or clinical medicine by turning to theY angsaeng (life-breeding) principle. - Bogam has defined one of the key concepts of the traditional East Asian medicine by embracing the Yangsaeng principle that focuses on preventingdiseases before humans fall victim to them. - It explains the process of creation and changes of the human body by parallelingthem to those of nature, reflecting the typical world view of this region. Theessence of the principle says that if one is eager to preserve health and life forever,one has to adapt oneself to the change of nature and lead a life of moderation andasceticism. - The introduction of the Yangsaeng principle into Bogam has occasioned to shift the focus of medical theories from the symptoms of diseases to the functions ofthe human body itself. It is for this reason that the chapter of Naegyeong(Overview of the Inner Body) was selected to be the leading topic, followed byOehyeong (External Appearance) and Jab-byeong (Various Diseases) as explainedin the above 3.2. This format was a remarkable turnaround from the conventionalmethods of compilation. - Bogam is a valuable material that provides insight to the way the 17th-century Asians perceived the universe, nature and human, in addition to offeringinformation on the understanding of the Asian life, culture and thoughts withreference to the human body and diseases.- The compilation contains diverse views on human, including Taoism 12represented by its accommodation to the laws of nature and mind-body training methods; Confucianism in its regards for human ethics and the role of thegovernment; and the Buddhist belief that the human body consists of fourelements such as earth, water, fire and air. However, these different visions haveone thing in common: that human and nature are inseparably and organicallyrelated. b. Uniqueness \u0012 By adopting a unique classification method, dealing with the reasons of ailments, common and special symptoms of ailments, diagnosis, acupuncture andmoxibustion together with prescription, Bogam was more systematically edited than any other documents of its kind published at that time in East Asia. At thesame time, it puts useful information in boxes to accompany and supplement thetext, much like the tpop-up windows uof todayss Internet. In other words, chapters are coherently divided into sections, which are then divided intosubsections, with text accompanied by related concepts. The network of information is made apparent at a glance due to the well organized structure, with the desired information highlighted at the center andrelevant concepts as well as information on similar diseases easily obtained. Thisutility as a medical reference is also enhanced by the detailed table of contents. \u0013 Unlike its predecessors, Bogam clearly indicates the sources of specific items of information, thereby opening a new era in the intellectual tradition in this field.It offers insight to the historical development of East Asian medicine by puttingtogether and analysing medical theories and prescriptions by means ofcomparison. It should be also noted that the content of a number of medicaldocuments that no longer exist can be retrieved only through Bogam thanks to its clear indication of sources. Therefore, it also serves as a crucial reference forstudying and restoring ancient and medieval medical history in East Asia. c. Irreplaceability The manuscript of Bogam handwritten by Heo Jun and presented to King Gwanghaegun is no longer in existence. The first print issued by the Nae-ui-wonis virtually the same as Heo Jun ss original, because it is based on his handwritten version. The encyclopedia has been reprinted over 40 times at home and abroad, 13but only two full sets of the first issue remain, being preserved by the National Library of Korea and the Jangseogak of the Academy of Korean Studiesrespectively. 3. Significance of the Document a. Time Bogam reflects the history of medical knowledge and clinical skills in East Asia. It is a summation of medical knowledge spanning ancient times to the beginning ofthe 17 thcentury, and it has since served as an essential medical reference for treating illness and disease. Thus, Bogam encompasses the past, present, and possibly the future of the medicine of the world. b. Place. The propagation of Bogam was part of the cultural exchange in East Asia from the 17th century. - With its academic and clinical utility, Bogam exercised enormous influence across the region since the early 17th century. It is indicated by the fact of beingemployed as a gift in diplomatic exchanges. - Looking into the international distribution of Bogam may cast light to understanding the medical environment and relations among nations in EastAsia. c. People As previously discussed, Bogam was reprinted over 40 times and widely used all over East Asia, including China and Japan. Bogam offers a wide variety of treatments covering all classes of people (both high-level prescriptions for theupper class and simple prescriptions or acupuncture for the lower), which givestodayss researchers a detailed picture of the diseases and treatments of that time. d. Topics \u0012 Bogam deals with a wide spectrum of areas in medicine. - It handles the root causes of human aging, ailments and death, followed by theprocesses of diseases and their treatment in addition to how to concoctmedication, and methods of acupuncture, moxibustion, massage and do-in, which 14is a training method to enable gi (energy) to circulate the whole body smoothly. - Also explained are the composition and working principles of medicinalmaterials forming the basis of curing, as well as ways to maximize the effect ofthese materials. - Also found are descriptions on surgical issues like treating gashes, not tomention the information on contagious diseases in addition to internal medicineincluding pediatrics and gynecology. \u0013 The compilation offers East Asians sunderstanding of nature. - It contains a wide range of knowledge on the earth and the universe achieved byEast Asia. - It also describes and analyses medicinal effects of 1,200-plus sorts of animals, plantsand mineral materials, appending medical opinions about them. e. Form and Style \u0012 Appearance The size of one volume measures 36.6 \u008322.0cm. Each page has ten lines, with each line containing 21 characters. Each line is accompanied by two-line notes. \u0013 Format The text is accompanied with visual materials at some parts.- Also attached is a detailed table of contents which classifies the entries andsubscriptions in a systematic manner. \u009c 1MFBTF\u0001SFGFS\u0001UP the item Uniqueness PG\u0001UIF\u00014FDUJPO\u0001\u0015\u000f\u0013\u000f 4. Issues of rarity, integrity, threat and management a. Rarity \u0012 Although many versions of the encyclopedic compilation have been printed and circulated over the past centuries, the first print of this historic document israre and therefore invaluable. \u0013 \u0001As pointed out above, two sets of the first print in 25 volumes are preserved intact: one is housed by the National Library of Korea and the other byJangseogak of the Academy of the Korean Studies. 15b. Integrity \u0012 \u0001The original printed sets have been well preserved. They are in as good a condition as when they were first made in 1613, enduring the test of time forfour centuries. \u0013 Bogam was published and preserved according to royal instructions. By the order of King Seonjo (1596), the encyclopedia was compiled based on existingmedical documents from home and abroad. The sets of volumes were also housedand managed by national archives, which were government facilities whereimportant or precious documents were stored, by royal decree. \u0014 Today, specialized research organizations have taken over custodianship from the government. The two sets in existence today were preserved in the twonational archives at Mt. Odae and Mt. Jeoksang under the protection andmanagement of the government of the Joseon Dynasty. The government of theRepublic of Korea then assigned this duty to the agency in charge of thepreservation of cultural assets followed by current research entities. c. Threats \u0012 They are designated as Treasure No. 1085 and are under the custody of the government in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. \u0013 \u0001The two current custodians, the National Library of Korea and the Jangseogak of the Academy of the Korean Studies, keep the respective set in specializedfacilities run by trained professionals. d.
