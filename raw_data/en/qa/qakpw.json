What does Vitamin D IV Therapy treat? Oral vitamin D can take weeks and even months to have an effect on your health, and most of the dose is lost when it is metabolized in the stomach. Vitamin D IV treatment, on the other hand, has a far more rapid effect, and some patients report feeling the benefits almost immediately. Because the vitamins are delivered directly into the bloodstream rather than the gut, the body can absorb a considerably larger percentage of them. Vitamin D IV therapy is a promising therapy for the following: - promoting immune system health - facilitating healthy bone growth - reducing inflammation - enhancing proper blood circulation and heart health - supporting brain function - supporting weight loss - aiding in the absorption of calcium and phosphate in the body Role of Vitamin D in the immune system Vitamin D plays a vital role in immune system support via numerous mechanisms and regulates both the innate and adaptive immune responses in the body. Vitamin D attaches to immune cell receptors such as neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells and encourages them to create antimicrobial peptides that protect the body from foreign pathogens. According to the National Library of Research, vitamin D has a role in activating the antimicrobial cells to help the body fight infections and inhibit the infection from attacking. What causes Vitamin D deficiency? At VitaMind, we meet a lot of people who have chronic health issues that cause low vitamin D levels. Gut disorders such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease can cause malabsorption, which prevents the body from absorbing nutrients from food. Because vitamin D is largely stored in the liver, kidney and liver disorders can also cause problems in converting vitamin D to its active form. A variety of other factors can raise your risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as: - Obesity - malabsorption of nutrients - Spending most of your time indoors - Wearing a lot of sunblocks when outside - Covering your skin when outside Symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency: A lack of vitamin D can increase your chances of developing health issues such as osteoporosis, heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Patients with vitamin D deficiency have an increased risk of developing the following symptoms: - Muscle pain - Weight gain - Low energy levels - Hair loss - Impaired cognition - Eczema - Low mood How Does Vitamin D IV Therapy Work? Vitamin D IV therapy involves infusing fluid or solution into a vein in the arm through an IV line. The IV solution is pumped through an IV bag containing Vitamin D, bypassing liver digestion and allowing it to be more easily absorbed into your body. This IV vitamin therapy can supply nutrients to the body that other methods cannot without the stomach or liver interfering. The only pain connected with this procedure is when you feel a tiny pinch of the needle at the injection site during the treatment session, which normally lasts 20-60 minutes and has no lingering side effects.
