Healing Services The Perfect Balance Stress & Anxiety Anxiety can wreak havoc on an individual if not taken care of. For anxiety disorders, one should speak with their healthcare professional. For generalized anxiety, massage can help. Depression Depression can vary from mild to severe and you should consult with your primary for the latter. Fortunately, massage can and has been a part of the healing process. Migraines Unfortunately, there is no known cure for migraine headaches. The good news is that I have been able to get many of my clients relief. My go-to therapy for migraines is TP (trigger point) therapy. TMJ TMJ may show symptoms in the face with facial swelling, headaches, neck and shoulder pain and tired facial muscles. This can all be helped with massage therapy. Arthritis Severe arthritis can result in chronic pain, inability to do daily activities and make it difficult to walk or climb stairs. Massage has been known to ease the symptoms of arthritis. Fibromyalgia Many people with fibromyalgia feel their pain in specific areas of their body. Even a small amount of pressure can cause pain, therefore, a massage therapist with knowledge about this disease is a must! Sciatica Massage therapies such as deep tissue and myoskeletal alignment techniques have been proven to be just as effective as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Targeted Pain Massage Therapy helps ease neck and back pain. Massage is also a popular therapy used to relieve muscle tension, spasms, inflammation, fluid retention, aches, stiffness, and pain. Additional Massage therapy is a proven method for reducing symptoms of endless mental and physical discomfort or pain. Each session at Mind Body Balance is catered to your unique needs.
