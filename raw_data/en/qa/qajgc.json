Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 JUNE. 1953. I. USTTRODUCTGEy. 1. General. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization was established on 19th May, 19-19, when the Scicvce and Induslry Research Act 1949 was proclaimed. Under that Act the Organization took the place of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which in turn had, in 1926, taken the place of the Institute of Science and Industry. The powers and functions of the Organization are similar to those of the former Council and include the iiiitiation and carrying out of research in connexion with, or for the promotion of, primary and secondary industries in the Commonwealth or any Territory of the Commonwealth, or in connexion with any matter referred to the Organization hy the Minister; the, training of research workers; the making of grants in aid of pure scientific research; the testing and stan dardization of scientific apparatus and instruments, and the carrying out of scientific investigations con nected with standardization; the collection and dis semination of information relating to scientific and technical matters; and acting as a means of liaison with other countries in matters of scientific research. 2. Executive. Mr. A. B. Ritchie, M.A., has been re-appointed as a part-time member of the Executive for a further period of three years. 3. Advisory Council. The following changes have occurred in the member ship of the Advisory Council;\u2014 Sir Kerr Grant, Sir Harry Brown and Mr. W. S. Kelly have retired. Professor M. L. Oliphant, Professor L. H. Martin, Air. I. M. McLennan and Mr. Donald Mackinnon have been appointed as members. Professor J. G. \"Wood has been appointed as Chair man of the South Australian State Committee in succession to Sir Kerr Grant. 4. Retirement of Me. G. A. Cook. During the year, Mr. G. A. Cook retired from the position of Secretary, after more than 30 years of service-with the Organization and its predecessors. He first joined the Institute of Science and Industry in 1922, was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in 1927, and became Secretary in 1944. Eollowing the retirement of Mr. Cook, the Executive decided that the secretarial work will be the responsi bility of four senior officers\u2014 Mr. E. G. Hicholls\u2014Secretary (General Adminis tration). Mr. G. B. Gresford\u2014^Secretary (Industrial and Physical Sciences). Mr. W. Ives\u2014Secretary (Agricultural and Bio logical Sciences). Air. M. G. Grace\u2014Secretary (Finance and wSuppHes).5. Retirement of Dr. F. L. Stillwell. Dr. F. L. Stillwell retired from the position of Officer-in-charge of the Mineragraphic Section in June, J953, after 26 years' service. He has been succeeded liy Dr. A. B. Edwards. 6. External Territories. Inder its Act, the Organization is charged with responsibility for research of interest to the primary and secondary industries, not only of the Common wealth, but also of Australia's external territories. As a joint venture with the Papua-Kew Guinea Administration, eight Sahiwal, ten Sindhi and four Water Buffalo calves were flown from Pakistan during the year, and are at present in quarantine under close veterinary observation at Kila Kila, near Port Moresby. The animals will later be used for tropical beef and dairy cattle breeding investigations. For the winter of 1953 the Land Research and Regional Survey Section has a survey team in the Buna Region of Papua. This team is organized on similar lines to those employed in northern Australia and where possible techniques developed in earlier land-use surveys will be employed. It is expected, however, that an initial period will be required for the development of special techniques for the surveying of this country. Assistance is being obtained from local authorities. . 7. A1cIlrat.h Fellowship in Animal Husbandry. Mr. AVilliam Mcllrath, of Sydney, has given \u00a350,000 to the Organization for the encouragement of research in animal husbandry. Mr. Alcllrath's gift will be used for the establishment of a Senior Research Fcllow.ship in animal husbandry. 8. Honours and Awards. Mr. G. A. Cook, former Secretary of the Organiza tion, was awarded the O.B.E. in recognition of his many years of service both to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the present Organization. Dr. O. H. Frankel, Chief, Division of Plant Industry, has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in recognition of his contributions to the theory of plant breeding which have been published in some 35 scientific papers throughout his lifetime. Dr. C. H. B. Priestley, Officer-in-charge of the Section of Meteorological Physics, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science of the University of Cambridge. Dr. D. F. Stewart, Principal Research Officer, Division of Animal Health and Production, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Weterinary Science of the University of Sydney. Dr. T. S. Gregory, Principal Research Officer, Division of Animal Health and Production, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Science of the University of Melbourne. Dr. R. C. Eossiter, Senior Research Officer, Division of Plant Industry, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science of the University of Western Australia. Dr. D. F. Waterhouse, Principal Research Officer, Division of Entomology, was awarded the degree ofDoetor of Science of the University of Sydney.8 Dr. M. Blackburn, Senior Eesearch Officer, Division of Fisheries, was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science of the University of Melbourne. 9. Eeseaech Staff. One of the most important functions of the Execu tive is the selection of research staff, since it is primarily on the quality of the men it appoints that the success of the Commonwealth Scientific and Indus trial Eesearch Organization's work depends. It is a constant concern of the Executive that it should con tinue to be able to attract the best men that the universities can produce. The universities are now producing more graduates but the number of first-class men taking higher degrees in science and having proved ability for research is not increasing significantly, whereas the overall demand for research scientists in Australia has gone up considerably. Unless the financial prospects offered by public and private employers to scientists are increased it will become more and more difficult to attract brilliant men into careers in science or technology. If the high stan dard of G.S.I.E.O. research is to be maintained it is necessary to meet normal replacements of scientific staff by recruiting each year a substantial proportion of the best graduates from the Australian universities, as well as ohtaining a proportion of highly trained men from overseas. The Executive considers that, if it is to he ahle to do this satisfactorily in the future, it is an urgent matter that the question of the remuneration of specialists and highly qualified professional scientific men in hoth ])ublic and private employment should be examined as soon as possible. 10. Buildings and Accommodation. Some progress has been made in the erection of new buildings, but many Divisions and Sections still find it necessary to carry on their ivork under crowded and difficult conditions. The new laboratory for the Divi sion of Tribophysics in the grounds of the University of Melbourne is practically complete and the staff will take up their new quarters in the near future. A property for conversion for research work has been taken over during the year for the 'Wildlife Survey Section in Canberra. Work is still in progress on the buildings of the Sheep Biology Laboratory at Prospect,Mew South Wales; the Biochemistry Laboratory at Fishermen's Bend, Melbourne; the Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratory, Geelong; the Central Block and the Microbiology Laboratory, Canberra; and the Perth Eegional Laboratory. 11. Mew Publications. A number of new publications has been issued by the Organization during the year and a full list of these appears in Chapter XXXII., Section 2. _ The periodical Rural Research in O.S.I.R.O. established last year has received an excellent reception, andis proving a good medium for making the Organiza tion's results _ in agricultural research available for extension services. 12. Overseas Visitors. A number of leading scientists from overseas visited Australia in the year under review, many of them under the auspices of the Organization. In their visits to laboratories and establishments they gave much stimulus and help to Australian research workers. Sir_ Eonald Fisher, D.Sc., F.E.S., Professor of Genetics at the University of Cambridge, visited Aus tralia at the invitation of the Organization to consult with officers of the Section of Mathematical Statistics and other scientists concerned with breeding investi gations._ Vice-Chancellor, University of Edinburgh, headed a group of more than 50 distinguished scientists from over thirteen overseas countries who attended the Tenth General Assembly of the Union Eadio-Scien- tifique Internationale held in Sydney in August, 1952. Professor P. M. S. Blackett, F.E.S., Professor of Physics at the Imperial College of Science and Tech nology, London, visited Australia as the guest of the Australian Mational University and discussed a variety of subjects of scientific interest both with the Executive and research staff in a number of the Organization's laboratories. Mr. A. Woodcock of the Woods Hole Oceanographie Institution visited the Division of Eadiophysics to collaborate with Australian scientists on outstanding problems in cloud physics. 13. Overseas Visits, Fellowships and Studentships. During the year under review, a number of officers of the Organization were sent overseas for some months to collect information on new developments in scientific research and to acquire general experience and training in new techniques. In addition, four senior officers were invited to visit overseas institutions for consulta tion concerning special aspects of their work. This year the Organization altered its policy with regard to studentships, and instead of advertising general awards it invited applications for hoth Australian and overseas studentships in specific fields of physical and biological sciences. Five studentships and four trainee- ships were awarded to recent graduates for training overseas in fields which would enable them to fill speeific posts in the Organization on their return to Australia. One studentship was also awarded from Science and Industry Endowment Fund moneys. At the close of the year 24 holders of studentships and traineeships awarded in previous years were receiving training in the United Kingdom, one in Holland, and three in the United States of America. Ten studentships were awarded early in 1953 for post-graduate work in Australian universities, raising the total of those receiving training under this scheme to sixteen. During the year several eminent oi'erseas scientists have been invited to work with the Organization as Senior Eesearch Fellows for periods of time ranging from six months to five years. To date four Senior Eesearch Fellows have been appointed. One Textile Eesearch Fellowship Was awarded for training overseas in chemical problems related to the wool industry. 14. Co-operative Eesearch with Industry. The Organization has continued to support the Aus tralian Leather Eesearch Association and the Bread Eesearch Institute of Australia under a similar arrange ment to that existing between the research associations in Great Britain and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Eesearch. A number of speeific research projects are being undertaken in collaboration with individual firms. The Executive welcomes such opportunities for co-operation with industry and hopes that they may be extended. 15. Collaboration with Universities. The establishment of research units Avithin the uni versities is of great importance as it enables the Organization's officers to enjoy the stimulus and help ofauthorities in different fields of science. The Organiza tion's work in the universities is mentioned in various places in the main body of this report. _ Arrangements for collaborative work with univer- Mties are pf three principal types. In some cases theOiganization has established its own units in universitybuildings or has erected its own buildings on university9 property; in otlier cases, sections have beeri established to work in existing university laboratories with the professor acting as olScer-in-charge. It has also been found desirable, where the universities themselves can undertake complete responsibility for specific research projects, to provide funds to enable research workers to be employed by the universities. Tlie number of research workers involved in arrange ments of these three types is now quite large, and the Organization gratefully acknowledges its debt to the universities, without whose co-operation many import ant research projects could not have been undertaken. 10. Science and Industky Endowment Eund. During the year the Executive, as Trustees of the Science and Industry Endowment Fund, approved grants to assist research workers as follows:\u2014^Mr. Tarlton Rayment, for taxonomic Avork on bees; Dr. J. Pearson, for work on comparative anatomy and embryology of marsupials; Mr. F. W. Hely, for work on soil fertility; Dr. B. Breyer, for polarographic work; Dr. R. W. Fairbridge, to join the Scripps Institute Expedition to the South Pacific; Dr. A. M. Clark, for fruit fly investigations; Mr. A. Bird, for entomological investigations; Mr. V. D. B. Skorman, to attend the meeting of the British CommonAvoalth Collection of Micro-organisms; Miss J. M. Langley, for Avork on mineralogy and petrology. In a'ddition, a studentship for overseas training in chemotherapy was awarded to Mr. G. P. Warwick. 17. Finance. Chapter XXXVI. gives details of expenditure during 1952-53 by the Organization totalling \u00a34,526,270. This amount includes a total of \u00a31,044,392 derived otherAvise than from the CommonAvealth Treasury, including \u00a3327,283 expended from the Wool Industry Fund and \u00a3455,273 expended on avooI produc tion and Avool textile research from funds derlA^ed from the Wool Research Trust Account established under the provisions of the Wool Use Promotion Act 1945. Certain other expenditure involved in erection costs of buildings Avas also incurred on behalf of the Organization. The Organization is particularly gratified by the way in AA'hich various bodies continue to support it, and by the marked interest evinced by certain sections of industry which have provided donations for co-operative research. Among the many contributions received, reference may be made to those of the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Wool Board, Australian Meat Board, Australian Dairy Produce Board, Australian Wine Board, Australian Egg Board, the Queensland Meat Industry Board, the Xew South Wales Department of Agriculture and Xew South Wales Water Conserva tion and Irrigation Commission, the Metropolitan Meat Industry Commissioners of Xew South Wales, the Victorian Railways, the George Aitken Pastoral Research Trust, Burdekin Bequest, Ian McMaster Bequest, and Alexander Eraser Memorial Fund, the Dried Fruits Control Board, the Australian Dried Fruits Association and the dried fruits industry, the National Gas Association, Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, xVustralian Cement Manufac turers' Association, the wool textile industry, the timber industry, and the pulp and paper industry. A statement has been included of expenditure on contributions made by the Commonwealth to the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, and the estab lishment and maintenance of the Chair of Aeronautics at the University of Sydney, and on grants to the Standards Association of Australia, the Australian National Research Council, and the National Associa tion of Testing Authorities. The Organization is responsible for the administration of the funds expended in this way.18. OEGANlZAtlON. For the purpose of carrying out its research work the Organization has established a number of Divisions and Sections. The Divisions, of which there are now fifteen, comprise the major establishments, which may be further subdivided into Sections; there are also independent Sections comprising establishments which have not reached a stage of development, so far as the scope and magnitude of their operations are concerned, to justify their designation as Divisions. In the present Report an attempt has been made to group the material according to its subject matter rather than according to the Division or Section con cerned. Additional chapters and appropriate cross references have been inserted, however, to permit the work of any particular Division to be reviewed as a whole. As the Organization's investigations extend on a Commonwealth-wide basis aiid as many of the investi gations which are being conducted\u2014^particularly those concerned Avith problems affecting the agricultural and pastoral industries\u2014^necessitate experimental work in the field, a number of branch laboratories and field stations have been established in various parts of Australia. The Head Office of the Organization is in Melbourne and associated with it are the Organization's Central Library, Agricultural Research Liaison Section, and Central Experimental Workshops. The Organization also maintains Overseas Liaison OflSces in London and Washington. The Divisions Avhich haA-e been established (in order of their formation) are as follows:\u2014 Plant Industry, with head-quarters and main laboratories at Canberra and- field stations and experiment farms at Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Lawes and Applethorpe, Queensland, Trangie, NeAv South Wales, and Kojonup, Western Australia.

Plant and Soils Laboratory. Brisbane. II. SOILS. 1. Genera u A basic knowledge of the soil is fundamental to any proper land use, and improvements in farming method, more intensive cirltivation, techniques for pasture im provement, and measures for soil conservation must stem from soil research. The Organization's work in this field is undertaken by the Division of Soils with head-quarters at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute of the University of Adelaide. Some work on soils and their behaviour under irrigation is undertaken at the Commonwealth Research Station (Murray Irrigation Areas), Merbein, and at the Irrigation Research Station (Murrumbid gee Irrigation Areas), Griffith (see Chapter IV., Sections 2 and 3). Division of Soils.\u2014The Division does research into the classification, properties, and problems of Aus tralian soils both of an applied and of a fundamental nature. The Division is the central and main body engaged in soil research in Australia, taking part either actively or consultatively in the very great bulk of in vestigations in this field. The primary objectives are\u2014 (i) The systematic mapping of the soils of Aus tralia in broad categories as an evaluation of national soil resources and as a compara tive survey relating pedologically the soil groups of this and other countries.(ii) The cla.ssification and mapping in varying degrees of detail of the soils of specific areas in regions marked for future or more inten sive settlement or in which problems of production have arisen; this is a service of immediate value to the farmer and to State advisory and administrative bodies. (iii) Applied research into problems concerning soil fertility or other chemical or physical factors affecting productivity. (iv) Fundamental research on tlie pedology, chemistry, physics, and microbiology of Australian soils. This is becoming an in creasingly important activity on Avhieh depends progress of applied research in the Division and also of investigations of other Divisions of the Organization and of outside agricultural authorities. The Division operates as four closely linked sections \u2014pedology and soil survey, soil chemistry, soil physics, soil microbiology. The work which is described in this chapter is decentralized at five regional centres outside of head-quarters in Adelaide, namely, Brisbane, Canberra, Deniliquin, Perth and Hobart. At three of these, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart, branch laboratories are already in existence and there is under construction a further large unit at Canberra. The Division has co-operated continuously with the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, University of iVdelaidc, and has kept in touch with State and Com monwealth bodies interested in the research programme. Recently a Conference in Soil Science was organized by the Division- of Soils and the University of Adelaide. For seven days meetings were held at the Waite Insti tute, Adelaide. A total of 152 members attended from 47 organizations comprising Commonwealth and State bodies, universities, and secondary industry. The- Con ference was followed by a four-day field excursion to the south-east of South Australia and the western districts of Victoria. A small committee was set up to work out a system of soil classification acceptable to Australian pedologists generally and harmonizing the conflicting views expressed at the conference. During the year officers have been overseas conferring with research workers and attending conferences. 2. Soil Survey and Pedoloov. (Division of Soils.) Survey work was carried on in all States and in north Australia, embracing a large number of separate units of work. Detailed surveys covered approximately 70,000 acres and broad-scale surveys about 50,000 square miles. A proportion of the work was concerned with land settlement of ex-servicemen. A good deal of the formal survey work, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, relates still to the development of crown lands, usually with problems in fertility. The Division is compiling a new soils map of Australia. Use is being made of new techniques of mapping and a more comprehensive system of classification\u2014both developed since the last soil map of Australia was issued in 1943. The plan being followed in field work by the Division is to attempt the mapping of the soils in broad groups using as units the individual sheets of the inter national map of the world, scale 1:1,000,'000. By this means an atlas of Australian soils will be built up and form a revised soil map of Australia. The field work of about half of the Melbourne sheet has been com pleted this year. This embraces eastern and central Victoria and the Monaro region in New South Wales. It is very desirable that work should be on as uniform lines as possible and to this end a Manual of Australian Soils was prepared and has now been issued.11 (a) Westei'n Australia.\u2014Survey work in the past year has been concentrated both on detailed surveys and on the extension and revision of soil association mapping done the previous year. This embraces survey projects in the Mount Manypeaks and Stirling Eange areas where land settlement is currently proceeding. The area covered during the year comprises 54,000 acres. The survey completed early in the year of another area of 25,000 acres north of the Stirling Ranges is of particular importance because of the possible hazard of salinity damage on certain soil types. Closer settlement is now reaching out on to such areas in \"Western Australia, and the solution of the salinity problem on non-irrigated land consequently assumes growing importance with such developments. The Swan Valley plain near Perth, comprising about 20,000 acres, has been used at a very variable intensity and a number of problems have arisen, particularly with horticultural plantings. The detailed study of the soils and associated problems has been carried out over this area and the field work is now complete. Eel- worm attack and zinc deficiency have both been demon strated in the area and the problem remains to establish the relative importance of these and other features, such as restricted drainage, on the various soils mapped in the district. A considerable variety of soil types has been defined and these bear on the potential land use, which is clearly less intense than it should be in a favorable geographic and climatic situation. The basic data are now available for attacking problems in production and designing an improved system of land use into which the economic factor enters. At the request of the Departments of Public Works and of Agriculture a reconnaissance survey with detailed mapping in some portions has begun over an area of 49,000 acres in the Boyanup-Capel district of the coastal jJlain. The area is being considered as an irrigation project using water from the Wellington Dam on the Collie River. Detailed surveys have been made on 4,500 acres in various parts of the project and it is hoped that with the aid of aerial photographs and the reconnaissance mapping the main characters of most of the area can be filled in. Field work will be continued with an assessment of irrigation value. On the coastal plain minor work included some inten sive examination of small areas for exj)erimental irriga tion at Coolup near Pinjarra, where water of relatively high salinity is being used. (b) South Australia.\u2014The development of the low fertility lands occurring very extensively over the upper south-east of South Australia has directed surveys to the Keith district as a first step in the mapping and evaluation of this region. Building on to the early survey of 1933 south and west of Keith, and to the survey of 600 square miles in the County of Bucking ham described in the 1951-52 Annual Report, the soil mapping of a further 300 square miles is complete on one additional area and approaching completion in another where settlement is rather longer established. This latter is the Tatiara district, which comprises the westward extension of the Wimmera of Victoria into South Australia. The total area covered by all these surveys is a continuous block of about 1,600 square miles. The detailed survey of the second of five units in the Barossa district has proceeded and a further 12,000 acres is mapped. There is a rather different set of soil formations to the type covered in the previous unit. It is also horticultural, grazing, and mixed farm ing land with specific problems. The survey is less intensive in general than the earlier one, with some portions mapped in close detail. The third unit, in the Tanunda centre, has been begun. There are major problems in land use, particulardy the reconstitution of degenerated horticultural farms and im.proved pro duction of pastures. An area of approximately 3,000acres situated on Lake Alexandrina near Wellington has been surveyed with a view to its development as a post-war settlement, partly by irrigation from the lake. This is but part of a wider regional problem associated with the economic use of the waters of the lake. Un fortunately the area surveyed has a preponderance of saline soils. The survey of 10,000 acres at Mintaro began as a collaboration with the Waite Research Institute which is planning to establish experimental work in agronomy on selected portions. The survey is mainly completed. It .should form an excellent basi.s for pasture research when all the data, field and laboratory, are assembled. Additional examinations have been made by further spot-surveys in the Adelaide hills district as a beginning of a more comprehensive soil map. The foothills and plains area is also being studied as an extension of the part covered by the investigation of soils and housing in Adelaide suburban areas. (e) Victoria.\u2014Apart from broad-scale regional mapping mentioned above and a reconnaissance of the soils of the Wimmera and adjacent districts no other soil survey work has been undertaken in Victoria during the year. (d) Tasmania.\u2014Over the past seven years field work of varied detail has proceeded over the region described as the Launceston Basin. The surveys have now been carried to a final stage. The Basin area is a most interesting district pedologically, and agriculturally is capable of more intense development. The development of river terraces has been studied as an aid to under- standing the soil pattern. The survey of the whole of Flinders Island has now been completed, together with an intensive mapping of 4,000 acres in representative areas. The relationships of soils to geomorphology in this island are of great interest, portion of it apparently representing a very old land surface while much of the remainder is very young, consisting of dune systems and raised beaches. The provision of a suitable base map by photogram- metry is being arranged with the National Mapping Section of the Department of the Interior. Progress has been made with the project of mapping the soils of Tasmania in broad groups. A comm.ence- ment was made near Hobart using military index sheets as geographical units. The greatest handicap in the future will be the lack of suitable base maps for both field work and compilation of soil plans, but the areas so far undertaken have fortunately had excellent military maps. Compilation of maps for other areas is being based on air photo co-ordination. The Frodsley Estate in the South Fsk Valley has been the subject of earlier investigations and a good deal of associated research by other bodies. The stock- carrying capacity has been raised considerably in past years with superphosphate and subterranean clover, but last winter the pastures failed and losses were heavy. The Division has co-operated in a programme of Com monwealth and State bodies by a new survey of 3,000 acres of improved pasture land. This survey has yielded information of value to experimental work and allowed the selection of appropriate sites for field plots and studies in animal nutrition. Further areas total ling 120 square miles adjacent to the Launceston Basin have been mapped in broad categories. Time was also devoted to a field study of alpine soils wdiich are quite extensive in Tasmania. (fi) Irrigation Zone.\u2014New South Wales and Vic toria.\u2014The principal detailed survey has been in the Jernargo area west of Jerilderie, New South Wales, which is proposed for more intensive development extending from the older Berriquin Irrigation District. Approximately 8,000 acres were so mapped and a further 120,000 acres in a broad-scale association survey. A beginning was made with the survey of the12 Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas of wbic.li the borti- cultural section only bad been covered in a surveytwenty years ago. Tbe Hew South Wales Departmentof Agriculture Soil Survey unit is co-operating active yin all this work. Broad-scale_ mapping has extendedmainly north and west and with particular attention to the large area west of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas between the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Kiveiswith an area of 3,000 square mBes. This district has been under review as to the possibility of its intensifieddevelopment with Snowy Mountains water when it becomes available in a few years. An oiiicer has beenserving on the Hew South Wales Committee dealing with the use of Blowering Dam water from the Snowy Mountains scheme and considerable effort is being directed towards the assessment of the soil factor as thekey to development. The work is closely tied in withengineering investigations. Attention is being diiected towards the salt and cation regime in the soils of theregion, especially towards a better prediction of the soils' ultimate development under irrigation. A two-year programme of soil salinity investigations has been commenced. Attention is being given to the calcareous crumbly soils of the region, as it appears these may have a unique part in the future irrigation of the area. (/) New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory.'\u2014The broad survey of the Southern Table lands has been carried northward to include the Canberra and Goulburn 4-mile military sheets com prising 11,000 square miles. About three-quarters hp been completed, together with eleven spot surveys in detail to examine and define the soil pattern. The land-use map of the Australian Capital Territory has been completed except for a small area in the north and three detailed spot surveys. Erosion status has been included as a feature of the Australian Capital Territory work. Eollowing earlier surveys along the Macquarie and Bogan Elvers in the north-west of Hew South Wales, a third area near Warren wp examined for the Irrigation Commission. This totalled 600 square miles. A further unit is yet to be mapped to give a soil picture of an almost continuous belt of the plains country commandable for irrigation from the Burrendong Dam. The limited water supply available has enforced a rigid examination of the soil-irrigation potential. (g) Queensland.\u2014Work has been concentrated on the study of the soils of part of the Darling Downs. The current project involves field and laboratory studies and soil mapping over an east-west strip across the centre of the Darling Downs between Toowoomba and Cecil Plains. Its main aims are (1) detailed study of the properties, classification, and relationship to agricultural use of the black earth soils, (2) study and pedogenic interpretation of the patterns of red and black soils derived from basalt rock in the upland areas, and (3) the mapping of soil associations of significance to use at the farm unit level. During the year field work for five additional detailed spot surveys in the Middle Eidge, Southbrook, Cecilvale, Aubigny, and Bongeen areas was completed, defining soil patterns as a basis for the soil association mapping. The aggregate area now covered by detailed survey is 40,000 acres, but several more small spot surveys will be necessary, particularly on the Kurrawa 1-mile military sheet. The broader-scale soil association mapping is now in progress on the area covered by the Toowoomba 1-mile military map sheet. In addition to the deep, red lateritic and non-lateritic soils of the Toowoomba area, slightly acid to alkaline red soils of moderate depth and morphology related to the red-brown earth group have been described form ing patterns with the very dark to black clay soils of the western part of the upland basaltic area. A numberof profiles selected as representative of the soils of the coastal area north of Brisbane were studied and sampled for laboratory analysis, at the request of the Division of Plant Industry. These soils have been identified as members of four great soil groups\u2014relict sandy lateritic soils, groundwater podzols, low humic gleys, and humic gleys\u2014and are now being subjected to detailed laboratory examination {see Chapter III., Section 18). {h) North Australia.\u2014^An officer has been seconded as pedologist to the Horth Australia survey unit of the Land Eesearch and Eegional Survey Section. The pedological work of these surveys is correlated by the Division of Soils. The work completed this year is in the Ord-Victoria Eiver Eegion comprising 70,000 square miles. The survey of a similar large unit in the Gulf country of north Queensland is just beginning. The work is co-ordinated on the pedological side by a visit from head-quarters during the field work. All analytical work on soil samples is conducted in the Division's laboratories. An officer of the Division of Soils is also associated with the Hew Guinea unit of the Land Eesearch Section. These surveys are described in Chapter XI. 3. Soil Physics. (Division of Soils.) (a) Water Movem-ent in Unsaturated Soil.\u2014^Most practical problems relating to soil water in Australia involve unsaturated rather than saturated conditions over a wide range of alternating wetness and extreme dryness. .On tbe other hand, it is the saturated condi tion that in the past has been more widely studied, particularly overseas. The Division is therefore con ducting work on the mechanism of water movement in unsaturated soil. Eesults obtained on movement under a temperature gradient have been published. They show that, in a closed system, water will move in the vapour phase toward the cool end of the system and in the liquid phase in the reverse direction. In this work, the movement of chlorides in solution served to dis tinguish between liquid and vapour movements. The same technique has now been applied to a study of the movement of water in relatively dry soil. It has been found that water moves as a liquid in soils which are as dry as the wilting percentage. This has led to the conclusion that water movement in soil plays more part in the supplying of water to plant roots than has hitherto been supposed. Other implications in relation to water availability, salt distribution through soil profiles, and movement of water under engineering structures are being studied. Attention has been given to the negative adsorption of chloride ions from soils in connexion with the unsaturated permeability studies. (b) Vapour Losses from Pressure Membrane Apparatus.\u2014The pressure membrane apparatus is standard equipment in the laboratory for the measure ment of water content of soil in relation to soil water tension. Loss of vapour through the cellophane membrane of the apparatus would affect this measure ment. The extent to which this can occur has been measured at a range of pressures and it is concluded that this type of loss is unimportant. However, losses occurring from other parts of the apparatus may be significant and it is suggested that at the commence ment of each run the apparatus be brought up to pressu]-e and then the gas cut off at the source. The lo.ss of gas in the first day may then be used to cheek these leaks. (c) Physical Properties of Soils,\u2014'Various pro perties of soils which affect its behaviour in agricul tural usage are being studied with the objective of setting up a limited number of methods to be applied13 in the routine examination of soil. These methods include structure stability, pore size, and range of available water. It is hoped that a useful means of characterizing the physical status of soil will arise from this work. An attempt is being made to standardize these methods to make them suitable for routine use. (d) Stability of Structure.\u2014^When soil aggregates are wetted they often tend to slake down to an unstable mass. The stability of these aggregates is an important feature on which the maintenance of good tilth depends. One cause of breakdown is the explosive action of entrapped air compressed by water soaking into the aggregate. Work is proceeding on this, and it has been found that the degree of breakdown of aggregates on wetting depends on the water content of the soil, before it is wetted. Moist soils break down less readily than dry soils when they are flooded with water. Similarly and for the same reason soil from which air has been evacuated is more stable when wetted than soil wetted under atmospheric pressure. The effect of concentration of electrolyte on permeability and on the stability of structure has been studied by an officer of the Division during the tenure of a student ship overseas. This work has quantitatively evaluated the level of electrolyte required to keep the soil colloids in a flocculated condition when the soil is saturated to varying degrees with sodium. In another section of this work the permeability of montmorillonite to strong solutions of electrolyte has been used as a measure of swelling. It has been shown by X-ray measurements that the loss of permeability of sodium montmorillonite can be attributed to crystalline swelling beyond 20 A. In a general way the permeability of the Xa- and Ca- montmorillonite has been connected with the X-ray spacing by the use of the Kozeny porosity factor. (e) /Stj'Mcfure.\u2014Further tests on the effect of crop rotations on physical properties of soils have shown that, in plots where conditions were such that structural breakdown throughout the growing season was a mini mum, a significant difference in bulk densities still existed between those under four-course and two- course rotations (see 1951-52 Annual Report). Water stability tests of these soils showed a significantly higher stability in that under the four-course rotation. Plots of the same soil type, which were in the second and sixth years of pasture as part of their rotations, showed a considerably greater water stability than the four-course which included only one year of IDasture. Xo difference was obtained between the stabilities of either of the plots under longer pasture. (/) Soil Conditioners.\u2014Tests with soil conditioners have shown that these greatly increase the water stability of an unstable soil. Where oats were grown in a subsoil in pots under ideal conditions of moisture and nutrients, only slightly increased yields were obtained in the treated soil but root development in the latter was several times as great as that in the untreated soil. (g) Formation of Surface Seals on Soil.\u2014^The effect of raindrop action on the \" sealing \" of the sur face soil is being studied both in the field and in the laboratory. A small rain simulator has been developed for examining the effect of raindrops on soil under controlled conditions. A lai'ge simulator is necessary if field conditions of splash are to be duplicated. In the meantime the mechanism of seal formation and the effect of seals on soil properties and soil-air-water relations are being investigated in the field. (h) Seasonal Changes in Water Content and Move ment of Clay Soils.\u2014Field studies of the seasonal change of water status of the soil profile are continuing in Adelaide. At the same time the vertical movements of the soil resulting frr ji changes in water content arebeing measured. The maximum depth of the seasonal penetration of rain and the progress of drying in the soil profile have been determined for the Adelaide climate and typical soil environments. Water penetra tion of the order of 10 feet has been noted in red-brown earth soils by the late winter. Soil water changes and fiarth movements have been correlated. As a conse quence definite recommendations can be given concern ing the appropriate footings for houses which must be built on these \" troublesome\" soils. The amount of water seasonally stored in the soil profile has been measured at a number of sites in Adelaide and found to be 8-9 inches in a normal red-brown earth profile. This storage has been compared with the amount estimated from the annual sum of precipitation corrected for evaporative losses according to various formulae. (i) Swelling of Clay Soils.\u2014Laboratory work on soils liable to extensive volume change is being under taken. The change in volume accompanying changing water content and soil water tension has been measured on remoulded clay blocks. The water content-volume relation is unique but considerable hysteresis is evident in the relation between soil water tension and water content (or volume), according to whether the final equilibrium water content is reached by drying or wetting the soil. (j) Measurement of Soil Water Status in the Field. \u2014Xew devices are being developed in an attempt to improve on other methods being used by the Division to obtain an in situ measurement of water content or soil water tension. One of these uses the volume change of clay as its principle. The other depends on the slow ing and scattering of neutrons by hydrogen. (Jc) Examination of Soils for Engineering Purposes. \u2014-The survey of the soils of Adelaide suburbs carried through in previous years has now been prepared for publication, together with a discussion of their engineer ing properties. A generalized map of the soils and a description of their characteristics and behaviour are provided. Colour photographs of soil profiles will assist in their identification by the architect or builder con cerned with selecting a type of foundation suited to a particular soil. This publication is being put out in conjunction with the Department of Mines, South Australia, which has assumed responsibility for an advisory service relating to soils and house foundations for private inquirers. The Experimental Building Station of the Department of \"Works is concerned with the design of foundations appropriate to the various soil types. A similar survey has been conducted on soils on basalt in the suburbs of Melbourne. At the request of the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria an examination was made of soil conditions along the route of a proposed pipe line from Morwell to Melbourne in Victoria. The route included an area subject to land slides which had become dangerous during the wet winter this year. Recommendations regarding alterna tive routes and possible treatments were made and were adopted. Upon a request from the Architect-in- Chief's Department, South Australia, the soils of the Xorthfield Mental Hospital area were examined. A report has been made on soil strength and water content conditions as they affect the design of large extensions to the hospitals where the soils are of a problem nature for foundation structures. {I) Mineral Studies.\u2014A detailed study is being made on the soil colloids extracted from the terra rossa and rendzina soils. These colloids are usually high in illite, with kaolin and free iron oxide present in smaller amounts. Further work has shown that these colloidsand those from the red-brown earth soils are essentiallycrystalline, although it was previously thought that they contained considerable amorphous matter. Colloidsfrom solodized solonetz soils are also being studied,together a few samples from Kangaroo Island' Tasmania, and Xew South Wales. '14 iSouie soil colloids from south of Adelaide are rich in \" opal The rock underlying these soils is almost pure \" opal This \" opal \" gives a diffraction pattern which is very similar to that of many common opals, the precious opals being often truly amorphous. The diffraction pattern given by the \" opal\" resembles, in an approximate way, that of j3-cristobalite. It is con sidered that the material or its diffraction pattern cannot he satisfactorily accounted for by ^-cristobalite, so work is continuing in the hope of elucidating its structure and origin. Some time has been spent m improving standard data available for X-ray analysis. The vV.S.T.M. cards have had data punched on them and data obtained from the literature has been added to the index, particular attention being paid to silicas, silicates, phosphates, and manganese oxides. Work has continued on the X-ray spectrograph and experiments indicate that it is suitable for detecting elements of greater atomic number than potassium. Under favor able circumstances one part in 10,000 can he detected. A comparative study of the mineralogy of the black soils and krasnozems which occur at Lismore, Xew South Wales, has been completed. These two soils are vei'y diflhreiit in the field and in their mineralogy, the red soils being mainly kaolin with free oxides while montmorillonite was dominant in the black soils. The mineral studies indicated that the two soils, which occur aide by side on basalt, represent different stages in the one weathering process. This study is now being extended to krasnozems from other parts of Australia. An investigation into the structure of cookeitc was also undertaken. Cookeite has a chlorite structure but is unusual in containing no iron or magnesium. Aluminium with a little lithium occupies the octahedral positions. study of the crystalline swelling of montmorillonite on wetting showed that the lattice swelling continued beyond 20A for monovalent cations although previous work had generally assumed this as the limit. Up to 20A the interlayer swelling was stepwise. It then jumped to 40A after which it progressed continuously. Spacings up to 150A were measured and the indications were that the crystal swelling did not cease at this point. All the swelling of montmorillonite can be accounted for by the crystal swelling. These investigations were cai'i'ied out by an officer working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England from which he has now returned. With other members of the Pedology Department at Rothamsted an investigation was made into the esters and silanes of montmorillonite. Xo evidence was found supporting the existence of these eomponnds. These organic complexes behaved like normal, adsorption complexes of montmorillonite. (m) Soils in Relation to Irrigation Development.\u2014 The characterization of the physical properties of soils from the Lower Burdekin Valley has been completed at the Brisbane Regional Laboratory. A statement dealing with the water entry characteristics of the soils has been published and gives details of the expected behaviour under irrigation culture. The laboratory characteriza tion is being summarized to form a supplementary report on the general physical properties of the soils of the area. Consideration has been given to the use of laboratory measurements in rating soils for their adaptability to development. An index has been devised based on five physical criteria to assess the status of tbe soil and its expected influence upon agricultural poten tial. To date the index has only been used on a limited group of soils, but it appeared to separate them into definite groups. The index is only designed to rate the soil on its physical status, and is not intended as a complete assessment of the agricultural worth of the soil, as it takes no account of chemical or economic factors. A good deal of attention has been paid to standardizing the laboratory measurements used indetermining physical properties. An adequate labora tory procedure has been established and the methods investigated in some detail. A study has been made of shrinkage of natural soil aggregates accompanying pro gressive water withdrawal. The influence of soilproperties on the extent and character of the shrinkage has been assessed. In particular the influence upon water entry of this shrinkage and subsequent crack formation in field soils has been examined. 4. Soil Chlmistey. (Division of Soils.) (a) Micro-nutrient Investigations.\u2014The work on soil manganese has been continued by the laboratory study of various extractants capable of forming complex unions with divalent and trivalent manganese. In a pot experiment a manganese deficient soil was treated with three levels of manganese sulphate and then sown with oats. After harvesting the manganese has been well recovered from the soil by extraction with an acetate buffer of pH 7-8 containing quinol and \" Sequestrene \" (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) but, in the absence of cither of these two compounds, the recovery dropped sbarply. A 1 per cent, potassium cyanide solution of pH 8.5-9 has also been found to extract the greater part of the manganese from some soils. The conditions of extraction employed have prevented peptization of large amounts of organic matter and lessened the risk of reduction of oxides of manganese during extraction. As the results of the above work indicated that added divalent manganese had been oxidized, tests were made on the recovery of manganese sulphate added in the laboratory to various soils. Xo evidence of oxidation was found in samples which had been kept air dry for 48 hr and other samples are being kept for longer periods. Further tests on the extraction of known compounds of manganese added to soils should allow a fuller assessment of the significance of the results obtained with the above reagents. (b) Ion Exchange and pll Studies.\u2014The investiga tion of the ion exchange-pH relationships in various cation-dominant soils is nearing completion. For the pH determinations soil water suspensions have been used and the ratio of soil to water has been such that unit volume contained a constant number of exchange positions. As the amount of sodium held in exchange positions increases, hydrogen being virtually the only (ither competing ion, the pH increases at a slower rate for kaolinitic soils than for soils containing mont morillonite or illite as a major clay mineral constituent, lllitic soils give a higher pH than montmorillonitic soils, with the same exchangeable sodium, by as much as four units. As the potassium in the exchange positions increases, there is a difference of two to three units between the pH of montmorillonitic soils and other soils having the same exchangeable potassium content, the montmorillonitic soils having the lower pH. Montmorillonitic and illitic soils increase their pH with increasing exchangeable calcium at a slightly faster rate than the kaolinitic soils, but in general the differences shown are not large. For montmorillonitic soils the overall effect of potassium is very similar to that of calcium and the combination of these two gives pH values of the order of one unit lower than for the same exchangeable sodium content. The effect of exchange able magnesium in competition with hydrogen is very different from that of calcium; for the same amount of magnesnnn on the soil, pII values are more than two units higher than for calcium. Magnesium soils of all the mineral types studied give similar pH values except for those soils containing large amounts of free iron oxide which give a slightly lower pH. (c) Cation Exchange and Clay Properties.\u2014Investi gations have commenced into methods of determining exchangeable cations in soils, particularly in calcareous15 soils, and some progress lias beeu made in developing a leaeliing solution which can be used without radical modification of existing analytical ptrocedures. In order to test this and other methods bulk homoionic soil samples are being prepared. A simple ultramicroscope has been assembled for use in preliminary work on the reversal of charge phenomena in soil colloids. (d) Terra liotsm and liendzina Soils.\u2014This project seeks to account for the formation of these morpho logically different soils on apparently similar parent material and under the same climatic conditions. The laboratory investigation has been conducted in two stages; the first was to determine which, if any, chemical characteristic or combination of characteristics could differentiate between these two soils; the second, from an examination of the underlying calcareous material, sought to account for this difi'erence. It has been found that these soils may be differentiated on the basis of the ratio of free ferric oxide to nitrogen in the clay fraction. Where this ratio is less than ten the soil is a rendzina, where greater than ten a terra rossa. The study of the underlying calcareous material is nearing completion, but indications are that there seems little prospect of this factor accounting for the formation of these two groups of soils. (e) Spectrochemical Invesligalions.\u2014All the samples in connexion with the factorial experiment designed to determine the influence of the three major components of plant ash (potassium, calcium and silicon) on emission by the minor components have been arced hut the examination of plates have been deferred pending the return of the officer concerned from overseas. As part of a detailed study of the lateritic soils of Western Aus tralia work has started on the spectrochemical analysis of 140 samples of gravel and fine earth from thirteen profiles. Increasing demands are being made for spec trochemical examination of samples other than soils or plants; during the year the miscellaneous samples included fish scales from healthy and unhealthy fi sh, scheelite samples from the Bureau of Mineral Resources, radioactive and other minerals from the Soutli Australian Department of Mines, and minerals from other sections of the Division. (/) Oeneral Soil Analysis.\u2014Laboratory examinationof soil samples collected by the Soil Survey Section and others continues to be a large and important part of the \\vork. ^ A new method for the removal and determina tion of free iron oxide in soils has been used successfully and faster methods for determination of total exchange capacity of soils are being investigated. The demand for the determination of both soluble and exchangeable cations in soils has increased considerably and the use of the flame photometry attachment ISTo. 9200 with theBeckman D[J spectrophotometer is under investigation. In the meantime, an accurate assessment has been made of the errors involved in the use of the Lundegardh airacetylene flame _ technique _ for the determination of calciuin, magnesium, potassium, and sodium in solutions containing various combinations of the four cations. (g) Chemical Analysis and Mineralogical Work.\u2014A detailed chemical and mineralogical study has been made of profiles of a number of the clay pit series of soils in the Barossa Valley, South Australia. The greater part of tlm subsoil samples consisted of very uniform-sized grains of quartz that showed consider able etching probably due to alkaline conditions. Illite as well as kaolin was present in the clay fraction. Work has commenced on a comprehensive chemical study of the illitic type of clay mineral that occurs extensively in Australian soils. (h) Rainwater Studies.\u2014Equipment has been designed in polythene to extract both cations and anions from rainwater by the use of exchange resins.(i) Aliscellaneous Investigations.\u2014Work is in pro gress at the Brisbane Regional Laboratory on a modi fication of the rapid Passon method for the determina tion of free carbonates in soils with a view to its adoption as a routine method in laboratory studies. Studies on the zinc status of the black earth soils have been continued with special emphasis on a method for the determination of zinc in soils in the presence of cobalt and copper. Studies are now being extended to the fractionation and determination of zinc content of a wider range of soils. The study of the equilibrium levels ol mineral nitrogen under grass in the black earths of the Darling Downs is being continued. Mineral nitrogen levels in the field were generally low, with a trend to a maximum in summer. The work is being extended to soils in continuous fallow, as well as soils under grass, samples being taken both from the surface and at depth. Some preliminary experiments on the rate of nitrification of added ammonia-H, using the Quastel and Lees perfusion technique, have been carried out. I he work on the chemistry and mineralogy of the lateritic soil derivatives in Western Australia has con tinued at the Perth Regional Laboratory on the thirteen representative profiles previously sampled. Consider able progress lias been made with the study of the clay mineralogy which is being covered by the X-ray section of the Physics Department of the University of Western Australia. The examination of atmospheric salt accession to three inland centres, Dwellingup, West Pingelly, and Kojonup, has proceeded for a further year. Regular analyses of the rainfall have shown that the amount received at Kojonup. 90 miles from the coast, is approxi mately half that received at Perth, four miles from the coast, riie composition of the rain varies considerably from sea-water in calcium content, as suggested by some earlier woik by the Division. The rain analyses are continuing for a further period with modifications in collecting technique. The use of synthetic ion exchange resins for extracting anions and cations from rainwater has proved reasonably successful but the technique requires perfecting. 5. Soil Miceobiology. (Division of Soils.) (a) 1 race Elements and Microorganisms.\u2014Bioassays of fifteen rocks and 65 minerals were made for the amounts of iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and molyb denum available to slspergillus niger (Mulder's micron most commonly released were ironand molybdenum, followed by manganese then copper, and least of all zinc. Among' the minerals, those featur- ing micionutrient elements in their chemical formulae tended to be fairly good sources of these elements, butcertain minerals not suspected of containing micro- nutiient were also found to provide them in moderate amounts. _ Despite widespread belief, the ferro-mag- nesian minerals are not always good sources of avail able micronutrients. Theoretically the fungus Curcularia which producesno organic acids should be a closer approximation a lugliGr plant tlian the large acids.' In comparativestudies, however, both give similar bioassay results, i lus suggests that exchange of hydrogen ion for tracemetal cations is not the mechanism -whereby moulds acquire micronutrients. Further studies have shownthat contact between hyphae and soil is not necessary except in ca]careou.s_soils where both fungi have difii-oulty in acquiring iron and manganese adsorbed oncalciimi carbonate. A reducing substance, such asascorbic acid non-toxic chelating agent, such asdisodium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate iron and manganese '16 In attempts to develop bioassay methods for avail able boron and cobalt, no small organisms were found which showed deficiency symptoms except the alga Chlorella vulgaris and the floating aquatic plant Lemna minor for boron. Smaller amounts of vitamin Bis were synthesized by microorganisms in cobalt-deficient soil than after the addition of cobalt. ISTone of theseorganisms was satisfactory for bioassays so this work was abandoned. Using a macro-respirometer developed in this laboratory, studies have been made of the influence of defi ciencies of macro- and micronutrient upon soil microbial respiration. Deficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorusmarkedly reduce both oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output, lack of sulphur reduces respiration appreciably,deficiencies of potassium and magnesium have slightly adverse effects, but gross deficiencies of calcium and of trace elements have no effect\u2014suggesting that most soil microorganisms gain adequate amounts of micro- nutrients even from the most deficient soils. The fixation of phosphates by clays and by compounds ofiron, aluminium and calcium and the liberation of phos phorus from various phosphatic fertilizers and organic phosphates is being studied with the respirometer. (b) Subterranean Glover\u2014Bhiiobia\u2014Bhizosphere Interrelationships.\u2014Factors affecting the growth of strains of Bhizobium trifolii in the rhizosphere of sub terranean clover have been investigated. Some strains of rhizobia applied to the seed coat in the manner of commercial inoculation are able to form effective asso ciations with the subterranean clover plant when sown in pots of sterilized soil in the green house, but under natural conditions in unsterilized soils such strains are unable to establish themselves in the soil in the face of competition from the indigenous microflora. The plant then shows symptoms of nitrogen deficiency in the absence of effective nodulation. Where a number of strains of rhizobia, either inoculated or indigenous to the soil, are competing for sites of nodule formation, some are more successful in their ability to produce nodules than others. In selecting strains of B. trifolii for purposes of commercial inoculation, it is essential to select those which are well adapted to a saprophytie existence in the soil and which will readily proliferate in the rhizosphere under the influence of root excretions. Those which readily establish themselves from the inoculum carried on the seed and can maintain a sapro phytie existence in the soil over the summer period in the absence of the leguminous host have been termed \" incursivc \" strains. An empirical test for incursion has been developed by simultaneously inoculating a strain known to be efficient in its power of nitrogen fixation with one known to be inefficient. The resultant plant reaction indicates which of the two is the more incursive. Field evidence of the importance of incur sion as a property of rhizobia has been obtained from the failure of some strains to symbiose with subter ranean clover sown from inoculated seed in the first year. In other eases the benefits obtained by inocula tion have not been sustained after the first year, and plant yields with inoculated seed have ultimately declined below uninoculated controls. Here it is believed that the inoculated rhizobia have been unable to oversummer the hot dry period in the absence of the host plant. (c) Fractionation of Soil Humus.\u2014^Attempts have been made to fractionate humic acid into its component colloidal constituents by fractional parti tion and adsorption chromatography, and paper electro- phoresis, but without success. All constituents move as a single entity, suggesting strong bonding between them, so methods are being devised for severing some of these links, after which further attempts will be made to fractionate the acid.III. PLAHTiS. 1. Geneeal. In view of the importance of primary industries in the Australian economy the Organization has placed considerable emphasis on investigations of plant prob lems. Work in this field is undertaken mainly by the Division of Plant Industry which has head-quarters in Canberra and experimental farms and stations at a number of centres throughout the Commonwealth. The work of the Division of Plant Industry is described in this Chapter. Sections 11 and 19 describe the work of the Division of Biochemistry and General Hutrition on mineral nutrition of plants. Work on special local problems of irrigation districts is undertaken at the Commonwealth Eesearch Station (Murray Irrigation Areas) at Merbein, Victoria, and the Irrigation Eesearch Station (Murrumbidgee Irriga tion Areas) at Griffith, Hew South Wales (see Chapter IV.). The Division of Entomology is carrying out work on weed control, insect pests of pastures and crops, and insect vector's of virus diseases (see Chapter IX.). The Land Eesearch and Eegional Survey Section is carrying out broad-scale ecological surveys in the under developed arid and semi-arid regions of the continent to assess their land-use potential and investigate prob lems of agricultural and pastoral development. The work on the regional surveys is reported in Chapter XI., Section 2, and the (Section's investigations on crops, fertilizers, plant diseases, tillage, and native and introduced pastures under dry land cultivation at the Katherine Eesearch Station, and under irrigation at the Kimberley Eesearch Station, are reported in Chapter XI., (Section 3 et seq. Division of Plant Industry\u2014The work of the Divi sion is mainly directed to long-range or fund(ameutal research beyond the resources of the State Departments of Agriculture. Particular attention is given to proh- lems having a Commonwealth-wide rather than State importance. Much of the research of the Division is conducted at regional and field stations in many parts of the Com monwealth, with emphasis upon the problems of the pastoral industry, the fruit industry, and special crops such as tobacco and oil plants. Work is conducted at the head-quarters and main laboratories at Canberra and Dickson Experiment Station, Australian Capital Territory (which also acts as a regional field station) and at the following centres;\u2014Institute of Agriculture, Hedlands, Western Australia (pasture studies and plant introduction); Glen Lossie Field Station, Kojonup, Western Australia (pasture Intro (plant introduc tion) Ap'icultural Eesearch Institute, Adelaide, Eegional Laboratory, Tasmania (apple investigations); Falkiner Memorial Field (Station and Eegional Pastoral Laboratory, Deniliquin, Hew South Wales (pasture studies); Eegional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, Hew South Wales (pasture studies and plant intro duction) ; Mitchell Laboratory, Trangie, Hew South Wales (pasture studies, with Hew South Wales Depart ment of Agriculture); Plant and .Soils Laboratory, Brisbane, Queensland, and Strathpine Experiment Station (pasture studies, plant introduction) ; Cooper Laboratory, Lawes, Queensland (pasture studies) ; Ayr, Quemsland (tobacco, with Queensland Department of Agriculture); Katherine Experiment Station, Katherine, Horthern Territory (plant introduction and tobacco). In addition, extensive trials are conducted on leased or private properties in districts outside the regional centres. Many of the research projects are carried out in conjunction with the State Departments of Agriculture and the Universities.17 During tlie year considerable attention was given to the re-organization of the activities of the Division. Increased emphasis has heen given to fundamental studies and the work on plant chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, genetics, and cytology will be extended. Three Senior Eesearch Fellows have heen appointed. To accommodate these increased activities there has been erected at the head-quarters of the Divi sion a number of new buildings and glasshouses. Dr. J. Griffith Davies, Associate Chief of the Divi sion, was transferred to Brisbane to take charge of expanded research on lagricultural prol)lenis of Queens land. The Queensland Pasture Liaison Committee was established with the purpose of assisting in the inter change of information on pasture research in Queens land and to co-ordinate the activities of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, the Division of Plant Industry, and the University of Queensland. Also during the year that portion of the plant physiology work formerly located at the Waite Agricul tural Eesearch Institute was transferred to Canberra. FTew laboratories were designed and equipped, includ ing three growth rooms for plant hormone assay inves tigations. In conjunction with the Central Experi mental Workshops a prototyjje controlled environment room has been installed and tested. Information from this model will be incorporated in further rooms. These will provide excellent facilities for a wider range of investigations for which close control of the major environmental factors \u2014 temperature, light, and humidity\u2014is necessary. Officers of the Division co-operated in a \" Conference Tour \" for research and extension officers concerned with jjasture development in the Southern Tablelands region of Wew South \"Wales. The object of the tour was to discuss the practical application of research results indicating that the carrying capacity of the region could be increased at least threefohl by correcting soil deficiencies. A similar tour is being arranged for the northern Tablelands region. In conjunction with the Victorian Department of Agriculture, the Division co-operated in organizing a Commonwealth conference of tobacco technical officers at Myrtloford, Victoria. A Plant Introduction Con ference was hold in Canberra and was attended by representatives of Universities, Commonwealth Govern ment Departments, and the Organization. Dr. J. Griffith Davies led the Australian delegation to the sixth International Grasslands Congress held at Pennsylvania, United States of America. Dr. Davies was also a member of the combined team of United FTations Food and Agriculture Organization exports which was formed at the request of the Government of Pakistan to advise on the development of Baluchistan. The Division has representatives on lunnerous co ordinating and joint committees comprising representa tives of Commonwealth and State Government Depart ments, Universities, farmers' organizations, and other Divisions. An officer of the Division is the official Australian member on the International .Seed Testing Association. 2. Pr.ANT Intkoduction. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Iniroduction and Exchange of Plants and. Seeds. \u2014There was a decrease in the numljer of seed samples received from abroad during the year, largely because there were no officers collecting overseas. TTeverthe- less, over 1,300 samples were received, mostly from re search workers in the Mediterranean countries and Africa with whom personal contact was established in F.5189.\u20142the previous year by the plant exploration team. Be sides the usual close quarantine examination to which all samples are subjected, additional precautions were taken against the introduction of new virus diseases by growing all legumes introduced under controlled condi tions and examining for the presence of virus. Over 900 samples of seed of Australian plants were sent in exchange to overseas institutions mainly in the United States of America, Portugal, India, Kenya, and the United Kingdom. Ahout 900 introductions were dis tributed to institutions in Australia, particularly to the State Departments of Agriculture and Kew Guinea. (b) Planl Geography.\u2014Although officers were not collecting overseas during the year, plant exploration has had a dominating influence on the work of the plant introduction unit. Many varieties which had been collected in the Mediterranean region and in Africa were grown for the first time in quarantine nurseries at Canherra, Brisbane, Perth, and Katherine. In addition, certain groups were studied more inten sively at Canherra and Perth. Populations of many .Strains the grass genera Phalaris, Dactylis, Lolium, Trifolium and Medicago were compared inter se and also with standard Australian varieties. Detailed morphological and phonological observations were made as a basis for a.sscssmcnt of intervarietal and intravarietal differences. It is hoped that careful study of these differences will throw light upon the origin of the Australian varieties and their evolutionary development since establishment hero. Comparison of the performance of the strains in Australia with the climatic and other environmental conditions of their place of collection will assist in the critical evaluation of comparative climatology as a jjlant introduction technique. From the first season's trials, the value of the collections is already evident. They include numerous types differing greatly in maturity and other physiological characters. Many are earlier than any of the existing Australian varieties, and hence many prove valuable in marginal areas where the season is too short for the full development of the conuaercial strains. Earlincss in maturity w.as found to be associated with origin, especially at Perth where there was a range from extreme earline.ss, represented in strains from Cyprus, to lateness in strains from the nortliern Mediterranean countries and from Morocco. Trials .are being e.stabli.shed at several marginal centres in Mew South \"Wales, South Australia, and \"R^cstern jkustralia whore the survival of the strains under adverse conditions will be tested and their agro nomic value determined. At Canberra, Perth, and Armidalc quantitative growth studies were initiated andseed supplies are being built up from isolation plots at Canberra. A new vegetation map of Australia was completed and will he published as part of an atlas of Australian resources. A paper has also been com pleted dealing with the distribution of grasses through out the world and the significance of this distributionfoi plant introduction studies. A survey of regions for future plant exploration has highlighted the import- .ance of southern Mexico and Guatemala as a source aioa for tropical pasture legumes, esj^ccially species and Phaseolus. (c) Agronomic Trials.\u2014(i) South-eastern Australia. During the year, a technical officer was transferred to Armidale to take charge of plant introduction workin tbi.s region. This is in recognition of the increasing ini])oi'taiice of pasture investigations in northern Kew South \"Wales and the promising results obtained in introduction trials. At Armidale some of the intro- duced varieties of tall fescue have continued to be outstanding, while strains of chickpea from Spain andEritrea appear to be useful, drought-resistant, quick- growmg forage plants. north, at Crooble onthe north-western slopes, perennial summer-growino-18 grasses from South America and South Africa are outstanding. Sorghum almum is being sown on a large scale for grazing and seed production, while the Bambatsi strain of Panicum coloratum and the fine- leaved Katambora strain of Ehodes grass, both from Southern Rhodesia, are being developed as rapidly as possible. The trials in this region are being conducted in close co-operation with officers of the JSTew South Wales Department of Agriculture, while liaison is also maintained with the Soil Conservation Service in trials at several centres throughout the State. Agronomic work on Lathyrus ochrus and on canaigre (Bumex hymanoscpalus) has been completed. It was shown that the former is a useful green manure and cover plant for light soils in the irrigation areas. Canaigre, which is being tested as a tannin plant, has yielded well on light soils at Mildura and in Western Australia, but is unthrifty on heavier soils. Tannin analyses are in progress and will complete the assess ment of its economic potentialities. (ii) Queensland.\u2014^Nearly 700 new introductions were established in the quarantine nursery at Strath- pine, comprising principally large collections of pasture and crop plants from Africa. The grasses have been tested for hydrocyanic acid content and the legumes for alkaloids. Positive hydrocyanic acid reactions were recorded introductions of Andropogon. Chloris, Cynodon, Hyparrlienia, Leptochloa-, Pennise- ium, evaluation of this material will commence next season using methods of chemical appraisement and growth and development comparisons with outstanding introductions to be selected for bulk seed production. Later, environmental testing is planned for those pasture species exhibiting high levels of nutritional quality and vigour. The more f)romising pasture plants previously intro duced from South America and elsewhere were estab lished in seed production rows at Strathpine. Regional testing of these introductions has been continued at Maryborough, Kuraby, Lismore, and Cecil Plains. The tests include a study of the defoliation reactions, yield, and chemical composition of plants grown at different fertility levels. This permits the sorting of introduc tions into two groups\u2014one showing pronounced response to fertilizer which might be suppressed by inadequate water status, and the other revealing an uneconomic return under equivalent conditions. Among the grasses tested, Paspalum simplex is characteristic of the first group, and P. notaium of the second. P. nolaium has an excellent nutritive balance and is sufficiently aggres sive to compete with, and jjrobably replace, some inferior natural pasture species. P. simjAex also has aggressive habits, but, unlike P. notatu-m, its nutritive value falls off rapidly approaching maturity. Of the legumes, Stylosanthes does not respond well to fertilizers but undoubtedly has a place in the improvement of large areas of natural pastures. A strain of Desmodium uncinahim and one of Aeschynomene falcata have per formed well and will receive further attention. (iii) Northern Territory.\u2014The preliminary phase of introduced crop plant testing at Katherine, which has been in progress since 1947, has been almost com pleted. It has covered the examination of many varieties of oil plants, fibre plants, green manures, cover crops, and puhe crops to assess their adaptability to the climatic conditions and their potential economic value. Among the oil crops, sesame, rapeseed, sun flower, and peanuts have proved to be well adapted, and the best varieties have been released for more extensive testing under field conditions. Fibre plants, other than cotton, have shown little promise, though some varieties of roselle have given fair returns. Cow- peas, labial), and velvet beans are the best of the greenmanures, but only cowpeas are sufficiently early matur ing for Katherine conditions without supplementary irrigation. Some introductions of PhaseoLus are out standing as pulse crops, with high yields of protein- rich grain. There is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief that this genus will ultimately provide extremely important agronomic material for pulse cropping over a range of climatic and edaphic conditions in northern Australia. More than 200 species of pasture grasses have been tested, and a small group of species representing im portant African grasses has been studied more inten sively, both agronomically and chemically, over three seasons. Compared with six native species from the Kimberleys previously tested by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, the African introductions have less crude fibre and more protein. Even so, they have a very low nutritive value during the dry season, and it is considered that reliance will have to be placed on legumes to maintain nutritive values during this period. ISTone of the legumes so far tested is wholly satisfactory under Katherine conditions, though Stylosanthes bojeri from Tanganyika, and Teramnus lahialis from Malaya are promising. It is expected that the recent African exp)loration will provide better basic material for research in this field. (iv) Western Australia.\u2014About 430 new introduc tions have been grown at Kelmscott, including 130 which were studied in considerable detail as indicated in the discussion of plant exploration. Of the other intro ductions, the legumes proved to be interesting botanic- ally but generally disappointing agronomically, as most of them make ]3oor growth during the autumn and winter and were too late maturing. The grasses promise to be of more value, the best being annual species of Bromus and Phalaris. A critical comparative study is being made of many strains and species of Ehrharta which were collected in the Cape Province of South Africa. These include rhizomatous forms which may be better able to with stand heavy grazing than the perennial veldt grass which is widely naturalized in Western Australia. Replicated trials of croj) and pasture plants at Perth and Kojonup have generally confirmed the results of jirevious years. Close co-operation has been maintained with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture in the regional testing of more promising varieties, and many samples have been supplied for new co-operative trials at Carnarvon. (d) Systematic and Economic Botany.\u2014The acti vities of the herbarium were on a reduced scale during tlie year because of the absence abroad of the systematic botanist, who has bee)i seconded to the Kew Herbarium for two years as Austi'alian liaison officer. Several important collections were received, including notably plants from Arnheim Land donated by Mr. L. Specht, New Guinea plants donated by Mr. J. S. Womer.sley, and Queensland specimens collected in the course of an alkaloid plant survey by Mr. L. J. Webb. Many of these have been mounted and laid in the herbarium, wliich now includes 27,877 specimens. 3. Pn.vNT Genetics. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a)_ Inheritance of Hard Earliness, subterraneum.\u2014The extension of^ subterranean clover into northern coastal regions of Kew South Wales is dependent on selecting varieties that_ produce a relatively high proportion of liard seed which does not germinate with the summerrains. Seedlings developed in the summer usually die off before the normal growing period in the winter.Hard seededness depends on environmental and geneti- cal factors, some varieties like Dwalganup and Kortham19 First Early consistently producing a high percentage of hard seed. Second generation progenies from crosses between these varieties gave significantly greater pro portions of hard seed than crosses such as Tallarook X Mount Barker. Tallarook has tended to become the standard variety in the coastal areas of Mew South Wales, but it often makes the bulk of its growth and sets its seed too late in the season. By crossing this variety with early ones, as Dwalganup and Mortham First Early, Fa segregates with vigorous growth and seed-setting earlier in the season have been produced. At the same time the inheritance of time of flowering and hard seededness are being studied. It appears that there may be a relation between earliness and hard seededness. A legume virus in the Bean Mosaic II group, although not causing severe damage in subterranean clover, was widespread in this species during the 1952-53 season at the Dickson Experiment Station, Canberra. It occurs sporadically in other areas in Australia and is carried by aphids. Varieties like Dwalganup, Mortham First Early, and Pink-flowered, with a lethal reaction to this virus in the glasshouse, apparently possess a degree of field resistance. The inheritance of the lethal reaction to this legume virus is being studied in the F^ progenies of appropriate crosses. (5) Relation Between Autotetraploidy and Virus Reaction in Trifolium subterraneum and Physalis floridana.\u2014It has been shown that doubling the chromosomes of a species does not always affect its reaction to viruses. In subterranean clover, the reaction to legume mosaic in a number of varieties is greatly increased in severity by doubling their chromosomes. Of the viruses which infect F. floridana, only the leaf- roll virus gives a markedly severe reaction with the autotetraploid of this species. ^ (c) Interspecific _ Ilyhridization in the Genus J halaris. Two sterile interspecific hybrids have been produced from the use of the annual P. minor as male parent, and the perennial P. tuberosa and P. caerulescens as the female parents. By doubling the chromosomes of the two hybrids with colchicine, fertile perennial, allopolyploid species P. tuherosa-P. minor With 56 chromosomes, and P. caerulescens-P. minor with 42 chromosomes have been produced. P. minorhas some ability to grow during cold weather, and isalso common as a weed in the wheat belt, so it is hoped that the new allopolyploids will be adapted to the wheat telt and also to the Southern Tablelands of Mew South Wales. {d) Ejfect of Autopolyploidy Species.\u2014111 siibterraiiGaii elovorj the aiitopolyj^loids of a numberof varieties are normal in appearance, and all are more vigorous than the diploids during the first four to sixvyeeks ot growth. In the Dwalganup variety, increaseddry matter production was maintained throughout the season by the tetraploid, but in the other varieties the diploids exceeded the tetraploids by the end of the season Although seed production was reduced in the tetiaploids, it was not serious enough to prevent their use. From the cross-pollinated white clover (Trifolium rcpens) a number of promising autoploid lines has been developed, and these appear to possess a greater abilityto stand up to hard conditions, such as dryness, than the c iploids. Some of the lines are more vigorous than the diploid, Jiave good seed yields, and loir cvanogenetic activity. Autoploid Medicago iribvlotdes lines have promiseand arc being tested further. Other species ofincluding lucerne, did not respond favorably to polyploidy.(c) Combination of Spotted-wilt Resistance, Fu.sarium-wilt Resistance, Eelworm de los Tempranos possesses a heritable resistance to spotted wilt, and techniques for incorporating this resistance into commercial-type hybrids with resistances to fusarium wilt and nematode have been developed. The resistance of Eey de los Tempranos is expressed by an ability to produce healthy shoots if infected. This physiological form of resistance is apparently recessive, and a low percentage of phenotypes possessing it is recovered in progenies. In conjunction with the Commonwealth Eesearch Station, Merbein, the project to develop commercially acceptable hybrids with nematode and fusarium wilt resistances has been taken a step further. Six promising hybrids have been selected from the progenies, three with determinate and three with indeterminate habit. The segregations for nematode resistance have not been clearly defined but indicate that the character is recessive. (/) Combination of Virus Resistance, Late Blight Resistance, and Desirable Agronomit^ Characters in the Potato (Solanum tuberosum).\u2014Leaf-roll resistance, as possessed by the Bismark variety and certain hybrids, appears to depend on a virus-inactivating system which keeps the virus concentration at a low level in infected leaves. This results in plants producing normally, and in a very low transmission of vdrus to the tubers. Where varieties or hybrids with this character become infected severely, leaf-roll transmission to the tubers is again restricted so that a proportion of them produces healthy plants. Further crosses have been made to incorporate this leaf-roll resistance character with resistances to viruses X and Y, and to the fungus late blight. 4. Structural Botany. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Development of Spikelets in Basal Sterile Speltoid Wheats.\u2014Progress has been made in the study ot the morphological and histological development of the spike in the basal sterile speltoids Sti and St2 and for comparative purposes in the vulgare varieties Yeoman and Victor. Prior to the differentiation of the first flower, primordium development is substan tially the same in all types. Only in failure to dif ferentiate basal flowers do Sti and St2 differ from the normally fertile types. I he tissues of the vegetative apex are clearly defined in three zones, namely:\u2014(1) a single outer layer of cells (dermatogen) which divide only by anticlinal walls except where a leaf primordium is initiated; (2) a second single layer of cells (hypodermis) which also divide only by anticlinal walls except where a leaf primordium is formed; and (3) a central core of cells within these two shells. The cells of the core divide by walls in various directions and are derived from^ a small group of cells at its apex. Leaves arise by_ divisions of the dermatogen and hypodermis whilst axillary buds are initiated by periclinal divisions in a plate of cells in _ the outer layers of the core. The spikelet^ primordia and the flower primordia arisehistologically as axillary buds, the empty glumes and lemmas as foliar structures. During the period of differentiation of the spike, leafinitials are formed in rapid succession but progressivelyfail to _ develop. When the \" inhibition\" to leaf jn-imordhim growth reaches a certain stage the dif- fereiitiation of axillary bud initials commences,hollowing a short transition period the growth of the20 foliar primordia is almost completely inhibited and the growth of the bud initials (spikelet primordia) becomes dominant. In most of the spihelets of St2 except the four or five nearest the top of the spike no fiower is formed in the axil of the first or second lemmas. In the more distal spikelets the second lemma may subtend a flower or an imperfect fiower or be completely sterile. In the remainder of the spikelets there is rarely any indication of the formation of any axillary initial at all. In Sti flower formation in the axil of the first lemma is comparable with that of the second lemma in Sto. The sterility of the basal lemmas is therefore derived from either initial failure to differentiate fiower primordia or the failure of the flower primordia to grow at any stage during their development. There is a definite trend to greater fertility in basal flowers from the centre to the tip of the spike. ,5. Miceobiologt. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Virus Investigations.\u2014(i) Reconstitution of X-infected Potato Varieties ly Chemotherapy.\u2014 Successful results were obtained by the use of the diaminotriphenylmethane dye Malachite Green. The potato variety under test, Early Carman, was grown as a bacterio.ogically sterile clone in complete nutrient. Small stem tips were floated in nutrient containing the Malachite Green so that they were completely exposed to its action for three weeks. The growing tips were then transferred again to nutrient without dye and when sufficient growth had occurred were tested for presence of virus X. One tip was free from X. It has now been clonally propagated and virus-free tubers will shortly be available for distribution. The tech nique is so simple that it should be possible to derive other virus-free varieties in a similar manner. (ii) Assessment of Virus Chemo-therapeutants.\u2014 Eecent work elsewhere has indicated that viruses might be controlled by chemical means. The growing of plants aseptically in culture solution appeared to offer a technique whereby they might be intimately exposed to test chemicals under controlled conditions. A co operative project was arranged with Taubmans Ltd., who supplied a range of chemicals for testing. Testing was begun using potato infected with virus X, grow ing in a complete nutrient to which the test chemical was added. So far only a few compounds have been tested. (iii) Host Range Studies of Lucerne Witches' Broom.\u2014Transmission studies by grafting and dodder (Cuscuta campestris) were terminated after some study of the symptoms produced on potato. The identity of witches' broom with tomato big bud was confirmed as much as it ever can be with a virus of this type. The great similarity of the Australian big bud virus to the American aster yellows virus also became very apparent in these studies. The investigations on witches' broom have been completed and written up as a series of three papers for publication. (b) Antibiotic Investigations.\u2014(i) In Vitro Tests of Commercial Antibiotics against Bacterial Pathogens of French Bean, Tomato, and Crucifers.\u2014Comparative in vitro tests have shown that streptomycin and aureo- mycin are more effective than bacitracin, chloromycetin, low as 0.25 p.p.m. has Tomato.\u2014Preliminary absorption studies showed that streptomycin was readily absorbed into the plant via the roots. It is remarkably stable in leaf tissue, being easily demonstrable by bioassay 63 days after cessa tion of treatment. It appears to become \" fixed \" in the tissue and is not transferred to young growing leaves. Marked phytotoxicity is evident at concen trations greater than 4 p.p.m. Treatment with 10 p.p.m. streptomycin for seven days, commencing within 72 hours of innoculation, prevents wilting of tomato by the pathogen but the organism is not killed and may be consistently re- isolated from the plant. (iii) Comparison of the Antibiotic Cycloheximide {Actidione) with \" P.A.C.A.\" against Dollar Spot of Turf.\u2014\" P.A.C.A.\" (phenylamino cadmium acetate) is an established turf fungicide. The opportunity offered by a severe outbreak of dollar spot in the summer of 1953 was taken to test the value of the antibiotic which is acclaimed as a good turf fungicide in the United States of America. Both treatments gave some control, but response was too slight to allow valid conclusions. (c) Rhizobium Strain Isolation and Testing.\u2014 Attempts to establish improved pastures in some areas of Xew South Wales (Wagga, Temora, Badgery's Creek, Camden Park) have failed owing to the dis appearance of the sown legume after the first season. One suggested cause of failure was ineffective nodula- tion. In co-operation with the Agrostology Section, strains of Rhizobium have been isolated from many hosts in these areas and tested for effectiveness in vitro. Many strains isolated from medics and clovers have been shown to be ineffective. Sub-tropical legumes under study in Queensland by the Plant Introduction Section have in many instances shown symptoms of nitrogen deficiency and ineffective nodulation. Where possible, isolates of Rhizobium have been obtained from odd plants that have been successfully nodulated naturally, and these are being tested for effectiveness in vitro. (d) Pasture Diseases in the Ninety-Mile Plain, South Australia.\u2014This co-operative project with the Division of Biochemistry and General Xutrition was completed after late season observations were made on the infection trial at Keith. Two types of bare patch, one caused by Rhizoctonia solani and one by nematodes, are easily recognizable and distinct. A third disease, \" General Unthriftiness \", is still obscure. Corticium praticola is definitely involved as a pathogen but its attack on the pasture appears to be conditioned by some nutritional condition not as yet understood. (e) Pine Tree Nutrition Experiments.\u2014These long-- term trials at Penrose and Woodburn have several years to run. Final measurements were made on plots of older trees at each of the sites in July, 1952, but plots_ of younger trees remain. All results point to a striking response of pines to phosphate on these poor podsoil soils, but it will be necessary for all trials to run to completion before the economics of phosphate application can be properly assessed. (/) Microbiological Population of Soils in Relationto Fertility Build-up^. Members of the agrostologygioup aie interested in the increment of soil fertility under subteiranean clover pasture and superphosphatedressing. Since microflora of the soil are intimately associated with structural and cherhical changes thatoccur, it is importpt to have some idea what ishappening to the soil flora under this regime of sub terranean clover and superphosphate. A start hasbeGii inadG of comparison bydGtcrminingj for tbo important groups of tbe21 soil microflora, tiie numbers which can normally he expected to he present in known fertile soils at dif ferent seasons of the year. Opportunity is being taken to check the microbiological status of variously treated soils in agrostological pot experiments at Canberra. (y) The Mechanism of Ion Beduction by Bacteria. \u2014-This project was begun at Eothamsted and was com pleted at the University of Melbourne. It was shown that the reduction of ferric compounds by bacteria occurs as a result of reducing conditions produced by dehydrogenase systems. It is suggested that this type of reduction may be important in supplying plant nutrients from iron and manganese oxides. (h) Effect of Microbial Activity on Phosphate Availability in Soil.\u2014Since phosphate availability in soil is of such great importance in pasture development, investigations have been commenced to determine whether micro-organisms play any significant part in the story. (i) Seedling Blight.\u2014A technique was devised for determining the population density of infective par ticles of Pythium in soil. Applying this technique to the soil of the Diclcson Experiment Station revealed that most of the Pythium particles were intimately associated with the colloidal coating of the sand grains and that the number of sand and other particles so infested was of the order of 1000/g. (;') Talce-all of Wheat.\u2014In a rotation experiment made in drums, there was an interaction of rotation and artificial infestation of the soil with a culture of the pathogen. Two years oats, two years Wimmera rye, and two years peas were each followed by higher yields of wheat than were obtained in any of six other rotations. In a parallel experiment, in which five of the elements of plant food were added to the soil in each of four years, there was no interaction of plant food and arti ficial infestation of soil. 6. Eeuit Investigations. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) At Hobart.\u2014(i) Physiology of Fruit in Relation to Storage Disorders.\u2014Comparison of varieties: The studies of light and heavy crop fruit of different varieties which gave valuable results in 1950-51 were continued, using, where possible, the same pairs of trees, The results were confirmatory; the change in cropping level from one year to the next did not affect the relationships between light and heavy crops. Progress of maturation: The progress of fruit development was continued in trees of light and heavy crop of two early maturing and two late maturing varieties of low and high disorder susceptibility. Breodcdoiun susceptibility in' relation to respiration during storage: The study of the progress of respira tion and change of protein content during storage in relation to the development of breakdown was com menced. An increase in protein nitrogen content was detected at the time of onset of breakdown. The effect of inanurial treatment on keeping quality and its relation to cell size and physiology: Eollowing evidence obtained last season that keeping quality appeared to be related to cell size and respiration per unit protein, plots were selected to study the effect on these variables in a range of cropping levels within a variety, and the effect of varying the nitrogen level alone and in combination with potassium and phosphorus. The elements were applied as sprays either just after petal fall during the period of fruit cell division or in January during the period of fruit cell enlargement. The effect of adding the growth substances 2,4-D and A.N.A. in the early sprays was also studied.Although this was the first season of treatment and residual effects from the former commercial manuring reduced the effect of the spray applications the follow ing results are indicated:\u2014 (1) There was no response in the fruit to the mineral elements of the early spray but there was a small response to growth sub stances. Satisfactory quantitative response to the later applications occurred and the method provides the means of inducing quick changes in mineral content. (2) There was a strong intercorrelation between the following variables :\u2014Percentage dis order, mean fruit size, cell volume, and respiration per unit protein, thus support ing the theory developed from the earlier survey of varieties that variation between trees in incidence of respiratory disorder may be due to difficulties in protein maintenance. (3) Respiration per cell, protein nitrogen per cell, cell volume, and respiration per unit protein were intercorrelated, which supports the theories of fruit respiration developed by officers of the Division of Food Preservation. (4) ISTo significant modifying effect of phosphorus and potassium on the action of nitrogen could be shown though there were indi:a- tions that the addition of phosphorus might reduce the E/P ratio and the incidence of disorder. January treatmont with nitrogen alone or in combination with potassium and phosphorus increased the E/P ratio and disorder above that of the controls. (5) The data showed an interaction between the disorder Jonathan spot and breakdown, each tending to suppress the other. This relationship had not been demonstrated previously. (6) A correlation between the incidence of rots developing in storage and the mean fruit size and other intercorrelated variables indicated a relation between fruit physiology and fungal development. (ii) Gas Storage Trial.\u2014From the results obtained in 1950-51 and 1951-52 it appeared that the conven tional gas mixtures containing carbon dioxide increased the susceptibility of Tasmanian varieties to scald and breakdown to a dangerous extent. The use of higher temperatures to counter this reduced the value of the method below economic levels. From physiological considerations and the results of a small experiment in an earlier investigation, it was considered desirable to test the value of storage in low concentrations of oxygen in the absence of carbon dioxide. Preliminary trials with the varieties Golden Delicious, Delicious, Granny Smith and Sturmer at 5 per cent, oxygen, 0 per cent, carbon dioxide at 32, 34 and 36\u00b0 F. have' shown that the method is very promising; scald and breakdown are reduced even at low temperature and texture greatly improved. The method is, however, inferior in control of colour change. (b) At Applethorpe.\u2014(i) Rootstoclc Trials.\u2014An attempt is being made to determine the relation between the time of blossoming and the cell number and cell size in Granny Smith fruits at maturity. Bain and Robertson have shown that, when cell division is com pleted at about 21 days after pollination, there is a wide range in cell numbers in young Granny Smith fruits. As the period of blossoming is of the order22 of ten days, it is possible tliat early and late pollinated flowers may differ in their rates of cell mnltiplication. Using fruit from the 1951-52 crop, it was found that the mean cell number for Granny Smith fruits is similar to that found by Martin and Lewis in. Tasmania, for apples from their source 1. The mean cell numbers for the fruits from the rootstocks studied are: jSTorthern Spy, 335 x 10'; Seedling, 331 x 10^; M XTI, 327 X 10'; M XVI, 312 x 10'. There is no apparent influence of rootstock on the mean cell number of fruits of Granny Smith. The mean cell volume is largest for fruits from trees on Xorthern iSpy stocks, which bore the largest fruits; and lowest for fruits from trees on M XII stock, which bore the fruits of lowest mean weight. From starch-iodine tests made with Granny Smith fruits from trees on different rootstocks, it appears that fruits from Seedling and Northern Spy stocks are more matured at a specified picking date than the fruits from trees on M XII and M XVI stocks. In the older established rootstock trials, the relative order for vigour of growth and for cropping remains unchanged. The stock trial with Delicious on the four Merton stocks, Essfour, Spy, and own-roots .shows, by girth measurement, that already at two years the trees on Essfour have made the greatest growth and the trees on Spy the least. (ii) Tree Replacement Investigation!,. \u2014 Arsenic accnmnilation in old apple orchards as a factor in tree replacement: This investigation involved the deter mination of the arsenic concentration of orchard soils in which it had accumulated as a result of regular spraying with arsenicals over a long period. It was concluded that, at the present levels, accumulated arsenic in old orchard soils is not responsible for the poor growth frequently made by replant trees. Root lesion nem-atodes and tree replacement: The first report on this investigation is in the press. The report embraces: (1) A study of the effect of Fratylenelius coffeae on the growth of quince, peach, plum, pear, apricot, walnut and grape. (2) A field trial to compare the growth of apple trees on the following rootstocks in nematode-infested soil: Mertons 778, 789, 793, and Northern Spy. (3) A study of population changes of P. coffeae under conditions of moist fallow. Under these conditions, soil was free of nemas in 8-9 months. (4) The evaluation of the following methods of control in glasshouse pot experiments with apple seedlings: fumigation with \" D.D.\", soil treat ments with different levels of sodium selenate and 66 per cent, bisdimethylaminophosphonous anhydride, air- drying infested soil for four months prior to planting. Soil fumigation was the most satisfactory treatment. Air-drying gave some measure of control. (c) General.\u2014(i) Thielaviopsis basicola on Lupinus angustifolius.\u2014A disease of New Zealand blue lupins at the Field Station, Applethorpe, was found to be caused by the fungus T. hasicola. This is the first record of the disease in Queensland. (ii) Collection and Identification of some Australian Nematodes.\u2014A large number of nematodes has been collected and identified. \"Work in this field is now restricted to plant parasites and suspected parasites. 7. Oil Chop Investigations. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Saffloiver (Carthamus tinctorius).\u2014The semi- drying oil from this plant is used as a linseed oil sub stitute and is especially valued for its non-yellowing properties and its suitability for alkyd resin preparations.(i) Variabilily and Inheritance Studies.\u2014-Extensive studies on safflower introductions have shown a wide range of variability of agronomically important cbaracters offering excellent conditions for a selective bi'ccding. After the breeding system of the crop and it.s artificial cross pollination technique wei'c deter mined, a series of intervarietal crosses were carried out for studies on the mode of inheritance of some characters and their utilization in improvement of the material. (ii) Selection and Yield Trials.\u2014As a result of .^election studies a number of improved lines have been developed. These have been submitted to extensive trials, under various conditions of growth, to determine their earliness of emergence, early growth and maturity, their yielding ability and oil content, and degree of spininess and rust resistance. In addition to a wide range of safflower adaptability, these trials have indicated a great yielding capacity of some strains under favorable conditions, comparable with the best in other countries. Also an increase in oil content from 28 to about 40 per cent, was found in some strains. (iii) Economy of Safflower Growing.\u2014Eegional trials were set up in conjunction with various State Departments of Agriculture to determine the relative aci'e yield value of safflower and linseed as compared with wlieat. Erom the results so far obtained, it appears that, under favorable conditions, the yield and monetary value of safflower per acre exceeded that of ]in.seed. The monetary returns per acre of safflower compared more favorably with wheat than linseed. (iv) Edible Oils.\u2014A safflower line was found which, owing to its oil quality, has great promise as an edible oil. A hybridization programme is under way to improve on some agronomic properties of this type. (b) Linseed.\u2014This crop, which is already grown commercially, needs some improvement of its yielding properties, oil content and oil quality, and resistance to diseases (ru.st pd pasmo). Yield trials have been set up to determine the performance of our hybrid lines originating from a cross of Walsh x Punjab. Some of these lines exceed the commercially grown variety Walsh in yield and oil quality, and combine the rust resistance of both parents. Studies on the degree of cross pollination in linseed and on the effect of harvesting at different stages on the yield and quality of the seed had been completed. _ (c) Castor Beans.\u2014Introductions of this important oil crop are being investigated, particularly as to their usefulness in commercial production. 8. Tobacco. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Leaf Quality.\u2014^The investigation on the effect of nitrogen and plant spacing on leaf quality was con tinued at Clare on the Tobacco Experiment Station of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. Nitrogen was applied at rates of 16, 24, 32 and 40 Ib./acre and plants were spaced at 15, 20, 30 and 35 inches in rows 4 feet apart. The general trend of the results was similar to that obtained in the previous season. Highest yield of good quality leaf was obtained withlowest nitrogen and differences between 24, 32 and 40 lb. nitiogen were not significant. There was a trendtoward highest yield at the 20-in. spacing. The quantityof leaf that cured green was greatest at 15-in. spacing and was mdependent_ of nitrogen supply. Althoughthe quantity and quality per acre were reduced by thewider spacings, the yield per plant was increased, so that It may be economical to reduce plant number per unit area.(h) Varieticn and Diaease J'esislancc.\u2014Thirteen hybrids containing the genetic factor for the necrotic type of resistance to tobacco mosaic wore grown at Clare. Those possessing the required agronomic characters were selfed and the p)'ogeny is now under test for retention of dominant factors for resistance. The effect of temperature on the resistance of tobacco l)lants carrying the necrotic type of resistance to tobacco mosaic is being investigated at Canberra. At tempera tures above 75\u00b0 F., inoculated plants arc severely affected and usually killed by vascular necrosis. With temperatures of the order of 100\u00b0 F. typical mosaic, mottle occurs. One of the varieties grown at Clare was not attacked by the looper caterpillar (Plusia spp.), a major pest in the district. Crosses were made to determine whether or not this character is inherited. A good response has been obtained to an Australia- wide appeal for seeds of native Nicofiana species. The material received is to be tested for disease resistance and examined for other characteri.stics likely to be of value. (c) Diseases and Disorders.\u2014An increase in the number of plants available for studies on the yellow dwarf virus disea.se was obtained by vegetative propa gation but the presence of the virus reduced the number of cuttings that rooted by 50 per cent. Cuttings from \" frcnchcd \" plants were affected similarly. The num ber of cuttings that rooted was not increased by treat ment with indolebutyric acid. Further attempts to transmit yellow dwarf mechanically or by dodder were not successful. A histological examination of yellow dAvarf plants failed to reveal abnormalities due to the presence of the virus. Frenching, a disorder of unknown cause, Avas Avide- spread in four acres of tobacco at the Katherinc Research Station, Northern Territory, and affected yield and quality to a marked extent. It also occurs in the Manjimup area of Western Australia and has been observed in north Queensland. A few lightly affected plants occurred at Katherine in earlier years but there was nothing to indicate that frenching could become of major importance. Although frenching is one of the earliest tobacco troubles to be described and is common in other countries, methods of control are uiiknoAA'n. Investigations on the relation of nutrition, soil, Avater supply, iSrc., to frenching are in progress both at Canberra and at Klatherine. Blue mould in the field is a continuing source of loss in all areas. Several surveys of field occurrence in one area did not reveal any major cause for differences in severity of symptoms such as could be used as a ha.sis for control. (d) Experiments in the Northern Territory.\u2014At Katherine Research Station, the testing of the levee soil for tobacco production was continued in collabora tion with the Land Research and Regional Survey Section. There Avere three times of planting extending from the end of May to early July, the total area planted being four acres. Total yield per acre was satisfactory but the proportion of good-quality leaf Avas low. Approximately one-third of the crop showed evidence of excess nitrogen and was quite unsuitable for flue-curing. A disorder knoAvn as frenching was wide spread, causing further loss in quantity and quality. Leaf texture Avas affected adAmrsely by Ioav atmospheric humidity and the same factor introduced difficulties in handling cured leaf. The 1,700 lb. of good leaf offered for sale at auction realized an average price of 127d. per lb., a A'ery satisfactory result. Experiments designed to obtain further information on niti'ogen requirements and on the causes of the severe outbreak of frenching are in progress. A small test plot has been established at the Ord Research Station.!). Tobacco CHKAriSTRA'. (Division of Plant Industry.) (\u00ab) Trashy Leaf Pheno7nenon in Tobacco.\u2014The prevalence of trashy leaf is causing a considerable loss to the Australian tobacco industry. The affected leaf is mainly characterized by loss of carbohydrates and increase in total nitrogen. Investigations have been extended to include study of qualitative and quantita tive changes in composition of glass-house plants which are subjected to treatments conducive to trashiness. Evidence exists that unfavorable energy status of a plant in terms of carbohydrate and nitrogen levels may lead to the phenomenon of trashy leaf in tobacco. This may also be responsible for unfavorable yields in other crops Avhen groAvn out of their environment. (h) Fluorescence in Trashy and Non-trashy Leaf.\u2014 Development of trashiness in tobacco is accompanied by decrease of fluorescent compounds in the affected leaf. This makes j)ossible detection of degree of trashi ness during sampling by observing differential fluores cence under ultra-violet light. The isolation and stability of the fluorescent compounds are being investigated. (<;) Flne-ciiring of Small Samples of Glass-house Tobacco.\u2014The quality of flue-cured leaf depends on conditions of groAvth and culture of the plant as well as the curing proces.s. For glass-hou.se experiments flue-curing procedure is essential for assessment of quality in experimental leaf. The curing of small samples of leaf and an investigation of their chemical composition is proceeding at Canberra. It was found (hat a good quality flue-cured leaf could be grown in the glass-house and, for successful curing, samples need not be larger than one leaf, providing adequate humidity is maintained in the curing chamber. (d) Studies of Plant Sugars.\u2014Further qualitative studies of sugars (by paper chromatography) in plant materials indicated a large fluctuation in relative pro portions of hexose and pentose sugars and aldo- and keto- forms. Thus, under conditions of environmental strain or disease, pentoses may accumulate, and tobacco samples have been obtained which contain up to 2 per cent, of arabinose. Special attention was given to the differentiation of keto- from aldo-sugars. A new specific reagent capable of identification of 5 ixg of keto-.sugar Avas dcA'eloped for the purpose. The presence of leaf-roll virus has a large quantita tive effect on the carbohydrate status of the potato plant and the fluorescence in the stems. Present work is directed to the quantitative and qualitative fluctua tion? in individual sugars and total carbohydrates occurring during progress of disease in infected plants. 10. Plant Ntjteition. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Characterizing Deficient Soils.\u2014Trials with potassium, copper, zinc, molybdenum, manganese, iron, magnesium, and boron on a number of soils on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales are being maintained. Responses to nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, calcium, molybdenum, and boron have been identified in this area. In trials at the F. D. McMaster Field Station at Badgery's Creek, a problem of symbiotic nitrogen fixa tion has been discovered. Legumes fixed little nitrogen and responded markedly to nitrogenous fertilizer. Lime improved the colour and groAvth of legumes on this soil. (b) Factors Affecting the Supply and Availability of Flements in the Soil.\u2014(i) Effect of Clover.\u2014An experiment to determine the effect of subterranean clover on the nitrogen status of soil is being continued at Canberra. The effect of the clover on the yield of a cereal crop Avill be measured.24 (ii) Combined} Eifects of Clover on tlio effect of suijerphospliate on clover and subsequent development of grass are being maintained for a second period of four years. (iii) Soil Reaction.\u2014The effect of lime in increasing yields of clover has been examined. Information has been obtained on the role of lime on some of the soils of the Southern Tablelands and at the Heytesbury Forest area in Victoria. Some of these trials are heing maintained to examine later effects of lime. (iv) Nodnlation and Nitrogen Fixation.\u2014It has been shown that normal nodnlation of clover can be obtained on acid soils on the Southern Tablelands by drilling inoculated clover seed with only 2 cwt. of lime per acre. The role of lime in improving nodnla tion is being examined. (c) Factors Affecting the Response to Fertilizers.\u2014 (i) Tnteractions between Elements.\u2014Information on the interaction between elements has been obtained in many experiments. Long-term experiments to study the interaction between phosphorus and sulphur are being maintained. (ii) The Residual Effect of Fertilizers.\u2014Field ex periments with fertilizers are being maintained to obtain further information on the residual effects of the different elements. Information on residual effects up to .six years have been published. (iii) Form of the Fertilizers.\u2014The shortage of sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphate has stimulated work on rock phosphate. Responses to rock phosphate have .so far been considerably less than responses to superphosphate, even where sulphur deficiency is corrected. The trials will be maintained for several years to determine subsequent effects. fiv) Fertilizer Placement.\u2014Trials to determine effects of lime and copper placement on the soils of the Heytesbury Forest area have been laid down. (d) Characterizing Deficient Plants and Defining the Role of Elements in Plants.\u2014(i) Mineral Content. \u2014Information on the differences in the nutrition of various plant species is recorded in the experiments. (ii) Organic Constituents.\u2014Deficiencies of a num ber of the elements influence protein metabolism. Work has been commenced to study the effect of deficiencies of essential elements on the amino acid composition of plants. The effect of deficiency of molybdenum on the nitrate, ammonia, amide, amino acid, and protein content of plants is being studied. The molybdenum treatment is applied from one hour to three days before harvest. The results so far suggest that molybdenum is especially needed for the initial reduction of nitrate. (iii) Biochemical Reactions.\u2014Studies on the in vivo effect of molybdenum on phosphataso activity are being continued. Lower molybdenum concentrations than tliose previously used are being tested to minimize the influence of inorganic molybdenum. Previous Avork has shoAvn that molybdenum inhibits phosphatase activity in vitro. (iv) Symptoms.\u2014Symptoms of deficiencies obtained in the course of the A\\'ork are photographed and described.each case: deficiencies of phosphorus, nitrogen, zinc, and copper have been found to vary in degree accord ing to the soil type, and so marked differences in species adaptability haA'e become apparent. A programme of work has been initiated which aims at providing information of a more detailed character Avhich should simplify the solution of these .subsidiary problems. This Avill entail more intensive work undei' controlled conditions of the glass-house rather than extensive field studies such as have been conducted in the jDast. The need for this basic detail has been stressed by the frequency with which uncer tainties arise in complex field experiments; and the stage has been reached at which the Division can make its best contribution to pasture development in the Coonalpyn DoAvns by investigating intensively the plant's nutritional requirements of zinc and copper and the function of these minor elements in the general physiology of plants. The greater proportion of the subsidiary problems in fhi.s area are such as may be solved by intelligent application of knowledge already provided by the Divi sion. Some of those \\Adiich concern the whole area are, lioAA'ever, being studied with the help of field experi ments. A series of experiments have been initiated to provide basic knoAvledge of the factors which control the uptake of cobalt by plants. It is unlikely that plants require this element for their own function. This point, how- evei', is being investigated. 11. Mineral fSluTiUTiON of Plants. (Division of Biochemistry and General fSTutrition.) The large-scale development which has folloAved the solution of the overall nutritional problem in the Ninety-Mile Plain, has roA'ealed many subsidiary prob lems associated Avith particular soil types, some of which have been subjected to experimental inA^estiga- tlon, Bj-oadly, the initial problems are the same in12. General Chemistry. (DiAusion of Plant Industry.) (a) Chemical Techniques.\u2014(i) Determination of Sulphur in Soils.\u2014A method has been developed for the rapid determination of total sulphur in soils. This method depends upon the fusion of 0.5 g of 50-mesh soil with 1.4 g sodium peroxide in a nickel crucible. The cooled melt is then dissoh'ed in hydrochloric acid and iron and aluminium precipitated as hydroxides by the addition of ammonia. These are then removed by centrifuging. Sulphur is then estimated in the super natant liquor as barium sulphate by turbidity measure ment after adjusting the pH. (ii) Determination of Molybdenum in Soils.\u2014A method for the determination of molybdenum in soils is being inA'estigated. (b) Nutrient Availability. \u2014 (i) Sulphur. \u2014 The chemical factors concerned in the availability of soil suljihur to plants are being investigated. Examination of a number of soils from eastern Australia from areasof moderate to high rainfall show A'ery low free sulphate sulphur. The total .sulphur in these soils is correlatedAvith total carbon and nitrogen which appears to indi- rate that, in general, the greater proportion of sulphurin tho.se soils i.s organic in nature. The carbon: sulphur ratio has been found to vary from 41:1 to 177:1 with an aAnrage value of 103:1. The total soil sulphur shoivs some relationship to thesulphur taken up hy plants in pot culture experiments, but thus relationship is poor and there is an influence ot soil type. (li) Phosphorvs.~Ey successive extraction of soilswith acetic acid and sodium hydroxide it is possible toestimate two .available fractions of soil phosphorus,which can be used as an index of phosphorus avail- a I I ,y on any one soil type provided correlations are, made with field or pot culture responses. Theab,solute availability of these fractions, however, isgoverned hy a number of soil factors such as pH, phosphate adsorption capacity, and the exchangeablecations. The interactions of these chemical factors on26 the absolute availability of the soil phosphorus as measured by plant uptake are being examined so that the method can be adapted to conditions which will he independent of soil type .and intersoil variation. (iii) Molyhdenum.\u2014The availability of molyb denum to the i^lant is influenced markedly by the soil pH. However, other soil factors also influence molyb denum availability considerably. Glass-house and laboratory experiments are being conducted to investi gate these, particularly the absolute amounts of molyh denum and the nature of the free iron oxides present in the soil. (iv) Manganese.\u2014Although the chemistry of man ganese in soils has been widely studied, it is not known how the available oxides persist in soils. Laboratory and pot investigations are in progress on the reactions of manganese in both healthy and efficient soils, par ticularly (1) the non-biological reduction of manganese dioxide in soils to see if there are differences in reducing ability or organic matter, and (2) the adsorption of the manganous ion by solid phase components of soils. (v) Uiilization of Copper hy Oats.\u2014An examination is being made to determine whether varieties of oats differ in the efficiency with which they utilize copj)er within the plant and hence whether they could tolerate differing severities of copper deficiency. Four varieties of oats (Ave7ia saliva), Roteuburger oats (A. strigosa), and rye cereal (Secale cereale) were gi'own in the glass house on a normal and a copper deficient soil. Harvests were made at the flowering stage and at maturity. Analyses are being made of the leaf, stem, and grain of these plants to determine the concentration and dis tribution of copper within the plant. Analyses are not yet complete, but those so far available indicate that, although there were differences in the visual symptoms of copper deficiency between the four different varieties of oats, there appears to be little difference in the uptake of copper from the deficient soil or in the copper contents of the individual plant parts. All failed to set grain on this soil. On the other hand the Roteuburger oats and the rye cereal each had a greater copper uptake than the oat varieties, both from the copper deficient and from the norm.al soil. The amounts of copper taken up by the plants were\u2014 from the copper deficient soil, A. sativa, 6-7 /ig A. /ig per plant; and from the normal soil 21-CO 50 gg, and .30 /rg respectively. 13. Plant Ecology. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Regional Vegetation Surveys.\u2014Surveys for the j^urjjose of classifying and mapping plant communitiesaie in progress in the Southern Tablelands, Maequarie and Hew England regions of Hew South Wales, southwestern Queensland, and the rain forest regions of Queensland and northern Hew South Wales. Thesurvey in Hew England is nearing completion, themajor plant communities have been classified and'partof the area mapped. Reconnaissance surveys in the Maequarie region have been completed and species listscompiled for twelve major plant communities. Soil- plant interrelation shijis on part of the south-western Queensland region have been determined, and a paperembodying the results of this work will be publishedportly. The surveys in the rain forest and the Southern lablelands are in the initial stages. (I) Studies on Native Grasslands.~(i) Ecological Studies on Treeless Grasslands.\u2014Studies treeless grassknds in south-eastern Australiain relation to soil, climate, and fire are in progress.Particular attention is being devoted at present to the subalpine grasslands of the Monaro region. These in vestigations include studies on the origin of the treeless areas as well as the changes in their botanical composi tion as a result of grazing and disturbance by man. All experimental area has been established at Seventeen Plain in the Kosciusko Park Trust Area, for detailed studies. (ii) Grazing Management Experiment, Trangie, A eir South MMles.\u2014This project is being conducted in co-operation with the Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture, and is designed to obtain informationconcerning the proper management of semi-arid Stipa- Chloris pastures. The effect of various stocking rates and systems on the yield and persistence of the perennial grasses and the wool production and liveweights of Merino wethers is being studied. The favorable climatic conditions during 1952-53 tended to reduce any differential effect of stockingrates but the heaviest rate tended to reduce the produc tion of green feed and this was reflected in the wool yields of sheep from such treatments. (iii) Aiitecological Studies on Native Grasses.\u2014Detailed life-history studies of four native perennial grasses and three winter annuals have been completed. Information was obtained on germination, seedlingestablishment, seasonal production, seed production, and root development. A study is in progress of the incidence of Bothrio- cliloa ainbigua in the Danthonia pastures of the Southern Tableland and its relationship to grazing and erosion. (c) Ecological Studies on Weeds.\u2014(i) Slceleton Weed (Chondrilla jiincea).\u2014^A survey of the distribu tion of skeleton weed has been completed and the area has been mapped. Within the climatic limits of its distribution skeleton weed density ajipears to be strongly correlated with the degree of soil disturbance. The effect of competition from introduced pasture species on the growth of skeleton weed is being studiedat Cowr^ Hew South Wales, and Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The results of the first year's work indicate that subterranean clover is the most effective competitor of the species used. Detailed studies of the factors involved in competition between skeleton weed and pasture plants of different growth habits are under study at Canberra. (ii) Hoary Cress (Cardaria draba).\u2014The role of chlorinated phenoxyaeetic acids is being at Murtoa, Victoria. (iii) Relationship of Fertilizers and Feeffs.\u2014Theeffect of annual applications of nitrogen, phosphorus,and potassium on the winter weed population under citrus trees at Griffith, Hew South Wales, was determined (Trasses predominated where nitrogen and phosphorus were added, medics were phosphorus alone,and capeweed (Cryptostcmma calendulaceum) where nitrogen alone was applied. (iv) Distribution of_ Introduced Weeds in South east Australia. The distribution of introduced weedsin relation to climate, soil, and land use is beingstudied. The general distribution of the principal weed species of Victoria has been determined and this IS being related to environmental factors. (v) The Ecology of Aquatic Plants.\u2014During 1952a study was eomnieneed of the distribution of aquaticplants in irrigation channels in relation to such factorsas water depth, channel cross section, turbidity of thewater, and rate of water flow. A preliminary recon naissance of irrigation channels in north-west Victoria and in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area has26 I)ecn completed. This work should assist in formulat- i]ig methods of controlling those aquatic plants which impede water flow during the irrigation season. (at) Ecology of Rain Forests.\u2014The Australian rain forests possess unique features which make them of considerable interest to botanists both here and abroad. In spite of the fact that Australian rain forests have been utilized for timber production for many years, very little is knoAvn of the interrelationships of the in dividual species or of the ecological relationships of the communities concerned. 14. Pasture Investigations at Canberra, Ai'STrai.ian Capital Territory. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Species and Strain Investigations.\u2014 (i) Sub terranean Clover.\u2014-The plant collecting expedition to the Mediterranean area in 1951 provided some 60 collec tions of Trifolium suhterraneum from sites extending from Turkey to Prench Morocco. These were the first introductions from the Mediterranean area to Aus tralia in which full details of the habitat and mode of occurrence were known. In 1952 rows of single plants of each of the introduc tions and of some 60 of the varieties previously col lected under field conditions in Australia were planted at Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, and at Kojonup, Western Australia. Detailed quantitative and qualitative observations were made on all plants. The objective was threefold. Firstly, it is hoped that these new introductions may provide material of direct commercial value in Australia; secondly, the com parison of the \" Australian\" and Mediterranean material may permit some deductions regarding the origin of the Australian varieties, whether by inde pendent introduction or by evolution in Australia; and thirdly, it permits comparison of material from various parts of the Mediterranean basin. The range of maturity of the whole Mediterranean collection exceeds that of the Australian material, hut the range of maturity from any particular zone in the Mediterranean is relatively restricted. (ii) Annual Medics.\u2014In conjunction with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, long-term trials have been in progress to determine whether suit able annual medics can be found for the wheat and sheep areas where conditions are unfavorable for sub terranean clover. The trials at Wagga, Temora, and Croohle have shown that a strain of Medicago tribuloides (No. 173) is superior to all others so far tested. It is now to he certified by the Department of Agriculture and arrange ments have been made for commercial production of seed. Further co-operative trials have been established at Condobolin and Trangie, which are further west than the trials previously undertaken. An investigation of soil factors influencing the relative development of medics and of subterranean clover is being conducted at the Temora Experiment Farm to secure more precise information on the soil requirements of each. The information from this trial should permit a more accurate definition of those areas where each can be most usefully employed during the pasture phase in the wheat rotation programme. A study of factors influencing the production of hard seed in medics showed that while seed dehydration exerts a major influence on development of impermea bility in the seed coat, the amount of nitrogen available to the plant during its period of growth is also signi ficant, a higher level promoting more hard seed forma tion.A number of new introductions of medic species and strains collected by the Mediterranean expedition are- being examined at the Dickson Experiment Station and compared with material previously obtained from Aus tralian and overseas sources. (iii) Grasses.\u2014Phalaris tuherosa and Wimmera rye- grass are the standard sown grasses in the Southern Tablelands environment. Many other species are under test, and those which appear promising are cocksfoot, liromvs inerinis, B. unioloides, B. niarginatus, B. roloratus, arundinacea (Kentucky 31). The work aims to dete'rmine whether these species can be most effectively used in combination with the standard species or whether they are best grown in alternate mixtures. To date none of the newer species has out-yielded the standard species but there are indications that with increasing soil fertility some of them may prove superior at certain times of the year. So far the addition of various grass species to a mixture of Phalaris and sub terranean clover has tended to depress the total yield although increasing the proportion of grass to legume. A trial to study the influence on production of herbage from Phalaris tuherosa when drilled in 7, 21, or 35 in. spaced rows, growing in association with subterranean clover, has shown that although the grass production per acre from the standard 7 in. drill rows has at first been greater than the wider spacings, the difference is becom ing progressively less owing to the relative increase in vigour of the plants at wider spacing. The produc tion of the subterranean clover has varied inversely with the grass production so that there has been little significant difference between total production of her bage from any of the treatments at the end of the growing season. The sowing of Phalaris in widely spaced rows means a considerable reduction in cost of establishment. (b) Fertility Studies.\u2014 (i) The Rate and Nature of Fertility Lift by Subterranean Clover\u2014During the ]mst 30 years, \" improved pasture \" in southern Aus tralia has attained an estimated area of 22,000,000 acres. In all instances it has iiwolved the use of superphos phate and a suitable legume, principally subterranean clover. Trace elements, copper, zinc, and molybdenum, are required as additional fertilizers over considerable areas. In many regions, the practice has not been aimed only at fertility maintenance or the achievement of some degree of improvement, but rather at the con- \\-ersion of poor and even worthless land to a high degree of productivity. There are few instances in the world of so dramatic an improvement in fertility and produc tivity over such extensive areas as those now being developed by the use of sown pastures in these cool and warm temperate regions of Australia. Yet little is known of the rate or character of this fertility lift. A project commenced in 1952 aims at the detailed study of this phenomenon. A survey has been made of the fertility status of 45 paddocks of varying top- dressing history on the granitic sandy loams of the Crookwell-Binda area. New South Wales. Fertility has been assessed both through the growth and response to applied nutrients of oats in pot culture on each of the soils and by the chemical analysis of the soil and the oats. The untreated soils of the region are seriously deficient in phosphorus, sulphur, and nitrogen; the first two of these elements are supplied in the superphos phate, the nitrogen through the rhizohial activity of the subterranean clover. The survey has shown thatdeficiency of each of these elements is largely but not fully met after 25 years of clover involving applicationof 13 cwt. of superphosphate. The increase in nitrogen content of the soil shows close linear relationship to thereadily extraetahle soil phosphorus over all 45 paddocks27 examined, witli an increase of soil nitrogen from 0.05 per cent, in tlie untreated paddocks, still carrying native pasture, to 0.20 per cent, in those with the longest history of improvement. Of the applied phosphorus, approximately half occurs in the acetic acid soluble and sodium hydroxide soluble fractions, the balance iu the organic form. Soil analysis also shows that the ratio of the increase in soil sulphur and the increase in soil phosphorus due to superpihosphate application is almost precisely the same as that of the applied fertilizer, suggesting that sulphur is as insusceptible to loss by leaching or other means as phosphorus is already known to be. Studies are continuing both on this soil type and on two other soil types\u2014those of basaltic and of sedi mentary origin\u2014within the region. (ii) Influence of Pasture Species.\u2014A trial has been established to determine the influence of individual species of grasses and legmnes growing in pure culture on soil structure measured in terms of aggregation and pore space. The species under trial Temora and Wagga, areas, on which various species and strains of medic and subterranean clover have been growing in association with Wimmera rye grass for a period of three years, are being cropped with wheat to determine their influence on the yield of the cereal crop. A trial to determine the influence of volunteer pasture subterranean clover and a mixtnre of P. tuherosa and sul terranean clover for various periods of time on soil fertility measured in terms of subsequent wheat yield is in progress at the Dickson Experiment Station. (iii) Nitrogen and Phosphorus Turn-over by Pasture and Animals.\u2014The carrying capacity of a mixed pas ture is not only related to level of soil fertility hut to the rate at which nutrients go through the cycle of soil- plant-animal and back to soil again. The rate of uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus and the competition for these nutrients by Wimmera ryegrass and subterranean clover is being measured on soils with varying levels of these nutrients. Yield data indicate that six weeks' initial growth of subterranean clover seedlings, prior to germination of Wimmera ryegrass on the same soil, practically nullified response by the ryegrass to an initial application of 30 lb. of elemental nitrogen per acre. Thus, the competition by the clover for nitrogen is of undoubted significairce in a mixed pasture of these tAvo species. (iv) Nutrient and Light Competition.\u2014Studies of the component factors of the competition between pas ture plants are being continued. A specially designed pot culture has permitted for the first time a study of the relationship of competition for light and for nutrients. They are closely interdependent phenomena but it is only by their study as separate and interacting factors that a full appreciation of their significance is possible. Their interaction is a variable phenomenon, depending on such factors as fertility status and stage of growth. (c) Management.\u2014(i) Conservation Effect on the Animals.\u2014Though improved pastures under continuous grazing can give more than threefold increases in wool production or sheep liveweight production or both over untopdressed native pasture, this is achieved under a system that allows up to 50 per cent, of the feed pro duced to be left unconsumed by the animal. Though the nutrients in this unconsumed herbage are not neces sarily lost to the soil, they could be used to better advan tage if returned through the animal as conserved fodder. Various degrees of pasture conservation and therefore of utilization are being compared in a long-term trial in which five equal areas are e\u00abch carrying the samenumber of sheep continuously but in four of them various proportions are shut up during the spring time for fodder. The sheep are then maintained on the lierbage production on the balance of each area until such time as their body weights indicate that they are getting insufficient feed, when the conserved fodder is fed back to them as required. During the first twelve months of the trial each treat ment carried four sheep per acre and even where two- thirds of the paddock was shut up and 6 cwt. of hay conserved per head, the sheep gained as much weight as those on the treatment where sheep had the run of the full grazing area and more was set aside for fodder conservation. (ii) Conservation Effect on the Pasture.\u2014Measure ments of pasture groAvth rate are being undertaken to determine the reaction of the pasture to the various intensities of grazing operative in the previous trial during the period when various portions of the grazing areas are set aside for fodder conservation. On another trial, surplus spring growth is being taken off for silage or for hay, and the regrowth of pasture the folloAving year related with the method of conservation and its productivity. The results so far indicate no depression in total autumn, winter, or spring growth during the year following the removal of the surplus spring growth. Though the grass was reduced in vigour and production, this was compensated by a greater production by the clover component. 15. Pasture Investigations at Armidale, Heav South Wales. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Ecological Surveys.\u2014(i) New England Region. \u2014The mapping of this region is being continued. The following great soil groups have been shoAvn to occur in tlie area\u2014krasnozem, prairie soil, black earth, and lateritic kraznozem basalts; red and yellow podzolic and lateritic podzolic soils on the granites and sedimentary rocks. Savannah ivoodland and forest formations dominated by species of the genus Eucalyptus (47 specie.s occur in the area mapped to date) characterize the native vegeta tion. The area is one of active eucalypt speciation, suspected hybrids being a common occurrence. A num ber of native pasture types haie been Cyperaceae are important. (ii) South-ivestern Queensland.\u2014An area of 4,000 square miles, representative of the general area included in this survey, has been mapped in detail. Fourteen vegetation associations have been recognized and mapped as association complexes. Six great soil groups have been identified and mapped. The climatology of the area has also been studied and information collected on the effect of management practices on the native pastures. In addition a detailed field reconnaissance of 20,000 square miles has been undertaken and the soils and plant-soil relationships studied. (b) Autecological Studies of Native Pasture Species. \u2014The following information is being collected on a number of native pasture species: (i) general pheno- logical record ; (ii) seasonal growth under conditions of measured soil moisture; (iii) seasonal changes in chemical composition; and (iv) effect of burning at monthly intervals throughout the year. One year's observations on the effect of burning have shoAvn that ivith early burning (June) the basal area of all the major species in the pasture has decreased. However, the number of plants of red grass (B. amhigua) has increased.28 (c) Grazing Management Studies of Native Pastures. \u2014(i) Comparison of Bates of Stocking and Continuous V. Rotational Grazing.\u2014In co-operation with the Divi sion of Animal Health and Production (see Chapter VII., Section 21 (h)) a study has heen made of the effect on the sheep and the effect on the pasture of different rates of stocking. Records were obtained of the effect of the different grazing treatments on:_(i) infection by internal parasites; (ii) wool production; (iii) liveweight of the sheep; (iv) yield and botanical composition; and (v) chemical composition of the pasture. The experiment, which commenced in Hovemher, 19-18, was concluded in November, 19-52. No significant differences in the amount of forage available under light (one sheep to l-J acres) and medium (one sheep to 1 acre) rates of stocking have heen recorded during the course of the experiment. Under a heavy rate of stock ing (one sheep to -4 acre) the yield of forage has heen consistently lower. No differences have heen recorded in the amount of forage available under rotational (one week in four) and continuous grazing at a rate of stock ing of one sheep per acre. (ii) Studies on the Production of Native Pastures used in conjunction with Sown Pastures.\u2014The results of the preceding experiment and general observations on sheep production on the native pastures of the New England region have shown that even at relatively light rates of stocking sheep weights decline to a low level in winter, and with stocking rates fixed by this critical winter period much of the summer production is not utilized. The critical winter period makes the breeding of Merinos solely on native pasture impracticable. In co-operation with the Division of Animal Health and Production (see Chapter VII., Section 21 (c)) a study was commenced on the effect of supplementing the grazing on native pastures with the following per centages of sown pasture: (a) 59.1, (h) 30.8, (c) 15.5, and (d) 3;9. A breeding flock of Merinos is being used. With only small proportions of sown pasture available the supplementary grazing will he provided according to the requirements of each class of stock, that is, wcaners will receive first preference. (iii) Studies of the Summer Management of Native Pastures.\u2014Under the relatively severe winter condi tions of the New England region the maximum carrying \"capacity of the native pastures is limited to approxi mately one sheep per acre. At this rate of grazing the production of the pastures during the summer months is not all utilized and the aftermath is considered to reduce the capacity of the pasture to carry sheep during the following winter. A study is being made in co-operation with the Divi sion of Animal Health and Production of the effect of various management practices, designed to reduce the amount of aftermath at the end of the summer, on the winter carrying capacity of the native pastures. The management practices are: (a) grazing at one sheep per acre (control); (h) grazing at three sheep per acre; (c) ungrazed during summer; (d) grazing with sheep (one per acre) and cattle (one per 8 acres) ; (e) grazing with cattle (one per 3 acres); (/) mowing the pasture at the end of summer and removing the aftermath; (g) burning the surplus growth at the end of summer; and (h) surface seeding the native pasture with clover and grazing according to the forage available. Treat ments (/) and (g) are grazed at the rate of one sheep per acre during the summer. During the winter months (April to November) all treatments are stocked with weaners at the rate of one per acre and their liveweight increase is used as a measure of the effectiveness of the above treatments in improving the winter grazing of the pasture. During the first summer, commencing with the same amount of forage available in all paddocks, each group made a liveweight gain of approximately 12 Ib./acre,that is, 12 lb. per head when grazed at the rate of one sheep per acre and 4 lb. per head when grazed at the rate of three sheep per acre. Having cattle grazing in addition to the sheep did not reduce the liveweight gain of the latter. During the winter, weaners on the pasture that had been ungrazed during the previous summer made the greatest liveweight gains. The liveweight gains of the groups that followed other summer management prac tices were not related to the varying amounts of forage remaining after the summer treatments, that is, at the beginning of their winter grazing period. When forage was abundant both sheep and cattle grazed the same species, but when grazing pressure became severe cattle commenced to graze the taller tussock species before the sheep. (d) Improvement of Native Pastures.\u2014Previous investigations have demonstrated that, with the applica tion of superphosphate, subterranean and white clovers can be successfully established in dense native pasture without ploughing. Although the protein content of the native species and hence their forage value has been raised by growing in association with clovers established in the above manner, the native species often do not persist in competition with the clovers and a pure stand of the latter results. From the point of view of developing a balanced highly productive pasture it would be advantageous to replace the native species with sown grass species and if this could be done by \" surface seeding\", that is, without ploughing, costs would be reduced to a mini mum. An investigation has therefore been commenced of methods of establishing grasses in (a) native pasture and (h) native pasture into which clovers had been previously incorporated. (e) Species and Strain Trials.\u2014The suitability of the New England region for highly productive improved pastures has been demonstrated by the extraordinary high carrying capacity of Phalaris-white clover and perennial ryegrass-white clover pastures. Two of these pastures were stocked at eight Merino weaners to the acre continuously for twelve months. This resulted in a wool yield of over 62 Ib./acre, a 10- to 12-fold increase compared with the comparable sheep on native pastures. The liveweight gains were also considerably greater on sown pasture. The testing of forage grasses and legumes is con tinuing and being extended into new localities. As the fertility of the soils is being improved by growth of clover, several grasses are yielding considerably more than Phalaris, thus confirming the trend observed last year. Festuca mairei, several tall fescues, and perennial ryegrasses have been most prominent in this regard. In a grazing trial on fertile soil, Wimmera ryegrass was found to be superior in the seeding year to oats as a forage crop. Following the summer drought of 1951-52 the annual clovers, particularly crimson clover and Tallarook and Bacchus Marsh subterranean clovers, yielded con siderably more than the perennial clovers. However, Ladino white clover, alsike, and red clover were quite productive. Lucerne yields appear to be restricted by faulty nodulation and when this is overcome better results are expected with this valuable species. Winter productivity of Tallarook subterranean clover was shown to be highly dependent on the time of sowing. Yields at intervals through the winter were much greater from early sowings than from those made only a short time later. A decline with age in the productivity of the Tallarook strain of subterranean clover, compared with other strains of this species, has occurred in a five-year- old pasture. The reasons for this are being investigated.29 (/) Plant Nutrition Studies.\u2014The survey of the plant nutrient status of New England soils has been extended to seven of the major soil types. First-season results from factorial field trials are available for three centres. At each, a marked deficiency of phosphorus and nitrogen was observed and at two of the three there was also a marked response to suljjhur. Sulphur responses are greatly increased with the presence of phosphorus, or nitrogen, or both. Nitrogen was inelfective in two out of the three centres without added phosphorus, or sulphur, or both. Phosphorus was less dependent on the other two elements. Potassium, limestone, magnesium, molybdenum, copper, zinc, iron, and manganese were without effect, but in one case boron appeared beneficial. Pock phosphate has been shown to be a very poor source of phosphorus on a chernozem soil, 1 cwt. of superphosphate producing in the first year the same response as 16 cwt. of rock phosphate. (Sulphur supplies were adequate in both cases.) Gypsum has proved a cheap and effective source of sulphur. On a basaltic soil in the Liverpool Eanges 1 cwt. of gypsum per acre resulted in a sevenfold increase in medic growth. On established pastures previously fertilized with superphosphate, results have shown that pasture pro duction may be maintained with additions of gypsum in place of annual dressings of superphosphate. This find ing has considerable economic significance, and the conditions under which gypsum may replace super phosphate are under investigation. The improved growth of plants on burns appears to be largely due to the increased supply of available nitrogen which follows the heating. The mineral con stituents also appear to have some effect, and a trial is in progress to determine the important constituents in this regard. A co-operative investigation with the IJniversity of Sydney School of Agriculture has been made of the unsatisfactory nodulation of certain clovers in the region. The soils on which the problem is more acute have been shown to contain very few naturally-occurring Bhizobium spp.; of those present, most are ineffective on subterranean clover. 16. Pastuee Investigations at Deniliquin, New South Wales. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) Ecology of Native Pastures.\u2014^Visits to the Atriplcx vesicaria dominant communities to the north of Wanganella have been continued, and preliminary indications are that bush density is proportional to the depth of soil moisture penetration. Seasonal observa tions of the floristic composition in these communities has been continued, and seed of various Atriplex species collected. The grazing trial on Danthonia semiannularis pasture has been continued. The low rainfall in July- August, 1952, reduced the yield of winter plants, but green pasture was available until late December because of heavy rainfall in October. A considerable number of perennial grass seedlings (D. semiannularis^ was recorded, germination occurring during the winter period as in 1951. Germination in protected areas was once again less than in grazed treatment plots. Eecovery has been slow following the heavy mortality of large plants in 1951. The demise of these plants has probably been due to_ waterlogging. It has been demonstrated that the soils supporting D. semiannularis may be poorly aerated during considerable periods in winter and early spring, when, owing to delayed drainage and swelling pf the clay surface, the soils may contain moisture in excess of field capacity.The summer species Chloris truncata and Sporobolus caroli appeared as annual plants because of the late spring rainfall. Studies have been made of the seasonal iiuctuatious in soil moisture beneath four typical natural pastures. These data, with such other physical characteristics of the soil as bulk density, clod density, aeration, and soil moisture volume at various tensions, and with qualitative observations on the phenology of the species, are providing an understanding of their occurrence in the pastures. (b) Plant Species and Strain Trials.\u2014Plantings made in rows and small swards with 140 species in 1950 and 1951 have led to the exclusion of a large number as unsuitable for use under irrigation. Com plete phenological data were collected for each species. Yield and seed production were measured; root density and distribution were determined and root morphology described from excavated prisms. The following summer legumes are now considered worthy of trial in grazed swards maintained under flood irrigation; Palestine strawberry clover, Ladino and Irrigation white clover. Among the grasses which are highly productive are ochrus, L. cicera, saliva, V. dasycarpa, and the Clare, Yarloop, Bacchus Marsh, and Tallarook strains of subterranean clover are best. Of the cereals, oats and barley were very productive and Phalaris aquatica, are well worth further testing in grazed swards. The need for a wider range of species and strains than that in common use in the Australian irrigation environment is obvious. Apart from their productivity on the more diifieult soils, the species need to be selected for their ability to contribute to the structural amend ment of the surface soils and to have a useful place in a pasture rotation for animal production. The perennial grasses have not persisted well in the sense of contributing to grazing. The most useful grass species is Wimmera ryegrass, Bromus unioloides being the only other grass contributing as much as 6 cwt. of dry material in the season. Useful legumes may be ranked: Clare 14 cwt./aere and M. tribuloides about 34 cwt./acre. There is a distinct possibility that suitable legume- grass mixtures can be used for improving the natural pastures on the coarser levee soils with fertilizer appli cation. Among these, two new introductions to this region are promising, namely, II. hispida confinis and T. hirtum. Two collaborative trials have been con ducted with other species. One is an observational trial with a wide range of medics sown in rows under dryland conditions. All species have matured in this environment but M. orhicularis did not regenerate in the second season, presumably because of hard seed. The second compared a number of strains of safflower for yield under irrigation. (c) Boot Growth and Soil Structure Studies.\u2014 Studies are continuing with a range of irrigated pas tures on a number of soil types. Three-year-old, irri gated, perennial pastures were found to have added 10 ton/acre of oven-dry macro-organic matter to a sandy loam soil. Over half of this material has been added to the top 3 inches of soil. For any one pasture, as the macro-rorganie matter of the top 3 inches of soil increased, infiltration rate decreased. When comparison was made at common30 macro-organic matter and soil moisture contents, soils under co-dominant white clover-perennial ryegrass pastures were found to have higher infiltration rates than soils under lucerne dominant pastures. The problem of establishing pastui-es under irrigation on the clay soils of the Eiverina region are still not resolved, though the factor of sowing time in autumn and the need to establish with rainfall instead of fiood irrigation is now understood. It is a belief among farmers that rice growing improves soils for pastures. It has been shown that the inundation of land, apart from rice-growing, improves the surface structure tem porarily and leaches salts so that much better pasture establishment can be obtained. These benefits were striking in the first season. This work can contribute to an understanding of thechemical and physical changes which can take place in the clay soils with inundation and the use of summercrops with a high water requirement. It fits into thepattern of work beginning with species selection forvigorous summer growth and with a species succession, or a rotation, ending with better structured soils and highly productive pastures. (d) Plant Nutrition.\u2014Phosjihovus, nitrogen, micro element trials were imposed on Wimmera ryegrass-sub- terranean clover, either as mixed or monospecific swards. Response to superphosphate increased in the second season of application, yield increases of over 70 percent, (contributed largely by the clover) being obtained at an application rate of 4 cwt./acre. Diffusible phos phate increased in both species where phosphate fertilizer was used. Heavy applications of nitrogen fertilizers tripled the yield of ryegrass in a monospecific sward, but neither increased nor decreased the yield of subterranean clover when grown alone. Micro-elements did not affect yields. (e) Irrigation Hydraulics.\u2014Border Chech: During the 1952-53 irrigation season observations were made of the behaviour of four irrigating streams in geo metrical progression mown and unmown bays under three conditions of initial soil moisture. The ohserva- vation of each irrigation of each bay involved an average of 10 depth measurements at an average of over 20 points per bay. Collation and interpretation of the data are not com plete. The influence of cover appears to he very marked, and it is thought that it will be possible to establish a relationship between the rate of advance of the stream and the initial moisture content of the soil. In conjunction with this experiment, observations were made of the temperature of the advancing and ponded irrigation water, as it is thought that this may influence the incidence of \" scalding \" of pastures. Apreliminary experiment involving the observation of temperature rise in artificially ponded water held at three depths indicates that water temperature is more closely related to received radiation than to air tem perature. (/) Furrow Irrigation.\u2014Experimental data have been re-examined and found to provide an encouraging starting point in the quantification of furrow irrigation relationships. A parallel theoretical analysis has been completed. (i) Infiltration.\u2014Euudamcntal theoretical studies of infiltration and unsaturated water movement are in progress. Collaborative work has been initiated with an officer of the Division of Building Research on the development of electrical circuit analogues to study these problems.The assistance of the Section of Mathematical In struments has also been enlisted in the study of these problems. (ii) Evayotranspiration.\u2014Recently the Water Con servation and Irrigation Commission of New South Wales requested estimates of potential evapotranspira- tion for the Riverina. A method has been developed for the estim_ation_ ofevaporation and evapotranspiration from precipitation data and astronomically computed radiation. In itspresent form this is largely empirical, and much further work is needed. I he method has been used in its present crude form to supply the Water Conser vation and Irrigation Commission with estimates of annual evapotranspiration. (iii) Irrigation Prole.\u2014The experimental pro gramme with the modified Proctor penetrometer is complete. The data have permitted the correlation between soil moisture and penetration to he investigated for a range of probe loads. It appears that the best correla tion is achieved with a load of 80 lb. 17. P.vsTUKii IxviiSTiGATiojs's IX Westekn Austeali.\\. (Division of Plant Industry.) (tt) Crazing Management Trial, Perth.\u2014This ex periment involves a comparison of continuous and autumn-deferred grazing with Alerino wethers on a sown annual pasture. Four grazing seasons have been completed. Sheep liveweight data for 1952-53 again show that the continuous group suffer a more rapid loss in body weight on the dry feed available during the late summer. Soon after the opening rains, the sheep on the continuously grazed pasture regained weightra]udly, as in previous years. However, the deferred group maintained a higher mean body weight through out the growing season due, no doubt, to the greater quantity of feed which was available to them. The liroportion of Wimmera ryegrass was again much higher, and that of Broimis gussonii much lower, under continuous grazing. However, in 1952, unlike the previous seasons, the proportion of subterranean clover was somewhat higher in the continuous grazing treat ment and the proportion of capGweed somewhat higher in the deferred. (b) Grazing and Potation Trial, Wongan Hills.\u2014 This experiment is a co-operative project located at the State Department Research Station near Wongan Hills. The second three years' pasture phase is now complete, and the sheep were removed from the plots after their liveweights and wool production had been measured. As in previous years, the oat pastures and the legume pastures carried the sheep in better conditon and pro duced more wool th.an the volunteer pastures of brome, capeweed, and Erod-ium hotrys. The second cycle of the trial will be completed by cropping the whole area to wheat. The fertility status of the soil will then be shown by the straw yield and the quantity and quality of the grain produced. (c) Species and Strain Investigation,\u2014 (i) Phalaris tuberosa.\u2014A study on the effect of row spacing on yields and persistence of spring sown Phalaris is being continued at Glen Lossie Field Station, Kojonup. Yield data from the 1952 growing season indicate that the yield per unit area is now somewhat greater in the widely spaced rows than on the sward and, where cul tivation was carried out between the well-spaced rows, the yield was further increased. (ii) Subterranean Clover.\u2014The more promising strains from the 1951 row trials were tested again in 1952 together with a number of new types from the Mediterranean collection. Promising strains for the Kojonup district have been planted again this year for further observation and to build up enough seed31 supplies for sward trials. Samples from these strains will be assayed for genistein content in connexion with the sheep infertility problem. Sixty of the most likely strains from the test rows will be sown together in a pasture to determine their behaviour under plant competition and grazing. A sward trial involving 15 selected strains is being continued. Yield data at the end of the 1952 growing season again showed the su])eriority in early winter production of a number of strains over the locally grown Dwalganup. Among the outstanding newcomers were Port Fairy, Hill's Small, Liege, and Gingin. (iiij Trifolium cherleri.\u2014Strains of this species collected in the Mediterranean area were grown in test rows at Glen Lossie Field Station. The material dis played a wide range of maturing dates and gave a high seed yield. Some of the strains appear to be worth testing under grazing as an admixture to pastures. (cZ) Cereal Investigations at Kojonup.\u2014(i) Oats.\u2014 In the oat grazing and recovery trials a number of un named crossbred oats from Wongan Hills Research Station yielded very well. Orient again showed its ability as a grazing and recovery oat, and a new intro duction, Acacia, gave a high green yield although it is a little late maturing for recovery. Generally recovery was good and yields ranged from 40.2 to 57.6 bus./acre. (ii) Barley.\u2014Five barley varieties were included in a grazing and recovery trial. Of these, Atlas gave the highest grain yield, 60.5 bus./acre, and also gave a good yield ot g'reeii material. Research gave the highest green yield, with the high grain yield of 53.5 bus./acre. All grain yields were within the range 52.4-60.5 bus./acre. (iii) ^\\]leat.\u2014In the trial of early maturing varieties. Insignia 49 proved superior to both Gabo and Wongoondy this year, although the yields generally were not high (19.1-24.2 bus./acre). With the mid- season varieties, yields were higher, with Eureka and Yalta again the best. In the time of planting trial with wheat, Gabo and Wongoondy were superior to Eureka in the first, third and fourth jAantings, but Eureka was equivalent to the early varieties in the second planting with 35.1 bus./acre. 1 rials planted in 1953 include one with ten wheat vfirieties soAvn at two jDlanting dates and a further trial with eight oat varieties and two barley varieties under three grazing treatments. ^ (c) Plant Autrition Uliidies.\u2014(i) Pot Culture1 rials. Perth.\u2014Studies of the factors affecting zinc responses^ in subterranean clover were continued. Results indicate that high levels of soil moisture increase the zinc requirement. Also a high level of available nitrogen appears to hinder clover in utilizing the zinc in the soil. Several sources of nitrogen were tried and all showed this effect. The available phosphorus level of the soil has also been found to markedly affect the utilization of zinc present in thesoil. Applications of phosphorus equivalent to only cwt./acre of superphosphate produced definite symptoms of deficiency. This action of phosphorus appears to be more pronounced with the Dwalganup than with the Bacchus Marsh strain. (ii) Fertilizer Field Trial, Kojonup.\u2014A study has been commenced on the effect of season on zinc responses given by subterranean clover. This trial will continue for several years. Marked zinc resijouses were given under the seasonal conditions experienced in 1952. Further investigations on the responses to sulphur by subterranean clover were made at Kojonup. Two trials carried out on Kojonup sand have failed to show the marked response to sulphur given on the Kojonup gravelly sand. Experiments have been extended toinclude the Boscabel gravelly sand to find whether the sulphur deficiency is related to the presence of lateritic gravel in the soil profile. The effects of varying rates of superphosphate applied annually are still under examination. The residual effects of superphosphate on Kojonup gravelly sand decreased again in the third year after applica tion. Applications of sulphate to the plots did not increase the declining yields, and the decrease appears to be due to continued fixation of the phosphate in an unavailable form. A trial was conducted on Kojonup gravelly sand to measure the response in pasture growth given by vary ing rates of rock phosphate. An application of 4 cwt./acre of ground rock phosphate gave a yield of subterranean clover almost equal to the highest yield given by superphosphate. (/) Soil Fertility Studies, Kojonup.-\u2014^The soil fertility studies initiated in 1952 have been continued this season. Successful establishment of subterranean clover wms attained on the virgin land used for the experiment. A second series was commenced in the trial dealing with the influence of the age and produc tivity of a subterranean clover pasture. Re-establish- ment of the pastures in the second year has been very uniform. Soil samples have been taken at the com mencement and conclusion of each growing season. In the trial comparing a number of grain legumes, the area has been sown to wheat this season as the second phase in the legume-cereal rotation. The experiment dealing wdth the effect of continuous cereal cropping on an established subterranean clover pasture has been amended to include a stubble treatment including burring, cutting, and \" turning in \" of the wheat stubble. i'j) Pasture Ecology.\u2014Small exploratory trials havebeen carried out to determine the effects of grazing, fertilizing practice, and seasonal conditions on the botanical composition of the annual pastures at Perth. 18. Pasture Invicstigatioks at Brisbane and La WES, Q UEENSLAND. (Division of Plant Industry.) (/) Ecology.^\u2014The ecological survey of the coastal region from Brisbane to Bundaberg was continued. In collaboration wdth Dr. Lincoln W. Ellison, of the I'uited States Forest Service, a study was made of the movement of the soil mantle in some of the higher rainfall areas of south-eastern Queensland. There is a considerable mantle movement under virgin forest and the landslips so common in these areas are not solely the result of clearing of the forest. (b) Regional Trials.\u2014(i) Coastal Soils.\u2014The main centre for work on the low fertility coastal soils has been established at Beerwah in a perched tea tree swam]). Soil is a low humic gley and the annual I'ainfall ap])roximately 55 inches. rwo experiments on the newly cleared virgin forest were planted in 1952. Eight grasses, Paspalum ddatatum. P. were sown as pure stands in small swards. Kineteen other species were also sown. Establishment from seed was satisfactory in most cases, but growth and development of the legumes was severely_ retarded, partly owing to difficulties in obtain ing satisfactory nodulation. Grasses were satisfactorily established and encouraging growth made whereboth phosphate and nitrogen .supplies w-ere adequate.Grazing of the mixtures has not yet been po.ssible but will be undertaken during next season.32 Additional tests on tlie coastal areas are being made at Glasshouse on an area of cleared and drained tea treeswamp, the soil being an organic clay (bumic gley) already a sod A nutrient trial and a_ species trial were laid down. The species trial consisted of replicated swards of 40 legumes and 20 grasses. As in the Beerwah tests, the legumes suffered from poor nodulation, though species within tlie cowpea cross- inoculation group Desmodium uncinatum Trifolivjn repens also grew splendidly. iSimilar species and nutrient tests were made at Elimhah on light sandy soil of low fertility. Poor nodulation of legumes was again encountered. Representative soils of the coastal region have been sampled by the Soils Division and are now being described and analysed (see Chapter II., Section 2). The existence of water-tables over extensive areas of the coastal plain is of considerable importance in the study of the development of these areas. Ground water cells have been established at eight points near the experiment sites and fortnightly records of water levels made. A detailed rainfall map of south-eastern Queensland is being prepared, the period for normals of 1921-50 being chosen after consultation with the Common wealth Meteorological Branch. The main work at present lies in establishing correlations and homo geneities between stations of short records with those of full records, so that greater use can be made of the short record stations in plotting the isohyets. (ii) Spear Grass (Heteropogon eontortus) Region. \u2014Nutrient studies: Further pot culture studies of the soil from Kodd's Bay have confirmed phosphorus deficiency, but response to other elements is not definite. Calcium has given significant yield increases with Phaseolus lathyroides and Medicago sativa in several instances, hut in one case a significant depression in the yield of P. lathyroides due to calcium was noted. Similarly with potassium and molybdenum increased yield and decreased yields have been recorded. In all instances, however, the effects of the other nutrients are relatively small, while the effect of phosphorus is very great, indicating that by far the most important deficiency is that of phosphorus. Species trials: A nursery trial was laid down at Rodd's Bay in 1952 as the first step in the assessment of pasture species in this region. Rainfall from February, 1952, has been good and particularly well distributed through the winter and spring and better than normal growth conditions have been experienced. The performance of the various species must, there fore, be regarded with reserve. The most promising species to date are as follows:\u2014 Pasture legumes\u2014Stylosanthes mutica. The most important observation made in 1952 was that in the winter months with ample soil moistureall the species under test remained green and continued to grow, whereas the native species were just as dry and dormant as in a more normal year. Following on from the nursery row studies, a large trial has been commenced consisting of swards of single species and of grass-legume mixtures, which are to be grazed intermittently. The objective is assessment of the species with particular stress on compatibility of the various grasses and legumes. Native pastures\u2014studies of burning: Since 1945 an area of native pasture at Lawes has been subjected to various burning and mowing treatments, and observa tions have been made on changes in the botanical composition. Changes have been relatively slow, but the treatments ajrpear to be leading to the development of three distinct pasture types. Burning has produced a pasture in which Heteropogon eontortus is very dominant and in which the soil surface between the clumps of this species tends to be bare and hard. \"With mowing and raking, H. eontortus is still dominant but other species, especially Bothriochloa intermedia, are prominent. Where the grass is not touched, or where it is cut and left on the ground, H. eontortus appears to be decreasing whilst Sporobolus elongatus is increas ing, and the heavy layer of litter appears to be leading to a reduction in basal ground cover of living plants. Grazing management\u2014alternate pastures: For the past three years an experiment has been conducted at Lawes involving a comparison of steers grazing a mixed pasture of Rhodes grass and lucerne and steers grazing an equal area of which half is Rhodes-lucerne mixture, one quarter is row-lucerne, and one quarter is Paspalum scrohiculatum reserved for grazing between May and December. Differences between the treatments were consistently in favour of the alternate pastures, but they were not large, and at no time was there any major difference in trend of weight change. Results on both treatments were very good in that the weight gains produced would, in practice, permit steers to be marketed at three years of age instead of the normal four to four and a half years. The main reason for this was that stock gained weight in winter instead of losing. (c) Plant Nutrition.\u2014(i) Darling Downs.\u2014The studies on the black soils of the Darling Downs have now been completed. ISTitrogen and sulphur are the primary limiting plant nutrients. Secondary but minor responses to copper and zinc occurred. Chemical analyses of Trifolium repens grown on these black soils in the presence and absence of added sulphur gave the same copper content, but a reduction in zinc content in the presence of sulphur. .The zinc values at 27.15 and 34.81 p.p.m. are relatively low. Manganese content increased with sulphur treatment from 45.0 to 64.7 p.p.m. (ii) Coastal Soils.-\u2014Investigation tlie of the soils at Beerwah, Glasshouse and Flim,hah was an important phase of the work in 1952-53. Both field and pot culture studies were made. Attention was given to evaluating superphosphate, rock phosphate, and basic superphosphate as the source of phosphate for Paspalum dilatatum, P. scrohiculatum, and Trifolium repens on the Beerwah soil. The soil at Beerwah is extremely deficient in phosphate and all species fail to survive for more than a few weeks after germination, unless phosphate is applied. The field tests of nutrients other than phosphate were based on four blocks: 1. Paspalum to pliosplinte alone, but P. scrobiculatum responded to a combined dressing of copper and zinc and interactions have been obtained between phosphate and copper -j- zinc; phosphate and potassium; phosphate and molybdenum. The clovers on blocks 3 and 4 gave poor growth because of inadequate nodulation, but subsequent inocu lation with more satisfactory strains of Eh'zohium has partly overcome this. Calcium at 4 or 10 cwt./acre CaCOg doubled the yield of the clovers; while jjotassium and a dressing of copper zinc both gave 20 per cent, increases in yield. Molybdenum gave a positive increase in the presence of high phosphate. Parallel pot culture tests fully agree with the results obtained .in the field and it was shown that copper is the element giving the response in the copper -f- zinc treatment used in the field tests. A similar set of experiments have been made at Glasshouse. IJesinodium uncinatum, in the absence of phosphate, gave negligible yields which were increased 120-fold by 6 cwt./acre superphosphate. Stylosanthes hojeri and Phaseolus not the higher dressings of superphosphate at 6 cwt./acre. Tests using the winter legume, Trifolium repens, T. pratanse, and T. fragiferum as the test plants again gave unsatisfactory results because of poor nodulation. Subsequent addition of a more effective strain by the use of soil inoculum gave marked improvement in nodu lation of white clover. Eesponses to superphosphate of seven- and twelve-fold were recorded at low (2 cwt./ acre) and high (6 cwt./acre) levels. Eesponses to calcium and to copper zinc treatment were also recorded in this soil. Ked clover gave parallel responses to white clover, but the results from strawberry clover, while similar, were less decisive because of the unsatis factory growth of this species under all the test conditions. The relict lateritic red earth at the Strathpine Experi ment Station is deficient in phosphorus and calcium and some responses to potassium and molybdenum have been obtained. The foliar symptoms of Paspahim scrohiculatum and Phaseolus lailiyroidcs are under study using water cul tures deficient in one or more elements. Both are valuable test plants in nutrient deficiency studies in the sub-troi)ical environment of south-eastern Queensland. Rhizobium: Repeated failure of inoculation, espe cially of the winter legumes used as test plants, has been experienced. In the majority of instances this has been traced to the use of ineffective strains of the bacterium. This has now been overcome. In pot culture studies with white clover that had failed to nodulate the addi tion of calcium gave lower yields and, when satisfactory nodulation was achieved, calcium gave the expected yield increments. Eairly satisfactory inoculation of the cowpea group of legumes has been achieved, but there is some evidence that more eifective strains within this group must be developed. (d) Sown Pastures on Blach Soils.\u2014(i) Row Culti vated at LaAves have shoAvn the value of the grass P. scrohiculatum as a pasture plant for .subtropical regions, and in 1948 a large-scale grazing trial Avas designed to provide basic information on the carrying capacity and reaction to grazing of this species. The experiment includes four types of pasture, viz.: (1) P. scrohiculatum (alone); (2) P. P. scrobiciilatum the annual legume Phaseolus lathyroides. Each of these pastures has been established as a sward and in rows at 42 and 63 in. spacing. All twelve treatments E.5189.\u20143A\\erc separately fenced and they have been grazed by equal numbers of lambing ewes. This experiment was completed in June, 1953. The main findings are\u2014 (1) The best quality lambs have been produced on a pure lucerne diet, but the carrying capacity of lucerne pastures is appreciably below that of grass or grass-legume mixtures. On the other hand, the quality of feed on a pure stand of P. scrohiculatum (which will maintain adult dry sheep in good condition) is not sufficient to meet the requirements of lambs or lambing ewes. (2) Both the quantity and quality of feed in mixed pastures of P. scrohiculatum and lucerne are satisfactory for lambing eAves and these pastures Avill carry approximately three ewes per acre, on a year-long basis. (3) Mixed pastures of P. scrohiculahm and Phaseolus lathyroides have not been success ful in this experiment, but from data now available it seems likely that such a mixture could be maintained under appropriate management. This would involve a short period of spelling during the summer groAV- ing season. The chief value of this annual legume Avould lie in its capacity to provide nitrogen for the grass; since the tAvo plants P. scrobiculatum and lucerne (grown either as mixed pasture or as separate stands) Avould at all times provide adequate nutri tion for the animals concerned. (4) In lucerne pastures there is a real advantage from roAv cultivation Avhieh is expressed in terms of (a) a more even production during all months of the year, (h) better control of Aveed groAvth, (c) greater longevity, and (d) better production from effective rain fall, leading to slightly greater production (approximately 20 per cent, in rows at 42-in. spacing). It has been shown that produc tion in all lucerne plots is directly related to the incidence of rainfall. (5) In pastures of P. scrobiculatum there is, under hay conditions, a very marked increase in the yield from roAV cultivated plots, but under a uniform intensity of grazing the production from sAvards rises, over a period of approximately three years, to the same level. The data noAV available show that soil moisture is seldom, if at all, a limiting \"factor in a mature stand of this grass and that the growth of B. scrohiculatum is con trolled mainly by temperature. The tAvo plants P. scrohiculatum and lucerne are obviously complementary, both in terms of production (i.e. period of groAvth) and in providing an oA'erall balanced diet for stock. Some final experiments are now in progress to compare overall production from mixed pastures (incorporating both jJants) and from separate stands of grass and lucerne AA'here stock have free access to either component. (ii) Paspalum scrobiculatum\u2014Frequency of Cut ting.\u2014In a number of exjAcriments Avith subtropical grasses it has been ob.scrved that close grazing or mowing\u2014esjAecially during the early part of the growing season-\u2014has adversely .affected subsequent growth and vigour in the plants concerned. Since this is a matter of obviou.s importance in relation to pasture manage ment, a number of experiments Avere carried out Avith P. scrohiculatum to determine the effect of different frequencies and heights of cutting on cumulatiA'e yields over one or more years.34 Tlie experiments have shown that (1) in general the cumulative yield for any one year is inversely propor tional to the frequency of cutting'; (2) this effect is progressively less marked where plants are cut at higher levels above ground; and (3) the yields in successive years are greatly depressed by frequent close cutting (e.g. mowing at a height of l| inches every 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks). Over and above these results, however, it has been consistently recorded that the cumulative yield from plots cut at approximately 12-14 week intervals is less than that from similar plots cut at 10 or 16 week intervals. In order to obtain some explanation of this result a new experiment was designed with many replicates of individual plants that were cut at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 week intervals over a period of 18 months and thereafter rearranged to allow computation of growth curves from plants previously subjected to each of these treatments. This experiment has confirmed the previous i-esults, and, in addition, it has shown that the yield of plants during the year following the several cutting treatments is similarly affected. A possible explanation of this somewhat unexpected result is that there may be a translocatioii of plant food reserves froin the leaves to the roots, or basal tissue, at or about 12-14 weeks after the commencement of new growth. An estimate of root development was made on the basis of samples taken from 4-in. soil cores at fixed positions round each plant, but the position is complicated because any reduction in above ground growth, in itself, leads inevitably to lesser root growth. Samples of \" roots and \" tops \" are now being analysed in an attempt to follow the development and translocation of carbo hydrates under each cutting treatment. 19. NiiTErrioN or Plakts in the Coon.\\lpyn Downs, South Austealia. (Division of Biochemistry and General ISiutrition.) Unusually acute zinc deficiency has been found to occur in subterranean clover grown in one of the light, sandy soils in the Hundred of Archibald. Zinc sulphate was applied to this soil at seeding, at rates of nil, -J, 31, 7, and 14 Ib./acre. Growth of subterranean clover (var. Bacchus Marsh) was found to be enhanced by the addition of as little as lij- lb. of ZnSOj.TIIoO per acre, and maximum yield was obtained by the applica tion of 7 or 14 lb. of ZnS04.7H20 per acre. The numbers of plants present in the pasture and plots were not affected by the amount of zinc added, and yield per acre was governed by the mean weight per plant. An experiment was carried out in the same soil to deter mine the tolerance of subterranean clover to unusually large applications of zinc. The additions ranged between 14 and 126 lb. of ZnSO,[.7HaO per acre in increments of 28 Ib./acre. The survival of plants and the yield per acre during the first year were reduced with each increase in the amount of zinc salt added above 14 Ib./acre, but the mean yield per plant was not affected in those that survived. During the second year, the clover grew well on all of the plots, and no differences^ in density or yield were apparent. The concentration of zinc in the dry matter of leaf and petiole of these plants at the flowering stage during the second year was increased considerably by addition of the largest amount of zinc sulphate at seeding. The concentrations varied between 25.9 and 62.2 p.p.m. Zn. The range of concentrations of zinc and copper in subterranean clover and lucerne grown in a number ofsoils of the Coonalpyn Downs has been investigated asan aid to the diagnosis of incipient deficiency of zinc and copper. Material for analysis has been collected as circumstances have permitted. The estimations have been carried out for the greater part on leaf andpetiole of subterranean clover collected during theflowering stage, and on whole tops of lucerne collected during the same period of time. The minimum concen trations found so far in subterranean clover (var. Bacchus Marsh) are 7.7 p.p.m. Zn and 1.9 p.p.m. Cu in the dry matter, representing extreme deficiency, and the maximum concentrations found are 31.2 p.p.m. Zn and 5.0 p.p.m. Cu in the clover from areas fertilized with sufficient amounts of Zn and Cu salts for normal development. The ranges of concentrations found so far in lucerne are 5.3-26.5 p.ji.m. Zn and 1.1-6.3 p.p.m. Cu, in the dry matter of whole tops. Lucerne has been found to grow well and to exhibit no apparent lesions v\\'here zinc concentrations in the whole tops are as low as 5.3 and 8 p.ji.m. in the dry matter. Satisfactory concentrations of zinc and copper have been found in mixed pasture that had been sown in Laffer sand nine years previously. Ho further applica tion of zinc and copper had been made to this area since tiie original experimental dressing of 7 lb. of ZnS04.7H20 and 7 lb. of CuS04.5Ho0 was applied at seeding in 1944. Leaf and petiole of subterranean clover (var. Bacchus Marsh) at the flowering stage contained 23.2 p.p.m. Zn and 6.9 p.p.m. Cu, and whole tops of lucerne collected at the same time contained 26.3 23.p.m. Zn and 6.3 p.p.m. Cu in the dry matter. During the late .spring of 1952, subterranean clover growing in light soil in experimental areas developed symptoms which, in several respects, resembled those which have been attributed to potas.sium deficiency. Subsequent exaimnations revealed the occurrence of similar lesions in subterranean clover in a wide range of soils in the Coonalpyn Downs as well as in red-brown earth near Adelaide. The 230tassium concentration in leaf and petiole of more than 50 samples of subter ranean clover from affected areas and from ap2iarently healthy areas has been determined. In nearly all cases the concentrations were found to exceed 1.5 per cent. K. I hese should have been adequate for normal .growth, f urther work on this problem is proceeding. During this j^reliminary examination, a concentration of only 0.47 per cent.^ K was found in the dry matter of leaf and ))etiule of sjiarse and poorly grown subterranean clover on the top of a low sand-rise. Samples collected at 6-yd. intervals to the base of the slope, where the clover was densely grown and vigorous, contained 0.53, 0.77, 0.67, 1.06 and 1.07 per cent. K respectively. It 1.s jirobable that fertilization with potassium salts, in addition to the usual apiilication of phosphate, zinc, and cojiper, may aid the maintenance of plant cover in difficult terrain of that particular sort. All effort is being made to induce uuconiplicatc!! deficiency of the individual nutrient elements in subterranean clover and in strawberry clover grown in nutrient cultures. The recognition of characteristic lesions should aid in field diagnosis of deficiencies in refractory soils. 20. Plant Toxicoi.ogt and Chemical Weed Conthol. (Division of Plant Industry.) (a) EvaluaUon of Xeiv He/'bAfiZes.\u2014Additional information on the relation between structure andactivity has been obtained in the testing of new poten- tml_ herbicides synthesized by the Hew South Wale.s University of Technology. One substance in sand culture increased the growth of wheat but decreased the growth of rape. Preliminary studies of the berbicidal action of 3-(p-chloropheuyl)-l,l-dimethyl urea (C.M.U.) havebeen completed. It was found that O.M.U. is a power ful herbicide acting principally through the root systoins of plants. There was evidence of upward niovo- ment in the transpiration stream but none of down ward translocation from the leaves.36 Green-liouse studies with maleic hydrazide indicated that this compound has growth-regulating properties. The possibilities of using maleic hydrazide to retard the growth of channel bank weeds during the irrigation season is under investigation. (b) Mistletoe Investigations.\u2014Field trials in colla boration with the Torestry and Timber Bureau have been continued. It has been shown the optimal dose of injected 2,4-11 can vary from year to year. Althougli it is unlikely that 100 per cent, control may be effected by single injections, it has been ascertained that some coastal areas surviving mistletoes are likely to be killed by a beetle (Bostricliidae). Trials are being made with new 2,4-D compounds which may .show a greater safety factor to the host plants. (c) Biochemistry of Cell Differentiation.\u2014Investi gations have been initiated to ascertain the factors resiDonsible for the formation of new stem growth from root tissues. The possibility of using anti-metabolites to inhibit regrowth of weeds is being investigated. (d) Impedance Measurements.\u2014Further nioasiirc- ments on healthy and leaf-roll infected tubers are being made at different stages of maturity. In immatui'i tubers there may or may not be a .significant differen. e between healthy and virus-infected batches, depending on variety. (e) Soil Moisture Meter.\u2014A portable resistance- capacitance bridge, of novel design, has been made for the rapid measurement of soil moisture in the field. (/) Soil Slerilants.\u2014A range of soil stcrilants is being compared for the purpose of determining the most effective compound for fire breaks around electrical installations in tbe Australian Capital Territory. (g) Crass Weeds.\u2014Studies on the lierbicidal action of petroleum oil fractions have been completed and the results published in the Australian Journal of Agricultural Research. Further work is in progre.ss with sodium trichloroacetate which has given good results to date on Johnson grass {Sorghum halepense), couch grass (Cynodon obtained with oil-based ester.s of 2,4-D and 2,4,.0-T applied Ib./acre. (i) Nut-grass (Cyperus rotundus).\u2014The use of sodium trichloroacetate in controlling nut-gra.ss is still under investigation. Good control was achieved for a period of nine months. The effect of a second application is being determined. 21. Pastuise Investigations at Kathekine -AND KimBEKI.EY. (Laud Research and Regional Survey Section.) The Land Research and Regional Survey Section hu> continued its research on native and introduced pas tures under dry land cultivation at the Katherinc Research Station, and under irrigation at the Kimberley Research Station. The work on these investigations is recorded in Chapter XI., Section 3 et seq. IV. IRRIGATION. 1. General. The Organization has two Irrigation Research Stations, the Commonwealth Research Station (Murray Irrigation Areas) at Merbein on tbe Murray River in Victoria and the Irrigation Research Station (Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas) at Griffith, New South Wales. Both are situated in the midst of impor tant irrigation settlements and keep in close touch with the settlers. The work of these two stations is reported in this Chapter.Research into soils and their behaviour under irri gation has been carried out at both Merbein and Griffith in close co-operation with the Division of Soils {see Chapter II., Section 2). Studies on irrigated pastures are carried out at; Deniliquin, New South Wales {sec Chapter III., Sec tion 16), and other investigations of irrigation tech niques for northern tropical areas are carried out by the Land Research and Regional Survey Section at tbe Kimberley Research Station near Wyndham, Western Australia {see Chapter XI., Section 3 {h)). 2. Commonwealth Research Station (Mukray Irrioatton Areas), Merbein, Victoria. The work of the Merbein Station extends over the middle and lower areas of the Murray River valley and is concerned largely with problems in soil condi tions and plant growth associated with irrigation in a semi-arid environment. Both gravity and pumped irrigation distribution schemes serve the region. Deterioration of land under irrigation is a world problem of great magnitude. Since its inception, the Merbein Station has devoted much of its activity to investigation of methods for arresting such diminu tion of productivity and for reclaiming land on which production has become uneconomic. Among horticultural crops of the region, vines for dried fruit production are specially important. In agreement with the forecast made in May, 1952, from the Station's examination of dormant sultana buds, the 1952-53 season proved to be one of high fruitfulness for vines. The season was such that there was a high incidence of insect pests and fungus disease, includ ing an unusually early and widespread occurrence of downy mildew. Drying conditions at harvest time were excellent and, in spite of all difficulties, a very big pack of dried vine fruits has been obtained. Prominent among the problems of vegetable culture under irrigation is that of nematode infestation. In association with the Division of Plant Industry the Station has been engaged for some years on a pro gramme of breeding of tomatoes resistant to nematode and other pests and diseases. The interest of the Station in nematology is being broadened considerably in view of the actual and potential importance of thi - subject in production of many of the crojis grown in the region. The work of the Station at Merbein on the process ing of dried vine fruit has been included in Chapjtei' XIII., Section 12. (a) Irrigation, Soil Preservation, and Reclamation. \u2014Each year there is an expansion of the use of spray irrigation in the Murray areas, especially for the pro duction of vegetables and citrus fruits. An important a pect is the need, determined by soil types and topography, for extensive installations of sj)ray irriga tion equipment in the areas being developed for soldier settlement. Findings from the experimental work at Merbein are being applied in these and other areas. Considering fixed pipe-line systems, as distinct fi'om portable systems, it has been found that for rotating spray heads of the types widely used in the region, 8.5 sprays/acre are capable of giving satisfa.-- tory water distribution under most weather cond'- tions. Sprays of this kind spaced at 6.4/acre, as in many of the older installations, give adequate irriga tion cover only in calm weather. While maturc citrus trees, for example, may not show adverse effect-'^ from uneven water distribution, smaller plants sjch as yonng citrus and vegetables may suffer markedly. A drilling rig constructed at the Station to assist in investigation of problems of waterlogging and soil salinity has been in use at Renniark throughout the year. These investigations are concerned largely with36 those parts of the Eemnark settlement where the soils are iormea mainly from material deposited nnder water. These sorts are generally heavy, but all have sand at some depth underneath, sometimes as shallow as three feet from the surface, sometimes as deep as 50 feet. Soon after irrigation started in the Kenmark area, troubles rvith high water-tables and soil salinity developed, and have appeared with varying severity throughout the settlement. Standard methods of tile drainage, found effective in remedying such difficulties in Maliee soils under irrigation, have proved unsatis factory in the heavy soils at lienmark. T or this reason, the Station has investigated the problem from the aspect of pumping water from the underlying water logged sands, with a view to relieving pressure of saline ground water within or close to the root zones of the crops. A grid of piezometers put down with the aid of the drilling rig over a considerable area at Kenmark has confirmed earlier indications that there is a continuous body of waterlogged material underlying the settle ment. The problem is therefore a community one. Information has been obtained on the variability of the underlying sand strata, on fluctuations of water pressure levels throughout the irrigation season, on the airection of ground-water movement, on the effect of existing drainage installations such as large open drains, and on the locations of areas of highest ground- water levels where drainage is likely to be most needed and most effective.- Pumping from bores of 6-in. diameter put down to depths of the order of 80 feet into the deep-seated sand strata at Kenmark has been shown to lower the pressure levels in the sands over a considerable area round each bore. Encouraging results have been obtained from a trial of \" spear points \" placed as a group at a com paratively shallow depth in the sand strata and linked to a common suction line. Such a system gives a much lower pumping lift than from the bores, and the ground water pumped away is of much lower salinity, repre senting a much smaller disposal problem. By the use of such a system, tile drains may be laid in sand freed from excess water in those Kenmark soils which have sand, normally waterlogged, close to the surface. (b) Land Use.\u2014Soil surveys with particular reference to land use have been carried out by the Station in numerous small areas of the region in the past year. The major area under examination is one of about 600 acres at Colignan, recently developed for citrus and vegetable production under irrigation, mostly by sprays. Kenovation trials have now been in progress for four or five years on land at \"Woorinen previously abandoned for vine-growing under irrigation. The idea behind the trials is that growth of suitable irrigated forage crops on such land for some years might make it once again suitable for horticulture. One of these areas which has been under lucerne and pasture for four years will be planted to fruit trees this year. Another area was put under millet, then pasture, then lucerne. Lucerne establishment, which had been very poor on some of the more saline patches in this area, has improved considerably during the past season. In the area served by the Wakool Land-Use Com mittee, studies by the Merbein Station are in progress with the object of examining the major soil changes after irrigation for a number of years of various pastures. (c) Horticulture.\u2014The very high potential fruitful- ness of sultanas for the 1952-53 season, as indicated by the examination of sultana buds in May, 1952, was confirmed by detailed examination of vines in October, 1952. On the same vines records of the number ofbunches per vine and the green weight of fruit were taken at harvest time in 1953. A high correlation was found between bunch number and green weight. Time of bud burst of sultanas has been examined in detail on three properties in the Sunraysia district. There was very little dilference in average green weight per bunch produced on shoots which burst on different dates. There was also very little difference in average bunch weight borne at each bud position along the cane. The shoots bearing fruit burst earlier and grew longer than barren shoots, thus confirming earlier findings. In the sultana cincturing trial this year the single- cut cincture as well as the double-cut affiected yield and berry size, unlike last year when only the double cut had any effect. Single-cut cincturing this year increased berry size, though not as much as double-cut, whereas the single-cut caused the greater increase in fresh weight yield. The sugar content was equally depressed by both treatments. The results are now available for the second year's harvest from the sultana pruning trial in which the number of buds per vine is kept constant and the treatment consists of varying inversely the number of canes and length of canes per vine. While there were no significant differences in yield in the first harvest, the second harvest has shown a significant decrease in yield from the vines with the smallest number of canes of the longest lengths. These particular vines were pruned to five canes each carrying 25 buds. Erom a further year's results with 2,4-D spraying instead of cincturing of currants, it seems clear that sjiraying is superior to cincturing, at any rate for currants which have reached years of maturity. The general situation has emerged that in the first year of spraying results may not be as good as with cincturing, but the sprayed vines consistently improve compared with cinctured vines, and after several years may be much superior. In attempts to find a 'ivay of improving the low fertility of some of the vine-growing lands of Woorinen, two trials of gypsum and sulphur on vineyards are being carried out. After four years since the first dressings were put on, yield results are still incon clusive, although vine health has improved notably. Weed control by oil spray instead of by cultivation has been tried for eighteen months on one of these areas, and so far has not given a significant increase in yield of sultanas. At Koraleigh a trial of gypsum and \" no cultiva tion \" on heavy lands has given only slight increases in yield of sultanas, not statistically significant. The \" no cultivation \" trial on the Kesearch Station itself suffered a difficult year, because of watering troubles and a spring infestation of apple moth. Surveys of vine health in the Woorinen district have been continued. A limited experiment last Eebruary showed that decreasing vigour of vines and their losses in yield closely followed increasing soil moisture stress; confirmation of this will be sought next season. The assessment of the influence of soil pH on health of the vine in the Murray irrigation region may be carried out with increased precision if an allowance can be made for the effect of soluble salts on soil pH. A method of making such a correction for Woorinen soils has been worked out. With reference to green manuring, it has been found that on Coomealla sandy loam annual application of phosphate is necessary for maximum growth of tick beans. This type of trial has now been extended to include a heavier soil.37 Trial applications of the insecticides parathion and lime-sulphur in the spring of 1952 for control of mealy bug on vines gave no significant results. As in the previous year, sultana hunches near the trellis posts had a greater percentage infestation than those away from posts, suggesting that the posts aiford harbour for the insects during the winter. Experiments on the control of \" shoot restriction disease \" of sultanas included an autumn application of lime-sulphur last season. This was found to be ineffective, whereas a spring application just before bud\"burst was almost completely successful in prevent ing the curled leaf and stunted shoot growth charac teristic of the disease. A point of considerable practical interest is whether the heavy incidence of downy mildew of the vine on certain properties last season had any effect on the development of primordia for next season's crop. _ If there were such an effect, it might influence the pruning of the vines during this winter. Examination of dormant buds taken in June, 1953, from an area where the whole crop was badly infected with downy mildew in November, 1952, showed that the percentage potential fruitfulness was not significantly different from tliat in the district as a whole. The average primordium size was appreciably greater than the district average. In the area examined, downy mildew was so severe that by the end of November, 1952, all bunches were destroyed and in some portions of the property all leaves had dropped as well by that time. Good vegetative growth was made later in the season. AVeekly measurements of the circumference of Valencia oranges were continued to the end of the 1952 season. It has been established that regular measurement of a small number of oranges, the same ones each time, is sufficient to give a good index of growth increments. This means that the measurements could be made by growers themselves, to give indications of variations in factors, notably soil moisture condi tions, important in maintaining satisfactory growth. Observations on blossoming and fruiting of citrus have been continued. Eecords of the time of opening of each flower and time of drop of flowers or young fruit were kept as in 1951. In both Navels and Valencias the past season was one of good setting. Most, fruit was set by relatively late-opening flowers on the second, third, and fourth positions on multiple-flowered shoots. There was an appreciable difference in time of opening between flowers on similar shoots on different sides of the tree. Erom a better understanding of the processes of flowering and setting, a system of regula tion of these processes may be attainable. (d) Plant Nutrients.\u2014The Station's investigations in this field continue to be directed largely towards nitrogen nutrition of the vine and soil conditions affecting it. Soil analyses from the comprehensive fertilizer trial on sultanas planted on soil of medium texture at the Station have confirmed previous findings that green manure over a period of years has significantly increased total soil nitrogen in the surface 6 inches (50 per cent, increase). A small increase, up to 10 per cent., is associated with the use of annual dressings of sulphate of ammonia at the rate of 4 cwt./acre. Foliage on the plots treated with sulphate of ammonia at the rate of 4 cwt./acre shows greater content of total nitrogen than that from plots not receiving this fertilizer. These results are from an area where yield increases of sultanas are commonly obtained by the use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This investigation is being extended to include an area of lighter soil at Eed Cliffs, where fertilizer trials over a number of years have not shown any responses to sulphate of ammonia.Trials of various rates of application of sulphate of ammonia to land carrying sultanas have been made during the past two seasons on Coomealla loam at the Station and on Murray sand on another Merbein property. In the Station trial, the total nitrogen content of foliage in October and December was increased by spring applications of sulphate of ammonia and decreased by growth of winter barley which was cut and removed at the end of August. In both trials, changes in soil nitrate during the season have been followed to gain information on nitrogen availability. Eemoval of nitrogen from the land by the barley treat ment has been found very variable from plot to plot within each trial. An experiment on different times of application of sulphate of ammonia at the same total rate of 3 cwt./acre has confirmed a previous finding that yield of sultanas is better when the fertilizer is applied in either early or late spring rather than as split dressings. Further investigations on the accumulation of nitrogen in the sultana vine have been made over the period January to June. Leaf blades, petioles, shoots, trunk, and root have been sampled for analysis with the object of elucidating the question of winter storage of nitrogen in the vine. (e) Fruit Processing.\u2014This is reported in Chapter XIII., Section 12. (/) Vegetahles.\u2014Eesults of investigation since 1950 of desirable characters in Fi hybrid tomatoes for the glasshouse have been assembled for publication. _ The object of this work was to find whether the desirable characters of pairs of varieties could be combined together with Fi hybrids. In two of these, S.A. Dwarf Eed (C strain) x Vetomold and Tatinter x Vetomold,combinations of high yields, good growth habit, high percentages of first grade fruit, and resistance to leaf mould were obtained. A trial of the use of \" Krilium \" for soil conditioning in the growth of tomatoes under glasshouse conditions has been started on Curlwaa loam at Buronga. In work on field tomatoes, hybrids selected for resistance to fusarium wilt and for suitability to the conditions of the Murray Valley have reached an advanced stage. Several very promising lines in the F4 generation are now under test for fusarium resist ance in preparation for field plantings in 1953-54. Selection for nematode resistance and suitable agronomic qualities of hybrid tomatoes obtained from crosses utilizing the resistant varieties obtained from the United States of America is being carried out each season. An increase in the percentage of resistant plants has been achieved. Although seed is sown in heavily infested seed beds and careful examination is made of seedlings before transplanting, many of those planted out develop root knots. Nevertheless, good progress has been made towards a useful resistant type. A trial of the effects of methods of farm manage ment on the root-knot nematode population of the soil, which was commenced at Eed Cliffs in 1951-52, is stillin progress. Soil samples are taken from the plots in spring and autumn and susceptible plants are grown in each sample. Where practicable, counts of nematode larvae on the roots of some of these plants are made while the plants are still young. Others are grown to maturity and given root ratings in accordance with the extent of gall formation. It has been found im practicable to make larval counts on plants grown in the soil samples taken in the spring, apparently because of low initial activity of the nematodes. The two fallow treatments, namely, a bare fallow and a .summer fallow followed by winter barley, have shown .some reduction in nematode population assessed by38 the above method. The treatment in which sinsceptiblc tomatoes are grown maintains nematode activity at a very high level. Oxving to the difficulties in securing completely resistant tomatoes, the treatment involving growth of a resistant tomato crop has so far shown nematode activity of a somewhat similar order to that found in the treatment growing susceptible tomatoes. During 1052, a small quantity of seed of Crotalaria spectahilis was obtained from the Division of Plant Industry. This plant has proved valuable, as a cover crop in some parts of the United States of America, where it reduces the severity of nematode infestation. The seed has been sown at Red Cliffs in order to increase the supply of seed for use in further work on nematode control. Inoculation of the seed with a suitable culture supplied for the work by the Department of Agriculture was found nece.ssary for optimum growth of this plant. 3. Ikriga'i'ion Research Station (Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas), Griffith, New South \"Wales. Waterlogging and salinity are important problems in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas, and much of the work of the Research Station at Grif fith ha.s been concerned with the principles and methods of applying water and the removal of surplus water by drainage. The district grows a particularly wide range of crops, the most im portant being citrus, peaches, wine grapes, vege tables, rice, and pastures. The early work of the Station was directed mainly at citrus problems, hut in recent years studies of plant physiology and other more fundamental work have had a wider significance. (a) Irrigation.\u2014Studies are being continued on the effect of weather and soil moisture levels on transpira tion. By following the soil moisture in a citrus orchard by progressive soil sampling, it has been found that the rate of removal of water from the soil progressively diminishes as the moisture content of the soil decreases. This information makes it possible to determine the best spacing of irrigation. Similar results are obtained when a representative sample of orchards in the dis trict is taken. In this way, using evaporimeter read ings, it is possible to construct soil moisture extraction curves during the winter (non-irrigation season) to predict when the irrigation season should open. (b) Drainage.\u2014The appropriate depth and spacing of tile drains for the major soil types on the Murrum bidgee Irrigation Areas has been determined and the results tabulated for use in the design of the tile drain systems. A method for determining the drainage characteristics of the land by the use of small bores has been evolved. This consists of sinking a small bore down into the water-table, pumping by means of a portable pump, and observing the extent of the lateral infiuence of the pumping on the water-table. These methods are now being used in a district-wide tile drain programme. In long-term experiments the effects of two farm-size tile drain installations on the water-table, soil salt con tent, and health and productivity of plantings is being observed. (c) Soil Physics.\u2014The permeability of the soil is important in irrigation. The soil structure may be changed in such a way as to reduce itvS permeability by the use of unsuitable irrigation water or the accumu lation of sodium salts in the soil, by mechanical com pression due to faulty tillage practice, and by the loss of organic matter in the soil. Loss of soil structure leading to reduced permeability is a major problem of irrigation. Changes in the microstructure of the soil have been studied. A technique was evolved which enables changes in the finer soil aggregates during permeationto be studied under the microscope. In this way the roles of displacement and solution of air and the swelling of soil aggregates on changes in permeability during permeation have been resolved and the reasons for anomalous changes in permeability noted by other workers have been explained. The effect of sodium ions in the permeating solution, leading to a collapse of the structural aggregates, was also investigated. It was noted in an experimental orange orchard that, where tillage is eliminated but weeds are suppressed by the use of herbicidal sprays, water lies on the sur face after very little has been applied as rain or irrigation water. This does not occur on tilled plots. It has been found that this is not due to changes in the permeability of the undisturbed soil but to the storage capacity of the tilled surface layer of the soil. When this has been satisfied the infiltration rate of tilled and bare unfilled soil is the same. The permea bility of sod plots, however, is much greater and this has been traced to the formation in the soil of burrows 2 mm. and more in diameter by irusects and other soil fauna. In this experiment soil aggregate stability is reduced by tillage and increased by sod. It is also increased by the use of sulphate of ammonia as a fertilizer, this being associated with a decrease in the soil pIT. (d) llorticidture.\u2014(i) Factorial Field Experiment irith Citrus.\u2014-The investigation of the manganese deficiency that is found in this experiment was com pleted. It was found that, although the trees on the iion-cultivated treatments were lower in manganese than those on the cultivated treatments, there was no difference in the exchangeable soil manganese. It was aho found that effects due to the fertilizer treatments and that previously ascribed to irrigation could be closely related to changes in soil pH induced by these treatments. All the experiment has now been sprayed with manganese and the visual deficiency symptoms on the sprayed leaves have disappeared. The length of time that this spray will be effective is now being investigated. The soil nitrogen studies have continued with a further field sampling throughout the summer. This has shown a slow rate of disappearance of exchangeable ammonia in the bare soil plots compared to the other plots. The remarkably high content of exchangeable ammonia in the bare soil plots at the higher levels of added nitrogen continues. These studies have also <hown that the soil pH has been considerably lowered by the increasing applications of ammonium sulphate fertilizer, and laboratory pot experiments have shown that the capacity of the soil to nitrify ammonia has been considerably reduced. (ii) Frost Prevention.\u2014Trials continued with a high-speed horizontal axis fan. Reasonably satisfactory control of air temperatures on frosty nights was obtained. However, it is felt that, to complete the tests, information on the prevention of frost damage to fruit is required. As no damaging frosts occurred during the 1952 winter it was not possible to obtain this information (see also Chapter XXVIII., Section 5). (e) Plant Physiology.\u2014(i) Soil Fertility.\u2014The methods of crop physiology have been used to investi gate the effects of adding organic matter, such as rice hulls, to the soil. Three distinct types of response have been recognized\u2014a delaying effect on germination, a set back to seedling growth, and a subsequent stimu lation of growth such that the final yield exceeds that of the control. The stimulation is due to an increased intake of phosphorus, and it is upon this phenomenon that attention has been focussed during the current year.39 Furtlicr pot-culture experiments liaA'e strengtliened the rievv that the additional ijliospliorus is liberated irom the soil and is not derived from the added organic matter. In particular it seems that the addition of pure sugars to the soil can produce the same effect as that produced by rice hulls. This work has shoAvn that, by studying the physiology of the crop plant a.s it groivs in the field, it is possible to learn something of the reasons Avhy certain cultural pi'actices and fertilizer treatments are beneficial. Such an approach is sometimes more reliable than , the more orthodox study of the soil itself, and a combination of these tAvo methods i.s still more likely to give results. (ii) Plant Water Relations.\u2014The Avork is designed to gain a knoAvledge of the factors involved in plant groAvth in response to water regime. The aim is to enable a reasoned ai)proach to irrigation practice and to provide a better understanding of plant metabolism in relation to Avater statu.s. The response of tomato plants and flax plants to a brief period of Avater shortage has been studied in order to undcu'stand hoAv plants respond to differences in .soil moisture content. The relations for the AA^holc plant and plant fractions have been considered for movement of nutrients into and Avithin the plant in relation to dry AA'eight and moisture content changes. The studie.s have been most detailed Avith the tomato and have included trends for individual laminae and petioles in plant.s having eight leaves at time of treatment. The re.sults point to a marked decrease in uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus during Avilting and a considerably enhanced intake very soon after Avater- ing to field capacity. The protein nitrogen in the leaf blades folloAved the same pattern. The finding.s shoAv that Avater stress of OAmn a moderate nature may haA'e a measurable effect on plant functioning. As such effects must influence ultimate yield the assessment of their nature is important to irrigation practice. fiii) Leaf Area Alensvremcnt.\u2014A rapid method for the estimation of leaf area in crop plants was examined and perfected some years ago. This method has now been tested for bias resulting from fatigue, and other cause.? and has given satisfactory results. Experimental Avork Avhich could not otherwi.se have been done has been made possible by using this method. V. ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION. 1. Gexeral. Research into problems of animal health and animal production has formed an important phase of the Orga nization's actiAuties. This Avork is undertaken Avithin the Division of Animal Health and Production with head-quarters in Melbourne, Victoria. The field of research undertaken by the DiAusion has widened Avith the jjassage of time and has been modified to meet changing national and scientific requirements. The major activities and the results obtained are reported in this Chapter and in Chapters VII. and VIII. Attention has been draAvn previously to the satis factory advance in our knowledge and control of disease of livestock of Australia. NcA-ei'theless, it is necessary that this knoAvledge be advanced still further and that the Division be maintained as the central national organization for the attack on problems of disease AA'hether these arise from internal or exotic causes. The increased security of the animal industry against livestock diseases has enabled the activities of the DiA'ision to be extended in the field of animal production. Chief among these extensions is the pro vision to undertake the study of animal-breeding problems associated Avith beef production in tropical Australia.Co-operative Avork Avitli other Divisions and with Departments of Agriculture and Avith the Universities in the several States and Federal Territories has con tinued to play an important part in the activities of the Division. During the year 47 original scientific papers AAmre submitted for publication. Section 12 of this Chapter sets out the investigations carried out by the Animal Genetics Section, other than those on sheep and cattle, which are included in Chapter VII., Section 14 and Chapter VIII., Section S respectively. 2. Axiaiai, Health RicsEAECH Laboeatory, Melbourne. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) The admini.Btrative head-quarters of the Division are situated in this laboratory Avhere experimental work on microbiological chemistry and animal physiology and pathology is carried out. The results of the work relating to sheep are reported in Chapter VII. and those relating to cattle in Chapter VIII. The following are the major inAmstigations in pro gress at the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Mel bourne:\u2014Pleuropneumonia of cattle (see Chapter VI11., Section 2 (a)). Mastitis in dairy cattle (see Chapter VIII., Section 2(h)). Haematuria vesicalis of cattle (see Chapter VIlI., Section 2 (d)). Brucel losis of cattle (see Chapter VIII., Section 2 (c)). Physiology of milk secretion (see Chapter VIII., Sec tion t) (h)). Caseous lymphadenitis of sheep (see Chapter VII., Section 16 (a)). Toxicity of large rations of Avheat (see Chapter VII., Section 9). Infer tility and physiology of reproduction in sheep (see Chapter VII., Section 12). Sheath rot of wethers (see Chapter VII., Section 16 (c)). Footrot in sheep (see Chapter VII., Section 16 (d)). \" Toxaemie jaundice\" of sheep (.see Chapter VIL, Section 16 (h)). 3. McMastee Animal Health Laboeatoet, Sydney. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) Re-oarfdi at this laboratory includes studies on internal and external parasites, principally of the sheep (see_ Chapter VII., Sections 17-18), nutrition with particular reference to carbohydrate metabolism in ruminants (.see Chapter VII., Sections 4 and 7) andto problems associated Avith drought-feeding of sheep (see Chapter VII., Section 8), on some aspects of the phy.fiology of reproduction (see Chapter VII., Section 12), and on certain infections and metabolic diseases. The McMaster Laboratory is, at present, the head quarters for tbe Avork of the Section of Mathematical Statistics within the Division and several of the Section s officers are housed there. They haA'e continued to play an active and most valuable part in the planningof experiments and in the analysis and interpretation of results. The officer in charge of this work is a mem ber of several of the research teams, including those conducting the sheep-breeding trials and the Merino strain trials within the Division. The results of some of the work are incorporated in Chapter VII., Section 13 (d). investigations in progress at theMcMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, are:Infectious bovine ophthalmia (.see Chapter Vlll.jSeetion 2 (e)). Epididymites in rams (see Chapter VIE, Section 16 (e)). 4. Veterinary Parasitoi.ogy Laboratory, Veeeongpilly, Queensland. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) _ Research at this laboratory is concerned mainly with iiiAestigation of parasites and of parasitism affectingive-stock, particularly those occurring in Queensland.Ihe laboratory also accommodates officers of the40 Division of Entomology engaged on investigations into the control of the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus {see Chapter VIII., Section 4). During the year facilities for field work became available by the establishment of the Amberley Field Station, near Ipswich, where atten tion will be given to parasites of cattle. Close co-operation with the Queensland Department of Agricnlture and Stock in all research problems is maintained and is assisted by the Joint Veterinary Parasitology Committee. Investigations in progress by the officers of the Division of Animal Health and Production include the following studies. {a) hirer Fluke.\u2014The snail intermediate host of the liver fiuke, hepalica, has been identified as Simliinnea suhu qua tills in all the mainland States of Australia. Under laboratory conditions and in a field trial the sodium and copper salts of pentachlorophenol showed considerable promise as molluscacides against S. suhaquatilis, but the study of the residual effect on tlie snail population has not yet been completed. (b) Haemonchus contortus of Cattle and Sheep.\u2014 Investigations to determine if II. contortus of cattle and sheep are distinct si)ceies have been continued and com- ))letcd. It has been found that there are morphologica] differences in male and female parasites from cattle and sheep. Infective larvae from cattle strains are visually distinct from those from sheep. Evidence favours the decision that II. contortus of cattle and sheep probably comprises two distinct species, {() Larval Tick Infestation of IIorse.s.\u2014Lesions on horses similar to those found in allergic, dermatitis (\" Queensland itch\") have been seen on numerous occasions scattered over the face, legs, and body. These lesions were accomp)anied by intense irritation. Micro scopic examination of tho lesions showed a typical allergic reaction. Intradermal skin tests gave a positive reaction with an antigen prepared from larval Boophilus microplvs. The condition was also set up experimen tally by the application of larval ticks of this species. (d) Tick TorMus.-\u2014Studies on the toxins of ticks have been continued both by animal inoculation and by filter- paper eleetrophoresis. Electrophoresis studies showed differences in the protein composition of aqueous and saline extracts of eggs and larvae of Boophilus micro- plus. By complement fixation definite cross immunity reactions have been obtained. Immunization with extracts of B. microplus ])revented death in rabbits inoculated with extracts of Ilaemaphysalis hispinosa. Positive complement fixation tests have been obtained with serum of rabbits immunized with B. microplus antigen when an antigen ]5repared from 77. hispinosa. was employed, as well as when the system was reversed. In a limited number of tests, immunization of rabbits with cither B. microplus or 77. hispinosa antigen did not affect engorgement of larvae of 77. hispinosa. Microscopic examination showed that in immunized rabbits there was a more intense cellular reaction in the tissues than in non-immunized rabbits. These studies are being continued with, in addition, other species of of ticks were received for identification. The material examined included Ixodes cordifer Heumann collected in Hew Guinea and three specimens of 7. holocyclus ivom. Warragu], Warburton, and Mt. Buffalo, iii Victoria. The distribution of 7. holocyclus in Victoria had pre viously been considered as coastal, extending as far south as Lakes Entrance.(/) Allergic Dermatitis of the Horse.\u2014These studies Lave been completed. It was determined that allergic dermatitis was associated with the development of a hyperaensitivity to the bites of a sandfly, Culicoides rohertsi, and could be prevented by regular weekly spraying with DDT. Treatment of affected horses with \" Ilapamine \" (histamine azoprotein) proved successful in most instances. Other major investigations in progress at the Veterin ary Parasitology Laboratory, Yeerongpilly, are: Epidemiology of parasitic gastro-cnteritis of cattle (see Chapter VIII., Section 3 (a)). Faecal examination as a measui'o of helminth infestation in cattle (see Chapter VIII., Section 3 (h)). Amphistome of cattle (see Chapter VIII., Section 3 (c)), \"Worm nodules (Onchocerea gibsoni) in cattle (work awaiting the pro vision of an insectary). Protection against body strike (sheep blowfly) (see ChaiAer VII., Section 19), 5. F. D. MoMaster Field Station, Badgeey's Creek, Hew South Wales. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) The development and study of hybrid dairy cattle based on Zebu crosses with British breeds have been continued. This study is reported in Chapter VIII., Section 6 (a). Other investigations in progress are: Inbred flocks of Australian Merinos (see Chapter VII., Section 13 (fl)). Inheritance of component fleece characters (see Ohaptor VII., Section 13 (h)). Hairiness of fluffy tip (see Chapter VII., Section 13 (c)). 6. Sheep Biology Laboratoey, Sydney. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) It was decided some years ago to establish a laboratory centre with adequate facilities for research on the jliysiology of the sheep and on wool production. An area of 115 acres at Prospect Hill, near Parramatta, Hew South Wales, ivas acquired in August, 1946. Plans for the necessary buildings were prepared but because of the shortage of materials and labour these have been considerably modified. Progress in the establishment of the facilities has been extremely slow. A house to accommodate the farm overseer has been completed and occupied. During the year one of the large animal houses to accommodate sheep in pens was completed and lyas put to limited use. A temporary surgery has been installed at one end, as well as an office which is occupied by one research officer, the farm overseer, and the liead animal attendant. The fleece and shearing building has been completed. The feed store, garage and workshop, and a sheep shelter-shed are Hearing completion. Two prefabricated laboratories have been erected and should soon be ready for occupation. An earth dam on Prospect Creek, a dog-proof peri meter fence, and sheep yards have been completed. -Vlso a start was made on the construction of sheep reception yards, sheep dip, fencing of the main drive, supply of water to troughs, and subdivision of the pasture area. These facilities and those projected will constitute the Sheep Biology Laboratory which will form the centre for the basic physiological or biological study of the sheep within the Division and with which a liaison with studies carried out at the several field stations ivill be established. Eesearch officers and staff that have been occupying temporary quarters in and around Sydney and Melbourne are gradually being brought together at this centre. A start has been made on the re-organization of the work. During the year the work of the scattered staff hasbeen carried out mainly at the Wool Biology Lnbora- toiy, the IMcklaster Laboratory, the Fleece ^\\nalysis41 Laboratory, all iu or around Sydney, and at the ^\\.nimal Health Laboratory, Melbourne. The worh of the group has included comparative studies of breeds of sheep, analysis of skin and fleece characters, experiments on skin autographs, population dynamics of hair follicles, hormonal regulation of wool growth, and the physiology of wool i3roduction. These studies nr' reported in Chapter VII., Section 15. Belated studies which may not apply to the shepj. directly are as follows:-\u2014 (a) The Biology of Mammalian Melunophores.\u2014 The pigment-producing melanophores have been studied in living tissue cultures of the skin of appro priate mouse embryos. The ditferentiation, move ment, and pigment accuninlation ol melanophores and the transfer of pigment granules from melanophores to the epidermis and developing hairs have been studied. (h) (lenetic Modification in Hair Follicle Develop ment in the \"Tahhy\" Mouse.\u2014A sex-linked gene Ta, recently discovered in the mouse by Falconer, produce.s tahby marking in the coat of feinale and an ajiparently different set female homoiiygotes (Ta/Ta) modifications of \"tabby\" homo- zygotes and hemizygotes include absence of two or three types of pelage hair follielas anil a reduction in the number of facial vibrissae. The investigation is being continued. It has important implications regarding the oaii-ses of follicle initiations and the origin of fibre type. The work of the group has also included that of the Fleece Analy.sis Laboratory. During the year 29,639 measurements were made on fleece samples. These were rerpured in the experimental biological work of the Division, mainly for the sheep-breeding and tlio Merino strain trial investigations. These determina tions included those for yield, density, mean diameter, staple length, and crimp. The investigations carried out in the Fleece Analysis Laboratory included that on the transfer of heat and moisture in fibrous masses, which has been continued. A statistical analysis of the results of the preliminary experiments on \" handle \" of wool indicated that three factors influenced the \"handle\" of raw wool; these wore fibre diameter, the percentage of suint, and the depth of the crimp waves. The exporimonts have been repeated but the results have yet to be submitted to statistical analysis. An investigation was started on the origin of golden- coloured bands iu wool from \" Gilriith Plains\", The association of the bands with the occurrence of rain after a dry spell seems to be well established. The investigation is being continued. The examination of fleece samples from particular strains of Merino sheep showed that the correlation between crimp and fibre diameter within a strain was exti'einely low, This relation was found to hold triu for the strains of sheep in three regional centres. During the year instruments for measuring ski area, for measuring fleece temperature and for record ing measnromonts of fibre diameter on a card were mode and also a humidity cabinet with temperature and humidity control. 1. BEaiONAn Pastoral Labguatoey, Armidale, Hew South Wales. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) Since the acquisition of \" Chiswick \" iji September, 1947, much work has been done to define problems of tlie area and to extend or apply the findings of other research workers. \" Chiswick \" is one of the areas usedfor the study of strains of Merino sheep in several environments reported in Chapter VII., Section 13 (e). The study of the effects of grazing management on pasture and animal production, which is a co-operative investigation with the Division of Plant Industry, has now been concluded and is reported in Chapter III., Section 15 (c) and Chapter VII., Section 21 (h). AVork on internal parasites of sheep has continued and has been supplemented by the appointment of an Ian McMaster Scholar to work on larval ecology. This work is reported in Chapter VII., Section 17. A study of the management of stock and pastures with difl'erent proportions of sown and native pa,stur8 has commenced and is reported in Chapter VII., Section 21 (e). Other investigations include the following;\u2014 (a) Slndies on Animal Behaviour.\u2014Observations on the grazing behaviour in flocks and paddocks of different sizes were continued. The liveweight gains of flocks of two sheep were lower than in larger flocks and a study was made to determine whether the grazing behaviour was detrimental to liveweight increase in this flock. A paddock of 2 acres was screened off to observe any changed behaviour when sheep in adjacent paddocks were not visible. (h) \"Staggers\" in Sheep.\u2014During 1952, experi ments were designed to confirm the jJi'otective role of cobalt both when given orally and when applied to a phalaris pasture as a top-dressing. Only one ease of .staggers developed and no conclusions could be drawn. In the winter of 1953, however, cases developed during May, earlier than usual, and after 4 weeks' grazing eight sheep of a group of 30 running on a phalaris-sub- terranean clover paddock have developed staggers. Cases have not occurred in 30 control sheep receiving cobalt per mouth nor in twenty sheep running in paddocks top-dressed with cobalt. (c) Production from Soivn Pastures versus Native Pastures.\u2014The comparison of liveweights and wool production from two groups of Merino sheep of the same age and breeding, grazing sown and native pastures, has continued with the same sheep. The mean weights of the two groups in May, 1953, were 104 and 75.4 lb. for the sown and native pastures respec tively. At shearing in ISTovember, 1952, the weights of greasy wool cut per head were 8.4 and 6.5 lb. As the group on the sown pasture were stocked at the rate of three sheep per acre the return on the sown pasture was 25.2 Ib./acre compared with 6.5 Ib./acre on the native pasture. (d) Studies of the Summer Management of Native Pastures.\u2014Sheep and cattle are being used separately and conjointly in a study being made by the Division of Plant Industry of the effect of various management practices designed to reduce the amount of aftermath ar the end of the summer on the winter carrying capacity of the native pastures (see Chapter III., Section 15 (c)). Further investigations in progress at the Eegional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, are; Heo-natal mortality in lambs (see Chapter AMI., Section 21 (a)). Internal parasites of cattle (see Chapter VIII,, Sec tion 3). Studies on anthelmintics (see Chapter VII., Section 17 (\u00ab)). 8. Hationai, Field Station. Gileuth Plains, Queensland. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) Pastures during the growing period of the wool clip .shprn in March, 1953, have been fair to good atdifferent times throughout the year, with the exception42 of a few weeks in January and early February wlieii they beeaiTJC quite dry; mid-February rains, totalling 3.01 inches, brought about a good response, and the grasses on the grey and brown clay plains, namely, the Mitchell grasses {Astrehla spp.) and Queensland blue grass {Dichanihiiim sericeum), flowed limited amount of Flinders grass (Iseilema mitchelli) germinated. .'V further 1.02 inches in mid-April pre vented the grasses from drying off again completely in the abnormally high April temperatures, and 2.10 inches of rain in late April-early May has resulted in considerable germination of herbage, more on the heavy clays than on the red stony loams which carry mulga {Acaria aiieura) as the dominant tree. The herbagt- growth was characterized by a heavy germination of wild mulberry (Alah'astrum spicaivm). In general, sheep have been in good to fair condi tion throughout the year. Ewes of the strain trial wcu; in excellent condition when brought in for mating in late April. Stocking rates continue to be conser vative, the present rate over the whole station being less than one sheep to 0 acres. The e.xperimental investigations carried out during: the year may be considered under two categories. Firstly, long-term Merino sheep-breeding studies and secondly, two smaller experiments which were almo.'^; completed within the year {se.e Chapter VII., Section 13(d)). Under the first category is included a selection trial in which different methods of selection arc being comjiared and data are gathered for the determinatio of the hcritability of certain characteristics of the Merino. Other trials in this category are the strain trial, in which five strains of the Australian Merino are being compared under the environments of Cuimamnlla, Queensland, Armidale, Hew South Walc.=, and Deniliquin, Hew South Wales, and a trial on the inheritance of hornedness and polledness in Merinos {see Chapter VII., Section 13 (/)). Under the second category is included a preliminary trial to determine if wetbers of the different strains of Merino represented in the strain trial vary in theii- cfflcioncy of conversion of food (lucerne chaff and wheat) to clean wool. An experiment to determine tin effect of testosterone propionate on the horn growth of young male Merinos (horned and polled) was alst- carried out. Investigations into the causes of lamb mortality within approximately three days of birth have bee' continued in the experimental flocks. Of 711 lamli. born ill the selection trial, 9.6 per cent, died within three days of birth. The main causes were starvation and suffocation; in eighteen deaths out of 68 no laeto'. contributing to death could be recognized. The^ standardization of observers who take part in the san.pliiig and measuring of sheep is now done annually, with the result that between-observer differences have been reduced and any that remain can be allowed f by making observer corrections to the field data. Approximately 1,100 ewes have had numbered coloured plastic eartags inserted in their ears in addi tion to the aluminium tags already present. Eachof the seven colours has been allotted to a group o\" ewes that needs quick field identification, especially during the drafting of flocks. 9. Hational Cattle Breeding Station, \" Belmont Rockiiampton, Queensland. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) \"Belmont^' was acquired by the Australian Meat. Board in 19d2 for co-o,perative cattle breeding investi gations by the Organization and the Queensland Depart ment of Agriculture and Stock.Rainfall in Rockiiampton for 81 years ending 1951 has a mean of 38.95 inches distributed with a marked summer peak, 24 inches falling in the summer months. December-March. The 1953 rainfall for the first six months, 19.35 inches is some 7 inches below the Rock iiampton mean for this period. (a) I'ashires.\u2014The response to the January, Feb ruary and March rains, which totalled 17 inches, wms very good on all formations and, although the Fitzroy River did not flood, the lower country produced a most luxuriant growth of a wide variety of useful grasses. Spear grass on the higher country provided good graz ing until the first frosts were received in the middle of May when it browned off very rapidly. The present available pastures are ample in quality and amount for the numbers of stock being carried. (b) Siock.\u2014The numbers and types of cattle being acquired are in keeping with the experimental pro gramme : 310 Hereford heifers were purchased late in 1952 and 306 were delivered to \" Belmont\" on 21st March; six Hereford bulls ex \" Play fields \", Dululu, arrived at \"Belmont\" on 6th March. One of these bulls has since died. Stock imported from the United States, of America, consisting of tliree Zebu bulls, two Zebu heifers, and five Africander bulls, arrived at Belmont \" on 12th April after being quarantined in Sydney, and after being staged at Yeerongpilly, Queens land, for tick fever inoculations. Zebu-cross heifers and cows were acquired from \"Waverley\", St. Lawrence, and from \" Roblyn\", Pandoin, and 30 arrived at \" Belmont\" on 31st May. The experimental cattle population on \" Belmont \" at present is as follows:\u2014 .Males. .. 30 Total 13 338 Steps were taken to acquire the Shorthorn cattle necessary for the experimental programme, and three bulls with 180 heifers ex Coreena Pastoral Company properties, Claremont, Queensland, reached \" Belmont \" on 19th June. Advice has been received that the balance of the Africander consignment\u2014two heifers\u2014 have arrived in Brisbane from the United States of America and are now undergoing quarantine. All stock, imported and local, is in good condition and, apart from tick worry which is discussed later, should continue to thrive well into the spring. (c) Improvements.\u2014The experimental programme calls for He creation of facilities which, in the early stages, will permit of the mating of at least twelve single-sire groups each of one bull and 30 cows in the first year, and in subsequent years paddocks each to contain one bull, 30 cows, and, at the time of mating, the three-months-old progeny of the previous vear's joining. (d) ^ Diseases and Pests.\u2014Outstanding in the environ ment is the cattle tick {Boophilus microplus) which is affecting all types and strains of cattle at present on \"Belmont\". There is little evidence so far that theZebu and Africander strains are any less susceptible to infestation and worry than the Herefords. It has been necessary to dip or spray all stock once a month.The main plunge dip is charged with a BHC mixture,whereas once a month a \" Rucide \" (DDT) cream pre paration has been used for spraying. Methods so faradopted to control tick infestation appear to be oflimited value. Bathurst burr (Xanthium spinosum) and prickly pear {Opunha spp.) are both serious weed pests on many parts of the property. (e) Experirnental Programme.\u2014The first majorundertaking will be a series of studies on the adaptationof representative groups of temperate and tropical43 strains of cattle to a tropical environment. The basic temperate region herds Avill consist of Hereford _ and Shorthorn males and females of pure strain in addition to crosses of both these representatives in both direc tions. Zebu and Africander bulls will be used as tropical region sires and these will be mated with females of both Hereford and Shorthorn breeds. Each sire group will be replicated three times. In all, this section of matings will involve twelve groups each consisting of one bull and 30 cows. Observations and measurements will be made on a\" wide range of characteristics including birth weights, rate of growth, heat tolerance, skin texture, buffalo-fly and tick resistance. The first task will be to define these observations and to evolve techniques for the measurement and recording of selected characters. It is confidently expected that all facilities and stock will be ready for the first experimental mating in January, 1954. It is planned to commence very soon a series of observations on the incidence of oestrus in cows. 10. Poultry Eesbarch Centre, Werjeibee, Victoria. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) The Poultry Research Centre, which was established in I94G with the purchase of a foundation flock of 450 growing pullets, was built up to a satisfactory level during the year. Housing and equipment are now available to keep 3,000 pullets in individual hen-cages and 2,070 hens in houses fitted with trapnests or in single test pens. In addition, facilities have been pro vided to house about GOO roosters and to rear 6,000 growing chickens, required annually for replacement. .\\11 post-mortem examinations are now carried out at the Centre with the object of obtaining complete and detailed mortality statistics. To facilitate the handling and computing of the numerous statistical data obtained yearly from over 5,000 fowls, the Hollerith system was introduced and the necessary punching and sorting equipment installed. The general research programme remained unaltered. (a) Investigation of Breeding Systems.\u2014Results from a detailed analysis of the E-pullets (E^ genera tion) can be summarized as follows:\u2014(i) of crossbred pullets in annual egg produc tion has again been demonstrated for the fifth consecu tive year. When crossbred pullets were compared with their purebred half-sisters they excelled by 39-4-6 eggs for the period ending at 72 weeks of age. (ii) No significant differences between the different types of crosses were found, though the single cross lietween White Leghorn male and Black Australorp female seems to be slightly superior to the reciprocal one. (iii) The rotational cross (criss-cross), probably carried out for the first time with poultry, gave excellent results in egg production and reproductive rate, and is the most eco nomical of all crosses to be produced, as the female flock consists exclusively of crossbreds and only a few pure bred males have to be purchased from outside, (iv) The group bred by selection of genetically superior sires and dams on the basis of progeny or sib-testing, or both, and mated together under a system which avoids close inbreeding, made further steady progress in egg production and is still superior to all other systems of purebrecding under observation, (v) The liagedoorn system (superior sire method with half-sib matings) showed for the first time some effect of the selection practised, (vi) Inbreeding has now shown its deleteri ous eflfects on egg production, hatchability, and viability. The conclusions, in general terms, from the viewpoint of practical breeding policy, can be summed up as follows: (i) The most effective way of improving(liai'acter.s of a qualitative nature with low heritability . in a pure-bred population is by selection of genetically superior parents which are discovered by progeny or sih-testing, or both, and by mating to avoid close in breeding. (ii) Egg production, hatchability, and viability show heterosis as the result of heterozygosity and depression following increased homozygosity (in breeding). (iii) Results obtained by purebreeding according to (i) can be further improved by obtaining heterosis through crossbreeding between breeds. Parents which fn'oduce superior purebred progeny proved also superior for crossbreeding (effect of general combining value). Evidence for nicking (specific combinability) ha= not been found yet. (h) Physiology of Reproduction and. Inheritance of Fecundity.\u2014Work on the deep freezing of semen has been suspended until necessary equipment for this investigation can be made available. The storage of fowl semen at room temperature was investigated further with a view to improving fertility results by controlling bacterial growth through antibiotics. Sulphamerazine in Tyrode solution proved to be of no practical advantage in extending the storage time of fowl semen at room temperature over 4 hours. Experi ments have been commenced with the object of labelling sperm with '^-P and tracing their passage up the oviduct to discover reasons for infertility in the female fowl. This promises to develop into a most valuable toehiiique. Data regarding the quantity and quality of semen produced by a few hundred roosters will be analyzed for a study of the inheritance of fecundity in the male. (c) Other Investigations.\u2014Observations were made on the effect of different light intensities on egg produc tion of pullets in individual hen-cages. The results have still to be analyzed. A series of experiments was undertaken to verify the possibility of interrupting incubation after 14 hours to permit a fertility test, and to continue incubation of fertile eggs after an interval of several days without harmful effects. This practice can be recommended if it is desired to obtain 100 per cent, fertile eggs. 11. Miscellaneous Investigations. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (rt) Sparganosis in Pigs.\u2014The investigation has been concluded and the findings are being prepared for publication. (b) Studies of the Copper Content of Blood and of Liver in Sheep and other Animals in Western Australia. \u2014Systematic studies of blood-copper levels and of copper concentration in the liver of sheep at Merredin, Western Australia, have been continued. An attempt has been made to correlate seasonal variation in the copper status of the sheep with changes in the inorganic constituents of the pasture. A co-operative study was started with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture at the Bramley Research Station. The copper status of the pasture plants is low and an attempt is being made to determine what other factors, if any, contribute to copper deficiency in the grazing sheep. Samples of blood and liver have been collected from marine and land animals in a comparative study of the copper content of tissues according to species and environment. (c) Silica Calculi in Wethers in Western Australia. \u2014A co-operative investigation was started on the occurrence of silica calculi in wethers in certain areas in Western Australia. The silica values in the urine of sheep in the affected areas, as elsewhere, were found ro vary greatly, from 24 mg. to 320 nig. SiOo/inl. The44 seasonal variation is being- studied and a searcli is being made for the cause of the precipitation of silica com pounds in the urinary tract. (d) Investigation of Beef Production in Australia.\u2014 See Chapter VIII., Section 7. 13. Animal Genetics. (Animal Genetics Section.) The Animal Genetics Section was established during 1953 in co-operation with the University of Sydney. The unit is located in the Departments of Zoology and Veterinary Physiology and is under the leadership of Dr. J. M. Eendel. The Section aims to investigate the possibilities of applying genetical knowledge to animal breeding, and to introduce university honours students interested in genetics to the techniques and concepts of quantitative inheritance. During the year one honours student graduated from the Section and has joined the staff of the Poultry Ecsearch Centre, Werribee, Vic toria. Two students are at present undergoing training in the Section. The work of the Animal Genetics Section on sheep is described in Chapter VII., Section 14, that on cattle is described in Chapter VIII., Section 8. Tlie remain ing work of the Section is reviewed below. (ft) Mouse Breeding.\u2014A mouse colony of some 1,000 breeding pairs has now been established. These are used in two different investigations; the majority in selection experiments designed to test empirically the effect of methods of selection, the rest in detailed developmental studies. In addition, some stocks of pure lines are kept. These have been split into sub- lines, so that at the end of ten generations or so, sub-lines derived in the first place from a single pair of inbred mice can be compared. This will give an approximate measure of the rate of origination of new genetic variation of a kind which cannot be attributed to single genes and so cannot be given a mutation rate in the normal way. Three selection experiments are in hand and of these one has been going for three generations and already shows response to selection. This experiment is being carried out in collaboration with the Veterinary Physiology Department of the University of -Sydney and is designed to create .a line of mice sensitive to oestrogen and a line insensitive to it. It will yield lines of mice which should be of use in two ways (i) in studying the genetics of cancer susceptibility in mice, (ii) in further studies of the ISTaked gene, -which are described below. More detailed studies will later be carried out on stocks of mice which have heen imported from Britain. Stocks of these mice are being built up; in the mean while one, known as Naked, has started to yield in teresting information. The Naked mouse has hair v/hich breaks off close to the skin very soon after the fibre is fully formed. This mouse has hair only on skin in ivhich fibres are actively growing, and so the way in which waves of growth pass down the body from head to tail can be followed. The characteristic patterns and rates of hair growth have now been estab lished for these mice. Normally, waves of growth pass from head to tail. The picture is the same for males and females, and for castrated and ovariectomized mice except that ovariectomized mice seem to have a slightly faster growth than entire females. In preg nancy all growth ceases and the mouse becomes com pletely naked a few days after parturition. There are several features of the resumption of hair growth which offer a lead to further study. There is a strong sug gestion that growth patterns are affected directly or indirectly by level of oestrogen. When the stocksare established this gene can be transferred into lines of high and low oestrogen sensitivity and the effect of this sensitivity on hair growth observed. (h) Production of Antibodies and Disease Resist ance.\u2014Dr. Sobey arrived from Edinburgh this year to undertake research in this field. The subject will be closely connected with work on myxomatosis in the first instance. Some general observations on the variability of response of pure lines of mice to injee- .tion of antigens are under way, and steps have been taken to start a rabbit colony for the work on myxo matosis. (c) Genes and Chromosomes.\u2014In recent years two schools of thought about the nature of the gene have arisen. One supposes that the gene is a large complex structure capable of acting as a multiple antigen and of taking many forms which are familiar to us as series of multiple alleles. The other supposes that there is confusion here between single genes and blocks of closely linked genes. Most, if not all, series of multiple alleles would be closely linked genes. To test this mutations could be looked for at a locus which has several alleles and see whether mutation was asso ciated more frequently than expected with chromosome interchange. If it is, this \"vmuld suggest that a pro portion of the new types apparently due to mutation were in fact due to interchange between groups of closely linked genes which only very rarely cross over. Stocks of Drosophila melanogaster for such experi ments have now been made, and the first experiments set up. This experiment -will have to run some time before sufficient mutations have accumulated. The actual process of chromosome interchange re mains obscure. No explanation so far put forward accounts satisfactorily for the simultaneous breaking of two chromatids at the identical place. The effect of temperature on the rate of interchange as reported in the literature suggests inconsistency with current theory. The data are inadequate for positive proof. Stocks of Drosophila are in the making which will enable this to be put to the test. VI. NUTRITION. 1. Genebal. A knowledge of animal nutrition is of fundamental importance to the efficient conduct of Australia's pastoral industries. The Organization's work in this field has been largely confined to studies of the nutri tional physiology of the sheep and the influence of nutrition on -wool production. This work is centred at the Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition. Application of the results of this work to the practical pn-oblems of the sheep industry continues to yield economic dividends which in recent years have been most spectacular. Initially there \"vms the demonstra tion that areas in southern Australia, hitherto abandoned as useless for agriculture, can be trans formed for efficient production when trace element deficiencies of zinc and copper have been rectified. As a corollary to this discovery, and by virtue of the complementary work on pasture improvement carried out by the Division of Plant Industry (sec Chapter III.), it is now clear that vast areas of the Australian continent, particularly in low rainfall regions, can similarly be rendered more productive after trace element adjustments have been effected. The results of these experiments have indicated the -wmy for develop ments of great economic significance, and the know ledge obtained from many other researches in the field of nutrition is finding its way steadily into practice. Dwisron of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.\u2014 The head-quarters and laboratories of the Division are in the grounds of the University of Adelaide, and it has45 field stations at various sites in Australia where nutri tional disabilities occur. The Division's work is largely devoted to the nutritional physiology of ruminants, more espiecially to the nutrition of sheep and to the influence of nutrition on wool production. Knowledge arising from the Division's experimental work is extended to application by the State Departments of Agriculture with which there is close liaison. Close co operation has also continued between the Division and the University of Adelaide. The Division's central field station, \" Glenthorne \", is now rapidly developing into a fine tool for research, considerable progress having now been made there with subdivision, pasture establishment, and the accumulation of Merino flocks. This Chapter describes some of the main researches of the Division, and lists others which are treated in more detail in Chapter III., Sections 11 and 19, and Chapter VII., Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 and 11. 2. Kuteition and Wool Production. (Division of Biochemistry and General jSTutrition.) During the year a review of existing knowledge of wool growth Avas prepared, by invitation, for an authoritative text on the physiology of farm animals which is being published in England. Experimental studies of nutritional factors ivliich directly influence Avool production are reported in Chapter VII., Section 2. 3. Studies op the Metabolic Processes op Sheep. (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) A series of studies Avhich aims at more complete understanding of the physiological and biochemical processes by AA'hich the sheep deals with its fodder has been continued. These investigations, together with others in this field carried out by the Division of Animal Health and Production, are described in Chapter VII., Sections 2-11. 4. Energy Metabolism. (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) The indirect calorimeters Avhich render possible a close assessment of the amount of energy dissipated by the sheep have been in almost constant use during the past year to provide information essential for the understanding of the overall problem of nutrition and Avool groAvth (see Chapter VII., Section 5). During this period a small and uoaM calorimeter has been built for the study of energy transactions in rats and other small laboratory animals. The primary purpose of this study is to help Avith- the understanding of the metabolic lesions that occur in zinc deficiency. 5. Vitamin A R.EQuiKEJtENTS op the Sheep. (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) The series of studies of the vitamin A requirements of the sheep has noAV been completed. The informa tion gained from these investigations has been published, and provides a sound basis of knoAvledge of this aspect of animal nutrition. 6. Efpects of Chronic Fluoeosis. (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) The studies of disabilities imposed on sheep confined to .Avaters containing an abnormally high concentration of fluorides have been continued (see Chapter VII., Section 10). 7. Minor Element Deficiencies in Animals' and Plants, (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) The underlying reasons for the more intensive studies of the deficiency states which supervene in plants andanimals when the minute quantities of copper, zinc, &c., necessary for normal function are not provided, have been discussed in previous Reports. These studies cover a Avide field of knoAvledge extending from nutri tional physiology to tissue metabolism; and all seek a more complete understanding of the functions served by these essential traces of heavy metals in living tissues. A series of studies of copper and cobalt deficiencies in the sheep is referred to in Chapter VII., Section 11. This is a continuation of the first series Avhich led to inijiortant agricultural developments and to the simple practical means of dealing Avith serious ailments Avhich aft'ect sheep depastured in many areas in Australia and elscAvhere. (a) Copper Deficiency in liats and Ihe Effects of Molybdenum on Copper Metabolism.\u2014A second series of nutritional and biochemical studies of the inter relationships between molybdenum and copper has been undertaken to extend further the findings of the studies mentioned in previous Reports. More detailed attention is noAV being given to metabolic lesions incurred in copper deficiency and to the physiological processes involved in the absorption, storage and elimination of copper. These have a direct bearing on the control of copper deficiency. (b) Zinc Deficiency in Rats.\u2014The solution of the difficult technical task involved in the freeing of foodstuffs from zinc has rendered possible a comprehensive physiological study of the zinc- deficient animal, and has opened the Avay to the investigation of the function that zinc assumes in living tissues. These exacting studies have been considerably extended. A close study has been made of the zinc-deficient rat's carhoyhdrate meta bolism, fat storage, and nitrogen metabolism, and the overall energy transactions are being studied to throAv further light on the findings. The metabolic lesion incurred by zinc deficiency is revealed only with difficulty as the zinc-deficient animal grows only to the limit allowed by its zinc intake; and once zinc becomes a functional part of the tissues it is retained with extraordinary tenacity. (c) Metabolic Defects in Zinc Deficiency.\u2014A study has been made of the aldolase content of the muscles of zinc-deficient rats, and the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of the diaphragm muscles has been investigated. A detailed study of the phosphorylated hexoses and trioses in the muscles of zinc-deficient rats Avas also made during this period. 8. Vitamin B12. (Division of Biochemistry and General JSTutrition.) (ft) General.\u2014-Experiments in the laboratory and in the field have proved that the untoAvard effects of cobalt deficiency in ruminants are those which supervene on a deficiency of the cobalt-containing accessory food factor, vitamin B12; and have shown that it is unlikely that cobalt sei'A-es any essential physiological function other than as a constituent of the complex molecule of vitamin B12 which originates in nature only as a product of the metabolism of certain micro-organisms.These_ facts have opened up new and important inA'estigations which bear directly on the outstanding liroblerns encountered in the nutrition of animals other than ruminants. (b) Microbiological Estimation of Vitamin Bj,.\u2014 Studies of the relations between the cobalt-content of the ingesta and bacterial synthesis of vitamin B12 have throAvn np into high relief the complications which vitamin Bjo-like substances introduce into micro biological assays. The synthesis of Autamin B12 and of pseudo-Antamins B12 under different conditions has been iuAmstigated in the rumen contents of a number ofsheep confined in metabolism cages in the Hackney46 aiUiUA; aud the findings are an important part of the intensive studies of cobalt deficiency in the sheep which are being conducted there. (r) Vitamin Requirements of the Rat and Vitamin Bn Assays.\u2014The use of the rat as an experi mental animal for the estimation of vitamin B12 has now been rendered possible; the success of the method depends on the lowering of the vitamin B12 reservp in the mothers of the rats used for the assays. Vitamin Bi2-free rations capable of sustaining normal growth when supplemented with vitamin B12 have been evolved, and a number of studies of the metabolic breakdown which supervenes on a deficiency of this vitamin has been started. (fZ) Vitamin B,j and Haemopoiesis. \u2014 The mechanism through which vitamin Bjo influences the formation of protoporpliyrin is being studied as a part of a more comprehensive investigation of the function of vitamin B12 in the production of blood cells. A long series of estimations of the free protoporphyrin andcoproporphyrin in the erythrocytes of sheep which had been reduced to the final stages of vitamin B,i2 deficiency, and of the changes in the concentrations of these porphyrins has been determined during the period of restoration to normal health subsequent to treatment with vitamin B12. The free protoporphyrin in the red cells of cobalt-deficient sheep is invariably higher than normal, and the concentration falls to normal after treatment of the animal with vitamin B12 or with cobalt. The concentration of iron in the plasma of the cobalt-deficient sheep is either normal or high. Fi'ce protoporphyrin in the red cells of copper-deficient slieep lias been found, similarly, to be high, though the concentration of iron in the plasma is lower than normal. 9. Plant Nutrition. (Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.) Tlie studies on mineral nutrition of plants, especially of the plants' requirements of zinc and copper, have been continued. This work is described in Chapter HI., Section 9. 10. Fikld Stations. (Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.) At the Division's central field station, \" Glenthorne \", situated about 11 miles south of the main laboratories, considerable iirogress has been made with subdivision fencing and with the establishment of pastures. Tenders have been let for the erection of a field labora tory aud fodder processing room to serve the sheep pens that are used for semi-intensive nutritional investigations. The main flock now has about 1,000 strong-woolled Merino sheep in it, and there is also a small flock of fine-woolled Merinos retained for special experimental work. During the year the usefulness of whale solubles, a by-product of the whaling industry, as a protein supple ment in the rations of pigs was estimated by two experimental trials which were undertaken as a co operative effort at the request of the South Australian Department of Agriculture. The results are now being prepared for publication. The trials provided an opiiortunity for officers of this Division to become familiar with the pig as an experimental animal and, at the same time, to answer questions of considerable immediate practical importance to animal industry. Nutritional experiments with a vci-y considerable outlay on a pig-breeding establishment would be neces sary before numbers suitable for critical scientific experiments would be available, and so a decision was reached to utilize pigs only -for special experimental work for which other animals are unsuitable.VII. SHEEP. 1. General. Wool is of the utmost importance in the Australian economy. Not only does it provide our major export, but it allows the use of vast areas of marginal land which cannot be turned to good account in other ways. With a sheep population of over 115,000,000, Australia produces about one-quarter of the world's wool and about twice as much as any other country, and more than one-half of the world's production of fine wool. Thus Australia has a vital interest in ensuring that wool can withstand the competition from artificial fibres. The remarkable success of the latter has been due in the main to the clear understanding arising from research on the physical and chemical properties of the new fibres. Moreover, the chemical industry established to produce them is planned as a co-ordinated and organized unit which ensures maximum efficiency and minimum wastage at all stages. It is a major aim of the Organizatiou's integrated programme of research in aid of the wool industry to investigate every phase of sheep and wool production: soil, pastures and nutrition, genetics, animal husbandry, wool processing, textile manufacture, and the exploita tion of by-products. The Organization has been given responsibility for carrying out this extensive programme under the provisions of the Wool Use Promotion Act 1945. The Government has set aside funds earmarked for this purpose amounting to almost \u00a3350,000 per annum in a Wool Eesearch Trust Account. Soil fertility is obviously of prime importance and outstanding results have been achieved in combating soil infertility arising from minor element deficiencies. On the plant side, too, special emphasis has been placed on pasture improvement and weed control. The work of the Organization on soils, pastures, and related matters affecting the pastoral industry is carried out by tlie Division of Soils and the Division of Plant Industry {see Chapters II. and III.). Work on the sheep itself has been undertaken within the Division of Animal Health and Production (Chapter V.) and the Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition (Chapter VI.), the Section of Matbeniatical Statistics being closely associated with the breeding investigations {see Section 13 {d) below), and the Division of Entomology co-operating in the field of animal disease {see Section 20 below). The Organization's work in the investigation of wool proce.ssing and wool textile research is undertaken at the Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories and the Division of Industrial Chemistry {see Chapter XVI.). The Animal Genetics Section's work on sheep breeding is described in Section 14 below. 2. Nutrition and Wool Production. (Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.) The series of experiments relating directly to nutri tion and wool production has now been extended to ])rovide further knowledge of the metabolism and utilization of the sulphur-containing amino acid, methionine, which is convertible in vivo to cystine, the main amino acid in wool keratin. Studies of the physiology of the wool follicles have been initiated to extend existing knowledge of the process of keratiniza- tion. In these studies the metabolic lesion, which previous work had shown to occur in the wool follicles of copper-deficient sheep, is being investigated further. Another series of experiments just completed has shown that both the rate of wool production and the efficiency of the conversion of the proteins in the fodder to wool keratin depend essentially on the overall energy transactions of the sheep, and has established fundamental laws which govern wool production.47 6'. Ir'nocEsSES OF Rumination. (Division of Bioclieniisti'y and General Nutrition.) Studies of the physiological and microbiological processes of rumination have been continued, and an investigation of the amino acid constitution of the bacterial and protozoa] fraction of the rumen contents has been started as a preliminary to a more extensive study of the overall changes which occur in the fodder ]iroteins during their passage through the rumen. (tt) The Passage of Starch from the Rumen to the Abomusum.\u2014The greater part of the starch in the stomach of the sheep is present in the fluid portion of the contents; the small amount in the solids is probably lodged in bacteria attached to the plant residues. A \\'ery large part of the starch of the whole digesta may be carried in the ciliate protozoa of the rumen fluid, ytarch/lignin ratios in the stomach contents suggest that there is an extensive destruction of starch in the omasum, and this is strongly supported by the lowered concentration of both starch and protozoa in the omasal fluid. The amount of starch reaching the abomasum is nutritionally insignificant even when the fodder contains large amounts (up to 150 g. starch/day). {b) Funclions of the Omasum.\u2014Starch/lignin ratios and nitrogen/lignin ratios in the various com partments of the stomachs of slaughtered sheep indicatethat only very small amounts of reticular contents may pass directly to the abomasum via the omasal groove andthat little if any liquid is squeezed away mechanically irom the solids in the omasum. The amount of water calculated to be absorbed from the digesta entering the oniasum ranged from 33 to 64 per cent, and the amountof iatty acid from 40 to 69 per cent, in seven sheep slaughtered for these estimations. (f) T\"he Conversion of Plant Nitrogen to MicrobialA tiro gen ill the Rumen.\u2014The distribution of nitrogen and lignin in the rumen contents and fodder of slaughtered sheeii has shown that approximately half of the plant nitrogen fed to these animals in a diet of yvheaten hay chaff was converted to microbial nitrogen in the rumen. {(!) The Fermentation of IIemicellulose Washed of the iei mentation of heniicellulosc (prepared from wheaten hay) by washed suspensions of rumen bacteria have been started. At present the results indicate that the pro]iortions of acetic, propionic, and butyric acidsformed_ under those conditions are similar to those produced in growing cultures of the rumen organisms. (e) Utilization of Urea.\u2014The experimental trials totest the usefulness of supplements comprised of various mixtures of urea and starch (grain) as protein concen trates for sheep under natural grazing conditions which were undertaken as a co-operative project with the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock attheii Tooiak Field Station, Julia Creek, north-west Queensland, have been continued. Serious disabilities m the rations were revealed in the first trial and asecond was^ abandoned after six weeks when, subsequentto the rapid growth of pasture which followed heavy rains, the experimental flocks refused to consume the concentrated rations. Another experiment has been staited with the onset of dry feeding conditions atToorak, and a similar, pilot-scale experiment withsimilar supplements fed to sheep confined in pens at Glenthorne. 4. Effects of Diet on Edminal Digestion. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) Digestion experiments were continued at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney in collaboration with the School of Agriculture, Hniversity of Sydney. Statistical analyses of the data obtainedshowed that the pH in the rumen of sheep fed on diets containing more than 50 per cent, of concentrates is about 0.3 less at any level of volatile fatty acids than when the diet is comprised of roughage. 5. Energy Metaboeism. (Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.) Experiments on the energy transactions in the sheep have been continued and have been directed mainly to studies of nutrition .and wool growth. This series has not yet been completed. 6. Cabbohydbate Metabolism. (Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition.) (a) Insulin Hypoglycaemia in Rumimnts.\u2014The effects of insulin on sheep and lambs have been studied further, and extended to an analysis of the different responses which supervene according to the route of injection. The previous findings that adult sheep do not convulse after intravenous injection of massive doses of insuliiq even though the sugar in the blood is reduced to negligible amounts for long periods, were confirmed. Alfter the sympathetic nerve supply to the adrenal glands is abolished by severing the splanchnic nerves, adult sheep were found to be more sensitive to insulin: they then convulsed after the intravenous injection of small quantities of insulin. Subcutaneous injections of insulin into adult sheepbring about a markedly different response; relatively small doses are followed by long periods of hypo glycaemia and severe convulsions which frequently do not respond to glucose therapy notwithstanding the re-establishment of a normal blood-sugar level. Younglambs are much more resistant to intravenous injection of insulin, and behave like non-ruminant animals. (ft) Perfusion E.vperiments.\u2014An apparatus has been designed and built for the study of isolated organs under physiological conditions. This will be used for theiuve.stigation of certain aspects of carbohydrate andfatty acid metabolisin of the sheep using livers isolated from nervous and hormonal influences. (c) Intermediary^ Carbohydrate Metabolism.\u2014TYie,levels of pyruvate in the blood of normal sheep and lambs during glucose tolerance tests have been studied. The observed fact that pyruvate concentration rises after ingestion of sodium propionate but not after lugestion of glucose is another indication of differencesin the channels through which fatty acids and sugarsare^ metabolized. The lead is being followed. Sheep inwliich^ a state of diabetes has been induced by alloxan injections are being used in the study of the utilization of carbohydrate by ruminants. 7. Cabbohydbate Metabolism in Pbegnancy. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) IT undertaken at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney. During the past year lurther experimental evidence has been obtained to indicate the occurrence of a breakdown in the Krebs tncarboxylic acid cycle when pregnant ewes are fasted.In the.se ewes, blood glucose is usually low, whereas levels of_ acetoacetic acid, R-hydroxybutyric acid, lower tatty acids, and citric acid are hisrh. \" Utilization ofglucose by the peripheral tissues of fasted pregnantowes IS considerably greater than in fasted non-pregnantowes. Even when blood-ketone levels are high, they arenot utilized but some experiments strongly suggested the output of ketone bodies by peripheral tissues. The blood picture of pregnant ewes which showed clinicalsigns indistinguishable from those of pregnancv toxaemia was not consistently different from that oftasted pregnant ewes which were cHnienlly normal, butthere has not, as yet, been an opportunity to follmvcase.s_ of pregnancy to.xaomia from the onset to the terminal stages.48 All tlie evidence so far is compatible with the occur rence of a metabolic block in the normal oxidativepathways of carbohydrate and fat within the tissues when pregnant ewes are fasted. The very high levels of citric acid in the blood indicate that the block occurs in the citric acid -> a-ketoglutaric acidstage of the cycle. Experiments involving theinjection of intermediary metabolites of tlie Krebs cycle, acid, a speeifie inhibitor of succinic dchydrogenase, have shown conclusively that this cycle does operate in the sheep. In some of the experiments in which pregnant _ewes were fasted, signs were observed which were clinicallyindistinguishable from those commonly seen in the initial stages of pregnancy toxaemia in the field, but the later stages of persistent drowsiness, terminated by death in coma, did not occur. The significance of these findings in relation to the aetiology of pregnancy toxaemia of ewes is still uncertain and the work will be continued. S. DKOL'UHT-FEliniXG AXI) Rel.VTED PeoULE.VIS. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) This work is undertaken by the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney. Experiments at Glen- field, Hew South Wales, on drought feeding of sheep have been continued in collaboration with the Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture and with further substantial support by the Hew South Wales Graziers' Association from the Burdekin Bequest. Principal results of the year's work may be summarized as follows. (i) Weaners which had been fed on drought rations comprised wholly of wheat, or of a 50: 50 mixture of wheaten chalf and wheat, showed no difference in their ability to grow and thrive when fed generously there after. (ii) When two groups of weaners, one of which had been fed for eight months on a drought ration of 50: 50 Avheaten chaff and ivheat, and the other on the same ration ad lib. were turned out on pasture, the former group gained in iveight ivhilo the latter actually lost Aveight. The pasture used Avas of poor quality. (iii) The addition of salt (sodium chloride) to drought rations comprised of AA'heateu chaff and AA'hoat increased the rate of food consumption. This might AA'ell he a disadvantage under drought conditions. _ In a recent trial tAvo groups of Aveaners Avcre fed ad lib. on10:90 Avheatcn chaff and Avlieat, and a supplement ofagricultural salt Avas supplied to one group. The groups shoAved no significant difference, under these conditions, in total food consumption rate of food intake, and livcAveight increase. (iv) When ground limestone was used as a calciumsupplement for Aveaners Avhich Avere fed ad lib. on cereal rations, Aveight gains Avere significantly better than Avhen the additional calcium Avas supplied as slaked lime. (v) Poor quality roughage or straAV is frequently available under drought conditions and an attempt Avas therefore made to determine whether adult Avethera could be maintained on cereal straAV of A'ery Ioav protein content (1.2 per cent, crude protein) if supplemented in A'arious AA'ays which AA'ould enhance its food value orpalatability. The straw Avas supplied ad lib. and the supplements used Avere: 1.5 per cent, urea, 5.0 per cent, molasses, 1.5 per cent, urea plus 5.0 per cent, molasses, 3 oz. Avheat per head, 1.5 per cent, urea plus 3 oz. Avheat per head, 3 oz. meat meal per head, a lick comprised of 2 parts salt: 1 part lime ad lib., and, finally, 5 oz. lucerne chaff per head. In all groups, except the one which received lucerne chaff, the effect of these rations was so severe that the sheep had to be withdrawn from the experiment after a month, in order to avoid verylieaA'y losses. Eood intake became negligible and the .sheep Avere extremely Aveak and lethargic. Even though a generous I'ation of lucerne chaff and oats was then offered, many still refused to eat and some 10 per cent, died. The group which received 5 oz. lucerne chaff as a daily supplement in addition to the strarv, actually gained slightly in Aveight during the first month. They Avere continued on this ration for some fir-e months but eventually lost Aveight and several died. (vi) Groups of adult Merino Avethers_Avere fed on drought rations comprised solely of grain, to supply 4.0 lb. starch equiAmlent (or food units) per Aveek. The grains used were Avheat, oats, maize, barley, and grain sorghum. All groups Avere fed at Aveekly intp'-vals for 154 days. The group Avhich received oats main tained the highest body woiglit and those Avhich received grain sorghum the lowest; wheat, maize, and barley Avero intermediate. It was of interest that the groups fell in the same order as regards the time taken to con sume the week's ration; those fed on oats consumed it in fiA'C days, those on grain sorghum in two days, and those Avhieh received wheat, maize, or barley consumed it in three to four days. These results may have a valuable practical application in relation to drought- feeding, apart from cost. Because of the longer period taken to consume the ration, oats should be more advantageous under conditions of total di'ought, Avhen no other feed is available. On the other hand, under less .severe conditions, aaLcu some dry feed is still avail able, there may be some advantage in using_ gram sorghum, because the rapidity with Avhich this is con sumed may encourage the sheep to seek other feed AAdiilst Avaiting for the next grain ration. The difference in liveAveight between the oat-fed and the sorghum-fed groups at the termination of the trial was only 8 lb. This Avas reduced to 4 lb. within a week, Avhen the tAvo groups AA'ere fed on 50: 50 chaff and Avheat, thus demon strating that much of the apparent difference in AAmight had been due to \" intestinal fill (vii) The nutritive value of lucerne chaff and wheaten chaff was compared in 50: 50 mixtures with Avheat, in rations fed at drought IcAmls. Ho significant difference Avas detected. (viii) Under drought conditions it would sometimes be of great advantage if the lambs could be weaned much earlier than usual. An experiment was therefore carried out Avith the lambs derived from the ewes in the experiment. They Avere allotted in chronological order of birth to groups Avhich Avere to be weaned at four, eight, and twelve AA^eeks of age on to rations of 50: 50 lucerne chaff and Avhole Avheat. A sub-group, Aveaned at four Aveeks, received a ration of lucerne chaff, crushed wheat, and milk poAvdor. Weaning at eight and tAA^eh^e Aveeks Avas generally successful but only about 30 per cent, of those weaned at four Aveeks, in either group, survived. Those which survived weaning at four weeks throve almost as Avell as those weaned at eight and twelve Aveeks, but it appears that feAV lambs can survive the sudden change at an age Avhen rumen development is still slight. 9. Toxicity of Large Rations of Wheat. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) This work, undertaken at the Animal Health Re search Laboratory, Melbourne, has shown that wheat- gorging by sheep is quickly folloAved by the development of a predominantly lactobacillary type of fermentation in the rumen, a sharp fall of ruminal pH to about 4, and a rise of ruminal lactic acid to 1 per cent, or more; and, furthermore, that the ruminal changes are soon followed by a rise of blood lactate, a fall of blood pH and plasma bicarbonate, and a severe fall of blood A'olume with eventual death. The hypothesis has been considered that the rise of blood lactate and the fall of49 blood pH and bicarbonate are due, at least in part, to direct absorption of enterogenous lactic acid from the bowel, altbougli the possibility lias not been lost sight of that hypoxia associated with reduced blood volume may also play a part. The evidence obtained so far indicates that the mere maintenance of the _ runiinal pH at 4 even for prolonged periods, by means of periodic additions of lactic acid, may lead to only mild and temporary acidosis without haemoeoncentration; even though some lactic acid eventually passes along the bowel, the pH does not fall. When lactic acid solu tion at jiII .3 was introduced directly into the duodenum by means of a catheter at a suitable rate for many hours, severe acidosis, lactacidaemia, and some fall in blood volume were produced from which recovery occurred after the infusion was terminated. When abomasal contents adjusted to pH 3 with lactic acid (4 per cent.) were infused directly into the duodenum, acidosis, lactacidaemia, ' and temporary haemoeoncentration followed. The typical \" wheat gorge\" signs, including severe haemoeoncentration, followed when the infusion into the duodenum was carried out with a mixture of ground wheat and ruminal fluid which had been allowed to ferment 24 hours at 37\u00b0 0., after which the pH was 4.4 and the lactic acid amounted to 1.35 per cent. After twenty hours, this sheep had reached a moribund state, but was restored to health by changing the infusion to normal ruminal fluid. These experiments show that it is not necessary for the wheat to ferment in the rumen itself, that the effect of introducing fermented wheat mash into the duodenum is more severe than that of lactic acid solu tion of much higher lactate concentration, and that although, as has been described in earlier reports, lactic acid can be absorbed directly from the rumen, the amounts so absorbed do not appear to be sufficient to produce severe effects. Since measurement of ruminal inotility showed that ruminal atony may supervene even five and a half hours after consumption of a large toxic dose of wheat, it would seem that there is little chance that large amounts of wheat will pass onwards unless a very large feed is consumed quickly, and this is what usually happens in the field. 10. Chbonic Fnuonosis. (Division of Biochemistry and General ISTutrition.) Deep bore waters sometimes contain harmful amounts of fluorides. The eflficts of additions of sodium fluoride to the drinking water supplied to grazing mature sheep are being studied in order to determine the safe limits of fluorine in stock-waters. Three con centrations have been investigated: 0.3, 10, and 20 parts of fluorine (as fluoride) per 1,000,000 of water to cover the range frequently encountered, neither the health nor productivity of the experi mental animals was adversely afl'ected by the high concentrations during the two-year course of experi ment; and no signs of dental changes or untoward effects of chronic fluorosis were discernible at autopsy. Subsequent chemical examination of selected bones and teeth from tliese animals has revealed small increases in their fluorine content. This, however, does not alter the conclusion that drinl^ing water which con tains as much as 20 p.p.m. fluorine is innocuous for mature grazing sheep provided that the animals have reached the age of three and a half years before they have access to it. A corresponding experiment with younger sheep is being continued. The groups which comprise this trial have been confined since birth to waters contain ing 0.3, 10, and 20 p.p.m. fluorine, and their mothers drank nothing but these waters during the whole period of their gestation. At present, the animals F.5189.--4are three years old, and there is no significant dif ference between their mean body weights, nor was there at last .shearing any significant difference in their wool production. However, the mottling of the enamel and the wear of their incisor teeth, and the selective abrasion of their molars, mentioned in the previous Report, have become more obvious. These effects are more marked in the group which has access to the water containing 20 p.p.m. fiuorine, but even in thc.se the deterioration of the teeth has not led to any adverse effect on the health of the sheep, not withstanding dry grazing periods throughout two summers. Another experiment with breeding ewes has indicated the water containing 20 p.p.m. fluorine has little, if any, adverse effect on their reproductive capacity. 11. Minor Elements in Animal TTutrition. (Division of Biochemistry and General Hutrition.) (a) Cohalt and Its Relationship to Vitamin Bis Deficiency in the Sheep.\u2014(i) The Production of Vitamin Bis in the Rumen.\u2014Vitamin B12 differs chemi cally from vitamins Bi2a and Bi2b only in the nature of the radical which is attached rather loosely to the cyanogen group of the complex molecule. These analogues are readily intra-convertible and they have about the same, if not identical, capacity to provide nutritional demands of animals and of the micro organisms that require vitamin Bio. Other cobalt- containing metabolic products of micro-organisms are known which behave very differently from vitamin B12 although chemically they are related to it. These vitamin Bi2-like substances occur along with vitamin Bi2 as products of bacterial activity in the contents of the rumen. Some of them have no activity in the animal organism, though for certain micro-organisms their potency may exceed that of vitamin B12. The estimation of vitamin B12 by microbiological assay methods is thus seriously complicated. A special study is being made of these factors, and for this purpose procedures for producing a state of extreme vitamin Bi2 deficiency in the rat have been (ivolvcd which have rendered possible critical rat assay methods. More recently, colleagues at the Rational Institute of Dairying, situated in the University of Reading, have courteously sent us cultures of a chlorophyll-bearing flagellate Ochromonas malhanensis, which requires vitamin B12 and will not react to the vitamin Bi2-like substances, and have made available, before publication, their recently evolved methods. These and the animal assay methods evolved here will render more direct those investigations wffiieh aim to solve some of the physiological problems associated with cobalt deficiency in ruminants. (ii) Vitamin B^ in the Tissues of Normal and Col)alt-deficient Sheep.\u2014^Because of interference by vitamin Bi2-like substance.s in the rumen contents, the two microbiological assay methods, in which a mutant of Eschcrichia coli and Lactohacillus leichmannii respectively are used as test organisms, give very dif ferent results and neither can be taken as a final estimate of vitamin Bjo. These substances are not stored in the tissues and so the \" vitamin B12 activity \" estimated by microbiological assay is probably in fact due to vitamin Bio per se. Assays by either method gi-\\'e the same result with liver extracts. Although the number of estimations is not as yet very great the con centration of vitamin Bio in the livers of normal sheep ha.s been found to vary over a range from 0.3 to 1.4 jxg. vitamin Bio/g. fresh tissue. The concentrations in the livers of cobalt-dcficient sheep are very much lower; in some it has been found to be reduced to 0.04 gg. vitamin Bi2/g. fresh tissue.oO (iii) Vitamin ii^ and Cobalt Deficiency in the Sheep. \u2014A. series of experiments has been conducted in the annexes at the main laboratory and at Hackney, and in the pens at the Waite Institute to study further the physiology and biochemistry of the relations between vitamin Byj and cobalt ijigestion in the sheep. The results have shown unequivocally that the syndrome of cobalt deficiency is, in fact, due to vitamin Bi;. deficiency. The sheep's requirements of vitamin Bi^ are being assessed, and it is already evident that the potency of the vitamin is increased over 100-fold if it is injected into the .muscles rather than administered as a drench or incorporated in the foodstuffs. Obviously it is either modified by bacterial activity within the rumen or its absorption from the intestinal tract of the sheep is very poor. If the latter proves to be correct, the extra ordinarily large amount of vitamin B12 which seems to be required by ruminants would be exiffained. Although the experimental work has not been completed, it is already apparent that the sheep's requirement of vitamin B12 is not very great if the vitamin is administered parenterally. The influence that the cobalt cojicentration of the ingesta has on the rate of production of vitamin B12 and of the vitamin Bi^-like substances in the rumen are being studied by observations on sheep in which permanent fistulae have been established. The fall in the rate of production of \" vitamin B12 activity \" in the rumen contents when the cobalt content of the rations is decreased below a critical level is quite rapid; the deficiency symptoms appear in the animal, however, only after its reserves of vitamin B12 become depleted, and this depletion tsikes several months. Shee]) in a state of extreme cobalt deficiency respond drama tically to intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 without any alteration in the rate of \" vitamin B12 \" production in the rumen. There is no response to massive doses of pteroylglutamic acid or to choline. (iv) Cobalt Deficiency binder Grazing Conditions.\u2014 It has been established that 100 /xg. of vitamin B,2 injected intramuscularly thrice weekly will rapidly restore normal health to .sheep that have been allowed to develop extreme symptoms of cobalt deficiency while grazing on the very deficient pastures at Robe: and that 50 yg. of vitamin B12 injected either thrice weekly or once weekly will maintain sheep in good health indefinitely^ on these deficient tracts. iVfter establish ing a relalively high vitamin B]o status in this way, mature animals remain healthy under these grazing con ditions for approximately six months without further treatment; whereas the storage of vitamin Bjo in the tissues after dosing sheep under identical grazing con ditions thrice weekly for a similar period with the etpuvalent of 1 mg. Co/day was sufficient to maintain them for only approximately three months after the treatment ceased. Experiments to determine the sheen's minimum requirement of vitamin B12 under natural grazing conditions are being conducted at Robe. (v) Control of Cobalt Deficiency.\u2014An experiment which aims to determine the most economic way to control cobalt deficiency under natural grazing con ditions indicates that mas.sive doses of cobalt adminis tered as a drench at monthly intervals may suffice for mature ewes: though their lambs suffer if they are not dosed at more frequent intervals. (b) Copper Deficiency in Sheep.\u2014(i) The Effect of Molybdenum on the Copper Metabolism of ' Sheep Depastured at Robe.\u2014The observations mentioned in previous Reports have been confirmed; the administra tion of molybdenum (as sodium molybdate) to sheep on these pastures inci'ea.scd the on.spt of the symptoms of copper deficiency while paradoxically increasing the sheep's capacity to retain copper in its tissues andblood stream. This phenomenon is being investigated in rats under controlled laboratory conditions; and the findings are likely to lead directly to a more com plete understanding of copper metabolism. A preliminary examination of the copper concen tration of livers of a proportion of the lambs from the owes which constitute the experimental gtoups mentioned in previous Reports indicate that molybdate interferes little, if at all, with the passage of copper from the ewe through the placenta to the foetus. These observations will be repeated to finally establish this important point. (ii) Iron. Metabolism in Copper-deficient Sheep.\u2014 The tissues of the sheep, like those of other animals, lose their normal ability to utilize iron and so'accumu late relatively large dei^osits of iron which is func tionally inert. A series of experiments has shown that these deposits are rapidly utilized on resumption of a normal copper status. (iii) The Absorption of Copper by the Sheep.\u2014 Experiments reported in previous resumes have indi cated that absorption of copper from the intestinal tract into the blood stream is much more rapid and efficient if copper salts are introduced into the abomasum than if introduced into the rumen. Copper introduced in dilute solution directly into the blood stream is removed relatively rapidly and becomes almost totally deposited in the liver. (c) Field Experiments, Robe.-\u2014Most of the field experiments mentioned above have been carried out at the field station at Robe. In addition a number of others have been conducted. The Effect of Dressing Copper-deficient Pastures with Copper Sulphate.\u2014The object is to determine, over a period of years, the efficacy and staying power of dres.sings of copper sulphate applied to the native pastures of the deficient tracts. \"The copper status of the experimental animals grazed on the pastures dressed in 1939 and 1940 with 14 lb. of copper sulphate per acre was assessed again during the year under review, by estimating the copper concentration in the liver from samples removed by biopsy. The mean concen tration of copper in the livers of untreated sheep on these pasture.s was barely adequate (34 yg. Cu/g. liver dry wt.); the copper status of the control sheep which received the equivalent of 4 mg. Cu/day in addition while depastured on the same area was high (522 yg. Cu/g. liver dry w-t.). (d) Field Experiments, Borrika. \u2014 Experiments similar to those reported above were started .some years ago_ at Borrika, on a different type of soil typical of the incipiently copper-deficient terrain of the Murray Mallee region. This experiment will be continued until frank symptoms of copper deficiency become apparent in the untreated sheep which constitute the experi mental animals depastured there. At the end of 1952 the livers of the untreated sheep on the untreated area contained a mean concentration of 84 yg. Cu/g. dry wt.; the fleeces of some of these sheep had by thenbegun to show signs of copper deficiency. Whereas the corresponding concentration of the livers of sheep that had grazed on the immediately adjacent pastures A\\-hich had been treated with copper some years pre viously was 64 yxg. Cu/g. dry wt., and all of these sheep were growing normal wool. (e) Field Experiments, \"Brecon\", Keith, South lustxalia. The site at \"Brecon\", which is typical ofthe ax'eas of very deficient terrain in the Hinety-Mile Plain that are being developed according to the piocedures indicated by the Division, was made avail able through the generosity of the Australian Mutual t rovident Society ; and the activities there are atpiesciit devoted entirely to a carefully controlled experi- mental study of the growth, production, and welfare61 of sheep depastured upon three types of pasture similar to those that are being used for the development of these virgin tracts. The overall problems of pasture development have been solved; it is now essential to give close attention to the health of the flocks and herds on these newly developed pastures so that dis- abiJitfes may be recognized and stops taken to I'cctify them before they assume very serious proportions. The soils of this area are singularly short of zinc and copper, and these elements must he added to the ])hosphatic dressings employed tliere for the establish ment of pastures. As other lines of our investigations suggested that the cobalt status of floclcs on this terrain would rarely, if ever, become completely secure and might he expected at times to become sufficiently low to seriously influence their health and productivity, the first series of experiments was designed to investigate the cobalt status of expierimental flocks depastured on three different types of pasture which were sown for this purpose. A few months after the experimental animals were transferred to these prepared areas the syniptoms of a serious nervous malady appeared in individuals in the pastures in which the perennial grass Vhalaris iuberosa predominated. The malady \" Phalaris staggers\" had been described previously to occur spasmodically with season and terrain in other areas where F. tuherosa had been employed for pas ture improvement hut, although its potential danger had been recognized, and the fatal consequence which frequently ensued had been attributed to a toxic sub stance in the young shoots of the Phalaris, little or nothing definite was known of its aetiology or of the reason for its spasmodic occurrence, and no effective means of controlling the disease had been suggested. The experiments during the first year indicated that a supiflement of cobalt which Avas provided as a drench to half of the flock, protected the animals from the toxic effects\u2014none of the cobalt treated animals dcA'eloped the malady, whereas 70 per cent, of those untreated developed the nervous symptoms and 50 per cent, died of the malady. There were similar outbreaks in the second year, and the protective effects of cobalt were confirmed. At present the experimental work is taking the main trends\u2014one to e.xploit, in terms of application, the knoAvledge we already have, and the other to learn more of the nature of the malady and of the mechanism through which the protective action of cobalt is effected. There is already proof that cobalt must he administered frequently if it is to effectively protect sheej) from the toxic influences of P. iuberosa. A drench containing 7 mg. Co administered once each week afforded complete protection over a period Avhen 30 per cent, of the untreated controls developed the disease; in these circumstances relatively enormous doses (280 mg. Co) provided once each month had no protective influence. Long-term trials have been started to examine the possibility that top-dressing the Phalaris pastures in this locality with cobalt sulphate might lessen the incidence of the malady. In January, 1953, cobalt sulphate in aqueous solution was sprayed in amount equivalent to 1 lb. cobalt sulphate/acre on to half of a 300-acre area of PhaZaris-subterranean clover pasture in which there Avas a serious outbreak of staggers the year previously. At the end of April, 200 mature Merino Avethers Avere placed in each area. .\\bout a month later many of the sheep on the untreated area had developed the malady; this flock Avas removed and another substituted. No cases have yet appeared in the flock Avhich has been confined for the Avhole period on the cobalt treated area. The behaviour of experimental flocks on these areas Avill be observed during the next feAV years, for it is probable that a practical solution of the very serious problem ofPhalaris staggers on these newly developed tracts will eventually take the form of a simple, direct procedure such as this. There is a Avide scope for more intensive studies and a number of experimental investigations have been started to clarify further tho aetiology of this interest ing malady. The first series of these aims to determine finally AA'hether the protective action of cobalt is effected within the intestine through its influence on the intes tinal flora or whether it is in fad an abundant supply of the cobalt-containing vitamin in the tissues Avhich favours metabolic destruction of the toxic prin ciple before it can influence the uerve cells. 12. Infehtility and Physiology of Repkodfction. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) The Influence of Nutrition on the Performance of Breeding Ewes.\u2014At the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne, Merino ewes were fed daily and Aveekly, on drought ration (see Section 7) for some Aveeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Some groups Avere given additional quantities of the same ration (10: 90 Avheaten chaff and Avheat) before and during mating (\"flushing\"), and before lambing (\"steaming up\"), or during both periods. There Avere no striking differences in the rates of conception or of lambing. (&) Seasonal Variation in the level of Fertility in Merino Sheep.\u2014 (i) The series of observations carried out by the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Mel bourne, Avhich involved four matings at three-monthly intervals at the Tooradin Field Station, has been com pleted. The mating periods corres'ponded to the winter, siiring, summer, and autumn respectively. Ten per cent, of the ewes failed to mate during the Avinter mating jieriod and 59 per cent, during the spring mating period, Avhereas only 1 per cent, failed to mate during the summer and antumn mating periods. Of the eAves Avhich actually mated and Avhich Avere still available at lambing, 84 per cent, of those Avhich mated in the winter, 58 ]icr cent, of those Avhich mated in the spring, 91 per cent, of those Avhich mated in the summer, and 96 per cent, of those Avhich mated in the autumn lambed. Some of autopsied three-four Aveeks aftei' mating. Others Avere X-rayed at 12, 15, and 18 weeks. In this manner it Avas deter mined that the failure to lamb of cAves which had mated was associated very largely Avith failure in conception and embryonic mortality Avithin three-four Aveeks after mating. Loss of this typo Avas higher at the winter and spring matings than it Avas at the summer and autumn matings. There may have been a small loss of foetuses between four and tAvclve Aveeks, but it is un likely that there Avas any loss betAveen 12 Aveeks and lambing. In relation to eAA^es mated, the number of lambs Avhich Avere born alive in the different groups was as follows\u2014Avinter mating, 72 per cent.; spring mating, 22 per cent.; summer mating, 93-95 per cent.; autumn mating, 95 per cent. The 30 pregnancies Avhich derived from the spring mating did not include any multiple pregnancies. Four to five per cent, of multiple pregnancies occurred at each of the other matings. Fcav lambs Avere lost from the groups mated in the Avinter and the spring. Substantial losses occurred from the groups mated in the summer and the autumn. (ii) EAves of the tAvo groups Avhieh wore joined Avith the rams at the end of October and in mid November I'espectively did not begin to mate iiiilil tiie O/iil of the first week in December. Thei'e Avas no difference in the course of mating in the tAVO groups. (ill) Among Merino ewes reared from earlier mat ings and noAV 4-5 years old, there Avere 53 per cent, of tAvin births from matings at the Werribee Field Station during May and June,62 (c) Effect of Administration of Hexoestrol on the Outcome of Pregnanoj.\u2014Investigations at tlie Animal Health Eesearch Laboratory, Melbourne, have shown that of seven aged Merino ewes to which hexoestrol was given intramuscularly sixteen weeks after mating, one aborted four days later; two died one and twenty days later respectively\u2014each contained a foetus which was apparently normal; two gave birth to lambs\u2014in the one instance still-born twin lambs, in the other a small weak lamb which failed to suck; and two failed to lamb, but were each found to contain a decomposing foetus 159 and 162 days respectively after mating. {d) Induction of Meat in Spayed Ewes with Stil- boestrol and Frogesterone.\u2014This work was under taken at the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne. A dose of 2 mg. of stilboestrol intramus cularly at fortnightly intervals produced heat regularly over a period of many months in at least three or four spayed ewes and frequently in all four. Progesterone in doses of 2.5-22.5 mg. given at the same times as doses of 0.25-2.0 mg. of stilboestrol did not augment the response in any way. (e) Studies on Mechanism of Fertilization.\u2014This work has continued throughout the year at the Animal Health Eesearch Laboratory, Melbourne. (i) Cytology of Fertilization and Early Cleavage.\u2014 The distribution of the nucleic acids in fertilization and early cleavage has been studied in the rat egg, by the use of ultraviolet micrography for living eggs and by the Peulgen reaction for fixed eggs. The nucleic acids show no distinct localization during fertilization, but a structure containing a high concentration of desoxy- ribonucleic acid, and probably analogous to Casperson's \" nucleolus-associated chromatin\", becomes increas ingly evident about the nucleoli during early cleavage. (ii) The '' Capacitation \" of the Sperm.\u2014It has now been confirmed that the sperm in the rat and rabbit requires to spend some time in the female tract before it becomes capable of penetrating the zona pellucida. It is further shown that the time required for the capacitation of rat sperms is between two and four hours, and of rabbit sperms apparently about 4 hours. (ill) The Passage of Sperms through the Female Genital Tract.\u2014The \" distribution of sperms in the female tract at various times after mating has been determined in the rat, rabbit, and ewe. The results support the idea that a restrictive action on the number of sperms reaching the eggs is an important function of the female tract. The parts of the tract responsible for the largest drops in sperm concentration are the utero-tubal junction in the rat, the utero-tubal junction and the isthmus of the tube in the rabbit, and the cervix and the isthmus of the tube in the ewe. In the rat it aj)pears that the restrictive junction of the tract is relaxed somewhat as the end of the fertile life of the eggs draws near. (iv) Polyspermy in the Pat and Rabhit.\u2014This appears to be the first investigation specifically on polyspermy in mammals. After normal mating, the incidence of polyspermy in rats is about 1.2 per cent, and in rabbits about 1.4 per cent. If mating is pre vented until the time of ovulation or a few hours later the incidence rises sharply to about 8.8 per cent, in the rat and about 16.4 per cent, in the rabbit. In the rat polyspermic eggs undergo apparently normal development up to at least the eight-cell stage. (v) The Reaction of the Zona Pellucida to Sperm Penetration.\u2014The zona pellucida of the rat changes after the penetration of the first or first few sperms and becomes impenetrable to further sperms. The zona reaction is about as rapid in the mouse egg as in the rat egg, and is apparently more rapid in the sheep egg. On the other hand, the rabbit zona shows no apparent reaction to sperm penetration.(vi) The Artificial Activation of the Rat Egg.-^ It is well known that the shrinkage of the vitellus and the formation of the second polar body, which normally only occur in consequence of sperm penetration, can be provoked experimentally. This artificial activation is being studied in rat eggs, with particular reference to their fertility. (/) Studies on Foetal Age in the Guinea Pig, Mouse, and Rabbit.\u2014These studies are designed to provide information which will make it possible to determine the foetal age, in attempting to relate foetal weight, foetal age, and placental development. These studies form a useful background to the projected investigation upon the relationship between placental development in sheep and the viability and development of the foetus, as an aspect of the neonatal mortality in sheep. 13. Breeding and Genetical Studies. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Inbred Flocks of Australian Merinos.\u2014This work was undertaken at the McMaster Field Station, Badgery's Creek, New South Wales. (i) The Flocks.\u2014The mean Wright's coefficient of inbreeding in the flocks is now approximately 25 per cent. The programme of inbreeding without selection has so far achieved no greater degree of uniformity for fleece characters among the inbred animals than was present in the original group of ewes from which they were derived. It is now proposed to practise divergent selection within some of the groups for high and low levels in certain characters, determined as a result of fleece measurements being carried out on animals in the various flocks. (ii) Top-crossing.\u2014Data for mean birth and wean ing weights from progeny by 25 per cent, inbred and other non-inbred sires show no diflerences. No animals are old enough to provide fleece data. Although the number of sires used so far in this experiment has been small, low fertility appears to be more prevalent among those which arc inbred. The experiment is continuing. (b) Inheritance of Component Fleece Characters.\u2014 At the McMaster Field Station, Badgery's Creek, New South Wales, matings continue for the purpose of building up numbers in the Fi and Fj generations. Data so far obtained from fleece measurements indicate that for the fleece characters, yield and wax and suint ratio, the Fi generation has similar mean values to those of their longwool parents. Mean values for staple length and fibre diameter in Fj, although of an intermediate nature, are closer to the mean value for the longwool than that for the finewool parent. Mean values for number of crimps per inch and density of fibre population in Fi are more truly intermediate. Crude mean values for the various characters in the three generations are summarized in the Table in which, for ^ the sake of brevity, numbers of animals in generations and standard deviations have been omitted. FLEECE CHARACTER EXPERIMENT DATA. Character. 3.7 10.914.8 31.0 24.06150 860 283053 Observations on the ratio of primary to secondary follicles, made on skin biopsy specimens taken from seventeen new-born Fa lambs, do not reveal that segre gation which would indicate a simple method of inheritance for follicle ratios. (c) Ilairinesn of Fluffy Tip.\u2014This investigation continued at the McMaster Field Station, Badgery's Creek, JSTew South Wales. The final drop of Fj progeny are not yet of an age to permit of their classification or fieece sampling. These final observations will take place during the ensuing year. (d) Sheep-breeding Studies.\u2014The Section of Mathematical Statistics has again continued to work in close collaboration with the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, in studies on sheep breed ing. In these studies, productive characters are being measured, including clean wool weight and its com ponents (staple length, fibre diameter, number of fibres per unit area of .skin, body size, and degree of skiij wrinkles), wool cover of points and face, lamb produc tion per ewe, and lamb survival rate. One major project at the National Field Station, \" Gilrnth Plains \", Cunnamulla, Queensland (Project ABl), was described in last year's Report and some results were given. This project has continued on the lines described, with the addition of two new groups in the family series, where selection is for one character at a time. The existing groups have demon strated that the characters fibre number and staple length can be present in different combinations, high fibre number and long staple being characteristic of one group, high number and short staple of another, low number and short staple of a third. The two new groups were designed to investigate the possibility of breaking the strong negative association which has been consistently found between fibre number and fibre diameter. During 1952-53, ram lambs dropped in ABl were again left entire at marking, but were sampled and shorn at twelve months of age instead of sixteen- eighteen months. On the basis of the.se measurements numbers were reduced by approximately half; the remainder were remeasured at sixteen-eighteen months, when the final selection of sires was made. This procedure will be repeated, and the correlation between mea.5urements at the two ages will determine th'\" reliability of final selection at twelve months of age for the characters under consideration. Some of the results reported in 1951-52 were con firmed in 1952-53, not only from ABl but also from other data examined. Histological examination of skin sections was made for the first time not only in ABl but also on samples from sheep at the Australia! Pa.storal Company's property, \"Noondoo\", Dirran- bandi, Queensland, whei-e the General Manager ha.s for many years been basing selection of his stud sheep on measured characters. These records were made available to the Organization for analysis, and facilities Avere also offered for taking both fleece and skin samples. The .skin sections from ABl have confirmed the selection on fibre numbers in the family series, the high fibre number group having a mean .secondary: primary follicle r.atio of 20.2 and the low fibre number group, 14.8. Skin sections from ewes in ABl were taken in the family series only, and there were not suffieient animals in the \" maternally handicapped\" class (twins and progeny of maiden ewes) to check the observation previously made on fieece samples that the number of fibres per unit area is lower in .sucr.' animals. In the \"Noondoo\" figures, however, a lower secondary; primary follicle ratio was found for the \"handicapped\" animals on skin sections.The \" Noondoo \" data cover measurements on clean wool weight for unclassed two-tooth ewes in a numbe: of years, together with their body weight, staple length, and fibre diameter. The degree of skin wrinkling and folding has been scored, though not in the same grades as in C.S.I.R.O. techniques; the level of wrinkling is not high, however, and variation is slight. Although fibre number has not been measured, the data provide indirect confirmation of previous observations in ABl that fibre number is the component which has the greatest infiuenee on variation in clean wool weight. During 1952-53, a study has been made, on data from various soTirces, of factors influencing the birth and survival rate of lambs in the Merino. From ABl and \"JSToondoo\" figui-es it has been possible to study the influence of the age of the ewe on the ratio of-ewes lambing to ewes mated, L, on the ratio of lambs surviving to lambs born, S, and on the ratio of twin births to all births, T. In both sets of data L showed a rise from two to five years. The incidence of twins in both sets of data showed an increase with age of dam up to about eight years. Ewes will be retained in ABl till the end of their tenth year until further evidence has been collected on the relation between productivity and age. The \" Noondoo \" figures demonstrated differences between sire groups in survival rate, though no such differences have been found in ABl. The \"Noondoo\" data have yielded evidence on a character not previously measured in ABl, namely, \" point cover \", or the extent to which wool covers the belly and limbs. Sheep have been scored on two scales, each of five grades, for \" point cover\" and \" face cover\". The two measures are highly correlated in these data, and large sire-group differences have been found, indicating a high measure of heritability. (e) The Study of Strains of Merino Sheep in Several Environments.\u2014Work on this project is proceeding satisfactorily at the Regional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, New South Wales. Standard observations on production and reproduction are being made. Subjective gradings of fleece characters con tinue to be made by a worker from the East Sydney Technical College. An analysis of the 1949-50 season's data,' separating the addithm effects of straims and locations from the interactions among strains and locations, has been completed. There were highly signi ficant interactions of strains and locations in nearly every characteristic studied. Semen examinations arc now being made each year of all rams being used for mating together with a reserve for each. The collection of body measurements and wool .samples from sheep in the studs from which strain trial sheep were purchased, was carried out in 1952 in four cases. Obseiwations in the trial are being made on a per head basis. Economic adaptation of strain 1<j environment depends also on production per acre or on the cost per unit of product in terms of fodder con sumed. To measure the intake-outpirt relationship of the strains under intensive individual feeding condi tions, a preliminary attempt has been carried out at \" Gilrnth Plains \" on group feeding using wethers frorn the strains as experimental material. (/) Studies on Hornedness in Sheep.\u2014Studies on the development \"of hornedness with age, on the inheritance of hornedness, and on any possible asso ciated character, have been continued, at the National Field Station, \" Gilrnth Plains\", Cunnamulla, Queensland. 14. Genetics of Sheep. (Animal Genetics Section.) The Animal Genetics Section has undertaken a survey of sheep throughout Australia which is designed to provide knoiAdedge of the total variation betiveen55 (a) Exparinicntal Physiology of Skin and Jluir Growth\u2014Hormonal Regulation of Wool Growth.\u2014 'i'his investigation centred at the Sheep Biology Labora tory, Sydney, has shown that the anterior pituitary gland secretes hormones which are necessary for normal wool growth. Fractionation of sheep pituitary tissue has been undertaken to isolate the hormones that will restore wool growth in the hypopliysectomized sheep. Various fractions are at present being assayed biologically for their content of known pituitary hormones. An intradermal assay is being developed for mea-suring their effects on wool growth. 16. Sheup Diseases. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Caseous Lymphadenitis of Sheep.\u2014Observa tions have been continued at the Animal Health Kesearch Laboratory, Melbourne, on the experiments which have been mentioned in previous Reports. lu the group brought into the experiment in 1947 and slaughtered in October, 1952, there was no significant diiference in the incidence of infection in the vaccinated animals, in those passing through a rested paddock ofl'-shears, or in the control animals. The results of all the experiments considered as a whole .show that the methods of control have a very limited value. It is possible that a more valuable and reliable vaccine may, in time, be evolved. In one experiment a living equine strain of Gorynehacterium ovis was used for the vaccination of guinea-pigs. Some protection was obtained. Five eqiiine strains were then tested with the result that two and possibly three of these were found to be worth further study. It was found that doses which are lethal on subcutaneous injection may be given safely intradermally. Some observations have been made with living ovine strains given intradermally in .sheep. It was found that by these means lesions in the regional lymph nodes occur more consistently than from infection of wounds, or from subcutaneous inoculation. (b) \" 2'oxaemic Ja.undice\" of Sheep.\u2014This co operative investigation has been continued at the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne. Investigation of natural outbreaks has continued by the Division of Animal Health and Production as a co operative effort with the veterinary research staff of the Department of Agriculture of Hew South Wales. Some of the outbreaks have been due to the develop ment of uncomplicated chronic copper poisoning in grazing sheep, some have been due to straightforward heliotrope poisoning, but others have been due to a terminal haemolytic crisis of chronic copper poisoning in sheep which have become susceptible as a result of previous grazing of heliotrope. Investigation of the two diseases has progressed along the following lines. (i) Chronic Copper Poisoning.\u2014The observations at the Field Station, Cobram, Victoria, have been concluded. These observations, which were continued over three successive seasons, have shown that early germination of subterranean clover and an acid reaction in the soil are not of themselves sufficient to cause a rapid increase in the rate of absorption and retention of copper by the grazing sheep. In the field experiment at Tumbarumba, Hew South Wales, a dry season again spoiled the planned experi ment. However, it proved to be practicable to increase the molybdenum content of the subterranean clover by including sodium molybdate in the .superphosphate u.sed to top-dress some of the pasture. The resultant increase in the molybdenum intake of the sheep exerted a definite limiting effect on their copper storage. The mean increase in liver copper concentration in a group of sheep grazing the molybdenum-treated pasture was65 p.ji.m. comjjared with an increase of 440 p.p.m. in the sheep grazing the pasture top-dressed with super phosphate only. Laboratory study of the factors influencing the ,storage of copper in the liver by sheep has continued. In following up the earliest observations that the nature of the plant material consumed had a definite influence on the amount of copper .stored, it was found possible to .separate an \" active\" fraction from lucerne hay. This uas found to have a readily demonstrable effect on juolybdenum excretion and was identified as inorganic .'ulphiite. Feeding experiments with sheep .showed that neitlier molybdenum nor inorganic sulphate alone will limit the storage of copper in the liver, but the two together will prevent the stoi'age of copper and at appropriate dose levels will cause copper to be lost f 1 om the liver. Iloth molybdenum and inorganic sulphate occur in ])asture plants in amounts which vary over a very wide iunge of values. These variations are being examined along with intensive studies of the quantitative relation- ship between molybdenum and sulphate intake on the one hand and copper storage on the other. (ii) Heliotrope Poisoning.-\u2014In the last field experi ment at Barooga, Hew South Wales, the effects of expo.sure to heliotrope grazing wore studied in groups of several breeds of sheep through three successive seasons. The observations were terminated in August, 1952. It was found that over the two and a half years of the cxi^eriment, with animals grazing the natural pastures in which Heliotropium europiaeum occurred, there was no significant difference in the death rate, from all causes, between two strains of Merino ewes. Border Leicester Merino cros.sbred wethers. With smaller groups, however, which were studied more intensively, it was found that the Alerinos were more resistant to heliotrope poisoning than the crossbreds when both were forced to eat heliotrope grown in pure stands. Furthermore, although the Border Leicester and Dorset Horn crossbred sheep stored more copper in their livers after they had grazed for two seasons on pastures containing heliotrope than did control groups which had not been exposed to heliotrope, the grazing on the heliotrope pastures did not affect the copper status of the Merinos. Supplying a drench containing 100 mg. Mo/day to crossbred sheep in this environment did not materially reduce the amount of copper stored nor was there any evidence of any deleterious effects of the con,sumption of this amount of molybdenum over a period of two and a half years in this environment. It may not, however, be safe to give sheep 100 mg. Mo/day in an environment which was supplying a higher intake of inorganic sulphate. The toxic doses of the alkaloids heliotrine and lasiocarpine for rats have been accurately determined and it has been confirmed that, although lasiocarpine is the more acutely toxic, the hepatitis in rats which closely resembles the disease in sheep is produced by repeated small doses of heliotrine. A similar result is produced by a similar series of injections in rats by the appreciably less toxic W-oxide of heliotrine. (c) Sheath Rot of Wethers.\u2014Plans were made at the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne, to continue the observation on a flock of wethers in the Western District of Victoria. However, few wethers became affected with sheath rot during the spring of 1952 and the projected observations had to be abandoned. Some laboratory obseiwations were carried nut on the effects of hexoestrol in wethers as it was considered desirable to determine if epithelial tissues in the penis and sheath of wethers undergo changes similar to those found in sheath rot. Tablets of hexoestrol were implanted in the .subcutaneous tissues66 ill wetliers. All tlie animals tlevdoiied cliaracteristic ui'ogenital abnormalities, which in no way resembled the lesions seen in sheath rot. {d) Footrot in Sheep.\u2014Eesults of jirevious research at the Animal Health Eesearch Laboratory, Jlelbourne, on the control and eradication of footrot in flocks have been scorned by some groups of producers. Inquiries and inspections were carried out in the field to deter mine the cause of failure of the application of the re.sults and to determine if further research were neces sary. Visits to affected properties in areas of jSTew South Yfales where the disease had become widespread in recent j^ears clearly indicated that failure to control it was not due to the recommended methods being at fault but to the fact that the owners or managers had not been instructed in their use and had not properly grasped the principles involved. Some cases of footrot have been established and fresh strains of the causal organism, Fnsiformis nodosvs, are being isolated. The bactericidal effect of various anti biotics on the organism will be tested in vitro and any which are effective at low concentration will be tried on natural cases of footrot, both systematically and by local application. Present indications, however, are that F. vodosns is readily destroyed provided the lesions are adequately exposed by paring, and that no antiseptic will be effective unless this is done. (e) Epididymitis in Rams.\u2014^Seven rams with epi- didym.al lesions have been carefully examined at the McMaster Animal Health Eesearch Laboratory, Sydney, four from centres in Hew South \"Wales and three from Victoria. Each ram Avas mated to erves before slaughter. The ewes were artificially insemi nated in addition, because the semen quality of the rams Avas poor and it was desired that the ewes should conceive in order to discover Avhether they would sub sequently abort their lambs. All ewes have remained normal so far and no vaginal or other lesions have been detected. Erom the lesions of two of the seven rams an abortus-like organism has been recovered and it Avas obtained from the semen of one of them before slaughter. The others yielded nothing of interest but this may have been due to the age of the lesions. The abortus-like organisms closely resemble those recovered from similar cases described by Avorkers in Queensland. Indications have been obtained, however, that both the HeAv South Wales and Queensland strains have at least one common antigen with Brucella ahorhts though they are not closely related to it, and that the Hew South Wales and Queensland strains are much more closely related but are probably not identical anti- genically. 17. Internal Parasites. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Studies on Antlielmintics.\u2014The.se investigations have continued at the Eegional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale. Hew South Wales. (i) Phenothiazine.\u2014Further observations have been made on the relation of particle si.m to the anthelmintie efficiency been found that if the particle .size exceeds 2.5-30 p most of the parasites survive. Further observations are needed regarding Trichostrongylus spp. but indications are that results will be similar. A number of commercial preparations of phenothiazine has been examined and several wore found to contain high proportions of coarse particles. When tested under laboratory conditions, such prepara tions showed loAV anthelmintie efficiency. (ii) Mode of Action of Phenothiazine and Related Compounds.\u2014-The chemical, physico-chemical, and .synthetic Aimrk is done at the Chemistry School of Sydney University and the products are screenedagainst Syphacia spp. in mice at the McMaster Labora tory. The organic chemical and physico-chemical work on phenothiazine, jjhenoxazine, and the phenoselena- zines has now been completed except for the prepara tion of 3-iodophenothiazine, which is in progress. The oxidation potentials of this series of 30 compounds have been determined. Tests against Syphacia in mice have been carried out, usually at dose levels of 2 g./kg., but considerable difficulty has occurred in obtaining adequate levels of Syphacia infestation in the mice and this phase of the work has lagged accordingly. Eesults, so far, indicate that there is a region of m.aximum anthelmintie activity betAveen -f-SOO mV oxidation potential. Hone of the diphenylamines tested has shown appreciable activity except 4-4'-di- niethyldipheuylamine, AA'hich was also found effective against H. contortus in sheep in 10 g. doses but doses of 18 g. Avere toxic. In all, some 82 compounds have been prepared for testing and the potentials of 30 of them have been determined by oxidation Avith bromine or dichromate and potentiometer readings. Attempts the oxidation potentials of the diphenylamines Avere unsuceessfid, due to the extreme instability of their oxidized forms. Because these studies on the mode of action of pheno thiazine have suggested that its anthelmintie effect may result from its ability to form relatively stable semi- quinones, some complex quinones Avere tested for possible anthelmintie in sheep. Certain quinones, e.g. 1-8-dihydroxyanthraquinone and 1-2- dihydroxyantiiraquinoue, cause diarrhoea in sheep and it Avas thought that their administration, together Avith phenothiazine, might enhance anthel mintie action against Oe. colnmhianum. Ho such effect occurred but both the 1-8 and the 1-2 compounds, them- selve.s, proved to be highly effective anthelmintics against the large boAvel parasites of Avere administered into the, rumen. These doses Avere effective in the absence of any purgative effect and Avoro without effect on nema- todes other than those which inhabit the large bowel. Larger doses of 2.5-5.0 g., however, were effective against M. contortus also. The relatively selective action of the.sc compounds on large bowel parasites, and especially the effect on T. avis Avhich is resistant to commonly used anthelmintics, including phenothiazine, is of considerable interest. (iii) Anthelmintie Tests tvith Miscellaneous Com- pounds.\u2014Several additional compounds, which there was some reason to believe might have anthelmintie actiAuty, Avere tested against H. contortus in sheep. (iv) Observations on the Techniques of Drenching Sheep.\u2014The short oesophageal tube, devised for ad ministration of phenothiazine to sheep and mentioned in the previous Ecport, is nOAV being produced in one form or another by commercial firms. If the sheep's mouth is first SAA-abbed with 5 per cent, copper sulphate, drenches administered through the tube pass into the abomasum, Avhereas, without such prior stimulation of the ocsophagcal-grooA'e reflex they almost ahvays enter the rumen, even when the drench itself contains copper sulphate. A comjoarison was made betAveen \" fast \" and \" .sloAV \" drenching Avith solutions containing copper sulphate through drenching instruments which did not include the short oesophageal tube. The \"slow\" method involved injecting a few millilitres of the dose into the mouth and waiting 3-5 sec. before giving the remaining 25-30 ml., and the dose passed into the abomasum in thirteen out of fourteen sheep. \"When the \" fast\" method was used, the Avhole dose was given as quickly as the sheep could sAvallow it and in seven out of twelve sheep it passed into the rumen. The \" slow\" method, which is the one advocated Avhen drenches containing copper sulphate with nicotine sul phate or arsenic are used, is, therefore, about twice67 as efficient as the \" fast'' method, with consequent conservation of costs and labour despite the slightly longer time required to drench the flock. (b) Studies on Resistance to Nematode Parasites.\u2014 These investigations have continued at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney. It is now apparent that the development and degree of resistance to tric-hostrongylosis is influenced by the number of larvae administered and the frequency of administration. Experiments with previously worm-free lambs indicated that doses of 1,000-2,500 larvae once or twice a week for four-ten weeks resulted in infestations which seldom persisted, and that the great majority could then withstand a massive challenge dose of larvae, administered some six months later. But when worm- free lambs were given 20,000 larvae at monthly intervals their immunologieal response, which was good at first, became less as monthly dosing was continued until eventually the dose elicited little, if any, rise in antibody level.' Of the eight lambs in this experiment, two died of triehostrongylosis after the fifth dose of larvae, one after the sixth, and one after the ninth dose. It was also observed that faecal egg counts in the lambs which were given smaller doses at short intervals did not develop until administration of larvae had ceased. Serological tests on groups of weaners grazed on natural and improved pasture at the Regional Pastoral Labora tory, Armidale, showed that positive reactions were more numerous and enduring among those on im proved pasture. At Armidale repeated small doses or a single massive dose of infective II, contortus larvae were adrninistered to three groups of sheep which five weeks previously had received an immunizing dose of 1,400, 11,000, or nil larvae three days after the removal of an existing un measured population. Apparently owing to the previous infestation removed by phenothiazine the sheep of the groups receiving larvae developed a generally low but variable infestation, However, when snbjected to the massive dose five weeks later these initiating doses were sufficient to prevent any build-up of infestation whereas six of ten sheep which had received no initiating dose developed moderate infesta tions. On the other hand, repeated small doses of larvae administered to this uninitiated group apparently stimulated resistance and prevented the development of infestation. Further observations were also made on sheep which had become resistant to II. contortus. Frequent blood- histamine determinations after massive challenge doses of larvae revealed no rise in histamine levels. Resist ance in such cases is not dependent, therefore, upon the allergic phenomena associated with \" self-cure 'h Attempts to break down their resistance by massive doses of larvae, given a.s a single dose, or in daily or weekly doses, failed in all of twelve sheep and their reactions to the complement fixation test were not consistent. In relation to the \" self-cure\" phenomenon, it has been shown that its occurrence in sheep infested with H. contortus is not associated with any change in pH of the ahomasum, and that an established infestation with this parasite is not affected by the continuous intravenous injection of histamine (9 mg. in seven hours) nor by increases in the level of blood histamine induced by \" compound -48/80 \". A sharp decline in faecal egg count, induced by intravenous injection of Salmonella typhi-murium in a sheep infected with E. contortus, was not associated with an increase in blood histamine. It appears that resistance of sheep to H. contortus is not associated with the \" self-cure \" phenomenon, nor with the titre of complement-fixing antibodies. Attempts to find evidence of some other antigen-antibody system have so far failed, hut the work is oontinuing.The effect of drenching with phenothiazine on the resistance of sheep to infestation with Trichostrongylua spp. is being studied at Armidale. It is clear from these trials that the abilty of weaners and lambs _ to resist fresh infestations is not impaired by drenching with phenothiazine. (c) Epidemiological Investigations.\u2014Field studies carried out by the staff of the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, have continued in Tasmania and Y/estern Au.stralia, in collaboration with the respective Departments of Agriculture. In Tasmania trials have been conducted on eleven properties during the year. They commenced in eai'ly summer. Worm popu lations, notably Trichostrongylus spp. and Ostertagia spp., tend to rise in the lambs in late spring and early summer, and lambs should, therefore, be treated about December to reduce their infestations and minimize contamination of pastures. Worm populations rise again in late smnmer and early autumn and the lambs should be treated again about February, when treat ment can conveniently be associated with weaning. In some, but not all, trials in 1951-52 there was also a considerable increase in faecal egg counts in late winter, associated with a declining plane of nutrition. Photosensitization has occuiTed on several occasions among lambs in Tasmania which have been drenched with phenothiazine. In Western Australia trials have continued on seven properties, including the Regional Field Station at Kojonup. Additional groups were included in the trials this year to provide a comparison between epi demiological changes in worm burdens and in produc tivity between treated and untreated sheep. In a trial the previous year, treated sheep weighed 89.5 lb. at shearing and cut 11 lb. 5 oz. of greasy wool, whereas untreated sheep wmighod 77 lb. and cut 9 lb. 1 oz. Moreover, among the twenty untreated sheep there were eighteen tender fleeces, six tender skin, and six with cotted wool, compared with ten tender fleeces, one tender skin, and no cotted wool in the treated group. The trials this year commenced when the lambs-\u00bbwere weaned in August. Worm burdens again increased in the late winter and early spring but to lower levels than last year. The unusual early summer rains of 1951 were not repeated in 1952 and faecal egg counts remained low throughout the summer. Rains in the early autumn of 1953 were followed by increased egg counts in May, with heavy infestations of E. contortus in the Toodyay district and of C. ovina in the Williams and Cranbrook districts. Further data are needed before the most effective timinc: of preventive treatment can be ascer tained, but indications from the first two years' work are that ewes should bo treated before lambing, that lambs should be treated in July and again at about the end of March, and that, if good rains occur during the summer months, sheep may require treatment about three weeks later. Epidemiological observations have also been continued on the Southern Tablelands of Hew South Wale?.' Another trial was concluded during the year with lambs born in late winter. When first examined, at about sevon weeks of age, appreciable worm infes tation was already present, as indicated by faecal egg counts. Worm populations rose during the spring, mainly due to infestations with Ostertagia spp. and Trichostrongylus spp., and remained moderately high during the summer. Infestations with C. ovina and Oe. venvlosum appeared during the summer. After rains in the autumn, the levels of infestation declined. This occurred in the previous two years also and is believed to be due to \" self-cure ' resulting from increased intake of larvae when autumn rains have favoured their development. Liveweight again showed a decline in the summer, due mainly to a reduced plane58 of nutrition, but tluit worm infestations also eontri- butocl to it was shown by the higher liveweight of treated sheep compared with controls. In hoggets there was only a slight rise in faecal egg counts in the summer, chiefly due to C. ovina and Oe. venulosum. The low level of infestation probably resulted from I'csistauce induced by infestation during the previous season. In additioji to these observations, lambs were killed each month from September to May for total worm counts. An appreciable rise, with many imma ture worms of each species, Avas found after heavy rain in December. Thereafter, the summer was dry and no immature forms Avere found until after further eft'eetivc rain had occurred in April. The fact that, although immature forms Avere then found, the actual Avorm burden of the sheep declined, probably indicates that \" self-cure \" had occurred. At Armidale the comparison of the epidemiology of nematode parasites in sheep grazing on soaa'ii and natiA'e pastures Avas continued. The obserA\u00bbations have been made on the same sheep continuously since birth in October, 1951. The dry spring and summer of 1951 resulted in a delayed onset of parasitism in both groups. Oeso'phagostomvm infestation was noted to be loAA^er in lambs grazing soavu pasture up until May, 1952, and although infestations have increased there still appears to be a significant difference in favour of the soAvn pasture group. At the termination of the trial Avhen the sheep are killed, this observation Avill be investigated fAirther. Haemonchus infestations, as in the autumn of 1952, continued at appreciably higher IcA-els in the natiAm pasture group during the spring and summer of 1952-53. This position was temporarilA reversed folloAving rains in February Avhen \" self- cure\" was observed in the native pasture AA-hereas a number of the soAvn Trichonfrongylvs infestations haA-e fol- loAved much the same pattern in both groups during the period of observations and are at Ioav and com parable levels at the present time. A jAreliminary trial was commenced at the Falkiner Memorial Field Station on the epidemiology of hel- minthiases in sheep on irrigated pastures. Tavo groups, each of tAventy young Avethers, have been under observation since February, one group on irrigated pasture and the other on native pasture. During th\" first three months, faecal egg counts in the group on irrigated pasture rose to doiAble the count of those on natural pasture. The rate of liveweight increase in the group on natural pasture was more than double that o the group on irrigated pasture. It is not believed that the additional worm burden of the sheep on irri gated pasture is solely responsible for their relatively poor increase in weight during a period of adaptation, but it has probably had an appreciable effect. Total counts of Trichostrongylus spp. have been made in sheep of both groups at monthly intervals. There has been a progressive increase in both groups but whereas the count in sheep from the irrigated pasture has increased from 915 to 5,680, the increase in sheep on natural pastures has been from 300 to 1,340. Trials in 1951 and 1952 at Armidale have confirmed earlier observations at Cherry Hill on the removal of Oe. columbianum from sheep grazing green oats. During 1952, the effect of a P/iuium-subterranean clover pasture and a red cloA'er pasture Avere studied in addition to green oats. On both pastures there Avas some shedding of Oa. columhianum in comparison Avith controls grazing natiA'e pastures but these pastures AA'ere leas efficient than green oats. Several factors may influence the shedding of worms. The ingestior of green oats led to an acid reaction of the faeces and this may be of importance. Shedding of Avorms com meneed soon after grazing on the green oats began and Avas associated with softening of the faeces. Thei-e and red clover but removal of AA'orms Avas much less effective. VCeight increases in the sheep on green oats wen- slightly greater in 1951 and considerably greater than the controls of 1952. The high nutritive value of the gi-een oats per w. does not seem to be the important factor in effectiA-e removal of Avorms. (d) Studies on O'stertagia spp.\u2014Investigations of the histotropic phase of these .sjoecies, mentioned in Ihe previous Deport, have been completed at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney. Third-stage Ostertagia larvae enter the gastric pits and glands in the pyloric and cardiac regions of the ahoinasum between 72 and 96 hours after administra tion. Some also penetrate glands in the abomasal Fundus. This initial migration is the most regular feature of the histotropic phase. Thereafter, worms may leave the mucosa quickly or remain there undeveloped for periods Avhich may exceed three months. Others may develop to the adult stage in the niTTcosa and migrate into the lumen of the abomasum in that form, or as the fourth instar. (e) Systematic Studies on Parasites ajfecting Sheep. \u2014These studio.s have continued at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney. Because little is knoAvn of the species of Coceidia in Australian .sheep, a sinwey has been commenced. So far, Eimerla iirloingi. has been found most commonly but small numbers of E. parra. E. nina kohl yakimovi, E. favrei. and E. intricata are also found. In addition, cocyst- Avhich correspond to the descriptions of E. crandallis Honess 1942, and E. ah-sa-ta Honeas 1942, have been observed. Trichostrongylus rugatus Monnig 1925, a common parasite of sheep, has been found in the small intestine of cah'es at a Sydney abattoir and may be common in cattle in Hoav South Walc.s. This is the first record of the occurrence of T. rugatus in cattle. An index has been completed of all members of the genus Cooperia. (/) Distribution of Nernatodes in the Small Intestine of Sheep.\u2014Information has been collected at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, on the distribution in the small intestine of sheep of those species of Cooperia Avhich are normally parasitic in cattle. It is believed this Avill aid elucida tion of the factors which influence localization of species in the .small gut and possibly also in regard to problems of host specificity. (g) Studies on the Bionomics of Free-living Stage.i of Nernatodes of Sheep.\u2014A study of the ecology of nematode larvae has commenced at the Regional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, Hew South Wales. (i) Hatching of Eggs and the Development of Infective Larvae.\u2014Faeces have been exposed in dense pasture (6 inches high), a short pasture (2 inches high), and on a bare pasture (grass cut at base, leaving mat only). These are compared with faeces exposed under optimum moisture conditions in a dense pasture and with control cultures in an incubator. Tempera tures in pellets in exposed faeces follow closely thermo graph records in an adjacent Stevenson screen and these records are being used until microclimatic records are available. Observations bave indicated that there Avould be a more continuous production of infective larvae where there is a dense pasture cover limiting ev.aporation and that \" mass hatching\" of eggs of Trichostrongylus spp. can occur under these conditions, depending on rainfall distribution. There Avas no similar \" mass hatching \" with H. contortus'. (ii) Vertical Distribution of Infective Larvae.\u2014 Small Phalaris-Ooxer plots trimmed to 4.5 inches in height are inoculated fortnightly Avith infectiA'e larvae, and the gra.^s, mat, and vertical distribution of larvae is correlated witli microclimatic conditions. The distribution was found to be reversed as between inoculation following dry and wet periods. A direct measure of infective larval populations on pastures grazed with different stocking rates is also iieing attempted and an infective dose of larvae sufficient to cause clinical symptoms, has been recovered from artificially contaminated pastures. {h) 'lite. Pathology of ITelminthiniils in Sheep.\u2014 Studies at the McMaster Animal Health Labora tory, Sydney, on worm-free sheep and on sheep which had been dosed with larvae of Trirhoslrongylu.-' spp. revealed that a hypocythaemic anaemia occurred in all the infe.sted animals, together with a fall in the haematocrit reading to below 20 per cent, in the more heavily infested sheep. The rate at which dye (Evan.s' blue) disappeared from the blood stream was greater in infested sheep than in controls. This suggested that in infested sheep there was an increase in capillary permeability or that blood was removed by the para sites. The hypothesis is being examined by serologica'i means. The hypocythaemic anaemia in infested sheepi was not due to the repeated injections of dye, nor to weekly bleeding. Blood analysis showed no signiiicani ditference in the electrolyte balance (Ha, K, 01) between control and infested .sheepi nor in infe.sted sheep at different stages of the infestation. iSTo con stant histopathological changes have been found in the intestine of sheep carrying light infestations Avitii Trichostronglylus spp. but further material from heavily infested sheep is to be examined. (i) Parasite Physiology and Toxicology.\u2014Eesearch at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, on the biological activity of complex ions, which may have valuable toxicological or chemn- therapeutic applications, has continued in collaboration with the Chemistry School of the University of Sydney and the Zoology Department of the University of Adelaide. Studies on the Biological Activity of Complex Ions. \u2014A wide range of additional compounds, of different chemical composition and belonging to the hi-, tri-, quadra-, quinqua-, and sexadentate groups have been tested for toxicity to mice. All these compounds wei' stable but they differed in symmetry, charge, anu water or fat solubility. All were toxic to some extent, but particularly the fat-soluble and highly charged compounds. Their toxic effect resemble.? that of curare. Among asymmetric compounds, the d-form is much more toxic than the Lform. There is evidence to sug gest that the less toxic Lform tends to block the toxiceffect of the d-form, if given in advance of it, whereas sub-lethal doses of the d-form, given in advance, enhance the toxicity of the Lform. The difference in toxicity between the d- and /-forms of the same compound was thought to result from differences in their ability to penetrate membranes.This was supported by the results of experiments with a compound _ labelled with losEu. After intraperi- toneal injection, the d-form reached a much hio'her level in the blood than the /-form. Side effects of''the injection of these complex compounds in rats were a rapid hyperglycaemia and glycosuria, which, reacherl a peak shoitly after injection on successive -davs.Seveie glycosuria continued even when blood glucosehad subsided below the renal threshold. After death, degenerative changes were found in the renal tubule^' and hepatic cells. Much lipoid had also been lost from the suprarenals and there was secondary prolifera tion in the lymph nodes. In both mice and rats Avell- inarked but transient polycythaemia occurred after injection. All these effects appeared to be related to the charge of the compound. There was no stronocoiu'clation between the effect of the compounds on blond-glucose levels and their toxicity and, when the lethal effect of the more toxic fat-soluble compounds was prevented by simultaneous administration of eserine, hyperglycaemia and glycosuria still occurred. Desoxyribonuclease was not affected by cationic complexes. [Trease was only inhibited by asym metric compounds. Succinic dehydrogena.se was aiiected, but whereas the /-form of a compound inhibited this enzyme, the d-form activated it. These effects did not .seem to result from surface action but possibly from disturbance of the spatial relationship of the protein molecules in the enzyme solution. The complex Eu (o-phenj^CL was found to inhibit growth of Brucella abortus strain 19 and preliminary tests indicated that multiplication of certain bacterio- phages was also inhibited. 18. Exteknal Parasites. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Studies on the Itch Mite of Sheep (Psorergates ovis).\u2014Attempts at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, to determine the duration of the stages in the life-cycle of this parasite have not, as yet,been siicce.ssful.^ The information given last year concerning distribution on the sheep has been confirmed and, in addition, it has been found that the itch mite may be present on any part of the head and face of the sheep. The investigation on the bionomics of P. ovis has been completed and can shortly be published. (h) The Pace Louse of Sheep (Linognathus ovillus). ; During the year it was po,ssible to investigate at theMcMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, an outbreak of this form of louse infestation. It is not a common parasite in Australia and does not seem tohave been investigated here previously. The completelife cycle occupies about five weeks. Eggs hatch in eleven-fifteen days under optimum conditions. Popula tions on sheep increase during the winter and reach a maximum in spring. They decline during the warmer months and a great reduction in numbers followsshearing. When populations are at a minimum, theselice are only found on the hair-covered face, but whenthe peak of population is reached they are also foundin the avooI about the face, head, and upper parts of theneck. If the lice are found elseivhere on the body it isdue to mechanical transmission and they soon die. Infestations may be so heavy that the face, head, anduppei neck apjiear brown in colour. Even heavyinfestations do not appear to worry the sheep undulyand the economic importance of the parasite is probably single trial in the affected flock suggests thatpHC, at the concentration generally recommended fordipping, will eradicate L. ovillus provided the dippingtechnique ensures proper saturation of the face, head, and neck, but this flnding requires conflrmation. Theusual plunge-dipping technique, in which sheep pass rapidly through the bath and the heads are immersedonce, IS so inadequate that many sheep in the group so treated were still infested when re-examined some three months later. (c) Studies on the Ecology of Ectoparasites.\u2014An attempt is being made at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, to determine the main charac teristics of the environment to which ectoparasites thatspend their complete life _ cycle on their and to .study_ their physiological adaptationtliei-eto. Damalinia ovis and the sheep are the parasite and host under investigation at present. It has heen .shown that the presence of fibre is necessary before oviposition can take place freely but there appears tobe no physiological specialization which prevents the egg's from hatching ivhen laid on fibres other than woolrr hair. The greatest number of eggs are deposited at temperatures in the vicinity of 37.5\u00b0 C. The best hatchappears to occur between 35 and 38\u00b0 C., but tbis requires closer examination. Some eggs of I), ovis, but none of L. ovillus will hatch at 40\u00b0 0. (d) Systeniaiics.\u2014Descriptions are being prepared at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, of the eggs, nymphs, and adults of those lice of the genus Linognathus which are found on domestic animals. Suitable diagnostic keys will then be drawn up. (e) Studies on Control of Ectoparasites hy Means of Insecticides.\u2014At the McMaster Animal Health Labora tory, Sydney, the value was tested of jetting sheep in long wool with BHO to control D. ovis infestations for two or three months, until they could be shorn. Ap preciable infestations with body lice when sheep are carrying several months' fleece create a difficult problem. It is often impracticable to shear them and dipping involves a greater risk than with recently shorn sheep besides seriously staining the fleeces and reducing their value. Yet, if the lice are not controlled, the irritation they cause results in considerable damage to the fleece through biting and rubbing. Moderate to heavy body- louse infestations occurred in some 200 wethers which were carrying ahout nine months' wool and which, for experimental reasons, could not be shorn for some two or three months. Each wether was jetted, well into the fleece, from poll to tail and to about midway down the sides, with BHO at four times the usual concentration recommended for dipping. Approximately ^ gallon was used on each sheep and the results were very satis factory. The louse population was reduced to negligible proportions and irritation was eliminated. There was no recurrence prior to shearing, some three months later, after which the sheep were dipped. (/) Demodectic Mange in Sheep.\u2014Deniodex ovis is commonly present on sheep in small numbers which remain unnoticed. It rarely causes any clinical signs and there are very few records of it. Such a case occurred at the Laboratory during the year, in a sheep which was known to have harboured this parasite for a considerable period. OAving to its rarity, a description of the case is being prepared by the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, for publication. 19. PnoTECTiON Against Blowfly Strike. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) Attempts Avere made at the Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory, Yeerongpilly, Queensland, to obtain a high incidence of this type of strike by wetting sheep in a shower dip to induce fleece rot and releasing large numbers of laboratory-bred Lucilia cuprina. Although an appreciable incidence of fleece rot Avas produced, these attempts were not successful in producing a high incidence of body strike for experimental work. It was found that by using indole plugs as an attractant, a satisfactory incidence of strike could be obtained. A trial to test the protection given by rmrious concentra tions of DDT and BHC was inconclusive; the work is proceeding, 20. Entomological Study of the Sheep Bloavfly. (Division of Entomology.) The folloAving is a brief summary of the work whichhas been carried out on the sheep blowfly by the Divi sion of Entomology. The ecological studies under (a) are described more fully in Chapter IX., Section 3. (a) Ecological Studies.\u2014A large-scale trapping experiment using newly emerged Lucilia cuprinamarked Avith fluorescent dusts has been carried out, and bas yielded much useful information. The experi ment included observations on several other blowfly species and the bush fly, Musca vetustissima. (h) Life History Studies of Blowflies,-\u2014Studies on the breeding habits and life history of several species have been continued.(c) Erotection against Body Strike.\u2014Pinal insectary tests were carried out the persistency of DDT incor porated in L.B.E. branding fluid. 21. Other Investigations. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Neo-natal Mortality in Lamhs.\u2014These studies liaA'e been continued at \"Chiswiek\" Field Station, Armidale, and elseAvhere in the Division of Animal Health and Production. At \" ChisAvick \", in 1951, ewes of several strains, mated and lambed under pen condi tions, reared a higher percentage of lambs up to marking time than station flock ewes mated and lambed under paddock conditions. Under pen conditions there was both a higher percentage of lambing ewes and a lower death rate in the lambs. A study was commenced of the effects of different husbandry practices at mating and lambing on the percentage of ewes lambing as well as on lamb mortality. Merino CAves from tAvo to seven years of age were brought under study. The husbandry practices are set out as follows. (i) Paddock Mating and a Modified Paddock Lamh- ing.-\u2014^A shelter shed with three attached yards located in a 350 acre paddock was used during lambing. EAA'es were shut in the largest yard at night and each morning the normal ewes and their lambs were removed to a second paddock. Ewes and lambs requiring special attention Avere retained in the smaller yards. (ii) Paddock Mating and Lambing.\u2014Ewes and lambs were inspected twice daily and assisted where possible. (iii) Pen Mating and Lambing.\u2014The mating of the 150 ewes was in a paddock .\u00a7 acre in size. The lambing Avas carried out in pens, 60 by 40 feet, with a shelter shed available for use in inclement weather. (iv) Mating on Sown Pasture and Pen Lambing.\u2014 The mating of 147 ewes was in a 46-acre paddock of sown pasture and the lambing was under conditions similar to the previous treatment. (v) Later Lambing off Shears and in Wool.-\u2014 Lamb-\" ing in these groups was three weeks later than in the previous treatment. The sheep lambing in-the-wool carried eleven months' avooI and were run under paddock conditions with the other group. An average of 95 per cent, of ewes of all age-groups in all treatments lambed Avith the exception of the two- year-old ewes mated three weeks later which gave a 72 per cent, lambing. Only in the groups mated on sown pastures was there an appreciable number of twins and then only in the three- and four-year-old ewes. The ewes grazed the sown pastures fourteen days prior to mating. The percentage of lambs lost of lambs born Amried according to the age of the ewe and the method of husbandry from 2 per cent, in the four-year-old ewes lambed off shears to 36 per cent, in the two-year-old ewes paddock mated and lambed. Disregarding age of ewe,.the method which gave the highest loss of 23.5per cent, was that in which the ewes were paddock- mated and lambed. Later lambing in wool also gave a high death rate of 21.3 per cent. The other methods gpe a death rate between 10 and 18 per cent., but the differences had little if any significance. In general there appeared to be no dominating cause of death. (b) The Effect of_ Crazing^ Management on Pasture and Animal Production.\u2014This is a co-operative investi gation between the Regional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, Hew South \"Wales, and the Division of PlantIndustry (see Chapter III., Section 15 (c)). The effects of different rates of stocking, rotational grazing, and grazing in different flock sizes on the health and production of Merino sheep grazing natiA-e pasture and the production of the pastures have been studied. The trends reported in previous years continued in the fourth year. The better liveweight gains with lighter stocking rate were maintained.61 The size of flock trial which compares sheep in flocks of 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30 terminated at the end of the third year. In the final year the lower body weight in the two-sheep flock was not so great. (c) Studies on the Production of Native Pastures, used in Conjunction with Soivn Pasture.-\u2014Earlier studies at the Eegional Pastoral Laboratory, Armidale, iSTew South Wales, on the native pastures of the New England region have shown that, even at relatively light rates of stocking, sheep weights decline to a low level in winter and with stocking rates fixed by this critical winter period much of the summer production is not utilized. The critical winter period makes the breeding of Merinos on native pasture alone impracticable. In co-operation with the Division of Plant Industry (see Chapter III., Section 15 (c)) a study is being made of the production of native pasture grazed in conjunction with increasing proportions of sown pasture (3.9, 15.5, 30.8, and 57.1 per cent.) by a compo site flock of breeding ewes, weaners, and wethers. The pasture and animal production on both the sown and the native pasture is being measured. This investiga tion commenced in April, 1953. VIII. CATTLE. 1. General. Cattle both for beef and for dairy products play an unportant part in the Australian economy. Populationincreases and the importance of maintaining exports emphasize the need for research into problems of beefproduction. Particular attention is being given to mvestigation of cattle raising in the tropical areas inNorth Australia where climatic and agrostological factors are unsuitable for sheep, and where beef is the main primary industry. The Organization's work on cattle problems has been carried out within the Division of Animal Health and Production, mainly in die Animal Health Laboratory in Melbourne and the Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory in Queensland {see Sections 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 below). The Division of Entomology has been concerned with work on the cattle tick {see Section 5 below). The work of the Divisionof Plant Industry on pastures is also of great importance to the cattle industry {see Chapter III.). The work of the Animal Genetics Section on beef cattle IS described in Section 8 below. 2. Cattle Diseases. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) {a) Pleuropneumonia of Cattle.\u2014The experiment being undertaken at the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne, on the possible value of lyophilizcd (i.e. optimally desiccated) vaccine, has beenconcluded by subjecting the 30 animals to challenge by nebulized virulent culture. The main conclusionsare that standard pleuropneumonia vaccine may be preserved by this means for a period of at least 27 months and that, when the dried vaccine is reconstituted for use, the resuscitated organisms are capable ofgiving lise to local tail reactions, to complement-fixation responses, and to immunity. In the particular experiment, each of these types of response was less than IS usually found when fresh vaccine is used but not significantly so: much larger experiments would be required to determine this. To obtain information concerning the minimum age^ at which cattle can be effectively immunized against pleuropneumonia, groups of 30 animals havebeen vaccinated in the age-groups 20-30 days, 40-50 days and 5-7 months 5 they will in due course bechallenged. It was found that in the youngest group, six cases of swollen joints with acute lameness occurred and in the middle group only one case, whereas none occurred in the oldest group. It has long been knownthat a proportion of very young animals are likely to develop swollen joints after vaccination and that, under field conditions, death may follow; it has been assumedthat death was the result of inanition through restrictedfeeding. However, the six animals that developedswollen joints in the youngest group eventually recovered from this, except for fibrous thickenino- of the originally infected joints, but five months later three were reported as showing signs of distress after exertion. One of these died suddenly but could not be autopsied; another ivas found to have developed extensive tricuspid valvulitis, from which the pleuro pneumonia^ organism was recovered. The third animalhad ^ eicatricial thickening of the biscupid and the aortic_ semilunar valves indicative of earlier valvular infection. This experience emphasizes the risk attachedto vaccinating calves at too early an age. The rapid whole-blood slide agglutination test, whichwas briefly referred to in the last Report, has now beenapplied to many hundreds of animals and a report isto be prepared. It has proved very useful in thecontrol of the outbreaks, not only in permitting therecognition of a high proportion of acute cases, but in allowing a rapid herd diagnosis to be made on thespot. It therefore has a useful role to play in control, although the complement-fixation test remains the best for highest accuracy. During the year, the casual organism was examined tor behaviour towards a large number of antibioticsand bacteriostatics. Eollowing on from this, an attemptwas made to treat experimental joint infections by intiaiuminal administration of chloromycetin kindlydonated by Parke, Davis and Company. However results were not encouraging. ' _ It has been confirmed that, contrary to old-established views, the organism does not need fresh unheated serumin order to grow; it will grow equally well in auto- claved serum media and on the surface of heated bloodagar. A long-forgotten observation of Japanese workers that egg yolk can replace serum for growth purposes^ was confirmed, and this was so even afterautoclaving. Work on the identification of the growth factor or factors is proceeding. Studies on the metabolism of the causal organism were concluded which, mter alia, have defined the roleol oxygen. Although strongly aerobic, the organism lacks a cytochrome system. Carbohydrates are oxidized to acetate and carbon dioxide via the Embden-Meyerhof hexose-diphosphate pathway, the essential role of oxygen being to re-oxidize the reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide formed during theoxidation of triose phosphate. In the absence of oxygen, such as might occur in large necrotic lesions in thelungs a poor growth occurs, but very slowly, and it is thought that under these conditions, electron acceptorsother than oxygen may be used. Pyruvate was broken down anaerobieally by the dismutation reaction to lactate, acetate and carbon dioxide. It was found that the organism does not possess systems for the oxidation of acetate or any of the triearboxylic acid cycle intei mediates, and that the amino acid metabolism isvery restricted, only serine and threonine beino- attacked. \u00b0 During the year, 525,000 doses (0.5 ml.) of vaccinewere distributed. Sufficient complement-fixing antigenwas supplied gratis to laboratories within Australiaand 111 Africa (Kenya, North Nigeria and Sudani totest 18,060 and 24,600 cattle respectively. ^ (b) Mastitis in Dairy Cattle.-Nork at the AnimalHealth Research Laboratory, Melbourne, was limited to investipting the value of various antibiotics againststaphylococcal mastitis, the criterion of bacterioffigicMcure being inability to demonstrate the organism bvroutme cultural methods in milk samples collected at62 weekly intervals for four weeks after_ treatment. ^ In tensified aureoinycin treatment (two infusions of 420 mg. at an three days), procaine penicillinplus 5-amino acridine, furaein, teiiamycin andneomycin were examined in this way and none was found very satisfactory, in that the proportion of cures was less than 20 per cent. (r) Brucellosis in CaMe.\u2014The main object of this work at the Animal Health Eesearch Laboratory, Mel bourne, during the past year has been to determine whether protection conferred by vaccdnation during calfhood persists through the fourth year after vaccina tion. The vaccinated groups, together with a control unvaccinated group were exposed to natural infection, as before, from experimentally infected abortinganimals. At the end of the exiperiment there had been 21 out of 30 (70 per cent.) of infections in the control group, 3 out of 25 (12 per cent.) in the once- vaccinated group, and 0 out of 25 in the twice- vaccinated group. Of specific Brucella abortus abor tions, there had been 9 (30 per cent.) in the controls and none in either of the vaccinated groups._ This again clearly demonstrated the value of \" strain 19 vaccination, but the difference between ^ the two vaccinated groups was not statistically significant. Observations are being continued in these vaccinated groups for a further year. (d) Haematuria Vesicalis in Cattle.\u2014Work on the estimation of aminophenolic compounds in bovine urine was continued at the Animal Health Research Labora tory, Melbourne. The problem has proved unexpectedly difficult, but progress is being made. A hypothesis is being examined that o-amino- pbenols may be the immediate cause of the bladder lesions, and in this connexion the possible carcinogenic eirect of a member of this group, introduced uito the bladder of mice as waxy pellets, is under investigation. (e) Infectious Bovine Ophtkahnia.\u2014Opportuuities occurred during the year at the McMaster Animal Health Laboratory, Sydney, to examine cattle affected with ophthalmia in the Penrith, Richmond, Casino- Tenterfield and Wellington districts of Hew South Wales. From affected eyes (tears) in each of these outbreaks a bacterium was recovered which has been identified as Moraxella (or llaemophilus) bovis. This has been described as the cause of a similar disease among cattle in the United States of America, but had not previously been recorded in Australia. The disease was transmitted to four young cattle, which had not been exposed to the disease previously, hy instilling asuspension of M. bovis into the conjunctival sac. Typical lesions developed in three of the four animals. The fourth showed no ocular lesions but harboured the organism in its nasal cavities in large numbers, ill. bovis was recovered from both ocular and nasal swabs of each of the four cattle after infection, whereas it had been absent previously. All were still harbouring the organism when last examined, some months after the lesions had subsided, and attempts to reinfeet two of them failed. The finding of M. bovis on the nasal }nucosa in large numbers suggests that droplet infec tion, through sneezing and snorting by infected animals, may be an important factor in the epidemiology of the disease. Transmission by instillation into the conjunctival sac was attempted in sheep, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. Only the mice were affected._ Five out of six developed a typical kerato-conjunctivitis withprogression to corneal rupture and formation of staphylomata in two cases. M. bovis was recovered from each of the infected mice. All cattle developed agglutinins to high titre as the disease progressed. A non-protoolytic, haemophilus-like organism which was isolated from one beast prior to artificial infection was shown on serological grounds to be unrelated to M. bovis. Drug inhibition tests by the dilutionmetliod, in vitro, showed that chloromycetin inhibited growth of M. bovis completely at 1: 500,000 whereas the organism grew well in aureomycin at this dilution but was inhibited at 1:100,000. Treatment of early cases with an ointment which contains 1.0 per cent, cliloromycetin has been uniformly successful and good l eports have been received from graziers who have used it according to instructions. In advanced cases, sjiectacular results are not to be expected but the rate of recovery has been accelerated. 3. Intebnal Pabasites. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) _ The following three investigations have been carried out by the staff of the Ueterinary Parasitology Laboratory, Yeerongpilly, Queensland. (a) Epidemiology of Parasitic Gastro-enteritis of Cattle.\u2014In Queensland, the herd at Dayboro is still under observation and a herd at Goodna has been brought into the experiment. The trends given by the egg counts for the various species of helminths present in these herds have been similar to those previously reported. The herd at Goodna has shown some extremely high egg counts, up to 6,000 eggs per g. for IIaemonchiis contortiis and up to 59,000 for Cooperia spp. (C. punctata. and C. fjectinata). These are the highest counts yet recorded in these studies. (b) Faecal Examination as a Measure of HelminthInfestation.\u2014Studies on the relationship between live- weight, age, and faecal output have shown that egg counts may be reasonably compared in animals ofdifferent ages by applying the following corrective factors:\u2014 Aw (Weeks).Correction Fiictor.Age (Weeks).CoiTULtion satisfactory tech-nicjue was developed for the collection of the large numbers of cercariae required for studies on thepathogenicity of the species. It was foiind that ccrcariae were readily attracted to yellow light and could in this way be induced to encyst on glasspreviously painted with liquid plastic. IN 0 symptoms were manifested by a _ calf given30,000 cysts of Paramphistomum icbilcawai in a single doku The flukes reached maturity in 30 days. At post mortem. 80 days after infestation 6,000 adults were recovered from the rumen. A second calf given 130,000cysts of this species also showed no evidence of infesta tion and when slaughtered twelve days after infestationyielded 5,000 immature forms collected from the small intestine. Further evidence was obtained that amphistomes exhibit a definite rhythm in egg production. Examina tion of specimens during the period of minimum eggproduction showed degeneration of the testes and an affience of eggs in the uterus. A new technique has been developed for countingfluke efi's in faecal samples and yields approximately four tinros the number of eggs obtained with techniques previously in use. i. Resistance to Cattle Tick Infestation. ^Division of Animal Flealth and Production.) Studies have been commenced at the VeterinaryParasitology Laboratory, Yeerongpilly, Queensland, on the resistance by cattle to infestation with Boopinlus6a mtcroplus, and in'eliininary work indicates an inherent natural resistance and a resistance associated with an allergic reaction to infestation. Work so far has heen confined to the allergic reaction, the development of which appears to depend on the numher of ticks and the intervals between infestation with larvae. Blood histamine results showed a conspicuous increase in histamiue concentration on attachment of newly moulted nymphs and adults. The increase was present tor only a comparatively brief period. Furthermore, as there was no increase during the period of rapid engorgement by the female, it seems evident that blood histamine concentrations are not associated with salivai'y secretion by the ticks. In hypersensitive animals the infestation is con siderably decreased and this is due mainly to losses in the larval stage. Many larvae are removed by the animal licking at infested areas to relieve the irritation and others are killed through the outpouring of excessive serous exudate. The nymphs from the surviving larvae cause a typical, allergic-type, papular reaction which appears a short time after attachment. The oedema subsides in several hours. A similar reaction occurs subsequent to attachment by the newly moulted female. Some loss through licking also occurs among nymphs and adults. 5. Entomologicaj, Studv of the Cattle Tick. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Chemical and Biochemical Studies.\u2014(i) Bio- assay Tests.\u2014Many new insecticides and formulations have been tested in the laboratory against larval and adult stages of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus, hut none has shown outstanding toxicity. The suscepti bility to insecticides of the translucent type and the moi-e common opaque type have been compared. The translucent ticks are usually found on animals carrying a very high artificial tick infestation, and the viability of their eggs is much lower than that of opaque ticks. In a limited number of tests translucent ticks showed a greater susceptibility to poisoning by insecticides than opaque ticks. (ii) AiiempLs lu Tniproue To.vicily of in collaboration with^the Division at the ISTew South Wales University of Technology, supplied three new types of DDT emulsion which, when tested in the laboratory, de posited a greater amount than usual of DDT on cattle hair dipped into the dilute suspensions. These materials, together with a well-known emulsion concen trate, were examined at Yeerongpilly\u2014(1) by deter mining the LD.-,i) by bioassay; (2) by spraying on to cattle and determining by microchemical methods the initial deposit and the period the insecticide persisted; (3) by comjjaring penetration of DDT from each formulation through the tick cuticle; and (4) by carrying out a field trial in which a number of tick- infested animals were sprayed and the kill of ticks and the period of protection against re-infestation assessed by a rating scale. Mone of these materials showed any outstanding improvement on existing formulations. (iii) .Toss of Efficiency of BllC Dipping Fluids.\u2014 Further work has shown that the loss of efficiency in BI-IC dipping fluids is related to a selective depletion of the toxic ganima-isomer. This deifietion is indicated by a decrease in the proportion of gamma-isomer to total BHC in the samples, and has been okserved in all field dipping vats examined. The dehydrohalogenation method of estimating the BHC content of dipping fluids is, therefore, shown to be of little value for it determines total BHC and the gamma-isomer content cannot be derived from this figure. Chromatography is the only specific method of analysis so far found satis factory; but this technique, although reliable, is verytime-consuming. The depletion of the gamma-isomer has been reproduced under laboratory conditions and work is in progress to determine the factors responsible and the mechanism of the believed breakdown. Although the depletion is a serious problem, its prac tical importance is minimized by the high initial concentration of gamma-isomer in the dipjjing vat and by frequent additions of new material. Thus there is no marked loss of toxicity in the dipping fluid until the concentration of the gamma-isomer has been reduced to less than one-fifth of the normal concentra tion used. (iv) Resistant Strains of Ticks.\u2014The fifth genera tion of the BHC-rcsistant strain of ticks brought from the -Kockhampton area still retains a high degree of resistance. Although the strain has not had any con tact with BHC or any other insecticide since it was collected from the field, there has only heen a very niinor drop in the degree of its resistance. This strain is also resistant to arsenic and toxaphene, and slightly so to DDT. Although both larval and a'dult ticks of the resistant strain show a similar degree of increased resistance compared with the corresponding stages of the non-resistant strain, insecticides can still be used effectively against immature stages of the resistant strain because of the greater susceptibility of these stages to poisoning. The resistant strain has a similar incubation period to that of the normal strain, but the parasitic life cycle is slightly longer. Other resistant strains of tick have heen found during the year. One from north Queensland was highly resistant to BHC. Another from northern Hew South Wales was resistant to arsenic. (v) Field Trials.\u2014Apart from the field trials men tioned in Subsection (ii) above, further tests have heen completed on dieldrin, chlordane, and toxaphene. pieldrin appears to he an outstandingly effective insecticide for ticks and, when used at a concentration of 0.2 per cent., \"mortality\" (as measured by the failure of engorged female ticks to lay viable eggs) was 100 per cent, and cattle were protected against re- infestation for approximately twelve days. Chlordane used at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.25 per cent, gave \" mortalities \" of 99 and 84 per cent, with protective periods of 7.5 and six days respectively. When toxa phene was used at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.25 per cent, complete kills of all stages of tick were obtained, together with a satisfactory protective period. (vi) Penetration of Insecticides through Tick Cuticle.\u2014The penetration of DDT and BHC tlirough the cuticle of non-resistant and resistant strains of tick has been measured by chemical analysis. Penetration has been found to be greatly affected by the nature of the solvent used for applying the insecticide. (b) Ecological Studies and Field Experiments.\u2014 (i) Infestation of Undipped Animals.\u2014In March, 1952, six sprayed cows of British breeds were placed in a paddock of 85 acres said to have been unstocked for a number of years. Three bullocks were added in June. The animals were examined weekly between April, 1952, and February, 1953, and they were not ti'eated for ticks during that period. The cows were Infested on arrival, but lost these infestations over tliree weeks and carried only a few male ticks until the sixth week, when larvae reappeared. Infestations built up to high levels but wore reduced naturally in winter, reappearing in mid-September. Two of the cows proved to he resistant to infestation, one highly so, and detailed observations were made on the larval and adult tick population that they carried. Compari sons wore made with the susceptible animals. Large numbers of attached larvae were found on the resistant animals, but few reached. maturity. There was no evidence of the susceptible animals developing any64 marked resistance to ticks during the five summer months. Grazing conditions were good during theexperimental period and the susceptible animals, aftershowing signs of tick worry in October, regained condition and tolerated the infestations well. Thesusceptibility of the animals is not related to skin thickness measurements, as suggested overseas, nor to hairiness of coat. The animals were observed to grazetogether and the resistance appears to be due to skin reaction. It is not known wlietker resistance can be inherited. One of the resistant cows was more seriously affected by buffalo flies than the others. (ii) Distribution of Larvae in Delation to Habits of Cattle.\u2014In conjunction with the observations onundipped cattle, the grazing habits of the cattle were observed for a 24-hour period once a month, betweenApril and Hovember. Observations were made everyi hour on the position and activities of the animals and the time spent by a helled animal in each 4-chaiusquare of the paddock was recorded. On the basis of these results,'larval sampling areas were set up round the \" day-camp\", the watering trough, and on twowell-frequented grazing areas, one on a timbered flat and one on a more open ridge. These areas weresampled by the \" trouser\" and \"blanket\" method.s on twenty occasions between November and March. Very few larvae were picked up round the day-camp and the trough, the greatest number being picked up on the ridge grazing area. After removal of the cattle, more larvae than previously were picked up round thetrough but still none round the day-camp. _ Low infesta tions round the day-camp could be attributed to thelarge number of meat ants which attack engorged female ticks, while the low counts round the troughmay have been partly due to constant picking up by the cattle. (iii) Study of \" Tick-free \" Area.\u2014An area_ nearDuaringa has the reputation of being unusually lightly infested with ticks, although well within the tick belt, and deaths from redwater fever occur there from time to time. On an earlier visit it was noticed that parts of the area carried heavy populations of the nocturnalfunnel-ant (Aphaenogaster spp.)._ Engorged female ticks were placed along a transect in this area, both in the evening and early morning. Eunnel and other ants were observed taking most of them. (iv) Larval fihtryiraZ.\u2014Observations are in progress on the survival time of larvae on ungrazed naturalgrasses. These and earlier observations suggest that less than 1 per cent, of larvae hatched will survive more than 50 days in summer and 100 days in winter. (v) Rotational Grazing and Frequency of AcaHcidal Treatment.\u2014An experiment has been commenced to determine whether the frequency of acaricidal treat ment can be reduced by combining treatment with a simple rotation of grazing. 6. Production in Dairy Cattle Herds. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Development of Zebu Hybrid Dairy Cattle.\u2014 These investigations are being undertaken at the McMaster Field Station, Badgery's Creek, New South Wales. The dairy cattle herd now numbers 53 head. During the year three pure-bred Jersey and four pure bred Red Poll heifers, both from high-producing herds,were purchased. The pure-bred Zebu bull was sold and his place was taken by a Sindhi x Jersey bull imported from the United States of America in 1952. The herd now comprises five bulls over two and under one year of age, 24 females in-calf or in-milk, two non-pregnant dry females, seventeen open heifers, and three calves undei four months of age.From early in 1941, there have been 170 head of cattle taken into this Zebu-cross dairying herd from all sources. Of these, 117 have been Zebu or Zebu cross- breds and 53 have been British-bred cattle mainly for crossbreeding but they have also been used to supply within-herd levels of productivity for comparative puiqioses. The investigation has shown that the crossbred cattle are manageable under normal dairying conditions and have controllable maternal instincts and normal responses in \" letting down \" milk. So far as they have gone, the production studies have shown that some of the British-bred dairy heifers are no better producers than crossbred heifers which were culled. It is believed that the first possible cause for restricted production should be overcome by the introduced Sindhi bull. The crossbreds have tended to be less persistent than British-bred females and also slower milkers. Selection may bring about improvement. The objective is to develop crossbreds for production within the tropics. (b) Physiology of Milk Secretion.\u2014At the Animal Health Research Laboratory, Melbourne, the following aspects have been studied:\u2014(i) variations in residual milk and fat, (ii) effects of unequal intervals between inilkings, (iii) the evanescence of the let-down reaction, (iv) rise in fat percentage during_ milking, and (v) artificial induction of lactation in heifers. Inter alia, it was observed that amount of residual milk and fat percentage of residual milk both increase with total yield. The relative amount of residual milk is repeatab'le from early to late lactation, but the regres- siou of residual milk on total yield declines during lactation. Cows in which the relative amount of residual milk in early lactation is high show low per sistence of lactation. Fat percentage of residual milk rose with total yield, but the relationship differed in some respects from that of residual milk and the total milk. 7. Investigation of Beep Production in Australia. (Division of Animal Health and Production.) (a) Beef Cattle Feeding Investigations.\u2014During the year, a senior officer of the Division of Animal Health and Production spent some six months in Britain and the United States of America, where he investigated methods of beef production, with particular reference to nutrition. He has compiled a full report on his observations and much of the information result ing from beef cattle research in Britain and northern America can be utilized in Australia with great advan tage. (b) Feeding of Stud Beef CaftZe.\u2014Records and data obtained after several years' collaboration with certain studs in New South \"Wales have been used as the basis for a publication at the extension level concerning the hand-feeding of cattle for stud and show purposes. (c) Beef Cattle Investigations - in the Southern States of Australia.\u2014All of the twelve centres which were to be established with funds provided by the Aus tralian Meat Board (see previous Report) are now in operation. Among the clearer indications which have emerged so far are: Long periods of stationary or declining body weights, irrespective of age, are being recorded at some_ centres, ivhereas at others a steady increase in liveweight has been achieved in some groups by the use of conserved fodder or suitable crops when pastures are dormant. The type of supplementary feed provided to cattle as weaners may affect the readiness with which they will consume similar or other supple ments as mature cattle. It is apparent that nutrition and management are two of the most important factors affecting beef production. Data derived from carcass appraisal are providing useful information as to theOd best age and condition for slaughter and the require ments of grazing and supplementary feed that are necessary. They are also indicating interesting differences in carcass quality which will require investi gation. 8. GrEisrETios OF Beef Cattle. (Animal Genetics Section.) Some comparisons of beef cattle of European origin with the descendants of the Zebu cattle introduced by the Division of Animal Health in 1931 are in progress. Preliminary oLiservations suggest that European cattle produce a long fine coat in response to poor nutrition, and a short coarse one when well fed. Such a response might be appropriate in cold climates, it does not seem appropriate in hot dry climates, such as that obtaining in central Queensland where poor feeding conditions coincide with the hot weather, and is certainly inappro priate in the \"wet coastal area where inanition is fre quently a result of the efl'ect of high body temperature on appetite. The hair cycle in Zebu cattle is not yet known. A start has been made in determining the ability of European cattle to regulate their temperature in hot climates. Considerable variation has been found between different animals, but comparable observations in mild climatic conditions aro necessary. IX. EXTOMOLOGY. 1. General. As in most parts of the world, the depredations of insects are responsible for enormous losses to primary production in Australia. Eesearch is therefore of the utmost importance both in the control of insect pests themselves and in the use of insects for the biological control of plant pests. The Organization's work in this field is undertaken mainly in the Division of Entomology with head-quarters in Canberra. Collaborative work is, however, undertaken by the Division on special problems in conjunction with other laboratories. Eesearch on insects affecting animals is done in co-operation with the establishments of the Division of Animal Health and Production and is re])oi'ted in Chapters VII. and VIII.; the Division plays a' part in the investigations on the virus disease of rabbits being studied by the Wildlife Survey Section (see Chapter X., Section 2). The Division co-operates with the Division of Forest Products in the study of pests of timber (see Section 18 below, and Chapter XIV., Section 6). Division of Entomology.\u2014The past year has seen several important developments in the work of the Division, and there has been a change of emphasis in some work. After a meeting of Commonw'ealth and State entomologists the Agricultural Council recom mended that an attomjit should be made to eradicate the Argentine ant from the infested areas in Sydney. For this campaign the Commonwealth made available to the Xew South Wales Government officers of the Division, together with special equipment. The cam paign, which was regarded as a large-scale experiment, was undertaken during the summer of 1952-.53. The Biological Control Section has intensified its work on the green vegetable bug, and is endeavouring to establish parasites of the oriental fruit fly which, it is hoped, will exercise some control of the Queemsland fruit fly. Laboratory experiments have shown that populations automatically adjust themselves to destruc tive agencies and, by so doing, reduce the effects of them. Studies have been commenced so that theory and laboratory results can be backed up by detailed observa tions on the factors actually operating in nature. Promising new methods of controlling certain pests, notably the cattle tick and lucerne flea, have been evolved. Preliminary studies have been made on the F.5189.\u20145viruses affecting insects. A new virus attacking a pasture caterpillar has been discovered and it is of particular interest because similar viruses have been used in Canada for insect control. In Western Aus tralia the Division's research officer stationed at the Institute of Agriculture has expanded his programme to include research on the lucerne flea. Dr. E. L. Beard, Senior Fulbright Fellow from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, has come to the Division to work for a period on the bacterial diseases of pasture cockchafers. 2. Cattle Tick. (Division of Entomology.) The Division's work on the cattle tick is described fully in Chapter VIII., Section 5. 3. Sheer Blowfly. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Ecological Studies.\u2014^Using the method of mark ing newly emerged flies with fluorescent dusts, more extensive field studies of newly emerged Lucilia cuprina have been carried out under typical summer weather conditions. These confirmed previous indications that the rate of spread of newly emerged flies after libera tion is quite different from that of flies hardened and fed in the laboratory after emergence. A marked tendency towards irregularity in distribution in the vicinity of the liberation site was again evident, even though environmental conditions did not appear to favour spread in any particular direction. The re coveries of liberated flies and, on some days, the catches of the natural population of L. cuprina were greater than previously recorded. This was partly due, no doubt, to the fact that the bait was more frequently stirred than in previous experiments. Some areas of country appear to yield consistently greater numbers of \" wild \" L. cuprina than others, apart from the well- known effect of immediate location of trap. The recaptured marked specimens of known age are being studied for indications of aging, which when applied to the \" wild flies \" may indicate the age structure of the natural population and throw considerable light on the population dynamics of the species. Analysis of the catch of species other than L. cuprina also indicated marked dilferences in abundance in certain areas, for instance, there were lower numbers of some of the smaller carrion-frequenting species, such as Microcalliphora varipes and Peronia rostrata, in traps in some sectors of the country than in others, and there was also a tendency for the larger Calliphora species to favour certain areas. It has been found that, in a few trap positions, the proportion of male flies caught is consistently higher than in the majority of traps, a phenomenon which occurs with most species. Studies have been commenced on the ecology of the common bloAvfly species other than L. cuprina. During the trapping studies described above, wild blowflies were trapped from other areas, carried to the centre of the trapping area, and liberated after marking with fluorescent lacquers and estimation of numbers. The percentage of marked flies retaken of the common nuisance species Calliphora augur indicates that this species occurs in far greater numbers than L. cuprina. Similar, though less conclusive, evidence was obtained for C. stygia. It was found that these two s])eeies of Cttlliphnra have the power of extremely rapid dispersal. Some information has also been obtained on other species attracted to carrion-baited traps. Chrysomyia riififacies wa.s found to have unsuspected powers of rapid dispersal, and specimens were taken three and a half to four miles from the centre of liberation in less than 24 hours. The smaller species Mici'ocalliphora varipes <liB])pr.sefi much more slowly. A very limited, amount of data on the dispersal of the bushily Musca60 vetuntisnima has been obtained indicating that the movement of the sijecies is much more restricted than that of the Calliphora siiecies. An important observa tion arising from the ecological studies, however, is that the Western Australian blowfly trap is a useful tool for the investigation of the ecology of M. vehistissivia, up to 15,000 flies per day per trap being taken in some situations. (6) Life-history Studies of Bloivflies.\u2014Studies of blowfly biology have been continued, and the breeding habits and life histories of further species elucidated. (c) Extension of Period of Protection against Body Strike.\u2014Final insectary tests on the persistency of DDT incorporated in the L.B.E. branding fluid base indicated that it had significantly greater persistency than that of a colloidal preparation. 4. Insect Physiolooy and Toxicology. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Digestion of Wool by Insects.\u2014It is now well established that the three groups of keratin-digesting insects (clothes moths, carpet beetles, and chewing lice) are characterized by highly reducing midgut digestive secretions. When wool is digested the resistant disul- phide bonds of keratin are reduced and proteolytic enzymes are then able to continue the degradation. Cysteine desulj)hydrase, an enzyme responsible for the production of hydrogen sulphide from cysteine, has been investigated in some detail in insects. This enzyme is more active in the gut of the clothes moth larva than in any of the vertebrate sources (e.g. rat liver) so far reported. It is also present, but less active, in other insects including carpet beetle larvae. The presence of high desulphydrase activity in clothes moth larvae and of low activity in carpet beetle larvae appears to be correlated with the ability of the former, but not the latter, to eliminate metals as sulphides. The pH optima of insect desulphydrases are higher than that of the rat liver enzyme. All are inhibited by arsenious oxide, phenylhydrazine, sodium chloride, and potassium nitrate in approjiriate concentrations, whereas thiourea, sodium pyrojihosphate, and sodium fluoride have little effect. There appear to be a number of differences between the rat liver enzyme and the insect enzymes (e.g. activation of clothes moth enzyme by potassium cyanide) and the insect enzymes are by no means a homogenous group. (h) Pcritrophic Membrane.\u2014The food in the mid- gut of many insects is enclosed within a single or multilayered sheath, the peritrophic membrane, which is permeable to food-digesting enzymes diffusing in and to the products of digestion diffusing out. There is a groat deal of confusion in the literature on its presence or absence in various groups of insects and on the origin of the cells which produce it. A re-examination of these questions, with the help of a mieroadaptation of a method for detecting chitin (a characteristic component of the peritrophic membrane), leads to the conclusion that the ancestral midgut epithelium (of endodermal origin) possessed the capacity to secrete a chitinous membrane enveloping the food. This capacity has been lost in .some insect? and, in others, it has been re.?trieted to a particular zone of the midgut. Studies indicate that the peritrophic membrane is produced continuously and at a higher rate in fed than in starving insects. In some species of fly larvae the average production rate lies in the range 5-10 mm./hr. The fine structure of the ])eritrophic membrane of the cockroach and of several other insects has been examined with the electron microscope. In the species examined the membrane appears to be a complexstructure of which the most characteristic and resistant component is a fibrillar network. A second component is a layer closely associated with the fibrillar network, consisting of unorganized fibrils embedded in an amorphous ground substance. In its most perfect form the fibrillar network possesses hexagonal symmetry, consisting of three systems of parallel fibrillar strands placed at 60\u00b0 to each other. The diameter of the fine fibrils composing the strands is about 100 A and there may be several in each strand. The separate strands of a system of fibrils are about 0.15-0.2/r apart. The fibrillar networks are well adapted to the formation of tough sheets, not readily torn. (c) Insect Muscle Biochemistry.\u2014A study of the cell fractious of blowfly flight muscles has indicated that the IVlg-activated apyrase is located in the sarcosomes which are believed by some to be giant mitochondria. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to show the presence in the sarcosomes of purine nucleoside phosphorylases. Active preparations of mammalian actomyosin-free apyrase, to compare the extent of its dephosphorylation of ATP with 'that caused by the insect enzyme, have been made from European rabbits and less active ones from Australian- bred rats, mice, and rabbits. It appears that two phosphate groups are split off by apyrases from all sources, in contrast with the classical opinion that only one group is hydrolyzed. Work is in progress on grass hopper and rabbit actomyosins to determine whether there is a difference in their pH for optimum activity. (cZ) Chitin Metabolism.\u2014The metabolic sources of chitin are under investigation. The course of enzymic degradation of chitin and chitin esters by a chitiiiaso lias been followed. The esters studied are those which might occur in the biological system. A-acetyl-D-gluco- saminc and D-glucosamine have been isolated from the degradation products. (e) ('hitin-Protein Association in Insect Cuticle.\u2014 There is good evidence that there is some kind of asso ciation between the chitin and protein components of insect cuticle. Work is in progress on the reactions which may occur between chitin, A-acetyl-D-gluco- samine, and D-glucosaniine on the one hand and pro teins on the other hand. (/) Precursors of Guticular Protein.\u2014Work on the differences in the comiiosition of the larval, prepupal, and early pupal haemolymph of insects has been con tinued. Many modifications have been made to a method for the quantitative analysis of amino acids by filter paper partition chromatography and an accurate and reliable method has now been developed. (f/) Inllncnce of Nutrition on Reproduction.\u2014It was previously shown that suitable dietary protein and carbohydrate are both required by females of the Australian sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina) before they can mature eggs. Both classes of foodstuff can be obtained from aphid honeydew, but only carbohydrate from the coccid honeydew^s tested. Meitber carbo- liydrate nor protein can be obtained in adequate quan tity from a wide variety of flowers. The products of digestion of carbohydrates have been determined by means of paper chromatography. Enzymes splitting maltose, sucrose, trehalose, and melezitose have so far been detected in the salivary glands.. Their presence and possible production in the adult midgut is being investigated. The natural carbohydrate diet of wild flies is also being investigated. In one instance L. cuprina caught in a field where sheep had been struck were shown to have obtained their carbohydrate requirements from Eucalyptus blossom.Sources, other than dead mammals, which might serve to supply the protein requirements of female flies in the field are being examined. When the protein content of grass is high (spring and autumn), fresh sheep07 droppings brouglit into the laboratory supply adequate protein for egg maturation. In summer, the protein content of the grass and of sheep faeces is low and liies are unable to mature eggs with this as their only protein source. The faeces of sheep grazing on im proved pastures (Fhalaris and clover) provide a better supply of protein than faeces of sheep on natural grass. 5. Biolooical Gontkol. (Division of Entomology.) (a) (SI. John's Wort (Hyperioum perloratum).\u2014 (i) Ecological Studies at Bright, Victoria.\u2014Following upon the intensive ecological study already undertaken of the effect of Chrysoviela gemellata Rossi and C. hypericrVorst. on St. John's wort in the Bright district, Victoria, periodic surveys are continuing of the main infestation areas of the weed. Indications are that in areas of more equable climate than at Bright (i.e. somewhat warmer and drier), the insects are capable of more extensive defoliation of the weed in infested forests and plantations. As at Bright, the beetles show a marked tendency to avoid densely timbered country. However, the survival rates of offspring of the rela tively few adults which reproduce in densely timbered areas appear to be higher than those observed around Bright. This difference in survival is considered suffi cient to account for the more extensive defoliation observed in other places, owing to the fact that the amount of llypericnm foliage is low per unit area in forests, and comparatively few insects are therefore needed to bring about complete defoliation of their host plant. In the Bright district the total treeless area in which Ilypcricum is being controlled at a low density by the beetles, notably C. gemellata, appears to have in creased considerably during the last two years. (This area is composed of sites in the immediate vicinity of wort-infested forests, &e., which act as a damping factor to population fluctuation enabling the insects to persist in moderate numbers.) The area reclaimed from Hypericum by a combination of beetle attacks and pasture improvement, or by the latter alone, has also increased. Very little infested farmland now remains there. In the adjoining Myrtleford and Mudgegonga districts, the beetles have recently caused spectacular and extensive destruction to Hypericum stands in par tially or wholly cleared farmland in the same manner as dui'ing the period of rapid multiplication in the Bright district some years ago. (ii) Distribution of Chrysomela species.\u2014.Rew liberations made in the year 1952-53 were much less than in previous years. Some 300,000 insects, mostly C. gemellata, were collected in the Myrtleford district of Victoria. Half of these wore sent to Western Aus tralia at the request of the Government Entomologist, who arranged for their release at Forest Grove and Greenbushes. The remaining 150,000 beetles were liberated in Hew South \"Wales, at Burrinjuck to replace a colony destroyed by fire, and in the Tuena, Rylstone, and Capertee districts. The beetles are reported to be making good progress in the Orange, Sodwalls, and Rylstone districts, some reductions in density of the weed being evident in the formei' two. Liberations appear to have failed in the Capertee and Cullen Bullen areas. (ill) Introduction of Zeuxidiplosis giardi.\u2014This coeidomyid gall fly has again been introduced from California, and this time a laboratory colony has been successfully established. The flies are now in the second generation and liberations in the field will be made as soon as conditions are favorable.(b) Other Weed Problems.\u2014(i) Crofton Weed (Eujoatorium glandulosum).\u2014The Queensland Depart ment of Lands has made host restriction tests in Hawaii upon I'rucecidochares utilis, a gall-forming Tephrited which was introduced from Mexico into Hawaii, where it has had a marked effect on the abundance of Crofton weed. The Division assisted in designing the test programme and recommended an importation permit after the tests were completed. The insect was subse quently introduced and established by the Department of Lands. (ii) Luntana. (Lantana caihara).\u2014It is expected that xkustralia will particii^ate in the Hawaiian co operative investigation (in the Central America region) into the natural enemies of lantana. The present plan is for a Queensland Department of Lands entomologist (financed by the Commonwealth and Queensland) to particijmte as associate explorer, hut insect introduc tions will not be made until a later stage when the risks involved in the introductions can be more fully assessed. (iii) Noogoora Burr (Xanthium pungens).\u2014Re newed attempts for the biological control of this weed are being considered in view of its importance and the expressed desire of Queensland authorities that this should be done. Ho final decision has been made. (c) Insect Problems.\u2014(i) Cabbage Moth (Plutella and Apanteles plutellae have continued. The work of introduction and establishment of parasites against Plutella is, however, drawing to a close. A complex of the most important foreign parasites of this insect has been introduced, recoveries of virtually all of them have been made, and, where field examinations have been made, the percentage parasitism attained is very high indeed. Angitia cerophaga appears so far to be the most important of the established parasites. There seenis to be no doubt that Plutella has declined markedly in abundance since these parasite introductions were begun. (ii) Cabbage White Butlerjly (Pieris rapae).-\u2014Ho further work on parasite introduction is contemplated so fai' as this host is concerned, and no further libera tions of Apanteles rubenda were made. This parasite has been recovered quite frequently in the field and is probably permanently established in Australia. Field observations indicate that P. rapae is very heavily para sitized by the introduced A. glomeratus and Pteromalus puparum, virtually 100 per cent, parasitism being common. (iii) Crecii Vegetable Bug (Hezara viridula).\u2014In creasing attention is now being paid to the biological control of this species. The importance of Hezara difl'ers considerably in dift'erent parts of Australia, partly for climatic reasons and partly because of varia tion in different areas in the efficacy of the introduced egg-parasite Microphaniirus hasalis. In general this parasite has been quite effective, but Nezara remains an important jjesf in some regions. During the current year four parasitic enemies of Nezara have been introduced. These are: Trichopoda pennipes, a parasite adult Nezara from Florida; T. p'dipes. a relatoil spetdes of similar habit from the West,Indies; an egg-parasite from the West Indies, Ooencyrtus suhnietnllirus] and a West Indian strain of M. bastdis\u2014the parasite already established here. Experience has shown that the Trichopoda spp. arc too difficult to culture in quantity; consequently, these have been liberated in the field in Hew South Wales and Queensland. Recoveries of Trichopoda have been made already, but it is too early to know if either of68 tlie species is permanently established. The two egg- parasites are being cultured in the laboratory and aistritmtion througliout Australia was begun during the year and will ue continued next season. (iv) Queensland Fruit Fly (Dacus tryoni).\u2014In the newly established Sydney laboratory work has con tinued in the attempt to introduce parasites of the fruit fly, involving development of a mass culturing technique and tests to determine whether imported Upline parasites of the oriental fruit lly {F. dorsalis) can paiasitme the Queensland fruit fly. Work on mass culturing has shown that fruit flies can be reared irom fruit wbich has been in cold store; this greatly facilitates the supply of rearing material. Other e.xperiments have been made to determine the best methods of rearing puparia, and of obtaining eggs without the necessity of having them deposited in fruit. Previously the necessary protein supplement to the diet of adult uies to enable them to produce eggs was only available from the United States. A local food product has now been used successfully for this purpose. A consignment of D. dorsalis parasites, consisting of Upius lungicaudatus (Ashmead) and 0. thaiensis, was received from Honolulu in April, 1953. Both species have been reared through to the P2 generation on D. tryoni material. 0. thaiensis successfully para sitized F. tryoni larvae under two different sets of in- sectary conditions; because of small numbers, 0. longi- caudatus has not been so fully tested as the other species. (v) Potato Tuher Moth (Gnorimoschema oper- culella).-\u2014-Various parasites of this important pest were introduced and liberated some years ago. A field sur vey has begun to determine whether any of those parasites are established. Early results are not very promising, but parasitized specimens found in the field may include some parasitized by Copidosoma koehleri, (vi) Red Scale (Aonidiella aurantii).\u2014A reliable report has been received that the red-scale parasite Comperieila hifasciata, introduced from California several years ago, has been recovered during two succes sive seasons at Mildura, Victoria. This parasite has been known for some time to be established in South Australia. (d) Other Hosts.\u2014Preliminary inquiries have been made in regard to the parasites of several other im portant insect pests. These include Ceroplastes destruc tor (white wax scale), Ceroplastes rubens (pink wax scale), and Listroderes obliquus (brown vegetable weevil). These inquiries indicate that the biological control of these important species should be undertaken as soon as staff and other matters permit. 6. Population Dynamics. (Division of Entomology.) Investigations aimed at finding how populations accommodate themselves to external stresses, such as applications of insecticides, have been continued, using the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, as the experimental subject. It has been found that, although the immediate effect of destructive factors is to reduce density, compensatory reactions are set up which tend to reduce, and sometimes even reverse, this effect when the populations readjust themselves to the continued operation of the destructive factor. For example, in one experiment 50 per cent, of the whole adult 'popu lation of flies was destroyed every second day over a period of ten months; the compensatory reaction caused the number of flies emerging each day to be much greater and the average density of flies to be only a little less than in an otherwise similar experi ment in which there was no imposed destruction. In other experiments it was found that, when 99 per cent.of all emerging flies were destroyed, the adult popula tion, instead of being reduced to 1 per cent., was only reduced to 10 per cent., the number of flies emerging per day being apparently six times as great, and the average life span of the adults twice as long as in the control population in which no destruction was imposed. Similar compensatory reactions were observed in many other experiments in which different kinds of situations were studied and the various mechanisms of compensation were clearly revealed. It is clear that populations can adjust themselves to very great external stresses, and that the resultant popula tion densities are far from being directly related to the favourability or otherwise of the environment. Largely as a result of these population experiments, a revised system of classification of environmental factors according to the influence they have upon popu lations has been evolved, and further advances have been made in the classification of the basic systems of population growth and maintenance, twelve such systems now being recognized. 7. Field Population Studies. (Division of Entomology.) Eecently the Division began long-term field studies on insect populations. The work is a logical and necessary extension of the theoretical and laboratory studies in progress on population dynamics, and is aimed at determining the factors responsible for governance of the numbers of different kinds of insects under natural conditions. It is becoming increasingly evident that a knowledge of such factors is essential for the successful control of many pests. It is planned to concentrate first on species subjected to a minimum of human interference in order to limit the complexities of a very difficult problem. If the investigations on such species are successful, it is intended to extend the work to various pests at present attacked by insecticides. Four species of Psyllidae and two of Coccidae have been chosen for study. Of these, three species some times develop enormous numbers, thereby causing severe damage to eucalypts. Our present limited knowledge suggests that the others rarely, if ever, develop very high numbers, although considerable fluctuations in population density occur both in space and in time. By suitably arranged field observations, a number of factors have been examined in a preliminary way for reaction to density changes on the part of the two most destructive psyllid species, i.e. examined as possible governing factors of population density. The results suggest that both species normally depend on natural enemies for density governance. Efforts are now being made to ascertain which of their natural enemies possess the necessary property of density reaction. The data obtained suggest that, under some conditions at least, none of their numerous encyrtid parasites are density-reactive. Of the other predators, Syrphidae, the larvae of which feed on psyllid nymphs, appear to possess this property in a special form. It seems that adult female syrphids concentrate their oviposition, and consequently their larval stages, in places where the psyllids are most numerous, thus tending to bring psyllid numbers down when and where they become abundant. It will be necessary to continue observations for many more generations of psyllids before conclusive evidence can be obtained on the density-governing powers of both the syrphids and their other natural enemies.69 Work on the otker four subject species has been limited to determinina; their natural enemies, about which little or nothing is known. 8. Locust and Geasshoppee Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) In the 1951-52 Annual Report it was stated that the population of the Australian plague locust (Chortoi- cetes terminifera) has fallen to such a low level in the Bogan-Macquarie outbreak area that swarm founda tion in at least the southern portion of that area could not be expected for some years unless re-population took place from outside. In the spring of 1952-53 the population was still at the very low level of the previous autumn in the vicinity of the Trangie research station. By February, however, rather higher densities were noted in this general area, but nobody was prepared for the widespread appearances of swarms in March and April, which seem to herald the commencement of another outbreak of Chortoicetes after several years of quiescence. The origin of these swarms has not been established, but suspicion centres on the drier western portion of the outbreak area, which may well have obtained crucial additions to their local popula tion from other outbreak areas further to the west and north-west. The experience of the last few months underlines the crucial importance of instituting an adequate patrol service to cover all outbreak areas, so that local multiplication in any danger area will not pass unnoticed. The effect of the new outbreak upon the ecological control experiments at Trangie can only be unfortu nate. The barriers of Atriplex mimviularia had reached the stage where their effect on the local multiplication of locusts could be studied as soon as a significant population of locusts had developed. All the barrier plots have now been invaded by flying swarms entering from outside, and egg-laying has taken place in some of them. The local populations on both barrier plots and control areas have thus been grossly disturbed. It will not be possible to evaluate the situation until the spring, but it is highly probable that tests will now have to be postponed for a consider able period. Recording work on the development of the barriers, and in connexion with the experimental revegetation of \" scalds \", as a possible means of reducing the extent of the oviposition habitat in an outbreak area, has been continued. Taxonomic work on locusts and grasshoppers has been continued. Increasingly large collections have been reaching the Division of Entomology Museum from all parts of Australia. 9. CoCKCHAFEE INVESTIGATIONS. (Division of Entomology.) General taxonomy of miscellaneous scarah_ species was continued. Trapping records were maintained from September to April. Rearing work enabled further correlations to be made between larval types and identified adult material. Further studies are in progress on the effect onAphodius howitti of olimatic factors of natural soil- borne diseases. 10. Red-legged Eaeth Mite Investigations. (a) Control in the Field with DDT.\u2014Evidence has indicated that sheep grazing on the dry pastures treated with DDT adversely affected the residual qualities of the DDT, prohabiy by burying much of it beneatb the soil surface out of reach of the mite.The general conclusion to be drawn from all the field experiments with DDT is that a very satisfactory control of the earth mite can be achieved by proper application. Generally speaking, late summer treat ments have been unsatisfactory and, where possible, the insecticide, either in dust or spray form, should be applied immediately after the first mites hatch from the oversummering eggs. Where it is not possible to get machinery on to the land because of wet conditions, aircraft can be employed with equally good results. The recommended rate of application is ^ Ib./acre of pp'-DDT. (h) Experiments with Other Insecticides.\u2014Further observations on small plots have indicated that para- thion, chlordane, and aldrin are not effective against the earth mite, whereas dioldrin has an effect approach ing closely that of DDT. The latter, however, is still the outstanding insecticide. A field experiment is now being conducted with dieldrin. (c) Effect of the Mite on Pasture Production.\u2014This experiment has now been running for two complete seasons. The results in the second year closely follow those of the first year and there has been no indication as yet of any marked cumulative effect of mite attack. In the first year, eradication of the mite by DDT treatment resulted in a 63 per cent, increase in sub terranean clover yield, a 32 per cent, increase in grasses, a 21 per cent, increase in Erodium, a 12 per cent, decrease in capeweed, and a 9 per cent, increase in total yield. The increase in subterranean clover was highly significant and the increase in total yield was also significant. In the second year the mite-free areas showed an increase in subterranean clover yield of 55 per cent., a 28 per cent, increase in grasses, a 19 per cent, increase in Erodium, a 35 per cent, decrease in capeweed, and a 17 per cent, increase in total yield. The increa.^e in subterranean clover yield was again highly significant. The increase in grass yield was significant, as was also the decrease in capeweed. The experiment is being 'continued. 11. Luoeene Flea Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Control in the Field.\u2014Following the highly successful experiments in 1952, parathion can now be recommended for the control of this pest. Applications at rates as loiv as J pint/acre of 20 per cent, emulsion \u2014by means of a low-volume boom spray\u2014achieved almost 100 per cent, kill of lucerne fleas present at the time of treatment. However, this insecticide has little or no residual effect at this concentration, and any eggs present during spraying will later hatch without inter ference and initiate a fresh infestation. Ideally, there fore, treatment should be carried out early in the season after all oversummering eggs have hatched and before any second-generation eggs have been laid. If this cannot be done, two treatments may be necessary. This insecticide is highly toxic to stock and to humans, and great care must be exercised in its use. However, owing to the very small amount which is applied, there is practically no danger to grazing stock, which can be reintroduced into the paddock within a week or possibly earlier. Parathion alone will not achieve an adequate control of the earth mite, should this pest also be present, but the addition of 1 pint/acre of 20 per cent. DDT emulsion will ensure the control of both pests. (fh) Lucerne Flea-Bdellid Mite Ecology.\u2014Two areas have been chosen and pegged out this year for a study of the relation between the lucerne flea and its predator, the bdellid mite, The earth mite will also be included70 in tJiese observations and interactions between the three groups investigated. It is proposed also to map the distribution of the bdeddid mite species over as wide an area as j)ossible. Life-history studies of both lucerne fleas and bdellid mites will be carried out where possible. 12. Insects and Vieusbs. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Viruses Attaching Insects.\u2014A new virus disease of a pasture caterpillar Pterolocera amplicornis has been found in the vicinity of Canberra. This virus causes the formation of \" polyhedra \" in the fat-body and other tissues of the larva, and electron micrographs taken at the Division of Industrial Chemistry have revealed the virus particles within the polyhedra. Similar viruses attacking insects in Canada and the United States of America have been used successfully for insect control; it is hoped that further work will permit their evaluation in insect control under Aus tralian conditions. (b) Viruses Affecting Plants.\u2014Further data have been obtained about the transmission of rugose leaf curl, the name proposed for the new disease of carrot, tomato, lucerne, and other plants, previously reported. The leafhopper vector of this virus, Axistroagallia torrida Evans (previously placed in the genus Nehela) is widespread in Australia, but is thought to be an introduced species. The virus is transmitted by a female leafhopper to about 40 per cent, of her progeny. This attribute of transovarial infection is very unusual, and has only been recorded previously for three other viruses. Rugose leaf curl has been transmitted either by .1. torrida or by grafting to sixteen species of plants belonging to eight families. ISTo symptoms could be detected on potato, egg plant, pepper, silver beet, or wild sage. The virus was flrst isolated from A. torrida collected in the vicinity of Canberra. A second isola tion has now been made from insects collected from Hawkesbury, ISTew South Wales. A virus-free leaf hopper colony has not so far been obtained. Several colonies, thought to be virus-free, produced no symptoms on indicator plants on which they fed, but their progeny produced the disease without access to viruliferous plants. _(c) Transmission of Myxomatosis and Related Viruses.\u2014Tests in collaboration with the Australian Rational University have now shown that cowpox in rabbits, ectromelia in mice, and fibroma in rabbits can be transmitted by mosquitoes. Similarly, transmission by mosquitoes under laboratory conditions of myxoma mutants has been demonstrated, and is now being studied extensively. Preliminary indications are that certain mutants of myxoma are less likely to spread under field conditions than the more virulent parent strain. {d) Physiology of Virus Vectors.\u2014Two projects have been studied. One, concerned with the mechanism by which aphids transmit plant viruses, has involved an examination of the effects of starvation on aphid physiology. Periods of starvation of 24 hours did not appear to affect the production of saliva, the rate of penetration of stylets into plant tissues, the production of digestive enzymes, or the amount of material ingested. Starvation for 24 hours did, however, in fluence the behaviour of the insects to an extent that is probably sufficient to account for the effects of starva tion on virus transmission. The second problem arose from reports on changes invector efficiency following wounding of the midgut.Rothing was known of the other effects of such gutwounds or the rate of healing of these wounds. A comparative study of the healing of gut wounds has shown that, in a leafhopper and a mosquito, healing takes place slowly by comparison with the process in the cockroach; several interesting differences in the mechanisms by which healing occurs have been revealed. 13. Teemitb Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) Testing of the relative resistance of timbers and constructional materials has continued, using the standard laboratory testing technique. Altogether 512 test colonies were installed, comprising 490 of Nasutitermes exitiosus and 22 of Coptotermes lacteus. The reduced number of test colonies compared with the previous year was due largely to difficulties in obtain ing some of the test samples of various commercial timbers. Work was continued in attempting to develop a standard laboratory colony technique for Mastotermes daru'iniensis. The more important test results were (1) the addition of a low percentage of pentachloroiihenol to a locally manufactured hardboard produced a board with high resistance to termite attack, (2) the order of decreasing resistance of six commercial timbers (based on tests of .10 trees of each species) was Syncarpia laiirifolia, .h'acah/ptiis crebra, E. tereticornis, E. paniculata, E. micrantha, E. grandis. The normal inspection and maintenance of field tests of tirnbers and preservative treatments around mound colonies of N. exitiosus and C. lacteus were carried out. The annual examination of soil poisoning tests showed that both creosote and 5 per cent, pentachloro- phenol (both used at the rate of 0.5 gal./cu. ft. soil),which had given complete protection against N. exitiosus attack for four years, began to break down in the fifth year. Five per cent, sodium pentachloro- phenate and 10 per cent, sodium arsenite have eachgiven complete protection for four years and 5 per cent. DDT for three years. In similar tests against C. lacteus, 5 per cent. DDT, o_ per cent, pentachlorophenol, and creosote have allgiven _ complete protection for at least two years. .'Vdditional soil tests including creosote, 5 per cent.DDT, 5 per cent, pentachlorophenol, 5 per cent, sodium pentachlorophenate, and 2 per cent, chlordane havebeen installed in the Eiverina, where attack frenchi, 0. series of termites were receivedfor identification during the past year. 14. Ant Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) (a) Argentine Ant.\u2014A conference of entomologists was convened at the request of the Agricultural Counciland held in Canberra on 24th and 25th June, 1952 toconsider the possibility of eradication in large areas.The conference agreed that it had been found possibleto clear experimental areas of Argentine ants at lelatively small cost; and to provide more conclusiveevidence it recommended that a large-scale eradication campaign be carried out in Sydney where the infested area was estimated to be only l-J square miles. Follow-ing discussions between the Commonwealth \"and Rew South_ Wales Governments, agreement was reachedearly m Rovember that the State and the local govern ment bodies affected by the ant would bear the cost of the campaign and the Commonwealth would makeavailable the Organization's technicians and equipmentto work in co-operation with State entomologists. From previous experiments it was considered thatone application of 60 gal./acre of 2 per cent, chlordane spray, applied by trained labour, would remove the71 immediate danger and possibly eradicate the pest from the Sydney area. It was envisaged that some spot treatment would be necessary as a follow-up treatment for eradication. The first step in the treatment was to spray around ail infested areas to prevent the Argentine ant spread ing while the general treatment was in progress. A total of 1,627 gallons of spray was used on the border treatments. The intensive treatment began at Lid- combe, Xew South Wales, on loth December, 1952. Spray operators were recruited from Sydney University, students who were on long vacation. During the summer of 1952-53 additional infested areas were found and 41 separate infestations totalling 2^ square miles had been surveyed by June, 1953. The infesta tions were as far apart as Eosehill, Marouhra, Miller's Point, and George's Kiver, threatening an area of over 100 .sijuare niilc.s of cdty and suburban properties south of the Parramatta Eiver. The total area sprayed from 15th December, 1952, until the work closed down for the winter on Sth June, 1953, was 1,161 acres. A total of 73,040 gallons of 2 per cent, chlordane spray was applied, an average of 62.8 gal./acre. The amount of spray applied and the method of application varied from suburb to suburb. An area of approximately 300 acres remained unsprayed when the work closed down for the winter. Experiments in co-operation with the Western Aus tralian Departments of Agriculture and Health were continued during the year; in Albany, applications of 2 per cent, chlordane spray to strips of Taylorina (Psoralea pinnata L.) swamp failed to eradicate the Argentine ant. An examination of the area was made and it was found that within the dense growth of Taylorina the Argentine ants do not trail to the same extent as in areas where trees are less dense. A comparative test of sprays containing 0.5 and 1.0 per cent, aldrin, 0.5 and 1.0 per cent, dieldrin, 2 per cent, chlordane, and 2 per cent. DDT was begun in March, 1953, at Shenton Park, Western Australia. Th ree replications of each of the six treatments were sprayed, each plot being six house blocks. Examina tions one and two months after treatment suggest that dieldrin and aldrin may prove just as effective as (dilordane, at a lower concentration. An experiment begun at Shenton Park, Western Australia, in December, 1951, has shown that sprays containing 2 per cent, dieldrin at the rate of 50 gal./acre completely controlled the Argentine ants within the treated area and for at least fifteen months prevented the establishment of nests in the treated Idocks by ants from neighbouring areas. (&) Meat Ants.\u2014The series of colonies of the meat ant (Iridomyrmex detectus Sm.) treated in the summer of 1951-52 with dusts containing 2 per cent. DDT, 2 per cent, chlordane, 2 per cent, aldrin, and 2 per cent, dieldrin at a standard rate of ^ oz. dust to each entrance hole were kept under observations during the summer of 1952-53. DDT dust reduced the population after treatment, but ants were present in all nests and populations increased with time. The DDT treatments were significantly inferior to the chlordane, aldrin, and dieldrin. The nests treated with chlordane and aldrin were_ still free of ants eighteen months after treatment, despite attempts to repopulate the treated nest sites hy ants from neighboiiring colonies; the nest site of one of the four treated with dieldrin dust was occupied by a small invading colony fifteen months later. The development of incipient eolonies of the meat ant was again studied after a spring nuptial flight on 29th October, 1952. One hundred and fifty sites were pegged and colonies were dug out at regular intervals to study brood development. The incipientcolonies of this series followed the same pattern as a previous series studied after a spring flight in 1951, but workers occurred earlier. The first workers were found at 77 days and the first entrance holes to be opened up were noted at 97 days after the nuptial flight. During the summer months there was again a high mortality of the females founding colonies. (c) Harvester Ants affecting Germination of Forest Trees.\u2014Ants of several genera in Australia, chiefly Fheidole, Monomorium, Meranoplus, and Melophorus, collect seeds for food and in some areas they do much to prevent the germination of seeds of forest trees. In addition, other species of ants collect fruits of trees for nest building and mechanically affect germination. In co-operation with the Australian Forestry School, a preliminary experiment has been carried out to study the efl'ect of a 2 per cent, chlordane cover spray on the germination of seeds of eucalypts. However, conditions were unusually favourable for seed germination, and the results were inconclusive. 15. G.vTKRPiLi.jiRS OF Pastuees axd Eiei.d Orops. (Division of Entomology.) Studies have been continued on the identity, distribu tion, and seasonal occurrence of several injurious cutworms and armjuvorms (jSToctuidae) in Australia. It has been established that two species of Heliothis have previously been confused in Australia with n. iirmigera, a pest of vegetables and field crops hitherto believed to have a world-wide distribution. In this country H. armigera appears, to be confined to the roastal and sub-coastal areas of Hew South \"Wales and Queensland and possibly also to the northern part of the Horthern Territory. An indigenous species, H. punctigera, occurs throughout the Commonwealth, with the possible exception of coastal Queensland north of Rockhampton. Where it occurs, II. armigera is an irnjmrtant pe.=t of tomatoes, maize, tobacco, and cotton each year. Outstanding attacks by H. punctigera are less frequent but it is the major insect pest of linseed, and also causes severe losses in tomato, tobacco, pea, and lucerne crops. There are also numerous reports of attacks on stone and pome fruits in the Murrumbidgee irrigation Area, and in South and Western Australia. In southern Australia, armyworm outbreaks in pastures and field crops have usually been ascribed to Persectania ewingii, which has also been regarded as the main armyworm pest in Hew Zealand. A study of the identity and distribution of P. ewingii has shown that two species, which differ considerably in their ecology, occur in southern Australia and are probably both responsible for damage to pasture and cereal crops. P. ewingii alone occurs in Tasmania where serious attacks on cereal crops have frequently been reported. There it causes most concern in the summer months. In southern Victoria severe outbreaks also occurred in December, 1952. Although late winter attacks in the Riverina and north-western Victoria were apparently due principally to this species, outbreaks of a second imdescribed species of Persectania at times occur in this area. The latter species appears to be the more important armyworm in Western Australia, attacking crops in the wheat belt. Heither of these species are believed to occur in Hew Zealand, where a native species P. aversa has previously been confused with P. ewingii. Three important cutworms are responsible for damage to pastures and field crops in eastern Australia. In Queensland the more important species appear to be Euxoa radians and Agrotis ypsilon. Both of these arealao_ injurious in Hew South Wales. Damage by A. ypsilon is probably largely confined to the coastal areasnorth of Sydney. E. radians and another species, J. infusa, are much more widely distributed in thisState but, whereas the form.er is usually a pest in the72 late spring and summer months, outbreaks of the latter occur in late winter and early spring. In 1952 larvae of A. infusa were widespread in winter pastures on the tablelands, the western slopes, and in the Eiverina where they fed on Mfidicago spp. and annual composites. In northern Hew South Wales and on the Darling Downs linseed crops were severely attacked in late winter. The resulting adults were very numerous and large southerly migrations of the moths occurred in the spring and early summer in southern Hew South Wales and Victoria. During migration the moths were conspicrious even in the daytime feeding at Eucalyptus and other blossoms. As in the previous two summers, immense numbers of the moths migrated to the moun tains of south-eastern Hew South Wales and western Victoria to acstivato gregariously in crevices and small caves in certain extensive rock outcrops. Observations during the summer on such assemblages of A. infusa moths at an altitude of 6,000 feet in the Australian Capital Territory have shown that spring migration and aestivation is an annual event. A small proportion of the moths become intensely active just after sunset and just before sunrise, when a randomized flight over the tops of the rock outcrop occurs. During these flights sugary food'is not normally sought. Hone of the moths copulate until aestivation is completed, the ovaries remaining in an immature state. This year migration in a northerly direction from these camps had begun in February and continued until early April, when the largest movements to the north and west were observed and the aestivating populations completely dispersed. It has been concluded that this habit of. spring- migration and gregarious aestivation, culminating in a return migration to the breeding ground in the autumn, serves an important function in the ecology of A. infusa. The dicotyledon food plants of the larvae grow profusely in the winter months when favourable rains occur. In the summer perennial grasses, which do not provide suitable food, are normally dominant on the heavy grey clny soils favoured by the larvae. As the high summer temperatures of the breeding areas do not permit adult aestivation, the migratory habit has apparently arisen as an adaptation to these unfavour able conditions. The relatively low temperatures and high humidities of the aestivation shelters permit the moths emerging in the spring to live during the summer months and reinfest their breeding grounds in the autumn. 16. Insect Pests ce Stoked Pboddcts. (Division of Entomology.) When grain is stored under hermetic conditions any insect pests present are controlled by a change in the proportion of the main constituents of the inter- granular air. Oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide produced by the insects until respiration is no longer possible. In order to study the effect of these gases, and to arrive at a closer understanding of the events that occur in the field, equipment has been built to provide continuous streams of any desired mixtures of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Exposing grain pests to these mixtures has enabled the separate and combined effects of these to be deter mined. Using grain weevils, Calandra granaria L., astest insects, it^ has been shown that, under otherwise optimum conditions, concentrations of carbon dioxidein excess of 30 per cent, or oxygen concentrations below 2 per cent, are necessary to kill the insects. Some progress has been made towards the development of an insect-proof packing material. Very finelydivided^ hard minerals bonded to a paper backing with a plastic adhesive have proved resistant to termites inthe laboratory. The termite Nasutiternles exitiosus (Hill) was used in \"penetrate or starve\" tests owing to its availability. Tests on the effects of radio-frequency fields on insects showed that the method was successful on a small scale, but that it would be economically useful for only a specialized range of commodities. 17. Insecticide Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) The new insecticides, as well as the old, are effective in controlling certain species of insects, but relatively ineffective against others. There is abundant evidence for this specificity of action, which is often exploited in controlling pest species with materials harmless to beneficial ones, but comparatively little is known of the underlying reasons why some species are susceptible and others resistant. This indicates the need for intensive study of the factors determining the sus ceptibility of insects to chemical control measures. The need has been emphasized during the last few years by the development, in various countries, of insecticide- resistant strains of certain species. During the year further environmental and biotic factors have been studied in the housefiy-DDT system. Using modified testing precedures, which take into account the sex and body weight of the test insects, it has been possible to trace the variation in susceptibility to DDT which accompanies aging of the insects, and to study the effect of the age of the parents on the susceptibility of their progeny. Some further aspects of the testing procedure, such as the use of anaesthetics to facilitate the handling of the insects and the temp erature to which the insects are exposed during and after dosing, have also been examined for their effects on the insects' response to insecticide treatment. The stage has been reached, in the study of this system, where each of the controllable factors likely to increase the variability of response has been evaluated in dependently and there is evidence of increased precision in the testing method. A detailed study of the exact nature of the dosage-response curves is in progress. 18. Other Investigations. (Division of Entomology.) (ft) Entomological Survey of Cocas Islands.\u2014This survey was carried out at the request of the Department of Civil Aviation to obtain information about the insects occurring on the Cocos-Keeling Islands before the new air route from South Africa was opened to ensure that both plant and animal quarantine measures on this route were effective. Some 2,000 specimens were collected from the several islands in the group. .4 study of these has shown that the majority of the species represented already occur in Australia. Two notable exceptions are the rhinocerus beetle, Oryctes rhinocems (a serious pest of coco-nuts), and Agrilus marmnrpvs, a small buprestid beetle which attacks citrus in Malaya and Indonesia. Aedes (Stcgomyia) albopirtus, which is capable of trnn.smitting dengue fever, filariasis, Japanese B. encephalitis, and yellow fever, is the more common of the two mosquitoes on the islands; it is also present in the northern part of Australia. There is no evidence, however, that any of the diseases mentioned are present in the Gocos Islands. _ The report of the survey has been issued for restricted distribution by the Department of Civil Aviation as \" Aviation Medicine Memorandum Ho. 14\u2014Entomo logical Survey of Cocos-Keeling Islands\" by T. G. Campbell. (h) Lyctus (Powder-post Beetle) Investigations.\u2014 Work has continued on the rearing of Lyctus larvae on a synthetic food medium. The most important findings have been; (1) sucrose in the diat may be replaced73 satisfactorily by a if starck in tke diet is replaced by amylose; (3) tlie total metkanol extract of either Melicope australasica or Cryptocarya glaucescens (two resistant species) is toxic to Lyctus larvae when added to tke synthetic diet; (4) tke testing of various fractions of these extracts has not yet revealed tke toxic principle. In co-operation with tke Division of Forest Products a survey is being made of the Lyctus susceptibility of a number of Queensland timbers. At present, samples of more than 30 timber species are in test (see Chapter XIV, Section 6 {h)). (c) Export of Leis conformis to Egypt.\u2014Tke Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture requested supplies of this beneficial coccinellid, and two consignments were forwarded by air in October and FTovember, 1952. It is understood that a laboratory colony has been established in Egypt from these consignments. 19. Taxonomy. (Division of Entomology.) Work lias continued on tke Ckalcidoidea, tke largest group of parasitic wasps. It must continue for many years but, after tke classification of tke whole super- family has been considered, it should be possible to revise individual families. Further progi-ess has been made on tke Diptera (flies), and work on tke taxonomy of tke Callipkoridae, an important group of blowflies, has been intensifled. A revision of tke Xemestrinidae is in press and a revision of tke Apioceridae is almost ready for publica tion. Tke Australian locusts and grasshoppers are being revised by an authority on tke group in tke United States of America. The second volume of this com prehensive work is now in press. Taxonomic work has been done in certain groups of tke Lepidoptera, in particular tke genus Heliothis. Other families being studied are tke Blattidae (cock roaches) and certain of tke Hemiptera (bugs). X. WILD LIFE. 1. General. Early in 1949 tke Organization's Wild Life Survey Section was established to undertake a study of tke life history, habits, and general ecology of native or introduced mammals and birds that were of importance to Australia by virtue of tke fact that they were economic pests. It rvas, however, in due course, also to develop an active interest in animals which were beneficial, calling for conservation and encouragement and not eradication and control. Wildlife Survey Section.\u2014As in previous years, tke greater part of tke Section's activities has been concentrated on tke problem of tlie rabbit, and particu larly on tke virus disease, myxomatosis, and its epi demiology. During tke past year, however, it was considered desirable to resume work on certain lines of \" direct\" control, to which preliminary attention had been given during tke early years of tke Section but which were discontinued in 1951 owing to tke calls of tke myxomatosis investigations. One reason for this decision was a recognition of tke limitations of myxo matosis, which even in favoured areas needs to be backed up and followed up by conventional methods of rabbit destruction. In furtherance of tke aim of extending tke Section's inve.stigations to animals which are beneficial to tke agricultural economy, a start has been made in tke study of tke ibis.2. IIabbit In-vestioations. (Wildlife Survey Section.) (a) Myxomatosis.\u2014For a jjeriod of twelve to eighteen months after December, 1950, when myxo matosis broke out in epidemic form in south-eastern Australia, tke primary need was for a definition of tke broad picture of its spread. This called mainly for extensive surveys, during tke course of which muck valuable, if circumstantial, evidence was obtained on tke insects responsible for transmission of tke disease in tke field and other factors having an important bearing on tke general epidemiological picture. During 1952-53 tke emphasis was shifted from extensive survey work to more intensive studies on special aspects of tke myxomatosis problem. In areas which had benefited by high kills during tke summer of 1951-52, as elsewhere, rabbit populations were built up as a result of breeding. During 1952-53 myxomatosis accounted for more than this increase, and in addition, tke disease spread and performed well in areas where it had not been in evidence previously. As a result of this, tke rabbit situation in tke four mainland States (Queensland, FTew South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia) is more satisfactory than at any time within living memory. Tke generally low level of rabbit infestation has enabled tke pastures and crop.s to respond to, and tke stock to take advantage of, the favourable .season, which has been reflected significantly in tke country's wool clip and wheat harvest. The decrease of rabbit damage to crops has been particularly noticeable in tke Mallee, where many indirect effects of low rabbit numbers have been noticed, e.g. time, labour and finance normally directed to rabbit control have been available for constructive work on properties. Tke production figures of a dairy farm in tke Murray Valley, where the state of tke pastures and tke degree of rabbit infestation have been kept under continual observation for a three-year period, have shown that butterfat production has been doubled since tke elimination of rabbits, brought about by myxomatosis and energetic follow-up measures by the landholder. In Western Australia and Tasmania the performance of myxomatosis has so far been rather disappointing, though useful local kills have been recorded. In view of the vigorous and widespread \"seeding\" of the virus by the State authorities, this must be accepted as a reflection of a relatively unsatis factory insect vector position; but the experience in otber States of tke Commonwealth suggests that it is by no means impossible that the disease might make a useful showing during certain years. During 1951-52, the first indications were obtained that some sort of adjustment between the host (rabbit) and parasite (virus) was taking place in the field. During the past year, although it has no significant effect on the overall very satisfactory situation, this process of adjustment had obviously made a consider able advance. Rabbits that bad recovered from the disease appeared in many districts in numbers sufficient to excite comment; and in three or four areas where special investigations were carried out evidence of a markedly reduced case-mortality rate was obtained {see beloiu). Work on tke insect vectors of myxomatosis has been carried out in tke Murray Valley and to a lesser extent in the Moree area and in certain parts of South Aus tralia. In northern Xew South Wales circumstances were not favourable for the specific incrimination of the insects responsible for myxomatosis transmission; the high kills recorded in the Moree area were the result, not of typical explosive outbreaks, but of low- intensity activity prolonged over several months. In74 tlin drier jrarts of South Australia, some doubt also i-emain.s as to the identity of the insects responsible for transmission, the evidence pointing to mosquitoes, sand-flies (Simuliidae and Seratopogonidae) and stick- fast fleas {Echidnophaga spp.) playing the vector role in varying combinations. The findings in the Mnrray Valley have been much more clear cut. Further studies of the mosquito. Anopheles annulipes, have confirmed its importance as a myxomatosis vector. Precipitin tests carried out by Mr. D. J. Lee, of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in Sydney, and the isolation of the virus by Professor F. Fenner, of the Australian Hational University, from mosquitoes collected in outbreak areas have incriminated A. (inmilipe.s almost to the exclusion of all other mosquito .species occurring in the region. Over an extensive belt of country, ranging from South Australia to the highlands of Hew South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, spring myxo matosis activity was correlated with the prevalence of simuliids (chiefly Anstrosimulium furiosum), which occurred locally in plague numbers. Field observations pointed to the fact that these insects may have been i-esponsible for spreading the disease into previously unaffected areas, e.g. on to high ridges and into the dry country lying north and south of the Murray. Evidence was obtained of the dispersal of simuliids, in large numbers, for distances of over 35 miles from their bre'eding places. Observations in this region also di.selosed the interesting fact that the population of Anopheles annulipes persisted, harbouring in rabbit burrows, for two months after all surface breeding water had dried up. Myxomatosis vector investiga tions of the Wildlife Survey Section have revealed a degree of mobility in blood-sucking insects of a much greater order than previous work, both in Australia and overseas, had suggested. The appearance and progress of some sort of adjust ment between the rabhit and the myxoma virus, leading to a reduced case-mortality rate, is obviously of major significance in relation to the continued successful exploitation of the disease as an agent of rabhit control. Arrangements are therefore being made for the inten sive investigation of this phenomenon in co-operation with Professor F. Fenner and his colleagues of the x\\.ustralian jSTational University. The work will involve serological surveys, the testing of virus strains \" captured \" in the field, and detailed rabhit population studies in selected areas to obtain more precise data on mortalities and the age structure of the population than the field ohservations to date have been able to furnish. This work may be said to have heen initiated by the special investigations, mentioned above, in the three or four areas where a markedly reduced case- mortality rate had become evident last season. Here the results of field observations and serological tests carried out in Professor Fenner's laboratory indicated an infection rate of nearly 100 per cent, followed by an overall mortality of the order of only 50 per cent. The conditions associated with some of these anomalous outbreaks suggested that the most probable explanation of the reduced mortality was the local appearance of a strain of the virus with a lowered virulence. That the appearance and spread of such variant strains may be an important factor in the rabbit-virus adjustment that is taking place in the field is suggested by the recent isolation, from an ai'ea of disease activity near Canberra, of a strain of the virus that has been shown by passage in wild and laboratory rabbits to be definitely attenuated. Pabbits infected by this strain have recovered after an illness lasting 40-50 days (in the normal course of the disease death occurs on the eleventh to the fourteenth day). One sick animal was shown to be infectious for 56 days after having con tracted the disease.(b) Biological Studies.\u2014During the course of the examination of the large samples that have been col lected periodically from a number of areas in con nexion with myxomatosis, the following information on rabbit reproduction in the eastern Eiverina has been obtained. Breeding in this region during the past two years has been almost entirely limited to the wetter months (April-Hovember). Young females born in April-May begin breeding towards the end of the year (October-Hovember), young males do not breed until the following season. The litter size varies from about four at the beginning of the season to seven at the end. This is apparently a function of age, since young rahbits examined always had small litters and at the commencement of each breeding season the breed ing population is predominantly young. The data collected point to the fact that there is an almost com- tdete turnover in the rabbit population in one year. Very few individuals seem to live longer than two years. Reproduction and population studies are being intensi fied, as it is now recognized that reliable information on such points as kitten mortality and mean length of life under conditions of high and low population density is needed for the clarification of certain prob lems of myxomatosis epidemiology. The survey of endo- and ectoparasites of the rahbit was continued as opportunity offered. A prelifninary field study of refection (namely, the consumption by rabbits of a special form of faeces passed during pieriods of inactivity, a process which is the physiological equivalent of rumination in sheep or cattle) has been carried out. (c) Miscellaneous Rabbit Control Investigations.\u2014 In the early years of the Section some preliminary .studies of poisons were carried out which showed that sodium fluoroacetate (which was developed in America primarily as a rat poison, and is popularly known as \" 1080 \") held distinct promise as an agent for the destruction of rabbits. During the past summer the Tasmauian Department of Agriculture organized a large-scale trial campaign using this poison, and an officer of the \"Wildlife Section was appointed to co-operate with the State authorities in the work. It is as yet too early to pass a verdict on the results of this campaign, but they have on the whole been very encouraging and mnch useful information on poisoning- practice has been gained. Attention has been given to the development of teehnique.s for the study of certain fundamental aspects of rabbit poisoning, such as \" free feeding\", furrow placement, and rabbit behaviour in relation to baits of different kinds. Field trials of the power fumigator, developed by the Section to hlow an atomized mixture of chloropicrin and oil into rahhit warrens, were carried out on a grazing property in the Mudgee, Hew South Wales, district. Successful results confirmed the conclusion based on earlier tests that the machine had definite promise where it would not be practicable to use other perhaps cheaper and quicker methods of control. An experiment was initiated with the object of gaining a balanced understanding of the problems of practical rabbit control under present-day conditions. With the co-operation of Mr. B. Parkinson, of \" Ben Buckley \", Mudgee, Hew South Wales, a field officer of the Section has been actively associated with the cam paign of rabbit eradication that is being carried out on the property. The rabbit situation (which has heen mitigated considerably by the effects of myxomatosis) was asses-sed paddock by paddock, the most suitable control measures decided on, and their efficacy and cost assessed. The results obtained to date indicate that the first and main attack on the rabhits infe.sting a grazing property can be carried out on a contract basis. With this system the work can be done rapidly75 and without interference to normal i-outine. It has become obvious, however, that the final \" mopping-up \" phase can he of long duration, but it is vital to the success of the whole scheme. 3. Kangaeoo Investigations. (Wildlife Survey Section.) Field tests were continued on the use of sodium fluoroacetate (\" 1080 \") as a component of salt licks to curtail the excessive population of euros (Macropiis rohvsivs) in the pastoral country of the Eoebourne Tablelands, Western Australia. Results are yet incon clusive as to the economic efficacy of the method, and the stage has now been reached where precise experi ments on captive animals and more direct observations of feeding animals are necessary, together with general ecological data. The investigations will be carried out in co-operation with the State Department of Agriculture. 4. Mutton Bird Investigations. (Wildlife Survey Section.) The joint investigations with the Tasmanian Fauna Board on the economic biology of the mutton bird (J'ulfinus tenuirosLris) were continued in the Furneaux Group and extended to Trefoil Island, at the western end of Bass Strait. In addition to the annual documenting of the breed ing population at Fisher Island, the reseai'ch islet near Lady Barren, Flinders Island, an intensive observa tion was Uiade of the first part of the life cycle of the breeding birds. The adult birds on Fisher Island were studied from the time of the arrival of the first birds (in the third week of September) until the hatching of the eggs (in mid-January). Gonad samples for corresponding histological studies were collected from neighbouring islands. During the 1952-53 season 340 adult birds were checked in on Fisher Island, compared with 325 birds in the 1951-52 season and 290 in the 1950-51 season. A notable observation was of a bird, Ro. 107,06, which was ringed as a fledgling in March, 1950, on Fisher Island and recaptured on the same island on 16th January, 1953. There was no evidence, however, that it was a local breeder. 5. Ducks and Rice Cultivation. (Wildlife Survey Section.) The problem of the depredations of wild ducks in the irrigated rice crops was brought to the fore in 1951-52, when drought conditions in the inland led to a concentration of water-birds in the irrigation areas and many complaints from rice-farmers of damage done to their crops. The main work has been done in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, but the Wakool area was visited at four strategic times in the growth of the crop. During the 1952-53 season the number of river ducks was about normal in the area, but the number of nianed geese (wood duck) was below normal. All species studied (black duck, teal, shoveller, hardhead, mailed goose, and tree duck) eat rice freely as planted grain and in the head. The maned goose also grazes on the young plant. In contrast to the 1951-52 season, when abnormal numbers of maned geese were present in the irrigation areas, the effects of duck visitations to the rice crops were negligible. Examinations of gizzards revealed that the principal foods of ducks in the rice fields are in the following order of preference: (i) Echinochloa crus-galli (barn yard grass, the most important weed of the rice fields) ; (ii) rice; (iii) Rumex sp. (dock, another weed of the rice fields); and (iv) Polygorum sp. (smartweed).6. Ibis Investigations. (Wildlife Survey Section.) There is a possibility that future developments of water conservation, which involve the construction of dams in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling system, may jeopardize the breeding-grounds of several species of water-birds. Among these, the straw-necked ibis (ThresJdornis spinicollis) and the white ibis (T. molucca) are considered to be important predators of locusts and of insects generally. An investigation to determine the role of these birds in the natural control of locusts and to define measures for the preservation of their breeding haunts is under consideration. Some preliminary observations of breeding distribu tion and behaviour were made in the Macquarie marshes, on the Murray, and in marshes on the Lachlan River. Preparations to study breeding requirements next season have been made on the Murray, and a survey of breeding distribution and numbers is planned. Observation of feeding habits and examina tion of stomach contents indicate a close dependence on freshwater invertebrates during the breeding season; Orthopteraj &c., of drier habitats appear when post- breeding dispersal of the birds has begun. The food preferences of ibises throughout the year will be surveyed more fully. 7. Bird Ringing. (Wildlife Survey Section.) The establishment of a FTational Bird Ringing Scheme has been under discussion by the Organization and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union for several years. It was decided that the provision of this service could properly be undertaken by the Wildlife Section. Australia is almost unique among the civilized countries of the world in not having an officially sponsored or assisted bird ringing scheme. Ringing for individual recognition is an essential feature of almost every scientific bird study. It is already employed by the Australian Rational Antarctic Research Expedition (which uses rings borrowed from the Rew Zealand authorities), and by one or two of the _ Australian States (who have indicated their willingness to participate in a national scheme), andit will be used in all the Section's ornithological investigations. _ Plans were completed during the year for the estab lishment of an Australia-wide bird ringing scheme based on centres at Canberra and Perth. A complete series of numbered metal rings has been ordered, and rings will be supplied to approved persons or societies wishing to carry out studies of birds in Australia. It is hoped that a limited number of rings will be avail able during the coming breeding season, but the whole range of rings will not be received until the end of 1953. In the Furneaux Group of islands, in the Bass Strait, a preliminary study of Cape Barren geese was begun (using rings obtained from Rew Zealand) to obtain data for estimating hunting pressure during the open season. Young birds were ringed on Goose, Rabbit, and Great Dog Islands. The Section is also co-operat ing in a ringing scheme on fairy penguins, initiated by the Rational Museum of Victoria, and employing the new flipper tag. Altogether the Section's officers marked 162 penguins in Bass Strait. XI. URDERDEVELOPED REGIORS. 1. General. Large portions oi Australia and its Territories are underdeveloped or are only very sparsely occupied. Lowrainfall, poor soils, sparse pastures, inadequate water, and great distances from centres of dense populationare some of the factors which have inhibited develop ment. It is essential to understand the problems of76 these areas and where possible to solve them, so that either new developments can take place or the present level of production can he protected from the adverse effect of unwise exploitation. The development of northern Australia has been slow in comparison with that of the southern and eastern State.3. Over 100 years have elapsed since the first settlements in the north, yet vast areas remain unproductive and are still only sparsely populated. In 1946, the Governments of the Commonwealth, Queensland, and Western Australia founded the northern Australia Development Committee with the object of formulating^ a policy of development for northern Australia. The former Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was requested to indicate a series of land surveys of underdeveloped regions in order that this development potential might be more accurately assessed. In consequence, the northern Australia Regional Survey, established later as the Organization's Land Research and Regional Survey Section, was organized to conduct these regional surveys. Wliilst the work of the Land Research and Regional Survey Section is thus concerned with the sparsely popu lated arid and semi-arid regions of the continent, much complementary work is carried out by other Divisions of the Organization on the development of low-producing areas in the less isolated regions.^ The Division of Biochemistry and General Nutrition is investigating problems of plant and animal nutrition on the Coonalpyn Downs, in South Australia (see Chapter III., Section 19), the Plant and Soils Labora tory is studying the wallum country in eastern Queens land (see Chapter III., Section 18), and the Division of Soils is making soil surveys throughout the Com monwealth (see Chapter II.). Allied work is also carried out by the Division of Plant Industry on plant and pasture ecology studies at Trangie, New South Wales, south-western Queensland, and elsewhere (see Chapter III.). Land Research and Regional Survey Section.\u2014This Section has its head-quarters at Canberra and field stations at Katherine, Northern Territory, and Ivanhoe (Kimberley, Western Australia). It has now mapped and surveyed over 200,000 square miles of territory, including the Katherine-Darwin region, the Barkly region, and the Townsville-Bowen region. The surveys take the form of broad-scale ecological studies which determine not only the distribution of the native vegetation but also the possibilities of growth and establishment of introduced crop and pasture species. They include the primary assessment of land-use poten tial, research into problems of agricultural and pastoral development of the arid and semi-arid zones and climatological studies, and also a general topographical survey showing the position of rivers, creeks, swamps, hills,' valleys, and other natural features. The immediate programme of the Section now includes the survev of the Gulf region in Queensland, the West Kimberleys, Alice Springs and Roper River regions of the Northern Territory, and the South-west Channel country and Cape York in Queensland. A unit has been established to commence a long-term survey of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. 2. Regional Sttrvets. (Land Research and Regional Survey Section.) Two regional survey units are now operating, one on the mainland of Australia and one in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. The first unit has been in operation in northern Australia since 1946 and has already completed surveys of the Katherine-Darwin region (27,000 square miles), the Barkly region (120,000 square miles), the Townsville-Bowen region(6,000 square miles) and the Ord-Victoria Rivers region (70,000 square miles). The New Guinea unit has been established within the last year and is about to commence a survey of the Buna region of Papua. The major function of each group is to classify andmap the lands of regions according to surface charac teristics of importance to the determinations of land-use potential. In order to do this studies must be made of the geology, geomorphology, soils, systematic bptany, and plant ecology of each region. Thus each unit con sists of a group of specialist scientific officers covering these respective fields but working together in very clo.se collaboration in the field. Some of these officers are seconded to the Land Research Section from other organizations or other establishments of C.S.I.R.O. To permit large regions to be surveyed and mapped in relatively short periods of time, special techniques have been developed based oh the interpretation of aerial photographs. These techniques involve a study of the origin of different types of country as well as a descrip tion of surface characteristics, and thus the final classi fication of lands has a fundamental basis to which sub sequent information on interpretations may be directly applied. The mapping unit is the land system, which is based on the pattern of topography, soils, and vege tation, the surface features of most direct significance to land use. The second function of each unit is to make the best possible assessment of the possibilities of land use from the information on land characteristics, and from climatic records and records of present or past land use, and by comparison with comparable environments out side the region. This assessment, together with the estimates of areas of each type of country mapped, provides a basis of facts necessary for the formulation of policies concerning land development or conservation. (a) Australian Mainland Survey.\u2014(i) Ord-Victoria Rivers Region.\u2014The region is approximately 70,000 square miles in extent. It includes a large proportion of hilly country of very low pastoral value, par ticularly in the central portion of the region. Thirty- eight land system.s have been described and these have been grouped into thirteen land-use groups. An examination of soils and climate indicates that dryland agriculture may be possible in some of the northern, higher-rainfall areas, where conditions are comparable to those at Katherine, Northern Territory. The survey has mapped areas of \" black soil\" plains, like those of the lower Ord River, along the lower Raines and Victoria Rivers. These would have similar possi bilities for the establishment of an irrigated agriculture if suitable sites for water conservation structures can be found. Smaller but useful areas of lighter-textured levee soils occur along the Wickham River near Vic toria River Downs, along the east .side of the Raines River to the north of Kildurk, and on the Man tinea flats of the lower Ord River. If adequate water sup plies can be obtained such areas may be suitable for the production of high-return crops such as tobacco, fruit, and vegetables. The northern parts of the region have not been greatly developed for pastoral purposes. The major handicaps are tall, coarse pasture.? of low nutritive value, and poor stock management. The central and southern pastoral areas have better pastures and more-developed stock management. The provision of watering points and transport for fat and store stock are major problems retarding more intensive land use. The following maps are being prepared:\u2014 Geology, geomorphology, land system, land-use groups, soils, vegetation, pastures, and field traverses. (ii) Fitzroy River Region.\u2014On the Lennard River the possibilties of water storage are limited by the small catchment and unsuitable rock formations at the dam site. The small areas of levee soils which appear suit able for high-return crops could utilize almost all of11 the water that could be regularly stored. The Margaret River flats have relatively extensive areas of good irrigable soils and it should be possible to con serve a considerable volume of water for irrigation. More hydrological data are required to ascertain the practicability of the establishment of an irrigation project, and agronomic investigations are necessary to deflne the forms of production which would be most suitable. The area warrants more detailed investigation. The natural flooding of the Eitzroy River flats appears to be too unreliable to be utilized as natural irrigation on a broad scale without extensive water control. Major hydrological studies are necessary before the scope of water use in this portion of the region can be defined. The pindan soils near Derby are mostly deep sands and are not likely to support an extensive agriculture dependent upon rainfall alone. The small patches of heavier soils are most suitable for irrigation from underground water supplies but the possibilities of development in this way are small. (iii) Gulf Region, Queensland.\u2014The first season of field work in this region has been commenced. It covers an area of about 110,000 square miles and in cludes the drainage basins of the Leichhardt, Elinders, and Einasleigh Rivers. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 15 inches in the south-western corner to 50 inches in the north-eastern corner. The region has been reasonably well developed for cattle grazing except in the central and northern hilly or sandy \" desert\" country. (6) Papua-New Guinea Survey.\u2014The Hew Guinea unit has now been organized and will begin work in the Buna region. The area covers approximately 2,500 square miles, extending from Mount Lamington and Kokoda north to the mouth of the Mambare River. The region includes the area devastated by the 1952 eruption of Mount Lamington, the lower gently sloping pumice plains, extensive swamp and delta formations near the coast, the Yodda Valley, the rugged hilly country of the Ajura Kijala Range, and parts of the Owen Stanley and Elydrographer Ranges. This area is partly served by roads and is partly accessible by boat. Parts are accessible by foot patrols along tracks and others can only be sampled by traverses through virgin country. Vertical aerial photographs cover portion of the region and the remainder has an incom plete cover by trimetrogon photographs. This first survey in Papua will be largely experi mental, and a period of training of new personnel. The principles developed in the northern Australia surveys will be applied but methods will have to be adapted to Papua conditions. The unit will have experience with a variety of working conditions in this region and it should be able to determine the tech niques most applicable for future work in Papua and Hew Guinea. Officers of various Hew Guinea depart ments are co-operating with the unit both in the organization and supply of equipment and in the field work. 3. Ageicultukal Reseaech in Hoeth Austealia. (Land Research and Regional Survey Section.) (a) Katlierine Research Station.\u2014In addition to research by the Land Research and Regional Survey Section into problems of dryland agriculture, the work of this station includes a programme of testing plant introductions and investigations into the possibilities of tobacco-growing conducted by the Division of Plant Industry (see Chapter III., Section 8). (i) Crops.\u2014In previous years it has been shown that in average seasons satisfactory yields of peanuts,cotton, and grain sorghum should be achieved, but there is considerable seasonal variation. In the seasonjust ended all crops made a promising start but suffered severely from a mid-season dry period which forced early maturity. Wet weather which followed in early April brought about a renewal of growth but was too late to affect yields advantageously. This late wet spell caused considerable damage to crops that were mature. Under the adverse conditions of last season peanuts appeared to have been affected least, sorghum to a major extent, and cotton very severely. Both peanuts and sorghum gave yields up to 1,000 Ib./acre but the cotton crop was reduced to negligible quantities of poor lint by the dry spell and the subse quent wet period while bolls were opening. A pre liminary examination of climatic data suggests that the last two seasons were worse than would normally be expected. A more detailed examination of the data is being made to assess more accurately the expec tation of different kinds of seasons and the likely jiroportion of crop failures. In general, varieties of all three crops, selected as superior in previous seasons, maintained their relative superiority under these adverse conditions. Investiga tions on drought responses of sorghum varieties have indicated that plant height per se is of no importance. When a variety Hegari and its dwarf mutant were grown side by side, the dwarf variety suffered far more from drought than the normal. Of the other crops under investigation, sunflower, a crop which has a reputation for drought resistance, and the fibre plant kenaf have again failed at Katherine this season. Grain pulses (Phaseolus spp.), including an edible variety, produced up to 600 Ib./acre. (ii) Fertilizer and Spacing Experiments.\u2014Experi ments in the 1950-51 wet season indicated that the fertilizer dressing so far tried and the crop spacings adopted were probably suboptimal for good seasons. Experiments on these points, designed to achieve maxi mum production, laid down in the last two subnormal seasons have failed in their objective because water has been limited. Present experiments are planned to determine the fertilizer and spacing practices which are a suitable compromise between the optimum for good seasons and those which are most effective in dry seasons. (iii) Soil Moisture Studies.\u2014Recent droughts havd emphasized the necessity for obtaining maximum utilization of rainfall in subnormal seasons. Attempts have been made to avoid run-off and to get as much of the rain into the soil as possible, through cultivation and tillage methods. Direct water conservation through basin listing has also been attempted. It has been shown that the red earth soils of this region have a very limited range of available water and that the amount of water which can be held in that part of the profile explored by roots is insufficient to carry well-grown plants through a rainless period such as the one that occurred during the recent growing season. The available moisture status of these soils is lower than would be inferred from the mechanical analysis. Rainfall penetration and subsequent utilization have been studied by electrometzdc measurements using gypsum blocks. The collection of water by basin listing did not have any beneficial effects on the growth of a cotton crop, nor did it delay the onset of drought symptoms. (iv) Cultivation and Tillage Practices.\u2014Significant differences have been obtained in the response to cultivation and tillage practices and, in general, the response is related to the differential penetration of early rain. While these red soils are normally free draining internally, they are poorly structured, are very easily reduced to a powder form, and are unstable when wetted. Any form of cultivation which produces a78 bulk of fine material leads to reduced water penetration. The most suitable form of land preparation sepis to be to break up the soil to a depth of about 8 inches, leaving it in the form of large clods, with as little fine material as possible. Subsequent tillage is necessary to produce seed beds and to keep the surface open and receptive to rain, but it should be as dust free as possible. Seed-bed preparation in general poses several problems, the chief one being to get the seed placed on a firm, moist seed bed and adequately covered with soil that will not set so hard that seeds have difiieulty in emerging. With cotton, emergence difficulties have been overcome by hill planting, that is, planting four to six seeds together at intervals of about 1 foot. (v) Disease.\u2014A feature of the past season has been the unusual incidence of disease. Sorghum crops were ruined, at a very late stage in their growth when good crops seemed assured, by \" charcoal rot\" caused by a Sderotium sp. It is well known that plants under acute stress are especially liable to this disease, and this fits the observation (by electrometric measure ments) that the moisture content of the soils carrying sorghum had been reduced to wilting point at the time the disease was first noticed. Sunflowers were attacked by the same organism, and at the same period. Bulk crops of Phaseolus spp., which showed premature senescence as a result of the drought, were badly infected by Phoma sp. Considerable progress has been made in understand ing the peanut disease of the Katherine district. The usual causal organism appears to he the same Sdero tium sp. that attacks soighum and sunflower. Observa tions have shown that the disease may gain access to ripening seed while it is still in the ground and may cause little or no visible external damage to the seed. When such seeds are planted, the organism becomes active and may destroy the seed during germination, or it may take some little time to become lethal and give rise to seedling collapse. In this phase, the disease ap],:ears identical with the \" concealed damage\" or \" hidden disease \" reported in recent years from the United States of America. The pathogen responsible for seed rot or for seedling collapse appears widely distril)uted in the soil and can attack plants at later stages when the disease is referred to as \" crown rot\" ifv \" wilt \". Primary invasions by the Sderotium are in most cases followed, and masked, by heavy infections from secondary fungi such as Aspergilliis spp. Uuts sown in land inoculated with trash from previous diseased crops have shown 70-90 per cent, failure. Considerable protection from soil-borne attack can be obtained by dusting seeds with a fungicidal dust before planting, but such protection is by no means complete. Careful seed selection and storage, protection with fungicidal dust, and increased rates of sowing to ensure good stands, in spite of some emergence failures, have permitted good crops to be obtained from diseased land sown continuously to peanuts for four years. Further studies on the apparent resistance to disease shown in previous years by certain introduced varieties indicate that they may iiot be truly resistant and that their previous freedom from disease may have been due, at least in part, to their relative freedom from internal infection. Investigations on this disease and its related symptoms on other crops are being continued. (vi) Pests.\u2014The adverse season was characterized also by unusual pest problems, most probably connected with the mid-season drought. In normal years, birds can be effectively di.9couraged by dawn and dusk gun patrols, while control of cover on the margins adjacent to cultivation discourages marsupials. This year, how ever, such measures were ineffective and the few surviving crops were heavily damaged by birds and marsupials. In previous years, there has been a jassid problem in cotton only with ratoon crops and ratooningwas abandoned for this reason. This year, however,jassids have become a serious problem on all crops and, unless the jassids are a reflection of the broken season, some control measures must be sought. The widespread occurrence of nematodes has been reported, but no evidence is as yet available as to its effects on crops. (vii) Native Pastures.\u2014Regional surveys carried out by the Section have indicated that only a small proportion of the total area is suitable for intensive agriculture and that, for much of the area, pastoral industries would appear to offer most scope. Work has commenced on an ecological study of the native pastures and on possible practical methods of improv ing their value. The cumulative effect of the reduced rainfall over the last two seasons ha.s been to damage severely many of the native grass species, especially the perennial Themeda australis and Sehima nervosum and the tall annuals such as Sorghum spp. Stools which escaped destruction have been so badly damaged that in many cases only a few weak shoots have grown. The partial suppression of the normally dominant perennials has resulted in a great increase in annual species. Studies of factors controlling the distribution of species have indicated that water and nutrition play a vei'y prominent part, and that microrelief is of great importance. Very slight variations in topography cause small sinks where water and eroded humus-rich surface material collect. The more fertile areas in general carry perennial grasses, while the less fertile areas carry annual species. Studies have also been made on the effects of grazing on native pastures. An area which originally consisted almost entirely of perennial grasses is now, after two years of grazing, composed of 98.5 per cent, annuals and only 1.5 per cent of perennial species. A control, uiigrazed area, now contains 60 per cent, perennials and 40 per cent, annuals, the intrusion of the annuals being a result of drought damage. Yield of dry matter has Ijeen relatively unaffected so far by the change from perennial to annual species as a result of heavy grazing. Attem.pts to introduce Townsville lucerne (Stylosanthes sitndaica) into native pastures has given erratic re.sults. Grazing facilitates introduction up to a point. It favours Townsville lucerne because it reduces competition from the grass (probably from shading) since the grass is preferentially grazed throughout the wet season. On the other hand, Townsville lucerne seed seems particularly susceptible to removal by flow ing water, and can bo i-emoved completely from areas where overgrazing has left the soil bare and subject to run-off. (viii) Introduced Pastures.\u2014The only grasses which have withstood the unfavorable conditions of the last two seasons are species of Centlirus. Although buff el {C. cilinris) and Birdwood (C. setigerus) are out standing in their persistence under conditions of low rainfall and low fertility and although they respond very well to higher levels of fertility (phosphate) it seems probable that, under more normal rainfall con ditions, other species, such as Rhodes grass which has been less persistent in drought, may be much more i)rodnctive at all levels of fertility. Experiments are in progress with a range of the more promising pastirre species in which it is planned to determine the effects of density of stand and fertility level on yield and persistence over a number of years. Other experiments are designed to determine the persistence of various legumes and to measure the possible interaction between grasses and legumes. (h) Kimherley Research Station.\u2014 (i) Crops.\u2014 Experimental plantings of sugar-cane and rice have both continued to give promising results. As crops of7'J this type would be very suitable for land settlement under irrigation, investigations of both are being con siderably expanded. Sugar-cane: The first sugar-cane variety trial planted in October, 1951, and harvested ten months later gave a mean yield of 25 tons of cane per acre. A small trial planted at the same time with the same varieties but harvested at eighteen and a half months has given higher yields, with one variety producing up to 60 tons of cane per acre. The longer growing period of this trial emphasized varietal differences. Addi tional equipment is now available to permit planting and cultivating under better conditions. A third variety trial planted in August, 1952, is showing the benefit of this improvement and estimates of yield of the growing crop are high. Preliminary growth studies have emphasized the marked seasonal growth of cane m this locality and a time of planting experiment has been begun to determine how plantings can best be adjusted to this factor. Particular attention is now being paid to sugar content. Preliminary evidence from hand refractometer measurements indicate that it is satisfactory hut trials are now in progress in which the sucrose content of the cane is being ineasured throughout the ripening season. Rice: A large collection of tropical rice varieties is now available. These have been grown for preliminary observations and multiplication in large wire-netting cages which prevent bird damage. From these small nursery rows a number of promising varieties, esti mated to have given grain yields approaching 2 tons/acre, have been selected for further study. Mechanical seeding techniques are now being investi gated in preparation for larger plantings. The high temperatures jDrevalent at the time when seed of summer crops mirst be sown constitute an establishment problem. Safflower: Irrigated crops of safflower, grown in the dry season, have given yields varying from 1,300 to 3,100 Ib./acre according to variety. Oil contents have been determined and range from 27 to 35 per cent. This crop, which produces promising industrial oil, is being considered for rotation with rice crops. Experi ments in progress are designed to determine relations between spacing, watering, and yield. Other Crops: Summer irrigated crops of peanuts, sorghum, and kenaf have been grown but yields in this season of low atmospheric humidity were lower than in former years. A 6-acre block of grain sorghum grown under irrigation during the winter period pro duced at the rate of 1,600 lb. grain per acre. (ii) Ferlilizer Experiments.\u2014It has been found that sugar-cane shows marked responses to phosphate and to nitrogen, but not to potash. An experiment is now in progress exploring the economic limits of fertilizer increase. To date, the best yields have resulted from the highest fertilizer application of 4 cwt. each of supm-phosphate and ammonium sulphate. There are indications that ratoon crops will require a higher nitrogen supply than the plant crop. Exifioratory pot trials with rice have indicated markcd_ responses in growth and in tillering with ammonium sulphate which is much more effective when placed at a depth below 2 inches in the soil than when ajDplied on the surface. Sodium nitrate has failed to give any significant response, whether applied to the surface or at a depth. All previous field trials have shown the necessity of superphosphate for adequate growth. (iii) Irrigation.\u2014Erratic results obtained in past sorghum and safflower experiments are believed to have been due to incomplete control of irrigation resulting from difficulties of accurate water reticulation. A careful study of irrigation requirements is in progress.Use is being made of gypsum blocks to indicate moisture status in the soil, and siphons of 2-in. diameter non- flexible plastic piping shaped to fit the channel banks are being used for distributing water from the head ditch to the irrigation furrows. They have proved to be much more satisfactory than pipe inlets, or V cut.s through the channel banks. With sugar-cane, observations on plant behavioui', as well as resistance readings, have indicated that water is required when the block resistance exceeds 10,060 ohms at a depth of not less than 12 inches; this corresponds to a watering interval of ten-seventeen days under dry season conditions. (iv) Disease.\u2014The only diseases of note during the past year have been on peanuts. A 6-acre block of peanuts in a rotation trial during the 1951-52 rvet season had been devastated by an outbreak of crown rot during the late stages of growth. Peanuts are being grown again on this land in the 1952-53 wet season, and again disease is very prevalent. It was first apparent in the same patches as last year's attack. There is some evidence that plants are more susceptible to the disease, or at least show the effects more clearly, when soil moisture is deficient. It is of interest to note that experience here with new varieties is parallel with that of Katherine in that varieties which show a high degree of freedom from the disease when first intro duced fail to maintain it in subsequent plantings. It seems that newly introduced seed probably has little \" hidden infection \" and that as seed stocks are multi plied, an increasing proportion of the seed becomes infected, thus giving the illusion that the strain is losing field resistance. These indications are of great importance in emphasizing the necessity for clean seed stocks for successful peanut production, f'errospora leaf spot showed a moderate incidence on peanuts. It was al.-^o present on Vigna spp. gi-owing on the levee. (v) Pests.\u2014The station has had unusual freedom from major pests during the past season. Grasshoppers did not_ attain plague proportions but the combined population of several species was sufficient in April- May to cause some damage to young sugar-cane. Further damage was prevented with a mixture of BIIC and DDT dusts. The usual bird pests have not been present so far this year. Even rice planted without the protection of a ' wire cage has suffered only slight damage by finches. It is believed that the late heavy rains ensured a plentiful natural food supply for tlie birds at the time when our own crops were ripening. A stem borer of rice, tentatively identified as a Schoenoiins sp., was fairly common among the later-maturing rice varieties. During May, some pupating and emerging parasitic wasps have been found in affected stems.' An outbreak of a sugar-cane stem borer caused con cern in July-October, 1952. This stem borer is not a usual one and has not as yet been definitely identi- fiefi; Differences in degree of attack on the several varieties was observed. Certain varieties of cane were unaffected, while others were heavily attacked. The attacks subsided late in the year without any great permanent damage being done and have not, so far, reappeared. (vi) Irrigated Pastures.\u2014During the year obser vation plots of a wide range of possible pasture grasses and legumes were established on the red levee soils. Although pastures cannot be regarded as a suitable basis for establishing an irrigation settlement in the region, they may be suitable as a factor in the mainten ance of soil fertility. The very marked contrast between growth on the levee and on heavy clay soils has strongly emphasized the special problems in establishing andmaintaining pastures on the heavy clay, which is the dominant soil type.80 it lias been previously reported that pastures of Khodes grass made good initial growth but began to decline even before they were fully established. This problem is being examined and the effects of fertilizer and ripping on an old Rhodes gi'ass pasture were studied. Ammonium sulphate gave a marked but ephemeral response but ripping did not cause any immediate response although slight benefits appeared later. In a grazing experiment in which five grasses have been established Avith and without legumes colour and vigour when associated with Clitoria ternatea, and to a lesser extent with Stylosanihes gracilis (stylo). The grasses showing no response are Cenchrus ciliaris and Paspalurn scrohiculatum (scrobic). It is possible that the lack of response by these grasses is connected with selective and excessive grazing of the legumes in thesepastures. These five grasses have persisted well, and with Andropogon there has been a steady improvement in stand and productivity leading to an increased stock ing rate. The Guinea, scrobic, and Andropogon pas tures appear capable of maintaining a liveweight in crease approaching 2 lb. per acre per day. Cenchrus ciliaris has given much better results when grazed con tinuously as compared Avith intermittent grazing, for the former practice has greatly reduced the develop ment of stemniy, unpalatable material. HoAvever, cAmn with the modified system, and with the best pasture so far as cover is concerned, this grass has given much lower liA'CAveight gains than the other grasses, and the legume components are seriously overgrazed. An area of Clitoria has been established as one stepi in the study of methods of establishment of a grass- legume pasture. There is an appreciable proportion of volunteer species, including grasses, and steers have shown rapid improA'ement, Avithout any ill effects, on this CZitoj-ia-dominant mixture. The decadent effects noted on Ehodes grass pastures have also been apAparent on grasses maintained as fodder crops, incliAdiug Pennisetum purpureum (elephant), Paniciim maximum (Guinea), and Sorg hum sudanense (Sudan grass). Thus elephant grass > rapidly established vigorous stools when first planted, and achieved high production, but production in the second year has been only one-third of that in the first season, yielding little oA'^er a ton of dry matter per acre. 4. Climatology. (Land Eesearch and Eegional Survey Section.) A small unit Avithin the Section has now been estab lished for some time studying the influence of climate on plant groAvth. Its overall function is to assist in the assessment of the land-use potentialities of the areas surveyed by the Section's regional survey unit. The unit has continued to provide general information-to other units of the Section. A report of the climate of the Ord-Victoria Eivers Eegion has been completed as part of the general report on that region, and other reports are in preparation for the current surveys in both northern Australia and ReAV Guinea. A detailed examination of the climate at Katherine, Rorthern Territory, has also been made. This includes a study of the distribution, amount, variability, and intensity of the rainfall, and of the annual distribution of tem perature, humidity, and photoperiod. In addition, the length of the growing season has been estimated for the 67 years of records available, as well as the expected duration and frequency of dry periods within the wet season. The information contained in this study will be applied to the research programmes being conducted in the dry monsoonal zone. At the Katherine EesearchStation studies on environmental factors in relation tocrop groAvth and production have been continued, mparticular with crops of cotton, peanuts, and grain sorghum, and further studies of these factors withrespect to native pastures have been commenced. Apart from standard meteorological equipment, extra recording equipment was used for the measurement of climaticfactors; gypsum blocks and thermistors Avere used for soil moisture and soil temperature determinationsrespectively. Eegular observations were also made of water deficit, growth, transpiration,^ and_ stomatalactivity A\\'ithin the crop plants under investigation, in relation to the climatic and edaphic factors. At the Kimberley Eesearch Station investigations on the waterrequirements of irrigated sugar-cane have been com menced. In the season which has just ended the wetting front was traced as it moved downward in the soil with each rainfall increment. Eoot development by the crop plants was observed to progressively exploit each new Avetted zone, and this development was most marked as the soil moisture content in the upper layers was decreased and became less readily available. Owing to the small proportion of available moisture in theprofile (the field capacity of the soil is approximately 21 per cent, and the permanent wilting point 13 per cent.), stress conditions in plants began to appear Avithin a feAV days of the commencement of each drying cycle. Rot until Avater deficits within the tissues became pronounced, hoAvever, was an effect on tran spiration rate and groAvth noted. Maxim,um depth of Avater penetration on the areas under study reached approximately 5^ feet. The roots of all crops were distributed through the soil to this depth and they lowered the water content of the Avhole of the wetted zone to the permanent wilting percentage before^growth ceased. On other areas at the station, particularly those topographically favoured, penetration to 7-i feet Avas observed. 5. Akid Eeseaeoh. (Land Eesearch and Eegional Survey Section.) The arid and semi-arid zones of Australia support large numbers of sheep and cattle even though the rate of stocking per unit area is low. It is of importance to maintain these areas at as high a productive level as possible and to raise this where practicable. The in vestigation of this field has been commenced and a report has been prepared folloAving a preliminary examination of the Alice Springs region. This report draws attention to the necessity for ecological studies of the native vegetation and its responses to grazing and climatic crises, in order that pasture management may be planned to prevent deterioration. It also indi cates the importance of ecological studies of exotic species. This is a necessary basis for their practical dissemination and establishment in native plant com munities AA'hich liaA'c a level of production too low to justify the expenditure involved in the more usual practices of pasture improvement. In such areas small- scale intensive forms of production may be of consider able local significance and hence the possibilities of irrigation from underground or small conservation sources should also be examined. After the recent good season in the Alice Springs area, an extensiA'e collection of botanical specimens wms m.ade as a foundation to the intended study of the various plant communities. XII. Fishebies. 1. Geneeal. Fundamental information on Australia's marine resources will lead to their full and economic exploita tion. The Organization through its Division of Fisheries aims to obtain this information. A basic study is made on migrations and other habits of fish81 in Australian waters, adaptation of methods of catching different varieties to locally prevailing conditions, and the location for fishing grounds. Division of Fisheries.\u2014The Division's research pro gramme can he subdivided under (a) oceanography (biological and hydrological); (&) survey and appraisal of the estuaries (particularly those of the important east coast rivers) ; and (c) cultural .studies, including the possibilities of fish farming in the coastal lakes and lagoons and in the rivers and freshwater ponds, pearl and pearl shell culture in the tropical northern waters, and other studies on shellfish. The Division also undertakes work on fish preser vation in co-operation with the Division of Food Preservation and Transport (see Chapter XIII., Section 6). Oceanographical studies were again limited to coastal waters and this must continue until the projected new 180-ft. trawler-oceanographic vessel goes into com mission. Culture and fish farming studies, begun in very recent years, were carried a stage forward, particularly with regard to knowledge of the basic factors in operation. The central laboratory at Cronulla, Xew South \"Wales, and the branch laboratories at Dunwich and Thursday Island, Queensland, Melbourne, Victoria, Perth, Western Australia, and Hobart, Tasmania, were maintained in continuous operation. In Queensland, the Division continues to operate from the research stations supplied by the Queens land Government. In Xew South Wales, the Division has agreed to carry out in co-operation with the State Fisheries Department a scientific survey of Lake Macquarie and to investigate the appiarcnt decline in recent years in the catch of fish taken in that area. During the year an officer of the Division visited Xew Zealand to study the trout investigations and stream improvement work, by arrangement with the Tasmanian Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Commission. In 1952, members of the Xew Zealand Oceano- graphic Committee discussed problems rvith officers of the Division. Through two of its officers the Divi sion is represented on the Standing Committee on Oceanography of the Pacific Science Congress. It has also been associated with the inauguration and develop ment of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council of the Food and Agricultural Organization. The crayfish exporters in Western Australia have made donations towards the cost of equipment and field surveys and it is also desired to make grateful acknowledgment of the following for co-operation and assistance during the year: the DeiJartment of Agri culture and the Police Department in Tasmania, the Western Australian Institute of Agriculture and the University Department of Zoology, the Australian Whaling Commission, the XorWest Trading Co., Whale Products Ltd., the Eoyal Australian Xavy, Huddart Parker Ltd., and all State Departments of Fisheries. 2. Opebations of Research Vessels. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) F.B.V. Derwent Hunter.\u2014After a long refit F.E.V. Derwent Homier returned to sea in August, 1952, and made two long cruises during the year, cover ing the southern waters of Xew South Wales, Bass Strait, and eastern Tasmanian and South Australian waters. (h) F.E.V. Gahleru.\u2014^She made two cruises to Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria to prospect for new shell beds. The Gahleru spent approximately twelve weeks in this area and payable quantities of F.51S9.\u20146fair, average quality (F.A.Q. in the trade) shell were found in a number of places between Groote Eylandt and the mainland. (c) Other Vessels.\u2014Onshore hydrological traverses, preliminary prawn surveys at Shark Bay, Exmouth Gulf, and the Broome area, together with crayfish surveys in Geographe Bay and Cape Xaturaliste, Wes tern Australia, were carried out with patrol vessel Lancelin and email craft of the Department of Fisheries and Game. During December, January, and part of February, 1953, the Division chartered the fishing vessel Buda Bay so that biological information on the marine crayfishes of the Cape Xaturaliste to Hamelin Bay area could be obtained. 3. Whaling. (Division of Fisheries.) Qbserimtions on the west Australian stock of hump back whales continued at the whaling stations at Carnarvon and Point Cloates and, with the inaugura tion of whaling on the east coast, observations were made on the east Australian humpback stock. On the west coast, 1,187 humpback whales were killed and 540 of these were examined by research officers; of the 600 humpback whales taken on the east coast, 423 were similarly examined. A preliminary assessment of the mass of biometrical data accumulated during this and previous years does not so far suggest any striking differences between the two stocks, but the figuires need a more detailed and critical examination. It was shown that the proportion of female humpback whales in the Western Australian catch for 1952 exceeded that of previous seasons. Further, a con comitant increase in the proportion of immaturity found among whales may indicate that the catching intensity is bearing heavily upon the male portion of the population and is now shifting to the other sex. Those two characteristics were not found in the east Australian catch, where the percentage of females killed was comparable to that in earlier years on the west coast, and the percentage of immaturity among males was lower than has been recorded from the west coast since the commencement of the present series of whaling operations. It was determined that female humpback whales reach sexual maturity at an average length of about 38 ft. 6 in. and males at about 36 ft. 6 in. Very few (about 1.2 per cent.) of the whales examined on the west coast were found to be physically mature, which confirms the finding of the previous season. It is possible that the east coast catch con tained a higher percentage of physically mature whales, but the observations made were iusufificient to prove this. The mean length of fully physically mature female humpbacks was determined to be 45 ft. 6 in. and of males 42 ft. 2 in. On the east coast three very early embryos of lengths from 0.87, to 1.8 cm. were obtained. On the west coast a considerable proportion of the females taken were found to be in late pregnancy and, during the early part of the season, a very high proportion of the remainder were lactating. Aerial observations conducted on the western whal ing grounds showed that speed of movement of hump back whales varied from 2.6 to 7.7 kt., and that the general change from a northerly to a southerly migra tion occurred about 24th August. The percentage accompanied by new-born calves increased markedly from September to October, indicating that many births must have taken place during the latter half of the season and that a considerable proportion of the whales other than these had already left the grounds.82 4. Sea Fisheries. (Division of Fisheries.) In south-eastern waters more time is now being dnvoted to observations on the water and plankton con ditions, and studies of gummy shark and the fishes of the continental slope are also being made. School shark and barracouta investigations are well advanced and are being reduced. The long-line fishing operations on the slope of the continental shelf, i.e. on bottoms over 100 fathoms deep, continue to yield most interesting results. Fish have now been taken 600 fathoms\u2014nearly three- (juarters of a mile\u2014below the surface. Progress has also been made in the recording of under water shoals of pelagic fish by echo-sounding. Explo sives are dropped on detected shoals so that specimens will float up for identification. Echogram traces of jack mackerel and anchovy have now been identified in this way. (ft) Barracouta (Thyrsites atun).\u2014The recoi-ded catch of headed and cleaned barracouta in all States fell from 13.7 million lb. in 1948-49 to 9.0 million lb. in 1949-50, 6.5 million lb. in 1950-51, and 6.2 million lb. (the average pre-war level) in 1951-52. The fall in the first year was due to a lessening of demand and had been predicted. The subsequent further fall was due to natural fluctuation in the availability of fish. There are summer-spawning populations in Bass Strait and eastern Tasmania, and winter-spawning populations in eastern Victoria, ISTew South Wales, and South Australia. The barracouta of western Tas mania are virtually unfished and unknown. This recognition of different populations does not depend on spawning seasons only. The average size of Bass Strait barracouta is consistently less than that of east Tasmanian barracouta, as shown by tens of tbousands of measurements in different years. The mdnthly records of catch and catch per boat at different fisbing ports show that barracouta migrate from east to west in Bass Strait and back again each year, simul taneously on the Victorian and Tasmanian coasts; in eastern Tasmania, and likewise in eastern Victoria and iVew South Wales, there are similar migrations on a .\"imilar scale, but running north and south. The relationship of the adult fish, rather than broods of young, to the environment is now being investigated with particular reference to the principal food of the barracouta, the euphausian Nyctiphanos australis. Only seven tagged barracouta have been recovered, out of 4,500 released. The barracouta catch could be increased ten-fold by adequately exploiting all the avail able populations without overfishing any of them; this would represent an increase of 50 per cent, in the total Australian catch of fish and shellfish. The seasonal cycle of bodily condition has been further studied, especially in the Bass Strait popula tion. From observations in five consecutive fishing seasons, it can be said that the first barracouta of the sea.son, those of the early spring, are fat; then dur ing the late spring, summer, and autumn barracouta first lose condition rapidly, regain most of it, lose some again, and then again improve\u2014being sometimes as fat at the end of the fishing season as at the beginning. These rcsult.s suggest that the Bass Strait fisli, wliich disappear in winter, might then be in better condition than most of those taken during the fishing season. The wintering area of this population is being sought and is probably in eastern Bass Strait, in mid waters or on the bottom. (b) School Shark (Galeorhinus australis), and Gummy Shark (Emis.sola antarctica).\u2014A limited pro gramme on the second shark species of commercialimportance, gummy shark, was started. The research vessel has continued an intensive tagging programme on both shark species as far as South Australian waters. Tagging results sliow that there is only one stock of school sharks in the waters of Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales, and there are reasons for believ ing that a depletionary trend is evident. Out of 245 gummy sharks tagged, there were two early locai recoveries. (c) Fiahes of the Conlini iiJal Slope.\u2014To determine depth distribution of fishes, long-line fishing in waters over the slope of the continental shelf, 100-600 fathorns deep, has been continued in east and west Bass Strait, off Eden, New South Wales, and off Triabunna, Tas mania. The three main teleost species so far encoun tered in this work\u2014Mora sp., Genypterus ilacodes, and llyperofjlyphe porosa\u2014arc in evidence at the majority of stations worked. (d) Tuna.\u2014Growth studies wore continued on soutliorn bluefin tuna {Thunnus maccoyi) and were facilitated by an abnormally rich occurrence of small fish in inshore waters of New South Wales for the duration of the season. Temperature correlations were continued and results indicate that changes in temperature associated with current lines tend to aggregate the fish. During one fishing test in offshore waters in the Eden area, a 40-ft. boat, modified for livebait fishing, caught about 10 tons of tuna in one day. The 43 other boats fishing inshore on the same day, using the troll method, averaged only half a ton each. It is becoming clear tliat the main body of the southern bluefin tuna pu])ulation frequents offshore waters. Captures were made up to 70 miles oft\" Investigator Strait, South Australia. Albacore {Thunnvs germo) and striped tuna (Kutsinvonus pelamis) were recorded for the first time in South Australian waters. The purse- seiner Tacoma made three catches of up to 4 tons each of .southern bluefin tuna in Boston Bay, South Australia, during March, 1953. (c) Australian Salmon (Arripis trutta).\u2014To test tbe hypothesis that fish present along the Victorian coa.stline during the late .summer-early autumn period move into New South Wales waters during the late autumn-early winter period, 300 fish were released at Lakes Entrance in .Vpril, 1952. During April and M;qy nine recoveries were obtained in the Bass Strait area. Between June and November 32 recoveries were obtained from ea.>tevn Victorian-New South Wales .areas, to as far north as Jervi.s Bay. Although it is thus apjiarent that the movement between Victoria and New South Wales takes place, some fish remain in tbe Bass Strait region. Eoutiue meristic counts and biometrical measure- ment.s have been continued on the salmon of South and Western Australia. Most of the tagging experi ments have been carried out in South Australian waters to determine whether or not the salmon of these water.s migrate to Western Australia. In June, 1952, 2,000 salmon were released at Cteduna, with some early local I'ecoveries. At Port Noarlunga, 220 fish were released in December, 1952, with 49 nearby recoveries, demonstrating a nou-migratory phase. 111 late November, 1952, 100 large fish were released at American River, Kangaroo I.sland, with three local recoveries. At Port Lincoln approximately 170 salmon wci-e rden.sed during A]iril, 1953. There was no early- recovery. During October, 1952, 350 fi.sh were reloa.sed in Ta.-miaiiian waters, with a few local recoveries. At Cbeyne Beach, Western Australia, 100 salmon were relea.sod in an attempt to confirm the westerly spawning run indicated by previous tagging experiments. One fisb, recovered at Hamelin Bay, had travelled approximately 220 miles in fourteen days.83 (/) Ihiff (An'ij)is gcorgianus).\u2014Preliminary racial never heen reliably recorded from South .\\.us- tralia. In Western Australia, however, samples con tained up to 100 per cent, of spawning individuals. It is now considered that spawning takes place only in Western Australia, the reproductive cycle being gene tically controlled but inhibited by unsuitable environ mental conditions. Further evidence is being sought. Since the initiation of an intensive tagging pro gramme in February, 1052, appro-ximately 7,500 ruffs have been released in South and Western Australian waters, to determine whether active interchange takes place along the entire coastline. There were many local recoveries and a few from some distance (maxi mum, 350 miles covered in four months). In South Australia tagging was undertaken mainly to test a hypothesis that fish of South Australia move into Western Australian waters for spawning. Best- travelled fish were recovered at Esperance, Western Australia, a distance of 600 miles after a period of eight months, at Eremer Bay, Western Australia, a distance of 730 miles after ten months, and at Rottnest Island, Western Australia, a distance of 1,250 miles in five months. During 1953, in Western Australia, 1,480 fish were released. In South Australia, during April, 1,850 ruffs were liberated, without early recovery. {g) Australian Traivl Fisheries.\u2014The work on this important fishery is almost at a standstill and will remain so until the Division has its own trawler. During the year an analysis has been made of avail able statistics. (i) HVs/ Australian Trawl Fishery.\u2014The company, Anglo-Australian Fisheries Pty. Ltd., who were operat ing in the region of the Great Australian Bight from September, 1949, ceased operations on 23rd March, 1952. Copies of the company's cruise reports and trawler logs have been used to summarize the result,- of this trawl-fishing enterprise and to compare the results with previous ventures of trawl fishing in the Great Australian Bight, and past and present trawl- fishing operations in east Australian waters. The results show the general commercial possibilities for trawl fishing in the restricted region of the Great .Vustralian Bight. (ii) Knu South ir-,7/c',s Trawl Fishery. \u2014The avail able catch and effort statistics of the Mew South Wales trawl-fishing industry have been brought up to date and are being maintained with especial reference to the three main species Ncoplatyceplialus richardsoni, Nemadactylus macropterus, and Trachichthodes ajfinis. A summarized analysis has heen the basis for initiating discus.sions on proposals submitted for increasing the stock of fiatheacl along the east Aus tralian coast. (iii) LaTes Entrance Danish Seine Fishery.\u2014With the co-operation of the fishermen a regular sampling is under way rvliich is likely to throw light on whether or not the stock of flathead is continuous with that existing on the Mew South Wales coast. (fi) Jade Maclecrel (Trachurus novae zelandiae).\u2014 From July to September, 1952, jack mackerel was plen tiful, and the catches were greater than the total for the previous three years. The large catches indicate a strong year-class which should dominate the fishery for several years. (i) Spanish Macherel.\u2014Field investigations were again carried out in north Queensland during August, to December, supplementing observations made during the spawning season of 1951. Further data on growthrate have been assembled and a large series of otoliths was collected. An analysis of stomach contents and feeding habits has been made. (_/) Edio-sounder and Detection Instrument Develop ments.\u2014Test runs were made with an echo-sounder on one of the trawlers of the Red Funnel Company on the Mew South Wales coast; no shoals wore, how- e\\er, recorded. Derivent Hunter also obtained no evidence of .shoals between Sydney and Eden, but one of the largest shoals recorded on a echo-sounder in Australia was traced off Eden and proved to be small jack mackerel. These results suggest that on parts of this coast shoals may not be easily detected by echo- sounder, as indeed has been found for some areas fished by English fishing vessels. Two unsuccessful trials were made in conjunction with the Division of Electrotechnology with an oscil loscope connected to the echo-sounder of a trawler of the above-named company. A subsequent test in a naval vessel proved satisfactory, a piked dogfish 19 inches long being clearly observed on the screen down to 60 fathoms. Using a directional hydrophone and high-frequency amplifier, preliminary underwater tests were made to find whether the penaeid prawn, Metapenaeus macleayi, could be detected by sound, hence aiding its survey. Mo unusual sound was heard when the hydrophone was only 5 feet from the bag of a net containing 300-400 prawns. 5. Estuaeine Fish. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) Mullet (Mugil ceiihalus).\u2014A total of 964 mullett was tagged for the year in south Queensland water.?, the percentage return being 2.44. This com pared favorably with the retuiui of 2.5 per cent, for tl'.e previous year when a similar number was tagged, thus indicating the existence of a stable mullet fishery in the Moreton Bay area. Four fish were recaptured at distances of from GO to- 160 miles north of the tagging locality. They were mature fish and were retaken during their spawning run, thus indicating that the mullet of Moreton Bay do contribute to the catch taken further north during this period. In an effort to determine the extent of the north coastal migration, the distance from the surf zone of the travelling .schools, and the gonadnl condition din ing migration, the possibilities of drift netting with 900 yards of 3Tj-in. linen mesh were investigated. It would a])pear that this method might h<> u-scd profitably, in particular for mackerel, using a larger mesh size net. (h) Barramiindi (Bates calcarifer (Bloch)).\u2014 Preliminary investigations were made on the biology of the giant perch or barramundi. A number of small specimens were tagged in the salt, estuarine, and fresh waters in the Mcinity of Rockhampton. Fair early returns included one from a fish which had grown 12 centimetres in two and a half months, and migrated 30 miles to the Fitzroy River. A number of fish has already been tagged and placed within a freshwater lagoon in the Rockhampton area. Their growth rate is to be noted and compared with scale-reading results. Stomach contents of smaller fi.sh from freshwater revealed a mixture of plant and animal detritus, the latter consisting of aquatic insects, small crustaceans, and small fish' fry. Stomachs of larger forms, how^ever, contained mullet, prawn.s, small perch, eels. place in coastal wmters at a time the mature wlieii approximately 17 lb. in weight and 33 inches (84 centimetres) in length. Scale-reading results indicate that such barramimdi might be two years old. After spawning the mature barramimdi remain within the limits of the continental shelf in coastal waters or river estuaries. Young barramundi migrate upstream from estuaries. They survive, in the river headwaters, in holes when the rivers dry back. Holes which will dry up during a prolonged dry season are avoided. (c) Black Bream (Mylio australis (Gunther)).\u2014 Work has been concentrated on the collection of material from the Sydney and Brisbane fish markets. Studies have included: size composition of commercial catches, length frequencies and scale sampling, gonad and stomach content collections. (d) Fish Culture.\u2014Of the two fish culture experi ments started, one was unfortunately ruined. The sand barrier to the ocean of the Moreton Island lagoon was penetrated during a period of high tides and strong south-east winds, and the lagoon became useless for experimental purposes. However, much useful infor mation had already been obtained on the transportation of small fish fry, particularly Mugil cephalus, from the small creeks and estuaries around Moreton Bay to the lagoon. Some 10,000 fish fry, mainly sea mullet, but including whiting, were transported by tanks, in which the water was changed about every hour. Large shallow tanks, 6 by 3 feet by 1 ft. 6 in. were most satisfactory, the carrying capacity of such tanks being 1,000 1-2 in. mullet or about 400 small whiting. The mortality rate remained below 10 per cent, if the water was renewed every hour. The fry were obtained by means of mos quito netting, strung between two poles, from shallow, muddy-bottomed creeks. These fry would appear to swim up such creeks when open to bay waters during high tides and to remain there until the next set of high tides under conditions of low oxygen content and high temperatures. paper on the hydrological and plankton cycles found in the lagoon for the eighteen months prior to the break through is almost complete. Construction of another fish farm for the culture of mullet fry in Moreton Bay is now under way. The other fish culture experiment at Maianhar is proceeding. A preliminary study has been made of the physico-chemical and biological properties of bottom muds, and of the changes induced by organisms in these muds and the supernatant water. It has been found that diatoms are an important food of the mullets, which are equijiped with a strongly muscular stomach using mud particles to grind up the diatom tests. It has been jiossible to differentiate between the epiphytic and mud diatom florae and thus to follow the feeding habits of mullet. It can now be shown, by determining diatom species found in their stomachs, where mullet have been feeding, irrespective of where they may be caught. This is useful in following the movements of the fish in estuaries, e.g., from flats to deep holes and from one part of an estuary to another. This method of study is applicable to small as well as to large fish. A preliminary survey has been made of the diatoms of a number of estuaries from Lake Macquarie to the Gippsland Lakes. The mud, which under .shallow water determines the properties of the supernatant, forms a strongly reducing environment. At first this was thought to be a purely microbiological phenomenon, but it appears that a strongly reducing substance is present in Zostera and that this can reduce sulphates to sulphides, as well as produce a reduction potential comparable to that of molecular hydrogen.Direct bacterial counts have shown that turbulence in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries causes an increase in the bacterial count of the water, and counts at depths to 3 feet in the mud confirm the theory of the vertical movement of water in the intertidal flats. Hydrogen ion and redox potential changes have been correlated with sulphate reduction, which has been and is a subject of special study. Microspira is omnipresent in cstuarine muds and even occurs in the sand of ocean beaches. It is accompanied by a commensal aerobe and by thiobacilli which oxidize the sulphide formed by Microspira. Under certain circumstances sulphur is produced. It has also been found that most aerobic bacteria in sea-water and mud will utilize calcium phosphate and ferric phosphate. This occurs through bacteria fer menting galactose, mannitol, and other carbohydrates common in seaweeds and reducing the pH from 8.1 to 5.3, thus causing the dissolving of phosphates. This action is apparently confined to the micro-environment. Even if the pH is buffered at 8.5, phosphate is still dissolved. Presumably ferric and calcium phosphate are sufficiently soluble to form a continuous reservoir for the bacteria. Little work has been done on the nitrogen cycle, but Azotobacter has been isolated from the muds. 6. Ekeshwatee Fisheeihs. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) Trout Investigations {Tasmania).\u2014\"Work con tinued on the lines of the previous year. (i) Lake Leaks.\u2014The study of the spawning run in 1952 showed that brown trout ran intermittently from 5th May until 28th June, depending on local rainfall in the catchment area. During this time some 1,100 fish were handled, though some escaped owing to floods. (ii) The Great Lake.\u2014The spawning run of the brown trout at the Great Lake lasted from 17th April until 14th August, during which time 1,900 fish were handled. The rainbow run lasted from 14th Septem ber until 8th Hovember, and 845 fish were handled. The condition of the fish in this lake showed a further falling off from the values of the previous year, and, as forecast, the fishing during the following season was disappointing. (iii) The Plenty River.\u2014The spawning run of brown trout passing through this fish trap allowed of the handling of 560 fish between 20th April and 28th June. The fish passing the trap are of interest in that it is possible to distinguish, by means of scale examina tion, two groups of fish; those that have spent all their life in the river, and those that have visited the estuary on one or more occasions, when an increased rate of growth occurred. (iv) Rivers of the North-west.\u2014Reliable data of catches are being sought from these rivers to establish the extent of the spawning runs, the extent of the spawn ing beds, and the survival from natural spawning. The outstanding result of a recent official visit to Hew Zealand, made under the auspices of the Salmon End Freshwater Fisheries Commission, was the adoption of the recommendations made in a private report; this should enable a programme of trapping rivers to be started in a very modest way. It is desirable not only to trap the fish running for spawning and on their retuim from the headwaters, hut also to install traps to assess the extent of the downward migration of yearling fish from the upper waters. (b) Freshivater Fish Culture {Tasmania).\u2014(i) Jjuhe Dobson.\u2014The results of experiments in this lake, aimed at increasing productivity, are about to be pub lished. Fertilization resulted in increased water-weed growth, carrying a rich epifauna. Trout have been introduced.86 (ii) Deloraine.\u2014The study of an artificial lake, con structed over a year ago, near Deloraine, has heen con tinued. The grass which covered most of the bottom has now decomposed, giving way to a large extent to fresh water vegetation, partly introduced. In April, 1953, G,827 yearling brown trout were introduced. (c) Fish\u2014other than Trout (Tasmania).\u2014The European perch (Perca fuviatilis) and tench (Tinea vulgar is) which were introduced into Tasmania in the 1860's were selected as suitable types of fish for possible stocking of more stagnant waters. Their growth rates are being studied. Because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient numbers for stocking an attempt is to be made to build up a breeding stock of these two species at the Plenty Hatcheries. 7. Ceustacea and Shellfish Investigations. (Division of Eisherics.) (a) Westerti Australian Crayfish (Panulirus long- ipes).\u2014The total catch for 1952 was 8,500,000 lb., an increase of 1,500,000 Ih. over 1951, due to an extension of the fishery north and south of the area fished in 1951. It is now evident that the accumulated stock on areas adjacent to the coastal processing stations and freezer boat anchorages has been removed. Thus the catch in the Abrolhos area shows a decline in total catch (1950, 2,100,000 lb.; 1951, 1,650,000 lb.; 1952, 1,550,000 lb.). The numbers of fishermen operating were less (1950, 114 men; 1951, 94 men; 1952, 84 men), hut the catch per man increased and the fishing effort Avas more evenly spread over the fishing season (April-August inclusive). The analysis of the data of the continuous fishing tests of 1947 and 1948 and of the progress of the Abrolhos fishery for the ten years 1943 to 1952 has heen completed. A continuous test replicating that of 1948 and combined Avith a marking experiment, at the Avestern reef of Pelsart Group, Houtman's Abrolhos, was commenced in March, 1953. The returns for March and April Avere approximately tAvo-thirds of those for the corresponding period of the test of 1948. This relation is very closely that existing in coastal areas which have been intensively fished from 1948 to 1952. A detailed inA^estigation of the \" Avhite crayfish\" occurrence in coastal areas Avas carried out during December. Experiments and observation show that it is evident that these crayfish represent a phase in the life history of crayfish which have developed in the coastal limestone reefs, the phase being the ecdysis before gonad maturation. The migration following on this ecdysis appears to he due to changes in the bottom Avater temperatures of the southern coastal reef areas, combined with nutritional needs for full maturity. Biological surveys were continued in the area. Cape Haturaliste to Hamelin Bay, in the south-west of Western Australia, a distance of about 90 miles. SpaAvning crayfish and crayfish in the Avhite crayfish phase, all of Panulirus longipcs. were obtained. The carapace length range agreed Avith that found else- vA'here. This indicates that these occurrences are not the result of a southern accumulation of large crayfish but are probably due to normal doA^elopment and growth within the area. The total area over which this species is now knoAvn to occur under conditions of average growth and develop ment is one extending seawards to about 30 fm, and northwards about 500 miles from Cape Leeuwin. The region _ of optimum groAvth and development is that extending from Garden Island in the south to Port Gregory in the north. (b) Prawns.\u2014Preliminary biological surveys were made in north-west waters of Western Australia. The areas yielded samples of the tiger prawn (Penaeuspsculentus) and a species allied to the king praAvn of Hcav South Wales (P. plcbejus), in addition to several others. Surveys will continue in Shark Bay and Exmouth Gulf in 1953. (c) Oysters.\u2014A survey of the oyster-groAving poten tial of the east coast of Australia has heen commenced. Eonrteen stations have been established ranging from Maryborough in Queensland through Hew South Wales to Mallacoota in Victoria. In addition, seven sub stations have been established in Moreton Bay. Each experimental plot is maintained by a local commercial oyster-farmer. Spatfall observations have continued in the Moreton Bay area. The heaviest spatfall at DunAvich occurred in December for the third year in succession. Using fibro-cement as experimental spat catchers, results up to 2,000 young oysters/square foot were obtained. (i) Japanese Oysters.\u2014Seventy-five cases of Pacific seed oysters (Ostreo gigas) Avere air-freighted from Japan to Pittwater with negligible mortality. It is hoped that the survivors of the 2,000,000 young oysters Avill provide the brood stock that Avill establish Ostrea gigas in Tasmania. The Pacific oysters shoAved great resistance to the effects of freshwater flooding. After heavy rains it was found that 100 per cent, mortality occurred in the Sydney rock oyster (Orassostrea commercialis), the Stewart Island oyster (Ostrea sinuata Lamarck), and a euryhaline paragraspan crab. The Pacific oyster survived the abnormal conditions Avith a complete absence of mortality. At Port Sorell, Avhere thermal graphs give greatest hopes of suitability for mass spaAAming, a drift-bottle programme has been completed to find a site from which larval stakes of the Pacific oyster Avill not he SAA'ept out to sea and lost. Several pools between Rabbit Island and the toAvnship of Port Sorell have been surveyed with the idea of turning them into spatting tanks if natural methods fail. (d) Scallops.\u2014Diving investigations have proved of great value in effecting population studies and noting changes in density distributions. Sufficient data have now heen collected to interpret and predict changes in the fishery. It has been found that the \" condition\" of the scallops is dependent on the trend of temperature changes in the Avaters of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel four to five months prior to the opening of the season. Diving has proved that beds of juA^enile scallops do not move from the area on AA'hich they first settle. Under satisfactory conditions, the commercial scallop takes five years to reach the minimum legal .size, hut during the last three years of this period the popula tion may he reduced by 60 per cent, predation. The large eleven-armed starfish Cosrinas- thickest on the beds of juA'enile scallops, and reduction in its numbers may yet become necessary. (e) Pearlshell.\u2014Further biological data on all species of pearlshell Avere collected, surveys Avere made of new and previously known pearling beds by the Oahlern, and pearl culture experiments were commenced. The expected summer spat-sets of Pinctada vulgaris and P. sugillata Avere observed, but thoy were lighter than in the previous year; in particular that of P. vulgaris Avas very light. Ho explanation is put forward for those phenomena. Special attempts to obtain sets of P. maxima Avcre nnsuccossful. Evidence is now to hand of a set of P. margaritifera in Thursday Island harbour toAvards the end of 1951. A number of young specimens Avere taken from the hull of a Amssel moored in the Jiarbour from June,86 I'JSl, to Docenibor, 1952. Other specimens of a comparable size were found on wharf piles. This is the first set of this species in Thursday Island harbour in four years. To summarize the spat-setting observations it seems that the density and regularity of set is definitely correlated with the size of the stocks of adults. P. vulgaris and P. sugillata, which exist everywhere in great numbers, set regularly and heavily. P. margarif i- fera and P. maxima, which are very scarce, set lightly and intermittently. 8. Ichthyology. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) Reference Catalogue of Anatralian and New Guinea Fish.\u2014A considerable amount of data has been incorporated in the card index of Australasian fish. This has been brought up to date with a total of 2,704 species, completely covering the known fauna. A further 550 illustrations have been located, and with the insertion of these a figure will be on file for every species which has been illustrated in literature. All more important papers on Australian fishes have been extracted for incorporation in the synonymy and an examination of the balance of minor imblications is under way. The cross-index to generic and specific names is completely up to date and a cross-index to common names is partly prepared. (b) Chech-list of Fishes of New Guinea.\u2014As part of the Division's investigation of the fish fauna of Hew Guinea, an exhaustive annotated cheek-list has been prepared of the fishes recorded from Papua, New Guinea Trust Territory, Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands. For completeness in the treat ment of a natural area, the records from Dutch New Guinea, Waigeu, and Misool are incorporated. The manuscript incorporates modern nomenclature and was compiled direct from the original works. A biblio graphy of the ichthyological literature of the area is incorporated. The work is complete except for final rearrangement and typing in a form suitable for publication. (c) Handbooh of Ceylon Fish.\u2014A completely referenced check-list has been comp)iled for the Ceylon fish fauna. Work was carried out primarily during an official secondment to the Ceylon Government under the Colombo Plan and completed at Cronulla. It is available for publication as an ordinary check-list or as a basis for an illustrated and keyed handbook of the Ceylon fish fauna. (d) Revision of Australian Clupeoid Fishes.\u2014 Further collections of adult' and larval fishes have been assembled for a monographic treatment of the taxonomy and larval development of Australasian species. The types of some species were examined in the British Museum. (e) Report on Antarctic Fishes.\u2014Further small collections of fish from Heard Island, Macquarie Island, and Kerguelen have been received from the Australian National Antarctic Eesearch Expedition. They will be incorporated in a report at present being prepared on fish material submitted from all expedi tions to the Antarctic since 1948. Some comparison was made with material collected by the Norwegian Whaling Expeditions, now in the care of the University of Oslo. 9. Hydrology. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) Oceanic Investigations.\u2014(i) Co-operation with the Royal Australian Navy.\u2014Permission was secured for oceanographical equipment to be placed onH.M.A.S. Barcoo and some valuable data have been collected in the course of her naval duties. Thissupplements knowledge of conditions in eastern Aus tralian offshore waters. (ii) Surface Tasman Sea Collections.\u2014By kind p_er- mis.sion of the Huddart Parker Company, and with the co-operation of the engineers of T.S.M.V. ITan^fa- nella, regular fortnightly collections of surface water samples for salinity and temperature determination have been made .since January, 1953, whilst en route from Sydney to Wellington or .\\uckland. Some excel lent information has thereby been secured. (h) Coastal Studies.\u2014(i) South-east Australian Waters.\u2014A paper dealing with some aspects of the long-term trends in properties at regular stations, and another on the latitudinal variation in productivity, are in i^reparation. By using drift cards instead of bottles at coastal stations the number of releases and returns and the statistical reliability of results are A cry greatly increased. (ii) Ba.ss Strait.\u2014A sampling programme has been developed in Bass Strait and adjoining waters in order to throw light on the circulation and productivity characteristics of this area, which seems to form an environmental barrier to the east-west movement of fish stocks. (iii) Sovfh-iresi Auslraliaii Waters.\u2014The Gerald- ton-Abrolhos line of stations was discontinued in order to allow of a more thorough monthly investigation of the 50 metre coastal station west of Eottnest Island. The temperature range of 4\u00b0 C. found is relatively small, and a maximum thermal gradient of 2\u00b0 C. contrasts sharply with much higher gradients which are encountered along the eastern Australian coast. Maximum temperatures were observed during the autumn months, after which there was a steady decrease to the minimum of 18\u00b0 C. in November. There was a sharp drop in the salinity of the whole water column in June. Throughout the winter and spring the salinity rose steadily and high concentra tions of organic phosphorus were detected throughout the entire water column. The steady drop in water temperature from June to November indicates that this water mass originated westwards in the deeper waters. (c) Estuarine Investigations. -\u2014(i) Productivity Studies.\u2014Effort is now being concentrated on a study of the probable factors controlling the availability of certain nutrients in deep basins of some New South Wales estuarine systems. (ii) Lake Macquarie Survey.\u2014In June, 1953, the hydrological section of an ecological survey of Lake Macquarie began. Attempts will be made to measure the flushing rate of the system and the rate at which pollution loads will be diluted by marine exchange. (iii) Shell Point {Oyster Experimental Lease).\u2014 Studies on the circulation of water and thermal charac teristics in the intertidal region have been continued. To determine the exact distribution of chemical proper ties beneath the mud surface, cores of 20-24 inches depth have been collected and analysed for the usual constituents; this has revealed the upward displace ment by about 6 inches of the superphosphate originally added at 12 inches beneath the surface. To explore subsurface water movements a series of manometers registering the water pressure at various depths beneath the mud surface, and sited at mid-tide, low-water and fully submerged levels, has been put into operation. To estimate the rate of lateral movement in the development of the observed pressure pulses, a duplicate set of manometers, enclosed in 4-inch piping extending down to a depth of 4 feet, has been installed and are read simultaneously with the original.87 (iv) Soiiih-vest Auslralia.\u2014A more intensive study u'as made of the discharge and recovery period in the Swan River. Salinity and oxygen saturation values varied in such a way to suggest that desaturated water of high salinity, originating in the deeper waters of the hasin during rainfall discharge, were forced into the shallower waters at the upper end of the basin to be replaced subsequently by water of a lower salinity and higher oxygen saturation. Future work must attempt to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this oscillatoi'y effect. The generation of inorganic phosphate in the bottom waters of the basin was even more intense than in 1951, with a maximum value of 90 jxg. P/1. at the height of stratification. Hypotheses have been developed to explain the high iihosphate concentrations and tests to evaluate these theories will be initiated. (d) Neiu Investigations. \u2014 (i) Radiochemical Studies.\u2014The instrumental difficulties involved in the application of the trace technique to problems of phosjihorus metabolism in estuarine muds, have now been solved and an experiment is in progress designed to show the rate at which, or at least the possibility that, vertical water movements in a typical estuarine mud jorofile could contribute to the vertical movement of phosphate. The possibility that diurnal pH changes in the Western Australian coastal waters could be a major factor in the development of certain features of Western Australian coastal limestone reefs is also being investigated by the tracer technique. The '^0 technique for the estimation of carbon assimilation in the sea has received some preliminary exmnination and it is hoped that in the near future this method will be applied to eastern Australian waters and provide a further check on the independent estimates of productivity based upon nutrient and chloroj)hyll cycles. (ii) SpectropJiotometric Determination.\u2014In study ing the productivity cycle of the sea it is essential to know what quantities of phytoplankton are available for the assimilation of inorganic nutrient, and their exact lateral and depth distribution. A chemical method was therefore devised for the estimation of phytoplankton densities, adopting the spectrophoto- metric method developed overseas, which utilizes the characteristic absorption bands of plankton chloro phyll. Preliminary tests on the efficiency of various solvents in the extraction of chlorophyll, on the rela tionship between chlorophyll and total organic matter in the cell structure of typical algae and diatoms, and on field collecting practices Avere begun. It is proposed also to estimate Avith the spectrophoto- meter the seasonal cycle of ferrous-ferric iron and some other trace elements in estuarine and coastal waters. 10. Plankton Investigations. (Division of Fisheries.) A limited programme of plankton study was main tained in association with hydrological work. A system of reliable fractionation of samples, employing an im proved \" Avhirling\" instrument, was introduced to minimize the effort of counting of organisms in the catches. Work was done in the Bass Strait area, the Thursday Island pearlshell investigations, and the survey of the NeAV Guinea fishery environment. The study of the distribution of euphausiids (Crustacea) in the Western Australian area has been continued. The three major species are Euphausia hemigihha as a slope and ocean species extending from Horth-Avest Cape in the north to Albany on the south coast; E. recurva as a slope and shelf species from Shark Bay to Cape Haturaliste; and Pseudeuphausia latifrons as a shelf, on-shore, species extending along the coastline of the State.11. Other Ina'estigations. (Division of Fisheries.) (a) 1<^outing.\u2014Results so far obtained are recorded in tAvo papers noAV in the press; a third paper is in lireparation. Visits Avere paid by request to the Haval Fstablishment, Garden Island, and to various Sydney poAvcr houses, to advise on fouling problems. The llnderAvater Paints Committee, formed at the instiga tion of the Royal Australian Navy, held four meetings. Tlie Committee requested continuation of the fouling programme of the Division. A rotor-tester has been devised by this Division and has been installed at White Bay poAver house. It has been found that diatoms and algae attach at speeds up to 16 kt., Avhile barnacles (Balanus amphitrite) attach at 2.05 Avorm {Ilydroides miiltispinosa) at approximately 1.6 kt. These results suggest that louling can be controlled by maintaining the rate of floAv continuously, even at off-peak periods; chlorine or sodium pentachlorphenate can be used when the floAV falls beloAv the critical value. (b) Fish Eggs and Larvae.\u2014Experimental work on I he rearing of fish eggs and larvae progressed, some .-uccess being achieA'ed in the carrying through of larvae to more advanced stages. The feeding of larvae has been investigated overseas and .some preliminary tests Avith brine-shrimp nauplii and unicellular organisms have been carried out. The development of the flying fish investigated and accounts are being jirepared. The eggs of a number of tropical and sub-tropical fish have been obtained from mature adults and Avork has commenced on the descrip tion of these for publication. (c) Ariiiariiim.\u2014As the result of a study of overseas ])ractice a neAv pumping unit has been installed and re designed reticulation is planned, which will improve the quality and the quantity of the sea-water supply. XIII. FOOD. 1. General. The processing, preservation, and transport of food stuffs is of great importance to Australia as a food- producing country, more particularly as it is situated inconveniently far from the main food-importing nations of the world and its OAvn population centres are separated by long distances. The Organization's Avork on food is undertaken chiefly Avithin the Division of Food Preservation and Transport with its main labora tories at Homebush, New South Wales, and branch laboratories at Brisbane, Queensland (meat); West Gosford, NeAv South Wales (citrus fruit) ; Eden, NeAv South Wales (fish); Hobart, Tasmania (fish, apples, and berry fruits); and at the Biochemistry Depart ment, University of Sydney (physical chemistry). The Avork of the Division is described in Sections 2 to 11 of this Chapter. Work on the manufacture of dairy products is carried out by the Dairy Research Section at Fishermen's Bend, in Victoria (see Section 14 of this Chapter). Work on dried vine fruits is in pro gress at the Commonwealth Research Station (Murray Irrigation Areas), Merbein (see Section 12 of this Chapter). Co-operatiA^e investigations on wines are carried out in the Waite Agricultural Research Institute (see Section 13 of this Chapter). Division of Pood Preservation and Transport.\u2014The first post-war consignment of chilled beef from Aus tralia to Great Britain was shipped from Brisbane in May, 1953. The techniques for the preparation and cooling of the meat Avere developed by the Division in88 tlie years 1932-39 and were applied and supervised by the Division's officers. Since the co-operative investi gations on frozen heef are occupying a major part of the time of the Division's Brisbane laboratory staff, reseai'ch studies on chilled beef have had to be restricted. If the chilled beef trade shows signs of resuming its pre-war importance, these research studies will be accelerated. The fruitful co-operation of the Biochemistry Depart ment of the University of Sydney with the physical chemistry group continued during the year. An officer has initiated a course of lectures and demonstrations on the physical chemistry of proteins for senior- students in biochemistry. It is lioped that this course will stimulate graduands in the Faculty of Scieirce to post-graduate interest in problems of protein chemistry which are of importance in the food and pastoral industries. The Specialized Instruments Corporation quantitative refrigerated ultracentrifuge was installed in an air-conditioned laboratory gene rously provided by the Cancer Research Fund of the University of Sydney. This ultracentrifuge, which is the only one of its type in Australia, will be of con siderable value to University workers in their enzyme and serum protein studies and to the Organization's workers in their fundamental studies on the denatura-. tion of proteins. The wide knowledge of the processing and preserva tion of various foodstuffs now possessed by the Divi sion's officers is being increasingly utilized through technical inquiries from Government Departments and industi-y. During the year two special surveys of the handling and preservation of marine products were conducted on behalf of State Departments. At the request of the Chief Secretary's Department of Hew South Wales, a survey of the nature and extent of wastage in cooked prawns was commenced. A survey of the Victorian Fishermen's Co-operative cold stores and their operation was carried out at the request of the Victorian Department of Fisheries and Game. As the result of the interest stimulated in the United States of America in 1952 by a report on the Division's work on crops of peas intended for canning, the two authors were invited to be guest workers at the Hew York Agi-icultural Experiment Station. Both officers were able to accept this invitation, the visit of one of them being made possible through the generous support of several Australian vegetable-canning firms. Dairy Research Section.\u2014Milk production in Aus tralia is not expanding, while local consumption of all dairy products continues to increase. With the aim of attaining maximum advantage from the dairy industry from the view-point of food resources, the Dairy Research Section deals with some of the longer- term and more specialized problems in dairy products manufacture, with research directed increasingly towards improving the efficiency of milk products pro cessing and the initiation and development of nmans of using all the milk solids as human food. With the temporary accommodation which had been generously provided for officers of the Section at the School of Dairy Technology, Werribee, and the Bread Research Institute, Sydney, no longer available, labora - tory space at Fishermen's Bend has been severely strained. A prefabricated building at Highett is, however, approaching completion, and tenders have been called for the larger permanent buildings on that site. 2. Physics. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) Rail Transport.\u2014^Studies of the performance of refrigerated rail cars, mainly in collaboration with officei's of the Hew South Wales Railways, have beengoing on for some years. These have the double pur pose of obtaining information on typical cargoes and, at the same time, investigating the heat transfer pro cesses in the cars to provide a sound basis for consider ing new developments in the design and operation of vehicles. Among the cargoes studied this year were thoroughly precooled fruit on a long journey and beef which had not been thoroughly chilled before loading. (b) Evahiatinn of Canning Processes.\u2014In a can of food there is usually an air space between the top of the food and the top of the can. The effect of this headspace on heat penetration during processing has been investigated. The rate of heat penetration through the headspace is low, typically 7 B.T.U./ft.^ hr. \u00b0F. under ordinary processing conditions. Consequently the slowest heating point of a solid pack is not at its centre but appreciably above it and the relative dis placement of the slowest heating point from the centre is greater in a squat can than in a tall one. Heglect of the thermal resistance of the headspace would cause serious errors in calculating processes from first principles or in estimating equivalent processes for cans of different shapes, but it does not appreciably affect the calculation of processes from heat penetration measurements. Factors affecting the lag factor or j value, used in specifying heat penetration into cans, have also been studied. (c) Design and Performance of Cold Stores.\u2014The experimental work on a survey of the performance of representative Australian fruit cool stores was termi nated last year. The accumulated data have been analysed and are being used in the design and operation of cool stores. Studies of the performance of stores at freezing temperatures have been started. (d) Water Relations.\u2014Work on the determination of equilibrium humidities and the relation between the equilibrium humidity and water content of par ticular materials is continuing. When dried vine fruits are held in a dry atmosphere the approach to a true equilibrium may bo very slow and the significance of experimentally determined vapour pressure isotherms is therefore somewhat doubtful. Observa tions at temperatures in the range 20-50\u00b0 C. have shown that the rate of losing water decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature. It is very low at 20\u00b0 C. and even after twelve months an appreciable quantity of water can be removed by raising the temperature to 50\u00b0 C. Still more water is remolded in the standard oven determination at 70\u00b0 C. (e) Colovr Measurement.-\u2014Instruments are being designed and te-sted for obtaining a precise objective measurement of the changes or differences in colour which arc important in particular storage or processing investigations. (/) Parity Ice.\u2014When packaged frozen foods are held in cold storage, ice crystals tend to accumulate in cavities in the pack. This ice comes from the food itself, and with some products the evaporation which produces it may be enough to cause severe freezerburn, which is an irreversible dessication of parts of the surface of the foodstuff. The physics of cavity ice- formation is being studied with the object of assessing the relative importance of features in the design and handling of the packages. (.d) Freeze Drying.\u2014Modifications of the laboratoryequipment and investigations of the processes of freeze drying of foods and biological materials have been earned out to increase the usefulness of the laboratory freeze driers as experimental tools. (/() Evaporation from Fruit.\u2014Further work hasbeen done on the relation between the rate of evaporation from pears and the drying power of the storage atmosphere.89 3. Food Chemisthy. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) Destruction of Ascorhic Acid (^Vitamin C).\u2014 Tlie studies on tlie anaerobic destruction of ascorbic aeid are related to the loss of ascorbic acid from canned foods in tvhich virtually anaerobic conditions are established vvitliin a short period after canning. Studies of destruction at 30\u00b0 C. over a period of twoyears were completed and the results prepared for publication. The effects of pH, fructose, sucrose, and frnctose-l,6-diphosphate were investigated and _ con sidered in relation to the retention of ascorbic acid by fruit and vegetable products. The yield of furfural and carbon dioxide as products of decomposition was inves tigated. Work was also done on the decomposition of dehydroascorbic acid. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, pectin, and oxalic acid were without effect. (&) Volatile Products of Apples.\u2014There is evidence of some relation between volatile substances and super ficial scald, a functional disorder. Preliminary experi ments last .season gave some indication of a relation between free volatile acids and superficial scald. Oil- wrapped apples are being exposed to low concentrations of volatile acids and esters, and the individual free and esterified acids are being determined in peelings. (c) Natural Coating of Apples.\u2014The studies on the natural lipoid coating of apples are related to the physiological behaviour of stored fruit, a.s the natural coating is the main barrier to gaseous diffusion and hence influences the composition of the internal atmos phere. The chemical constitution of the oil fraction is being investigated. A preliminary separation was undertaken of the fatty acids and neutral substances obtained by saponification. The fatty acids were separated by fractional distillation of methyl esters. The use of the refractive index-density diagram in connexion with this distillation is being developed. The neutral substances were separated by distillation and adsorption and shown to include hydrocarbons, alcohols, and other compaunds. A larger quantity of oil is being obtained for study in the present season. The separation of fatty acids by partition chromato- graphy on powdered rubber, and the separation of alcohols by adsorption chromatography of the coloured phenylazophenylurethanes were also investigated. A further study of the insoluble \" eutin \" is being made. Removal of cell wall material with snail cellulase is under investigation. (d) Determination of Ethylene Dibromide in Air.\u2014 Ethylene dibromide is used for fumigating citrus to destroy fruit fly infestation. A rapid method of deter mining ethylene dibromide in air was developed. (e) Determination of Diplienyl in Fruit Wrapis.\u2014 Determinations were made in connexion with citrus storage experiments. A source of error was found in the published spectrophotometric method, and a modi fied method was adopted. (/) Chemical Reactions in Processed Foods.\u2014The study of the chemical composition of certain raw fruits was continued. This work forms a necessary basis for the investigation of the reactions involved in the browning of fruits when dehydrated and stored. The amino acids in apricots and peaches were studied by paper chromatography and by displacement chroma tography using columns of ion exchange resins. All of the major amino acids and most of the minor ones have been recognized. The carboxylic acids in the same fruits have been separated by displacement chroma tography using anion exchange resins. The major acids have been isolated and identified and many of the minor acids have been recognized. A ketose occurring in apricots, which could not be identified by chromatographic methods, has been shown to be anunknown oligosaccharide containing glucose and fructose. Another unknown ketose occurring in pears awaits investigation, but the other sugars in apricots, peaches, and pears have been recognized. The occur rence of a uronic acid, which is probably galacturonic acid, in pears has been found to depend on the method of ripening the fruit. Peach and apricot purees have now been successfully freeze dried and thi.s material is being allowed to brown at a suitable temperature and moisture content. The chromatographic techniques developed can now be applied in the study of the chemical composition of this material before and after browning. (g) Protein Chemistry.\u2014 (i) Determination of Total Nitrogen in Proteins.\u2014A critical study has been made of the digestion of amino acids and proteins with sulphuric acid. The effects of temperature, catalyst, and oxidizing agent have been specially studied. (ii) Studies in the Denaturation of Proteins.\u2014The denaturation of certain enzymes and proteins by heat, freezing, and urea is being examined. The general aim has been to study the process by following simul taneously the changes in several properties which are sensitive to different kinds of deformation of the protein structure. Special attention is being paid to the solution, viscosity increment, solubility, and ability to combine with heavy metals. (/;) Infra-red Spectroscopy.\u2014The infra-red spectro- graph has been modified during the year and has recently been equipped with a vacuum system for con tinuous evacuation thermocouple detector. Studies in protein chemistry and on the structure of limonin will be materially assisted by this modification. (i) Polarography.\u2014(i) D.C. Instrumentation and Derivative Polarography\u2014Lower limits imposed by overseas authorities for trace elements, particularly lead in canned foods, have necessitated improved methods for this analytical determination. The range of the laboratory's existing recording D.C. polarographic equipment is being extended for this purpose. The technique of derivative polarography is being developed, involving the superposition of a square wave of about 10 c/s. generated and rectified by means of choppers. (ii) Metal-complex Polarography.\u2014The D.C. polaro- graifiiy of the complexes of amino acids and proteins with copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead has been further studied. It is hoped shortly to apply the technique of derivative polarography to this field. (hi) Organic Polarography.\u2014The polarography of organic compounds in alcoholic solution has been further examined. \"With limonin and its derivatives an attempt is being made to extend this work to methanol-benzene solvents. 4. Mioeobiologt of Foods. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) The effects of various environmental factors on the growth and death of food-poisoning and food-spoilage micro-organisms are being studied. Applied studies have consisted mainly of the diagnosis of spoilage in various products, chiefly canned foods. (a) Clostridium botulinum Investigations.\u2014 Although types A and B Cl. botulinum have been responsible for most cases of human botulism, a number of fatalities have been caused by type E strains, and in almost every case fish was the foodstuff concerned. A study of several type E cultures has been continued, and it has been found that they differ from the A and B types in several respects. As type E strains grow well at low temperatures it was thought that they may have a marine origin, but attempts to isolate them from marine muds have not been successful. A paper on the temjierature relations of type A and B strains has been published.90 (h) Bacl.eriul Spores.\u2014Tlie study of those highly resistant forms of bacterial life has been continued. In addition to measurements of heat resistance, experi ments have been carried out on the factors which are necessary for germination of the spores, and on the conditions under which tlie spores are formed. (Jermination is promoted by low concentrations of .several substances and inhibited by traces of other compounds. There are, moreover, consider able unexplained differences between different types of spores both in their requirements for germina tion and their sensitivity to inhibitors. (c) Wafer R'elations of Micro-organisms.\u2014The requirements of representative strains of food poisoning Stapliylococci and Salmonellae have been determined. The data should be useful for predicting the amount of water needed to support the growth of these bacteria in various foods. Studies with other organisms are in progress with the object of ascertaining the water requirements of the various types of food-spoilage organisms, and of the biochemical processes involved in the uptake of water by microbial cells. (d) Mould Wasfage of Stored Fruit.\u2014These investi gations have been suspended until a mycologist is aj)pointed. (e) Freeze Drying of Bacteria.\u2014The drying of bacterial cultures from the frozen state is widely used as a means of preserving cultures. Frequently, how ever, a large percentage of the cells die during the drying process. Various methods for reducing the mortality have been proposed, but the underlying reasons for their success are not understood. Experi ments to improve the biological efficiency of the process have been commenced, and designs considered of appa ratus in which some physical factors can be measured and controlled during drying. Measurements of temperatures of the product being dried have been made in existing apparatus, and these have revealed some problems which will need to be solved. (/) Mould Counts of Tomato Products.\u2014Additional experiments to measure the errors inherent in the standard method of analy.sis have been completed. In general, the errors have been in accord with those expected for a binomial distribution. (g) Spoilage of Meat.\u2014Examples of bone taint in beef have been brought to the notice of the laboratory, and the causal organisms isolated from the spoiled tissues. Although it is rare, this form of spoilage frequently results in total condemnation of affected hindquarters, and the isolated organisms are being studied to determine methods by which spoilage may be controlled. 5. Meat. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) Co-operative Investigations. \u2014 (i) General. \u2014 The co-operation between the Brisbane Laboratory and the Low Temperature Eesearch Station, Cambridge, has been strengthened by the seconding of an animal physiologist and an assistant from Cambridge to work for a period of one to two years at Brisbane. (ii) Freezing of Hot Carcasses.\u2014It seems likely that, if muscle tissue becomes frozen before it passes into rigour, the formation of drip on thawing could he aggravated. Fundamental studies also suggest that holding the frozen carcasses at a temperature just below freezing, just prior to thawing, might offset this effect. Trials are under way to test these questions on carcasses of widely different quality. So far it has been found that only with light weight carcasses is there any possibility that, with existing freezing equipment, an appreciable portion of the carcass will be frozen before rigour occurs. As, liowever, the biochemical changespreceding rigour will all have been taking place at reduced rates, it is still fiossible that the early freezing may have modified the muscle. After a period in frozen storage the material will be examined to deter mine the extent of the biochemical changes, the tendency to drip, and the eating quality. (iii) Modification of Muscle of Beasts Pre-slnugliter. \u2014Laboratory investigations at the Low Temperature Research Station and at Bri.sbane have shown that the tendency for thawed muscle to drip may be influenced both by the calcium-magnesium levels in the muscle and by its acidity. Attempts are in progress to bring thc.sc changes about by controlling the feeding and exercise, or by injection of drug\\s which will alter the blood composition. The effect of these treatments will be studied by following the development of rigour in sections of muscles from the freshly slaughtei'cd carcasses, and by determining the drip and eating quality of the stored, frozen carcasses. {h) Chilled Beef Studies.\u2014A carefully controlled and statistically designed experiment has been set up to study the extent to which carcasses differ in final quality when subjected to chilling and freezing. The initial experiment is to be followed by others in which the time of onset of any such differences will be studied in more detail. (c) Air-horne Contamination.\u2014The existence of dual humidity-sensitive mechanisms in the destruction of air-borne organisms has now been demonstrated at 10\u00b0 C. as well as at 0\u00b0 C. The mechanism operating at low humidity has been shown to be a water activity effect. That at high humidity has not yet been determined, but several possible explanations, such as cold shock and oxygen tension, have been shown to be untenable. (d) Ozone Sterilization.\u2014A detailed study of the dynamics of the decomposition of ozone in the presence of meat has been made in the study of the influence of ozone on the rate of development of organisms on meat. It has been shown that the decomposition of ozone in the presence of meat is a first-order reaction, but the reaction constant is a function of the degree of pre- ozonization of the meat surface. (e) Freezer Burn Studies.\u2014In the study of damage to frozen offals in storage it has now been shown that the severity of the damage to livers is to some extent determined by the fat content, and that it is also affected by the period of storage prior to freezing. 6. Fish. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) Analysis of Australian Fish Species.\u2014Work has been carried out on the measurement of the oil content of Tasmanian barracouta at monthly intervals through out the year. The chief object of this co-operative investigation with the Division of Fisheries was to gather information on the changes in oil content which accompany biological changes in the fish. At the same time, data were obtained to explore the possibility ofusing barracouta offal (heads_ and viscera) for reduc tion to fish meal and oil. Similar work is being carried out Avith other species. Analyses for urea and tri- methylamine oxide content of various sharks and Teleostei have been made. These data will be related to the various kinds of volatile bases, such as ammonia, trimethylamine, and dimethylamine, which are produced during spoilage of the various species of fish. (&) Chemical Methods for Estimation of Spoilage. Further ivork has been carried out on the measure ment ^ of volatile bases, volatile acids, and imlatilereducing substances in fresh and baeteriologically sjioiled fish muscle and in canned fish and shark ivhere heat-breakdown of urea, or trimethylamine oxide, or both has occurred.91 (c) rroccsstnt] Studies.\u2014The development of ammonia and triraetliylamine during the canning and subsequent storage of shark (Galeorhinus australis) has been studied. Pretreatments of the Hash, sueh_ as pre-soakiiig in lactic acid, pre-cooking and draining before canning have been carried out and their effects on the development of volatile bases and of off-flavours in the finished product have been determined. Attempts have been made to improve the quality of canned barracouta by various pretreatments aimed at reducing or masking the intensity of an unpleasant \"metallic\" flavour found in the canned product, 7. Eggs. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (\u00ab) Staragc of Oiled Eggs and Carhon Dioxide Gas- slured Eggs.\u2014The analyses of the comparative results of the storage of oiled and unoiled eggs with eggs stored in carhon dioxide gas mixtures, with respect to the internal quality observed after cold storage of the eggs, have been coin])leted. After storage for fourteen weeks, which is an avei-ago period for storage and transport to the United Kingdom, there are no appreciable differences in the internal quality between unoiled. oiled, and gas-stored eggs. When the storage period was extended to 26 weeks some advantages in internal quality accrued from the oiling and gas storage. How ever, these advantages must be balanced against the disadvantage of decreased percentage of thick white in the oiled and gas-stored eggs as compared with unoiled eggs. (h) Effect of Additires to the Oil.\u2014.Vlumininm and magnesium stearatcs have been added in various con centrations to oil used for coating eggs in order to test the possibilities of improving the properties of the original paraffinic oil. The internal quality of eggs so treated has been compared with that of oiled and unoiled eggs after a period of cold storage. (c) The pTI-Carhon Dioxide Rehdiouship in Egg White.\u2014The relation between the pll and the total carbon dioxide content of the white of oiled eggs and eggs stored in carbon dioxide gas has been determined to elucidate the reactions controlling the pH in the white of oiled eggs. Further work has shown that tlm linear regressions of the pH on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the white are similar for oileTl eggs and eggs stored in carbon dioxide gas mixtures, indicating that the pH change in oiled eggs is largely due to the level of carbon dioxide in the white. (d) Siruchire of Egg White.\u2014The thick portion of egg white has been examined Avith a view to obtaining a quantitative measure of the structural changes occur ring during storage. These changes at present are detected subjectively. (e) Firth Whites in Stored Eggs.\u2014-A condition manifested by a pink coloration in the white of stored eggs appears after fowls have ingested certain plants of the family Malvaceae. Isolation of a fatty acid present in these plants is proceeding in order to deter mine whether it is the cause of this disorder. 8. Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Storage and Transport. (Division of Food Preseiwation and Transport.) (a) General.\u2014The collaborative work with the Uni- A^ersity of Sydney at the Plant Physiological Eesearch Unit and Avith the Hcav South Wales Department of Agriculture at the Citrus Wastage Research Laboratory has continued. During the year Avork has begun in the Botany School, University of Melbourne, AAdierc a research officer and a technical officer have been stationed to carry out plant physiological and bio chemical iiiA-estigations in connexion Avith fruit storage problems.(h) Plant Physiology and Biochemistry.\u2014Work on the iiroperties of the cell surface and its absorbing capacity and on the functional particles in the cell has been continued. The electrical properties of the cell surface haA'e yielded some information as to its ])robablc composition, A\\diich could not be obtained from chemical investigations alone. The large particles (plastids) which are characteristic of plant cells have been investigated and their structure has been shoAvn to include a surface membrane. A membrane has also been found to occur on the smaller particles (mito chondria) AA'hich are characteristic of all cells. In, collaboration Avith the Division of Industrial Chemis try, the thickness of this membrane has been estimated and its permeability to dissoUed substances studied. The results so far indicate that its permeability is consistent Avith a lipoprotein structui'e. The occurrence of the enzymes concerned with oxygen uptake in the process of respiration has been established in the particles isolated from beetroot, carrot, and apple tissues. The mitochondria differ in their ionic composition from the surrounding medium and this difference is partly dependent upon the membrane and indirectly dependent upon the meta bolism necessary to maintain the structure of the ])articles. The sudden rise in respiration, known as the climac teric rise, AA'hich occurs about the time of ripening in most fruit, has been investigated in apples and pears. With apples the results of tests over tivo seasons are consistent Avith the hypothesis that the increase in respiration is due to the increased demands for protein synthesis and maintenance in cells above a certain size. At the same time, the complex of respiratory enzymes, knoAA-n as succinoxidase, has been shoAvn to increase. Similar results, interpreted in a slightly different Avay, have been obtained by some Avorkers in America, using the aA'oeado. Experiments have begun to investigate the corresponding rise in pear respira tion. The study of groAvth of apple fruits has included an examination of the soluble and protein nitrogen con stituents. The amino acids have now been identified and some changes in the relatiA'e amounts have been observed. The balance in young fruit is upset by removal from the tree. Some differences Avere obtained hctAveen amino acids occurring in fruits and in dormant tAvigs. The synthetic processes are connected with the liberation of energy in the respiration process largely by the specific, substances termed phosphate carriers. .Estimation of the more important phosphate carriers of plant tissue is important to explain the control, not only of growth, hut also of normal cell activity in the resting cells of stored fruits and vegetables. The estimation of these important phosphate carriers is being studied at the Melbourne University Botany School. The relation of fruit size to cell size and cell number had previously been shown to influence the behaviour of fruits of different sizes in store. Fruits of the Delicious variety groAvn on the Avest coast of America and groAvn in Kcav South Wales have been compared. Preliminary results indicate that the American fruit is larger than the Australian fruit because of a larger liumher of cells (not a greater cell size) and this probably accounts for their better storage behaA'iour. The pea, one of the most important A'-egetahle crops, has a narroAv margin of optimum maturity for use either in the home or in commercial processing. The ]ihysiology of maturation of peas is being iuA'cstigated. Experiments haA'e been made in Avhieh blossoms have been tagged so that peas of knoAvn age could he analysed for cell size and number, protein and92 total nitrogen, and carbohydrate content. The rapid increase of starch and protein nitrogen during matura tion make this material useful for a general hiooheinical study. (c) T'echnology.\u2014(i) Orchard Variahility in Apples.\u2014The work on the apple varieties Delicious and Granny Smith was carried out for five seasons to determine the variahility in storage behaviour and its possible correlation with size of fruit, different trees, different orchards, and different seasons. The statisti cal analysis of the large quantity of data has been carried out by the Section of Mathematical Statistics. There is evidence that the different stocks on which apple trees are grown affect the storage life of the fruits. The effects of different stocks on storage life of Jonathan and Delicious from the stock trials of the N\"ew South Wales Department of Agriculture at Bathurst have been investigated. This will be com pared with similar work being done at the Organiza tion's orchard at Stanthorpe, Queensland. (ii) Numher of Days to Maturity.\u2014The results of the experiment to test whether the number of days from full blossom is the best criterion of maturity for picking apples for long storage indicate that the method is not better than the recommended method used in most districts of Australia, which is the change in ground colour of the fruit. (iii) Temperature of Storage.\u2014With the better con trol of temperature now possible in commercial stores, fruit may be stored nearer to its freezing point with much less risk of actual freezing. This results in a marked improvement in storage life of many fruits. With the apple varieties Granny Smith and Delicious significant differences have been obtained in the storage life at temperatures of 30\u00b0, 32\u00b0, and 34\u00b0 E. (iv) Superficial Scald in Apples.\u2014Superficial scald is troublesome in Australian Granny Smith apples, particularly in Western Australia. While this disorder is generally controlled by the use of oiled wraps, it is, desirable to know whether fruit which will develop scald can be detected prior to the appearance of the marked symptoms. The cells in the immediate region of the skin are being studied microscopically to deter mine whether any changes can be detected in incipient scald. (v) Delay before Storage of Pears.\u2014Many Aus tralian districts find difficulty in obtaining rapid storage and cooling of pears after picking. This led to an investigation of effects of delay and rates of cooling on respiration and storage life of both William Bon Chretien and Packham's Triumph pears. The effects of a given delay can now be defined fairly precisely for these two varieties. Picking at the optimum maturity is of great importance and, once cooling has started, it should be as rapid as possible. (vi) Batting in Winter Cole Pears.\u2014Investigations of the conditions leading to attack by blue and grey mould in Winter Cole pears has shown the importance of careful handling. Careless handling results in injury at the stage where fruit is exposed to mould infection in the packing houses. (vii) Storage of New Varieties of Stone Fruits.\u2014 Investigation of the storage life of new varieties of peaches, nectarines, and plums grown on the Bathurst Experimental Farm has heen continued. (viii) Orange Storage.\u2014In the citrus wastage investigations a dip mixture of sodium phenylphenate and hexamine in controlling green mould wastage in oranges has been successful. The new treatment is more promising than the borax, boric acid, and wax process previously tested. Paper wraps impregnatedwith diphenyl are as effective as the horax dip treatment in reducing gi-een mould wastage and more effective in reducing stem-end rots. (ix) Lemon Storage.\u2014Work over several seasons in collaboration with Dr. T. B. Kiely (Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture) has shoAvn that coastal main-crop lemons will keep in good condition in orchard shed storage for as long as six months with less than 5 per cent, lors and with 99 per cent, retention of fresh green colour in the buttons. _ The successful treatment consists of dipping fruit, picked in June at the light green to silver stage of maturity, in a mixture of 2,4-D and the fungicide \" Shirlan W.S.\". Field trials have indicated that stem-end rot in storage can be controlled to some extent by appropriate Bordeaux sprays. (x) Fungicides.\u2014More than 50 new chemical treat ments for wastage control in oranges have been screened. Hothing better than sodium phenylphenate and diphenyl has so far been obtained. (xi) Spore-load Investigations.\u2014In collaboration with Dr. T. B. Kiely, the influence of known levels of loading with spores of green mould on the subsequent wastage in oranges has been investigated further. Methods have been developed for loading to standard spore loads and for estimating the actual surface spore load both in those artificially loaded and those carrying the natural spore load. This work is being used to determine the effectiveness of various factors in com bating mould wastage. (xii) Characteristics of a Good Keeping Orange.\u2014 For many years it has been said that fruit with a smooth skin is less susceptible to mould wastage than fruit with a rough skin but little critical work has been done. Experiments on fruit with different degrees of smoothness of the rind treated with standard spore loads showed that smooth-skinned Navels kept sig nificantly better than rough-skinned Navels but no significant differences were found with Valencias. (xiii) Orchard Varieties and Storage Behaviour.\u2014 In collaboration with the Irrigation Research Station, Griffith, work is being continued on the storage behaviour of fruits from different trees grown under the control conditions on Farm Block 466. Owing to the shortage of fruit in the 1952 season the experiment could not be repeated but the fruit is being stored again in the 1953 season. (xiv) Grapes\u2014Substitute Paching Material.\u2014In collaboration with the Division of Forest Products, experiments have been carried out to compare Aus tralian sawdusts as packing material to replace the standard granulated cork. The sawdusts used were radiata pine, mountain ash, karri, and jarrah. Results indicated that sawdust, which is much cheaper than cork, may be satisfactory for grapes of the Ohanez variety. (xv) Control of Fruit Fli/.\u2014Investigations of the effects of the vapour heat-treatment and of fumigation with ethylene dibromide on the behaviour of common varieties of fruit are almost completed. The limits of tolerance of the different varieties have been defined. Experiments have been carried out in collaboration with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture to determine the effects of the treatments on the insects in fruit. 9. Canning and Fruit Products. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) Vegetable Canning.\u2014One further season's work on peas in Tasmania and New South Wales has confirmed the usefulness of the maturometer designed^ by this Organization for following the maturation of pea crops and for providing information03 wliicli permits accurate prediction of the optimal harvest date two or three days in advance. Prior knowledge of this date enables the canner to plan orderly harvesting and to maintain uniform high quality in the canned pea pack. This procedure has been termed the short-term prediction of maturity in pea crops. Long-term prediction, on the other hand, requires an accurate assessment of the number of days from sowing to maturity. Statistical analysis of data for 180 jDea crops, grown in eight districts in Tasmania, showed that the relations between sowing date and days- to-maturity could be expressed as a series of straight lines, which fall into early and late season groups. Within each group there was a common rate of matura tion of the crops. Long-term prediction of pea crop maturity thus becomes a practical possibility, and the planning of canners' planting programmes can be greatly simplified. Attempts were made to extend these techniques of maturity assessment to crops of green beans for can ning. It appears, however, that the maturometer re quires modification for use with green beans. The advent of mechanical bean-pickers makes it necessary to regard green beans as a one-pick crop. Investigations on two crops of Landreth Stringless beans indicated that the yield of canning quality beans from a single pick was about 10 per cent, less than the potential yield of the crop by successive pickings. Practically the same yields were obtained whether the crop was picked at three, four, five, or six day intervals. Tomato breeding trials were continued with the object of developing a tomato with improved canning charac teristics. Canning tests and chemical analyses were made on twelve standard varieties, fourteen selections from the 1952 trials, and first and second generation hybrids from fourteen crosses. The hybrid tomatoes showed increased yields without loss of quality. A number of field factors, as yet undefined, infiuence the quality and composition of tomatoes to a greater extent than variety. (b) Fruit Canning.\u2014The effect of maturity at pick ing on the quality of apricots for canning was investi gated, using the Trevatt and Moorpark varieties. Moor- park apricots showed best quality in the can when picked immature and\" ripened artificially. The Trevatt apricots, however, then picked immature, ripened to satisfactory colour and texture but were excessively acid in flavour. In a storage and ripening trial, Trevatt apricots were cool-stored for four weeks and ripened to satisfactory canning quality. The effect of maturity at picking on quality was also examined for the J. II. Hale variety of freestone peach. Again it was found that peaches picked immature and ripened artificially gave a better canned product than tree-ripened fruit. The freestone variety, Eio Oso Gem, was tested and found to be a suitable canning variety but not as good as J. H. Hale. Investigations directed towards improvement of the quality of Tasmanian canned solid-pack apple were continued. Treatment with calcium salts gives a firmer product Avith better colour, and could be usefully applied to over-mature fruit and some early, soft varieties. The addition of some water to the pack is desirable for technological and economic reasons and it was found that 8-12 oz. could be added to a Ho. 10 (6-lb.) can without affecting the quality. The quality of canned berry fruits is also capable of considerable improvement and investigations were commenced on the specific problems of collapse and disintegration, and low drained Aveights. Samples of Tasmanian raspberries, loganberries, gooseberries, and blackcurrants, covering a range \"of varieties and maturities, were collected and analysed to provide data on chemical composition, which it is hoped will provide a basis for standard specifications for berry pulps.Berry fruits frozen in 4-gallon cans provided rkw materials for jam manufacture much superior in quality to heat-processed pulps. (c) Fruit Juices.\u2014The marked influence of root- stocks on the quality of canned orange juice was con firmed in the 1952-53 season. Poncirus trifoliata when used as a rootstock for Washington Havel or Valencia oranges gives fruit of superior quality, and canned juice from this fruit is free from bitterness at an early stage of maturity. Rough Lemon rootstock with the same scions gives fruit of poor quality and canned juice that is bitter at all stages of maturity. A number of other rootstocks examined showed effects on fruit and juice quality intermediate between these extremes. The chemistry of limonin, the main bitter principle of oranges, was further studied but it is not yet possible to define the structure of the molecule. Some explora tory studies on the biogenetic relations of limoninand associated bitter principles indicated that they occur in detectable amounts only in fruit of the orange tree, where they are concentrated in the seeds and the albedo, and that they disappear from all parts of the fruit as it matures. (d) Container Investigations.\u2014A need exists for a reliable test procedure for acid-resisting internal lacquers for cans. An acidified aqueous extract of beet root tissue, containing the anthocyanin pigment betanin, showed promise as a test medium. Corrosion reactions in tinplate containers cause bleaching of the pigment and the extent of bleaching can be followed quantitatively. _ The problem of sulphide staining in cans of food high in protein has prompted investigations on the liberation of labile sulphur from animal tissues during heat processing. A polarographic procedure is being used to determine sulphydryl groups and the rate of their disappearance on heating. During the year sixteen commercial acid-resisting lacquers and twelve sulphur-resisting lacquers were examined for suitability as internal lacquers for food cans. In addition, a number of lacquer treatments, intended for glass container closures, were tested on electrolytic and hot-dipped tinplates. (e) Equipment.\u2014An experimental pressure spin- cooker has been constructed for processing canned foods in steam under pressure, the can being rotated axially dAiring processing. The forced convection induced by this rotation increases the rate of heating of the product so that the total cooking time is greatly reduced and the quality of the product is enhanced. The usefulness of the spin-cooking procedure has been demonstrated for acid foods, and it is now hoped, by means of the pressure unit, to extend the principle to the processing of low-acid foods such as vegetables. 10. Dehydrated Foods. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) (a) V egctables.\u2014Following the preliminary work of last year which confirmed the beneficial effect of starch coating on the storage life of dehydrated carrot, potato starch Avas fractionated and the resulting amylose and amylopectin fractions applied as processing treatments to carrots. A Avhole-starch treatment and untreated material were also included. This material was stored to study the rates of deterioration. The rate of deterioration of dehydrated vegetables increases with increasing moisture content. Since air- drying to loAV levels of moisture content is uneconomic, other means of reducing moisture are sought. One of these is the use of \" in-package\" desiccants. The drying agent, in its own package which allows transfer of water vapour, is enclosed in the container holdingthe dried vegetable. The prerequisites of such a desic- cant include (1) high water adsorption at low relative94 humidities, (2) non-toxicity, (3) lack of flavour and odour, and (-1) cheapness. Some bentonite clays pos,sess these attributes, and samples of Australian clays have been obtained to compare with tyj)es in use in the i'nited States of America. Preliminary trials have resulted in satisfactory dry ing of sweet corn, sweet peppers, and green beans (stringiess varieties). (h) Fruit.\u2014At the request of the Dried Fruits Pro cessing Committee, samples of dehydrated halved and sliced freestone peaches were i)repared for distribution to bodies interested in the production of dehydrated tree fruits. Equipment necessary for the study of uptake of sulphur dioxide gas by fruit before drying has been installed. That dealing with air speed and temperature has been tested and found satisfactory. The thermal conductivity equipment for the control of concentration of sulphur dioxide is not yet satisfactory and is being adjusted. Concentration of sulphur dioxide gas in a small .sulphur-burning box has been determined. A maximum figure of 4 per cent, was obtained, while, on many occasions, it was only 1 per cent. (c) Dehydrated Sugared Fruit.\u2014The chief study on this product was the storage characteristics of material prepared from syrups which had been used many times. A trade report on the storage of sugared fruit was prei)ared at the request of the Dried Fruits Processing- Committee. (d) Meat Dehydration.\u2014(i) Compression of Dehy- drnte.d Mutton Mince.\u2014The compression of dried mince results in an appreciable saving in packing space and tinplate, and also it prolongs considerably the shelf life. It is accompanied, however, by some damage to the texture, the extent of which is governed by the com- jiression technique. The investigations were extended to imdude the examination of a new technique, the results of which were satisfactory. (ii) Effects of Different Parts of th e Carcass on Quality.\u2014Only certain jjarts of a mutton carcass are suitable for slicing and the remainder would be dried a= mince. Consequently it was necessary to investigate the effects of different parts of the carcass on initial quality and storage life of the dried meat. (iii) Gas Paching.\u2014It had been demonstrated earlier that the packaging of dried meat in an inert atmosphere extends considerably the storage life. How ever, in commercial practice it would be difficult and costly to produce packs virtually free of oxygen. Ex- jjcrimcnts were carried out to obtain a measure of the effects of different levels of oxygon in nitrogen packs .and also of the effects of different total amounts of gas in the packs. (iv) Addition of Flavouring Materials.\u2014Because dried mutton is rather bland in flavour, it was con sidered that the addition, during processing, of small amounts of flaVoui-ing materials would enhance the flavour and help to mask stale flavours produced during storage, without limiting its usage. A consumer pre ference panel is being used to evaluate the effects of a number of additives. (v) Storage of Dried Mince and Dried Slices.\u2014A fairly comprehensive storage iJrogranime has been con tinued throughout the year. The variables include time of storage, temperature of storage, and type of pack. Deterioration increases with increasing time of storage, increasing temperature of storage and increasing amounts of oxygen in the cans.11. Fiiozbjn Fbuits and Vegetables. (Division of Food Preservation and Transport.) Work on the freezing of fruit and vegetables is con ducted co-operatively with the Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture. The programme of test ing varieties, evaluating methods of j^reparation, and investigating such raw material factors as maturity and handling practice in relation to the quality of the frozen product -(vas continued. (a) Fruits.\u2014The testing of varieties of freestone peaches for freezing which has extended over several seasons was continued. Sufficient data have now been collected to give a fairly reliable estimate of the freezing- characteristics of several local varieties. Similar work is in progress on apricots, cherries, plums, pineapples, mangoes, and berry fruits. Experiments on frozen cherries had previously provided information on the behaviour of varieties 23i'epared in different ways and therefore no new work on cherries was undertaken last season. Chemical Avork on the browning of peaches during freezing is still in progress. Special attention has been given to the eflhct of added ascorbic acid, and of the tannin and polyphenolase content of the peaches. Pre liminary work on pineapples Avas commenced Avith the object of studying raAV material factors associated with the deA-elojjinent of off-flavours in the frozen produce. A detailed iuAmstigation of the use of sulphur dioxide in the freezing of Moorpark apricots Avas begun. (b) Vegetables.\u2014More attention has again been given to the freezing of peas than to other vegetables. The application of methods of maturity prediction develojAcd lor canning f)eas has been successfully extended to jAcas for freezing. Eurther data have been collected on the determination of the maturity range associated Avith the highest accep tability in frozen peas. Investigations on the effect of handling- and delay before processing on the quality of frozen peas have been extended to factory conditions. This lAi-oject has been in pro gress for several seasons and the results so far obtained have given a clearer picture of the deterioration occur ring in i-aAv peas caused by delays at different stages of preparation. The use of preepoling as a means of arresting deterioration has been investigated by observ ing changes in palatability and by chemical analysis of the frozen peas. (c-)_ Other Investigations.\u2014The installation of an experimental air-blast freezer has been completed and equipment for controlling air floAA' and temperature measurement has been fitted. This unit will be used for studies of freezing rates in relation to factors such as package size, air speed, and temperature. SeA'eral iiGAV packaging materials Avere tested for moisture vapour_ permeability and suitability for frozen food packaging. 12. Dried Vine Fruit. ((ffiminonwealth Eesearch Station, Merbein.) Further laboratory trials liaA'c been made of the1 enioA al of the bloom \" from the surface of graiies by immersion in Avarm ethylene dichloride. These have noAA'^ been extended to include the currant and gordo in addition to the sultana. The extracts, after remoA'alof soIa ent, haA'e proA'ided the- starting points for chemical and physical examination of materials known to be of complex composition. -Vs a preliminary to studies on the influence of variousinternal factors on the drying of grapes, experimental Avork has been carried out to establish a samplingtechnique for grapes. Variations in sugar content trom berry to berry on individual bunches have been included in this study.95 As part of an investigation on permeabilities of grapes to water, both as liquid and vapour, rates of water loss and uptake through the cuticles of untreated currants, sultanas, and gordos have been determined. An assembly of appropriate anti-oxidants and an investigation of analytical techniques for detection of rancidity in edible oils have been made in connexion with the search for a suitable substitute for paraffin oil used in the final stages of packing-house processing of dried vine fruits. From time to time, prohibitions or restrictions of the use of paraffin oil have been promul gated by certain countries importing dried fruits. For this reason, work on substitute oils, begun some years ago, will be continued as opportunity arises. Studies were also extended to ethyl formate which is an additive in the final treatment in the packaging of dried vine fruits. Trials continued with various dipping oils for pro cessing of sultanas before drying have again demon strated the effectiveness of the modern oils in the cold dip for sultanas. Among the hot di])s for sultanas, the .sulphite dip developed by the Station was applied by a number of growers at Woorinen last season with very satisfactory results. It has been found that increase in dipping time from 1 to 16 seconds in sulphite dip produced pro gressive increases in drying rate and lighter coloured fruit. Further trials of rack dehydration have been conducted at Woorinen with particular reference to sultanas dipj)ed in hot sulphite dip. Experience in a trial of dehydration of a full rack of green fruit with the equipment available indicated that greater capacity may be required in the heating unit and that modifica tions may be necessary in the duct work used to conduct heated air into the rack space in order to attain more uniform distribution of heated air along the rack space. 13. Wine. (Ocnological Investigations, Waite Agricultural Research Institute.) The investigations directed by the Committee on Oenological Research, which comprises representatives of the Organization, the Federal Viticultural Council, the Australian Wine Board, and the University of Adelaide, have been continued at the Waite Agricul tural Research Institute. (a) Sherry Investigations.\u2014The results of the inves tigations have been published by the Australian Wine Board in the form of a monograph; work on this subject has been discontinued for the present. (h) Wine I easts.\u2014The results of the laboratory testing of wine yeasts in the Waite Institute culture collection have been collated and prepared for publica tion. Further investigations have been conducted on the development of improved strains of yeasts by habi- tuation procedures. Results to hand indicate that the ability of some strains of yeasts to ferment at high temperatures has been increased by habituation, but general conclusions would be premature at this stage. An important aspect of the investigations is the study of the influence of conditions of culture and storage on the stability of the habituated strains of yeasts, and work has been started along these lines. (c) Bacterial Decomposition of Organic Acids in Dry MOnes.\u2014The decomposition of malic acid by bacteria is among the more important changes occur ring during the maturation of dry wines in Europe. Since this reduces the sourness of wines, it is often desirable but may be undesirable in some wines. The decomposition of tartaric acid, on the other hand, is usually associated with spoilage. A programme ofinvestigations has been commenced with the object of determining the occurrence of these changes in Aus tralian dry wines, their influence on the wine quality, and the methods by which they can be controlled. 14. Daiky Pkoducts. (Dairy Research Section.) (ft) The 'Utilization of Skim-milk Solids.\u2014One of the main justifications for dairy-farming as a method of land use, the outstanding ability of the dairy cow to change pasture into protein, calcium, and riboflavin in the form of high quality human food, is only valid if the non-fat milk solids do in fact find their way to human consumption. In seeking improvement in the utilization of skim-milk solids as one of its major objec tives, the Dairy Research Section has given first attention to the development of a form of non-fat milk solids suitable for addition to bread. Details of the experimental work and the method of manufacturing the modified skim-milk powder have been published. The product has proved very satisfactory, and with it bread of high quality contining up to 12 per cent, of milk powder has been produced. Commercial produc tion in Australia is now of the order of 500 tons per annum. Technical advice on manufacture has been given to several dairy factories. The utilization of buttermilk for the same purpose was investigated. The baking quality of dried butter milk was found to respond to the addition of hromate, glyceryl monostearate, and stearin in the same way as skim milk, and the optimum levels for these additions were found to be of the same order. Commercial buttermilk may sometimes be too alkaline, in which case the addition of acid is desirable. Storage tests were undertaken to see whether milk powder could possibly be added to flour at the flour mill. After three months there was no indication of deteriora tion in flavour or performance. \"Work was continued on egg substitute--a product made from skim milk ivith treatments differing accord ing to the particular property of egg to be replaced. The substitute for egg-white in meringues and similar confectionery, reported last year, is undergoing commer cial development, and help has been given in its large- scale production. A substitute for whole-egg in sponge cakes has been developed to the point where under laboratory conditions SO per cent, of the eggs in the standard recijie may be replaced. Further work will be necessary. This work is part of a wider project for the development of neiv food forms from milk, and greater understanding of the physical and chemical changes involved must lead to more rapid progress. Technical assistance has been given in the commer cial production in Australia of yoghurt. (h) Oxidized Flavour in Milk.\u2014^Previous work had shown that \" oxidized flavour a prominent defect in bottled milk in Australian cities, contained two com ponents, one derived from oxidation of the butterfat, and one from the oxidation of skim-milk constituents. The chemical nature of the latter component, which may be isolated by steam distillation, is being investi gated. From the 2,000 gallons or so of skim milk which has been distilled there has been obtained about 0.2 g. of admixture of carbonyl compounds. These have been studied by preparation of the 2,4-dinitrophenyl- hydrazones and hy chromatographic and other means,and appear to differ in important respects from carbonyl comjiounds isolated from oxidized butterfat. (c) Susceptibility of Butterfat to Oxidation.\u2014Cold storage of butter has become increasingly important in_ Australia _ in recent years. The problem of main taining quality and bringing the butter to the con sumer throughout the year at the highest possiblequality level is a complex one, but the checking of oxidative deterioration is one of its major elements.96 Studies on variation in tlie inherent susceptibility to oxidation of butterfats produced in the different dairy ing districts at various times of the year, and of the correlation of this with their content of certain un- saturated fatty acids and tocopberol, have been continued. The extent to which samples of butter from the various dairying districts could he relied upon as sources of butterfat for such studies has been given attention. Fats churned from sweet cream appear to be more susceptible to oxidation than those churned from ripened cream neutralized to the same pH. (d) Weed Taint in Butter.\u2014Woyk on the physio logical mechanism by which Lepidiaim spp. (pepper- cress) give rise to a high content of indole and skatole in milk and cream has stopped. It was possible to show that the effect of ingestion of Lepidium^ by the runiinant is to interfere with the normal detoxication of indole and skatole, thus giving rise to high levels of these compounds in the blood stream. (e) Structure of Dairy Products.\u2014Agitation of milk takes place by accident or design in many manu facturing processes. The behaviour of milk fat on the surfaces created during agitation frequently affects the efficiency of processes and the quality of the resultant product. By means of an overflow device the behaviour of fat globules on milk surfaces has been studied. Fresh milk surfaces free of fat show a rapid influx of fat globules when the surface is disturbed. The rising of air bubbles to the surface induces a similar effect, to gether with clumping of the globules and the formation of small patches of free fat. Such patches of fat may on disruption of the surfaces give rise to fat particles so small that they would not be recovered in the separa tion of milk or the churning of cream. A q lantitative method for the study of fat globule behaviour on such surfaces has been developed and used. The secondary structure of butter\u2014the presence of cracks or lines of weakness\u2014has been studied by the use of porous plates to absorb the liquid fat which normally acts as cementing material. Phase-contrast microscopy has been applied to this problem. The j)ar- ticles arc on the very limits of visibility, but the method may prove useful for some purposes. (/) Cheese Starter Studies.\u2014A stock of efficient single-strain starter cultures has been established, to gether with a large number of bacteriophage races to permit tyj)ing of new strains. A visit to jSTew Zealand permitted full beneflt to be derived from the original work in this field which has taken place there. The cultures originally brought from England had been selected because they were not affected by the phenomenon of \" winter slowness \" which occurs in the milk there. A similar and probably identical phenomenon has been apparent in many Australian dairying districts this season. The series of non- inhibited starters has been extended by the isolation of two further strains of suitable bacteriophage relation ship. The cultures, which are distributed to cheese factories by State Departments of Agriculture, are being increasingly used in the industry, giving more rapid manufacture and assisting to lower costs and improve quality. Ultraviolet light was found to be effective in the destruction of air-borne bacteriophage. Streptococcus diacetilactis was found to be a conimon constituent of commercial starters in Australia; its effect on cheese quality was studied. The behaviour of individual strains in blended and multiple cultures,^ and phage- carrying phenomena, have also been investigated. (g) Siveeiened Condensed Milk.\u2014Approximately the same correlation was found between the refractive index of sweetened condensed milk and its total solids contentas between specific gravity and total solids. Neithp determination alone would give a better accuracy in controlling the condensing process than \u00b1 1 per cent, total solids. Colour, viscosity, and pH measurements were made on samples of sweetened condensed milk bought by officers of the Department of Commerce and Agricul ture as representative of the milk available in the world's main markets. Assistance was given to the Department and to the industry in the study of the causes of defects in samples of Australian sweetened condensed milk. (/() Other Investigations.\u2014Minor studies have_ in cluded the effect of \"Heoprene\" and of a polyvinyl chloride lining, possibly useful materials in the con struction of dairy processing equipment, on milk ffavour, and their resistance to cleansing treatments; the relation of type of milk powder to the quality of reconstituted milk; the sterilization of chocolate milk; and improvements to the volumetric methods of fat estimation in milk and cream. XIV. FOEEST PEODUCTiS. 1. General. Australia possesses a great variety of timbers, many of which are of considerable commercial value. Funda mental data regarding properties, potentialities, and correct methods of treatment are essential to the full and proper exploitation of our timber resources. The work of the Organization in this field is carriedout by its Division of Forest Products which has its laboratories in Melbourne and the work of this Divi sion for the current year is reported in this Chapter. Some work on timber pests is undertaken by the Divi sion of Entomology (see Chapter IX.). Division of Forest Products.\u2014The aim of this Divi sion is to give direct assistance to all concerned in the utilization of forest resources. Its work is directed to the more effective use of these resources by_ reducing waste in forest, mill, and factory; by reducing losses from decay and insect attack; and by improving the quality of timber produced in the growing forest by a study of the relationship between silvicultural treat ment and timber properties. Although the timber and_ allied industries^ have operated at a reduced level, this has not resulted in py reduction of requests for assistance from the Division. The industry has never been so conscious of the needfor improving standards, efficiency, and techniques and has drawn very freely on the Division for advice. In the whole field of the Division's work the number ofinquiries has risen to 8,000 per year and the number of visitors to the Division has increased to 1,600. A ten-day course in forest products was given to the fourth-year students of the Australian Forestry School, Canberra, and the courses for forestry and architec tural students of Melbourne University and for the Supply Management Glass and the Building Science Class at the Melbourne Technical College were con tinued. The special course of a week for third-year students of the Victorian Forestry School, Creswick, was repeated again this year. A number of lectures and talks were given to outside establishments interested in the rvork of the Division. The Forest Products Eesearch Conference held in Xovember, 1952, was well attended with delegates from State Forest Services, the Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau, other Commonwealth organizations, and the New Guinea Department of Forests. The Pulp and Paper Co-operative Eesearch Conference was held at the beginning of the year and was attended by technical officers from the contributing companies. The97 Division also took part in the Seventh Australian Pulp and Paper Industry Technical Association Conference and in the Eastern States Timber Industry Stabiliza tion Conference in Hobart. Dr. W. E. Cohen, Officer-in-charge of the Wood Chemistry Section, was seconded for three months to F.A.O. Head-quarters in Eome; Mr. E. E. Turnbull, Officer-in-charge of the Utilization Section, attended the second session of the E.A.O. Asia-Pacific Forestry and Forest Products Commission in Singapore; and the Chief of the Division attended the Sixth Eritish ConimonAvealth Forestry Conference held during the , year in Canada. The help and co-operation of the paper companies, the Commonwealth Forestry and Timber Bureau, the State Forest Services, the Hew Guinea Department of Foi'ests, and all branches of the timber and allied indus tries are gratefully acknowledged. 2. Wood and Fidke Steuctuke. (Division of Forest Products.) (a) Anatomical Investigations.\u2014(i) Wood.\u2014The study of the anatomy of the woods of the Myrtaceae occurring in the south-west Pacific area has been com pleted and accepted for publication in the Australian Journal of Botany. Woods of the Burseraceae and Cunoniaceae from the same area are being examined. In view of the recent description of sixteen new species of Nothofagus from the Hew Guinea area, an examina tion of the wood anatomy of certain of these species has been made in comparison with that of the species occurring in Australia, Hew Zealand, and South America. Work has continued on various Australian, Hew Guinea, Horth Borneo, and Solomon Island timbers which have not been previously examined anatomically. (ii) Barl'.\u2014During the year a considerable number of specimens from various species of the genus BucalyjAvs has boon collected and, to date, 7G.u samples from 220 species have been sectioned and examined. From these investigations it is now possible to make a grouping of species on bark characteristics and to com pare such a grouping with that published by Blakely on anther characteristics. In some species of eucalypts considerable variation in bark anatomy has been ob.served. In such cases many samples have been collected over a wide range of trees from different localities in order to assess the variability both within and between trees. The evaluation of hybridization between certain eucalypt species has been carried out in collaboration with taxonomists interested in this field. It is possible that the range of variation in some .species mentioned above is due in some degree to hybridization. (h) Identifications and Identification Methods.-\u2014 Over 800 timbers have been identified, many of these coming from ti-ade sources. Government Departments and individuals. On the other liand, quite a large proportion were specimens obtained through field collections in Hew Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Horth Queensland. In such cases identifications based on wood anatomy were carried out to assist final botanical determinations of the material collected. Identification keys have now been prepared for the various timber species occurring in mangrove associa tions and full anatomical details of each timber investigated have been recorded. Cards covering 25 Horth Queensland timbers not originally included in the card-sorting key for commercial Australian timbers have now been prepared and copies sent to Forestry Schools and State Forest Services. Thirty-six addi tional sets of the card-sorting keys based on microscopic features have been distributed. Further work has been F.5189.\u20147completed on Horth Borneo timbers and the results transferred to cards for inclusion in the card-sorting key developed for the timbers of this region. (c) Cell Wall and Fibre Studies.\u2014(i) Hydrolysis Batterns. \u2014 The patterns developed when acid hydrolysed (fibres are oven-dried or swollen in alkali are well known but not satisfactorily explained. Pos sible factors causing the development of such patterns have therefore been investigated. On the basis of techniques involving the electron microscope and polarization optics it has been concluded that the patterns arise from preferential hydrolysis in the region of the cell wall deformations and, in part, from the operation of stresses during drying. They are in no way associated with any intrinsic structural feature of tlie cell wall as suggested by other workers. (ii) Cell Wall Organization.\u2014Examination of oanibial cell walls by means of the electron microscope lias revealed the presence of a structure approximating the so-called \" fibroid \" texture with both transversely and longitudinally oriented micellar strands. The relative orientation of the micellar helices in the different layers of the secondary wall has now been definitely established. In earlier work the angle of micellar orientation in the middle layer of the secondary wall\u2014this angle is an important faetor in determining wood properties\u2014was shown to depend on cell dimensions. However, specimens of Finns taeda and P. caribaea grown in Queensland and recently examined show this dependence to a markedly less degree and the possibility that some other factor influences micellar orientation in these species must be considered. (iii) Cell J^ength.\u2014The variation in tracheid length throughout a 36-year-old tree of Finns radiala has been studied. At each of the fifteen levels investigated the tracheid length increased rapidly over the first ten growth rings from the centre outwards, after which there were only small fiuctuations. The longest tracheids were found in the outer rings between 20 and 30 feet above ground level in this tree which was 82 feet high. The work designed to produce trees of I', rudiata of high average tracheid length has been continued in co-operation with the Forestry and Timber Bureau, Canberra. (iv) Fibres of New Guinea Timbers.\u2014Considerable information has been obtained on the fibre dimensions and the ratio of wall thickness to lumen diameter in various specimens of mangrove species and in specimens of hoop and klinki pines. This information has been required in connexion with the pulping studies of Hew Guinea timbers. (v) Examinntion of Fibres from Various Eucalypts. \u2014To supply information on fibre dimensions of various species of the genus Eucalyptus being used for pulping, determinations have been made of average fibre length, .Tvcr.ngo fibre diameter, and the ratio of cell wall tliicknc.ss to cell diameter in representative samples of fifteen specie.s of pale-coloured eucalypts. (d) Tension Wood.\u2014-The fundamental structural characteristics of tension wood have been investigated by microchemical and X-ray diffraction methods in an extension of earlier work on this typo of reaction wood. -\\8 a result several loads have been obtained relative to the causes of the abnormal behaviour of this tissue, e.g. development of woolliness in sawing. A developmental study has revealed a series of morphological features associated with its formation, and some of these appear to correspond with features observed in eucalypt woods of good quality for the production of groundwood. In this connexion the point of fundamental importance appears to be the degree of lignifieation in the tissues and this is intimately cori'elatod with geotropic98 response. Investigations have therefore begun on the distribution of lignin in the cell wall using techniques of ultraviolet absorption and electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction studies of types of tension Avood containing the distinct inner gelatinous layer reveal an exceptionally high micellar orientation and, in fact, the diagrams obtained closely resemble those from ramie. The X-ray diagram of typical tension wood can thus be regarded as one in which a diagram of highly oriented cellulose is superimposed on the more diffuse diagram of normal wood. (e) Growth Siudiea.\u2014(i) rinus taeda and P. caribaea.\u2014The growth pattern in the wood laid down oA'er a twelve-month period has been determined for the above two species using samples taken from three posi tions in 36 trees of each. Results obtained for both species show that there was no actual cessation of radial groAvth throughout the year although it Avas least pro nounced in September. Radial groAvth was considerable betAveen September and Xovember, Avhen typical early Avood Avas being formed; this corresponds to the period of most marked height groAvth. During December to March early Avood Avas .still being laid doAvn, but in the period Marcli to August, when tliere Avas no height groAvth, most of the groAvth ring Avas formed. Between June and August late Avood developed. Prom these preliminary results it Avould appear that most radial growth takes place in the period of least height groAvth. (ii) Radial Fissures in the Early Wood of Conifers. \u2014In certain conifers excess of Avater loss over uptake during late wood formation may cause partial collapse and radial cleavages in the early wood. Living ray cells are exposed in the cavity formed by the cleavage and are stimulated to active groAvth. Different species shoAv different responses to this powerful groAvth stimulus. Thus the cavities fill with cellular tis.sue in radiata pine, Avith resin in Douglas fir, and remain empty in spruce. Reasons for this varied response have been found in the anatomy of the ray cells for the A'arious species. (iii) Spiral Grain.\u2014Studies on the occurrence and distribution of spiral grain in the stems of various conifers have commenced and several jAossible techniques for its detection in living stems tested. (/) Bark and Wood ExiracHves.\u2014Rutin and ellagic acid have been isolated from extracts from some of the eucalypt species examined previously, thus confirming the evidence obtained by paper partition chromato- graphy. An adsorption chromatographic method of .separation is noAv being perfected; this technique Avill allow separation of the various components of extracts to be made on a larger scale and Avill greatly facilitate their examination. Using extraction and crystalliza tion techniques, eudesmin, aromadendrin, and a third compound have been isolated from the kino of gi'ey box {Eucalyptus hemiphloia). The unknown substance is being examined. During the general examination of the cellular kino of jarrah to find means of converting it into a suitable tannin extract, several samples from different trees Avere found to have up to 20 per cent, material soluble in hot Avater. This is much higher than the aA-erage f about 5 per cent.). Methods used to examine leucoanthocyanins in Butea frondosa kino have been explored to assist the investigation of such substances in jarrah. IIoAvever, repeated trials Avith these methods have failed to produce the results claimed. Several mangrove barks from Mew Guinea and eucalypt barks from Western Australian species have been analysed for tannin content. The extract from the bark of one eucalypt species not previously investigated has been tested by a local tannery. It was reported that, although this extract Avas unsuitable alone, it could be blended Avith other extracts to produce a satisfactory leather.3. Wood Chemistry. (Division of Forest Products.) tu) Litjnin and Related Compounds.\u2014The search fur more suitable solvent systems for the chromato- graphy of lignin has been continued. Confirmation of the existence of tAvo lignin fractions has been obtained by the fsopropyl ether .-water (40: SO: 20) Avhich gave fractions 0.05 and 0.95, and acetone : methyl ethyl ketone: water (25:75:100) which gave lignin fractions at Rjf 0.24 and 0.28. The identification of two definite lignin fractions at finite Pf values is a definite step in the elucidation of the chemistry of methanol lignin from Eucalyptus regnans. Resolution of the lignin by counter-current distribution is rendered difficult by the presence of numerous impurities, and a study of the removal of the impurities by solvents has therefore been made with the object of attaining a partial purification without denaturing the lignins. Prolonged cold AA'ater extrac tion appears to be the most successful yet tried and is being inA-estigated further. (h) Wood Carbohydrates.\u2014A bulk sample of Avater- .-^oluble carbohydrate material extracted from methanol- cooked E. regnans wood has been separated into a fi-action insoluble in 60 per cent, ethanol and a fraction soluble in 60 per cent, ethanol but insoluble in 90 per cent. Conditions for the hydrolysis of the latter fraction Avith X sulphuric acid have been established by the use of optical rotation to folloAV the course of the reaction. Chromatographic analysis of the liydrolysate carried out by separation in a cellulose ccdumn revealed the presence of xylose, galactose and ni-onic acid. The barium aldobiuronate wood Avith rnethanolic a pale yelloAvish syrup Avhich on treatment Avith rnethanolic ammonia yielded a crystalline mass. By suitable fractional crystallization a product Avas obtained Avhich, from its constants, Avas identified as of methyl-4-O-methyl- oc -D-glucopyranosiduronic acid. The /3-form Avas Thus the aldobiuronie acid of R. regnans is believed to consist of D-xylopyranose units linked with 4-0-methyl-D- ghicopyranuronic acid units. (e) The Mechanisin of Delignification.\u2014In investi gations on the influence of chip shape on the course of delignification of E. regnans wood by sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide solutions, saAvu \" chips\" cut with faces as near as possible in the longitudinal, tangential, and radial planes were pulped. Results obtained were compared Avith results of pulping matched material subdivided in dift'erent Avays. Penetration of X/2 sodium hydroxide took place with almost equal ease in the three directions, Avhereas Avith sodium sul phide the penetration in the longitudinal direction took place somcAA-hat more rapidly. Xo effect on the course of delignification Avas noted when 1-in. cubes of wood Avere crushed under a load of 1,000 lb./ square inch in a tangential direction, nor Avas there any difference between the strength properties of the pulps from crushed and uncrushed specimens. A method has been established for the determination of the cupriethylene- diainine viscosity of pulps from of New Guinea Woods.\u2014The pulping properties of representative samples of A'irgin and plantation grown hoop pine {Araucaria cunninghamii) and klinki pine (.4. hlinkii) haA'e determined. Both species pulped readily by the sulphate processgiving good yields of shiA'e-free pulps. Only small99 differences in cliemical composition and pulping char acteristics were noted between the individual trees of both species and, in addition, the pulps from both species were very similar. The strength properties of the pulps from plantation grown trees were lower than those from the older virgin trees. The difference was most noticeable in the case of tear; a result which was not une.xpectcd because of the lower average fibre length from the younger trees. A slightly higher tear factor was obtained with pulp from plantation grown hoop pine, in comparison with pulp from plantation grown kliuki pine. This again was correlated with the slightly higher average fibre length of the former. The initial tearing resistance of pulps from both species was very high and the other strength properties compared favorably with those of high-grade spruce kraft pulp. With a mixed furnish of 20 per cent, klinki pine pulp and 80 per cent. E. regnans kraft pulp the increase in strength properties of the test sheets was 25 per cent, in burst, 9.2 per cent, in breaking length, and 19 per cent, in tear over those obtained for the regnans pulp alone. (c) Fibre Striicliire in Ilelation lu Pulp Properties. \u2014Successive growth rings from a plantation grown tree of Pinus taeda were subdivided into early and late wood and each part of each ring pulped separately by the sulphate process under comparable conditions. All pulps so obtained were bleached to remove remaining lignin and on analysis they were found to be similar in chemical composition except for small variations in pentosan content which followed the changes in pen- tosan in the original wood. Pulps from the early wood of each growth ring had much higher bursting strength, tensile strength, folding endurance, and air resistance, but lower tearing resistance and bulk than the pulps from the corresponding late wood. Pulp strength pro perties varied considerably from growth ring to growth ring for both early and late wood. There was a good general correlation between basic density of the wood and the properties of the test sheets, a high basic density giving a high bulk and tear but low bursting and tensile strengths, folding endurance, and air resistance. Struc tural factors governing basic density, namely, cell , diameter and cell wall thickness, appeared to haA'e a greater influence on pulp properties than cell length or micellar orientation. (/) Beater Studies.\u2014Preliminary investigations have been made on the operation of the recently installed Aylesford laboratory beater, before a detailed examina tion of its beating characteristics. The performance of the laboratory Lamp)en mill which has been used in general evaluation work for a number of years showed no significant difference from that of a new mill except in the case of freeness (C.s.f.) where the laboratory mill gave significantly lower results. (g) Rheological Studies on Paper.\u2014A rheometer for measuring stress-strain-time relationships on paper strips has been constructed. The instrument operates by means of electronic servo-mechanisms and is able to produce a continuous record of the interdependence of any two of the above rheological variables, or their derivatives, over the ranges likely to be encountered in paper investigations. The rheometer will also be used in studying the relation of physical proijerties to the structure of paper and i)robleins arising during manufacture. One of the principal problems involves the control and measurement of relative humidity, and experiments have been carri(al out in an effort to obtain constant relative humidity over a wide range. (h) Folding Endurance of Paper.\u2014The folding en durance of paper is a property which shows high vari ability in readings obtained on similar sheets and, after instrumental modifications which improved the per formance of the M.I.T. fold tester very considerably.it was concluded that the source of much of the I'esidual variance must be in intrinsic factors within the paper. The effect of moisture content differences consequent upon small changes in relative humidity was pro nounced but quite insufficient to account for the large variation in results. A linear relationship between basis weight and folding endurance was established, and small fortuitous variations in basis weight could not account for observed variability. Fibre length was found to exert a very critical effhct upon folding endur ance. Fractionation of eucalypt and pine pulps showed that the folding endurance passed through a minimum with increasing fibre length, indicating that two dis tinct mechanisms contribute to the fold endurance. The influence of the j)eriod of beating was also studied; folding endurance continues to increase long after the tensile strength reaches a constant value, presumably as a result of the increasing amount of fine material produced. (i) The Alechanism of Beating.\u2014An investigation has been commenced into the nature of the essential changes induced in cellulose fibres by beating. Exami nation of the filtered supernatants from beaten and un beaten pulps showed an increase in optical density on beating, and attention has been directed initially to the significance of the colloidal material liberated. Un beaten eucalypt and Ljusuan kraft pulps and similar pulps beaten to 18,000 rev. in the Lampen mill were fractionated by removal of the fine material, and the properties of the residual fractions and the whole pulps were compared. The results indicated the relative importance of the liberation of the fine material during beating as an important factor in the production of desirable paperrnaking properties, compared with the changes in the fibres in other ways which influence the properties of the sheet. 4. Timbee Physics. (Division of Forest Products.) (tt) Physical Properties of Wood and Belated Materials.\u2014(i) Shrinkage and Den.sity Aleasurements. \u2014The British and American standard tests for deter mining shrinkage have been studied and modifications to the testing procedure recommended. Significant errors are introduced into the results by measuring the oven-dry specimens while still hot. Transverse and longitudinal shrinkages can be measured satisfactorily on a single 1 by 1 by 4 inch specimen with the length parallel to the grain. Shrinkage and density tests have been completed on material of 30 species from the Pacific islands. Tests are in progress on 150 Australian species, including a large number from north Queensland not previously tested. Material is being tested from some 30 trees of idantatiou grown radiata pine between 20 and 40 years old. Shrinkage and density tests are being carried out on a number of trees of Eucalyptus rossii, E. robertsoni. and hybrids of these species. Large variations have been observed in the shrinkage and density of radiata pine bark with position in the tree, the density and radial shrinkage increasing considerably with increase in height. An investigation to establish tlie most satisfactory method of determining shrinkage intersection points is in progress. They are being determined firstly from the shrinkage over different moisture content ranges, secondly on difl'erent size.s of specimens, and thirdly from the total volumetric shinnkage and basic densitv, on the assumption that all water sorbcd at moisture contents lielow the intersection point produces an external swelling equal to its own volume. The variation in tlie longitudinal shrinkage-moisture content relationship throughout a growth ring is bein\"^ investigated. \"100 The shrinkage-moistui'e content relationship has also been studied for specimens consisting entirely of a medullary ray, and material free from rays. It has been found that in contrast to other wood, the shrink age of the rays parallel to the axis of the tree is con siderable, but if is small in the radial direction of the tree. (ii) Wood-Liqidd ifelatfons.\u2014Turther tests have coufirmad that the apparent density of wood substance increases with increase in external swelling owing to the displacement liquid. Within a single homologous series, a decrease in apparent density appears to accompany an increase in molecular weight, although no overall correlation between apparent density and molecular weight of the displacement liquid has been observed. The study of the effect of temperature on the moisture content-relative humidity relationship has been continued. The apparatus used has been modified and the determination of moisture content is now being made using a McBain-Bakr quartz spiral balance. A precision calorimeter has been constructed for use in measurements of the heat of wetting of wood by water over a range of temperatures. (iii) Creep.-\u2014Tests on air-dry mountain ash beams under prolonged loading have shown that, at extreme fibre stresses from half to three times the normal design stress, the deflection continues to increase for at least two years reaching up to four times the initial value. Measurements of decrease in deflection after unloading indicate that the proportion of plastic flow to elastic after-effect is lower for dry beams than for green ones. Creep in hoop pine in bending was compared with that in mountain ash but no significant difference was found even for two such structurally different timbers. Thus creep is apparently not markedly dependent on species. Tensile creep tests show that although creep of wood in tension causes a smaller proportional increase in strain than in bending, it continues for at least 1^-2 years. In compression, it appears to be still smaller than in tension. At stresses below about 10 per cent, of the ultimate strength, no creep has been observed in conipression specimens which have been under load for approximately a year. This is in contrast to ten sion and bending where creep was found to occur at these low stresses. After prolonged loading in shear for a few months at a stress equal to one-third of the ultimate strength, specimens showed an irrecoverable deformation which was small compared with the recoverable, but the irrecoverable portion increased with increasing temperatui'e. The deformations, which were measured with electrical resistance strain gauges, reached about twice their initial values. Relaxation tests were carried out on air-dry hoop pine beams which were kept at constant deflection. These showed that the forms of the creep and relax.a- tion curves are of a reciprocal nature as for certain other materials. (iv) Thermal Properties.-\u2014The galvanometer ampli fier and automatic timing equipment of the apparatus for measuring thermal conductivity have been redesigned and rebuilt. The timing equipment now gives timing periods of 5, 10, 25 and 50 seconds, different reading intervals being desirable at different stages of the experi ment. The temperature control of the air-conditioned laboratory for this work has been improved by instal ling a resistance bridge temperature controller, and variations of only about \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 C. are now obtained. (v) Electrical Properties.\u2014Moisture meter correc tion figures have been determined for material from ten trees of jarrah and from eleven trees of South Australian-grown radiata pine.A study has been made of the effect of depth of elec trode penetration on the readings of a moisture meter used for testing plywood glued with casein adhesives. The results indicate that errors are increased by the penetration of the gluelines by the electrodes and point to the desirability of investigating surface electrodes. The dielectric constant and power factor of white cheesewood have been determined at frequencies up to 70 Mc/s. The objective is the design of a moisture meter for impregnated timber. (vi) Testing of Building Boards.\u2014The capillary rise of water in two types of hardboard and one insulat ing board has been studied and is not considered serious in practice. Total immersion tests have been carried out on 21 types of hardboard and ten types of insulating board which are available in Australia, the water absorption and swelling in length and thickness being determined. The dimensional stability of these build ing boards is being studied over a large range of relative humidities for repeated cycles of conditioning. An investigation of the effect of moisture content and tem perature on the tensile strength and Young's modulus of hardboard is in progress. (b) Battery Separators.\u2014Bollowing examination of billets from klinki pine top logs, it appears likely that, with careful selection, a proportion of top logs could be used for battery separators. Oomparative resistance tests on separators of Port Orford cedar and on separators from a large consign ment of north Queensland kauri were carried out for a firm of battery manufacturers to check ou the abnormally high resistances obtained. The cause of the trouble was found, and satisfactory separators are now being produced from the kauri stocks held by the manufacturer. (c) Strain Gauges.\u2014The test on a hydraulic cylin der belonging to the Preservation Section was success fully carried out using nitrogen as the pressure medium and measuring strains with electrical resistance strain gauges. It has been possible to glue thin aluminium foil to green timber and so form a moisture-proof barrier on which to glue resistance strain gauges. It is hoped in this way to be able to use these gauges on green timber. The use of resistance strain gauges for creep testing is being studied on a large scale to check stability over long periods. 5. Timbee Mechanics. (Division of Porest Products.) (a) Studies of Properties and Testing Methods.\u2014To obtain a practical yet accurate method for adjusting strength test values for differences in moisture content, investigations have been commenced to determine the relation between the moisture intersection point obtained from strmigth studies and that determined from shrink age studies. Data which have been accumulated have indicated that previous estimates of the shrinkage intersection point for jarrah were too high; so far no satisfactory relationship with the strength intersection point has been established. The absence of a generally accepted empirical method of adjusting impact test results for differences in moisture content has led to investigations of the effect of moisture content on the toughness of bunya pine andmountain ash. In addition, a large amount of impact data from other species is being studied. Following the development of a dropping ball technique to indicate the impact hardness of wood, comparisons are being now made between ball drop and Janka hardness.101 Experiments on trees of mountain ash, representative of a wide range of size and age, have provided additional information on the Variation of properties with height and radial position within the tree. By comparing radial position from the bark a more defined relation ship was obtained than when the pith was used as datum. Oomparimn of the effect of loading impact and static bending specimens on the inner and outer tangential and radial faces was studied on silvertop ash, brown stringybark, and white stringybark. The results of tests on tangential and radial faces were significantly different, as is normal, but the effects of loading on inner and outer tangential faces were not significantly different both for green and for dry material. In comparisons of test measurements on small and stan dard size specimens, the smaller specimen gave signi ficantly higher values for modulus of rupture but lower values for modulus of elasticity. The effect of rate of loading in the testing of fibre- boards is of interest in the development of specifica tions for standard methods of test for this material. Bending tests have been conducted on both hardboard and insulating board at three loading rates, viz. 0.004, 0.04 and 0.4 in./min., and it is proposed to extend the investigation with tests carried out at 0.0126 and 0.126 in./min. Different spans and types of support are being used in bonding tests conducted to study the effects of large deflections, friction at the supports, and size of supports on modulus of rupture. (b) Species Testing.\u2014The determination of the mechanical properties of timber from the more import ant species continued steadily throughout the year. Most represented species was radiata pine from South Australia, but others include messmate stringybark, brown stringybark, white stringybark, red gum, red box, grey box, peppermints, yellow box, tallowwood, blackbutt, turpentine, brush box, jarrah and Wew Guinea malas. A full range of tests was completed on approximately 100 logs of green material and 110 logs of dry. In addition, tests were conducted on 90 miscel laneous Species from Queensland, 32 logs representing eucalypt hybrids from the Australian Capital Terri tory, three _ species of hTew Guinea timber, and one Fijian species. In \"Victoria the systematic sampling within districts of representative material of all important species is proving quite satisfactory from the viewpoints both of collection and of laboratory organization. (c) SilviciiUural Tests.\u2014To compare the properties of parent and progeny trees of slash and loblolly pines selected as a basis for the establishment of future plan tations in Queensland, a considerable amount of work has been done jising small compression specimens cut along a radius from bark to pith. Investigations havebeen made of the correlations between density, percent age summerwood, and compression strength. The study has been extended to a large number of trees of radiata pine. These were drawn principally from South Aus tralia (50 trees), but other material has been obtained from Victoria and Mew Zealand. High correlations between density and strength have been obtained. The percentage of summerwood is boing determined in alltrees to enable correlation with the specific gravity ofindividual growth rings, and rates of growth are being studied to determine effects of silvicultural treatment.The relations between the mechanical and physical properties of hybrid eucalypts are being studied with the aid of similar experiments and correlations. (d) Timber Construction.\u2014Long-term loading testson simple tension joints with single split ring connectorsor shear plates have been under observation for periods up to eight years. These and more recent tests to check the significance of such effects as end distanceand ^ splitting have reached a stage where analysis is justified.In the investigation of the short-term loading capa city of columns a report has been prepared on the effects of variables on column strength and the most satisfactory formula for estimating maximum loads. The testing of model columns 2 by li inches in cross- section under constant long-time load was continued and extended to other species and another moisture condi tion. Altogether 106 columns have now been set up, 79 of mountain ash, sixteen of Douglas fir, and eleven of yellow stringybark. Most of the columns have been maintained green but nineteen have been allowed to dry out. There was some evidence that atmospheric tem perature variations were producing significant effects, and columns are now being kept in controlled tempera ture rooms. To date, 27 of the 39 columns loaded to 70 per cent, of their estimated short-time capacity have failed, most within the first month and many within a few^ days. Of the twelve still standing (maximum period ten months) eight are long columns of green mountain ash. Mearly half of the columns under a 60 per cent, load and one-quarter of the columns under a 50 per cent, load have failed, the minimum failure periods being two and eleven months respectively. All except the heavily loaded columns were of green moun tain ash. Experiments on the effect of a concentrated load over a joist in a flooring system have indicated considerable distribution of load to adjacent joists. This informa tion is of considerable importance in the design of sizes of members and is being reported. A study of the effect in laminated beams of using external laminae of relatively strong species over a core of lighter and weaker material has been completed. Selected mountain ash was glued to a core of radiata pine from plantation thinnings. The strength and stiff ness of model beams appear to increase parabolically wtih increasing thickness of outer laminations. Although nailing provides an effective and economical method of fabricating a large range of timber Struc tures, information on the design of nailed joints in Australian species is very limited. Experiments arebeing confined to behaviour in simple joints consisting of one or two nails. The splitting effect of nails driven near the end of pieces is being investigated and with drawal resistance measured. Some tests have been completed and others are planned for standard smoothfinish nails and a number of species including messmate stringybark and radiata pine. (e) Growth Stresses in Trees.\u2014In the conversion oftimber from log form to veneer, growth stresses may cause splits which seriously limit its value. \"With some species this tendency to split is increased by heating orother pre-treatment. Experiments are being conducted to determine the significance of temperature in causing expansions or contractions in longitudinal, tangential, and radial directions and to determine the effect of heatin causing relaxation of growth stresses in the log. Loss of strength is also being measured. Observations have been continued on seven young mountain ash trees of age approximately thirteen years and ranging in girth from 9^ to 22 inches. These Were severely bent by abnormal snow loads approximately two_ years ago. Most trees showed very marked straightening in Movember-December, 1951, but little change has taken place since. 6. Timber Preservation. (Division of Forest Products.) _ (a) General.\u2014'Iti addition to normal research activities, ofiicers of the Section have been largely occupiedby numerous requests for technical assistance, and with miscellaneous practical tests, demonstrations, and discussions relevant to the establishment of preservation plants in Australia.102 (h) Field Tests\u2014Field and service testing of pre servative-treated timber has continued to be an impor tant practical project. During the year inspection wa.s made of Pimts radinfa test sleepers installed in track te.sts in six localities in South Australia. This test was commenced by the Division in 1936, in co-opera tion with the South Australian Eailways and Woods and Forests Dep)artment. Results after almost seven teen years' service have now clearly demonstrated that P. radinfa sleepers, pressure treated with a preserva tive oil, give very satisfactory service and may possibly outlast untreated jarrah sleepers which were installed in the same test as controls. The successful utiliza tion of pine sleepers is now dependent mainly on availability. (c) Pressure Treatment of Rail Sleepers.\u2014During flic year the new high-pressure pilot plant has been in almo.st continuous operation and has beeu mainly used for the experimental treatment of rail sleepers for co-operative tests. Approximately 1,700 sleepers have been treated, mainly during the current year, for Vic torian, Tasmanian, Western Australian, and Common wealth Eailways. These sleepers have been treated at high pressures (1,000 Ih./sq. in.) and absorptions have been generally satisfactory. In addition, a small number of ISTew Guinea mangrove sleepers has been freated and installed in track tests to demonstrate the po.ssibility of using the considerable potential supplies of this timber for rail .sleepers. Unlike eucalypt heart- wood, which can be penetrated with preservatives only at high pressures, the three species of mangrove tested were readily treated at low pressures. (d) Causes of Failure of Crossanns.\u2014-The survey, in co-operation with the Postmaster-General's Depart ment, to determine causes of failure of crossarms in service, has been completed for all States and the data obtained are being analysed and reported. In addition, an inspection of crossarms between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie was made at the request of, and in company with, P.M.G. officers. Eecommendations for modifica tion of crossarm specifications and for practices to increase service life are being made. (e) Non^pressure Treatment of Round Timbers.\u2014 Methods of treatment of poles and fence posts without application of pressure have been further investigated.A method of treatment by alternate hot and cold spray ing with a preservative oil has been developed and demonstrated to pole-using authorities. This treat ment has given satisfactory absorption of preservative in sapwood similar to that obtained by the conven tional open tank process. It is considered to be applic able to the treatment of poles in small depots where large-scale plant would not be justified. Particular attention is being given to developmentof simple methods for treating round fence posts. Field tests over many years have demonstrated thatsmall round posts of any species can be treated to give a life equal or superior to split posts of the most durable timbers. The successful use of round po.'^ts by farmers is thus assured if the methods of treatment are sufficiently simplified. (/) Toxicity and Permanence of Water-borne Preservatives.\u2014The first series of tests to determinethe resistance to leaching of nineteen water-borne pre servatives has been completed. In these tests sapwoodblocks of Eucalyptus regnans, impregnated with known amounts of preservative, were leached in distilled water at constant temperature in a shaking machine for a total period of 128 days. During the leach'the water was completely changed twelve times and at eachchange the water was analysed to determine the progressive removal of preservative. At completion ofthe leach, blocks were analysed to cheek the residua] quantities of preservative. Decay resistance tests on leached and unleached blocks are also in progress. Hesiilts obtained have given a valuable picture of the I'clktivc perniancncp of different preservatives, and greatly extend the usefulness of field test results. Wliile such laboratory test.s do not replace field testing, they are moat useful in predicting the performance of preservatives under conditions which do not simulah normal outdoor service. Further work is now in progress to determine the effect of timber species and of pH of the leach watpr on the permanence of water-borne preservatives. (p) Timber Mycology.\u2014Tests on the comparative resistance to decay of various Australian timbers are now in progre.ss. This is a long-term project in which niticli preliminary work ha.s been nece.ssary to develop and standardize testing techiiique.s and to collect authentic and fully representative specimens of man> different timbers. Collection of material from all States is still contining and tlie tests are designed to show the extent to which decay resistance is affected by locality of growth, variation between trees, and position within the tree. This project is partly a co-operative one with the Division of Entomology, Canberra, where a parallel .series of te.sts is being made on the same material, to determine resistance to termite, attack {see Chapter IX., .section 13). In addition to work on Australian timbers, several little-known imported timbers, offered for sale as rail sleepers, have been tested to determine decay resistance. Work on the collection, identification, and cultural characteristics of Australian wood-destroying fungi is continuing steadily. Field collection of fruiting bodies of these fungi has been expanded during the year and approximately 130 persons in all States are now forwarding material which is rapidly enlarging the herbarium and the standard culture collection. Concurrently with this work the cultural characteristics of wood-destroying fungi are being studied to enable identifieation of these fungi when a fruiting body is not available. As a further method of identifying wood- de.stroying fungi in culture, methods of producing fruiting bodies in the laboratory have been developed with reasonable success. {li) Timber Borers.\u2014Study of the habits and the methods of control of the Lyctus and Anobvum borers is continuing. Detailed observations have been made with L. hrunn-eus on oviposition and development of the egg until emergence of the larva, using a technique which permits continual observation of .the egg without disturbance. Studies on oviposition in Anobium have also been made, with particular attention to the type of surface preferred by the female beetle. Work on the relative susceptibility of Queensland rain forest timbers to the Lyctus borer has been com menced at the request of the Queensland Forestry Department. A large group of little-known timbers has been received for these tests, which are now in progress, and will ultimately include approximately 160 different timbers (see Chapter IX., Section 18(h)). The degree of susceptibility of P. radiata to the Anobium borer is also under investigation in labora tory tests. In these tests the susceptibility of this timber is being compared with that of baltic pines and Xew Zealand white pine, with the object of predicting the possible future need for preservative treatment. (t) Other Investigaiioms.\u2014Other work during the year has included the pres.sure treatment of timbers fo;* test in water cooling towers, in radio masts, and as103 fover boarding over drains. \"Work has also been done on the decay resistance of wood-wool cement hoards, and on the weather resistance of different preservatives used for surface protection of sheds, fences, &c. 7. Timber Seasoning. (Division of Forest Product.?.) (a) Oenprnl.\u2014The year's work was charactorixod hy heavy demands from industry for technical assistance. A marked change was observed in the atti tude of industry to the various factors affecting the economics of timber, seasoning. Because of the high co.st of timber, increasing interest was shown in dry ing equiiiment which would reduce expenditure on air seasoning stocks even though this meant an increase in l)ot]i jdaiit and drying costs. (h) Veneer Drying.\u2014A study of the mechanical drying of veneers of the refractory \" ash \" eucalypt groii]) was commenced. It includes a comparison of the values of platen drying, roller drying, and ortho dox kiln drying. Variables examined during platen drying include (i) \"dwell\" time, (ii) \"breathe\" time, (iii) platen pressure, (iv) temperature. For nT-in. thick veneers, good quality was obtained by combining a temperature of 320\u00b0 F. with \" dwell\" limes ranging from 3 to 15 seconds and a \"breathe\" time of about 5 seconds over a total time of about 4 niinnte.s. Tlic work completed showed the quality of veneer obtained under optimum kiln conditions, or in a roller drier, to be somewhat better than that of the best sheets obtained under platen drying. (c) Drying Studies.\u2014A numerical system of assess- ing drying degrade was evolved in which the severity of each defect was weighted according to its relative importance. The period over which free evaporation rates are obtained during the drying of green timber under Australian standard schedule conditions was determined. This period was shown to be some 4 hours for the heartwood of Pinits radiafa and Eur.alypfus regnans when in the form of 1 inch thick boards. The information is important in the design of timber driers. Studies of the moisture content of hardwood railway sleepers in service track in south- oast -Vustralia showed that core values remain at about 30 ]jcr cent, throughout the year, but that case values have a wide seasonal fluctuation. Kiln .schedule studies were commenced on E. f-nstigata. Brugviera spp,, Bhizophora apicnlata, E. macrorr- hyncha and a Siviefenia grown in Fiji. Limited studies were made to determine optimum kiln condi tions for wet papier maehe and foamed latex products. (d) Drying.\u2014Work on the partial dryingof 8 by 4-in. sleeper sections of E. ohliqua to give surface zone moisture contents less than 30 per centwas continued. \" Stanvac K9 \" and perchlorethylenewere used as drying agents. The quality of drying wassomewhat better than usually obtained by air drying to^ similar moisture limits. Preservation treatmentwith creosote at a pressure of 1,000 Ib./square inch torefusal point gave total penetration to a depth of1 inch from the .sleeper surface. Creosote absorption apj'roximated 9 Ib./cubic foot. The combined vapourdrying and low pressure^ preservation treatment of gi ecu 9 by O-in. P. rndinta slee]>er.s required some10 hours only. Creosote absorption values ranging from 74 to 10_ Ib./cubic foot were obtained with heart- wood penetration of I-J inch. Sapwood was completelv penetrated. (c) Eiln Design and Plant Layout.\u2014Eighty-seven vi.sits were made to commercial plants in all Australian States, to advise on plant reorganization and lavout,timber handling and storage, kiln installation, control, and maintenance, the drying of veneer and solid timber, and the prevention of di.stortioii in timber (particularly pre-cut housing timbers). Kumerous discussions relat ing to the design of kilns, conditioning rooms, re-drying rooms, and reconditioners were held with members of industry, and 3S7 kiln drawings were issued to com mercial firms and other organizations in Australia and Kew Gruinea, and some in Kew Zealand, Malaya, and India. Appropriate specifications and comprehensive materials lists w^ero prepared in most cases. Plant layout plan.? were prepared for some fifteen firms. Designs for McCa.shney burners were prepared for 52 firms in all Australian States and South Africa, and performance tests were carried out on a number 'i constructed units to ensure satisfactory operation. Particular attention was given to developing designs for pre-driers. These large, multi-line driers were required for operation at constant drying conditions so that any drying line could be unloaded, or reloaded with .green timber, at any time without affecting the efficiency of the unit. They will be of value for par tially drying the difficult, collapse-susceptible species in the cooler, wetter areas of Australia where pre liminary air-drying conditions are unsatisfactory. Estimates indicate that the capital outlay in construct ing and stocking such units in these areas will be only about 50 per cent, of that required for building and stocking air-drying yards of equivalent output. Twm units with charge capacities of 224,000 and 168,000 super, feet are in construction in Tasmania. Designs ivere completed for two others with charge capacities of 160,000 super, feet each. (/) Waste Wood Products and Building Materials. \u2014The value of decayed heartwood as a binder for sawdust-based hardboard and briquettes wms investi gated. Appreciable quantities are present in old trees of the \" ash \" eucalypt group. \"With sawdust moisture content below 5 per cent., pressure at 3,000 Ib./sq. in., 10 per cent, of the binder, and temperature at 400\u00b0 F., good briquettes were obtained which resisted crumbling under fairly severe handling. The material pioved of little value as a binder for hardboard when pressed at 500 Ib./sq. in. iVt the request of a manufacturer pressing sawdust-phenol resin boards on a semi-com mercial scale, comprehensive mechanical and physical te.-^ts were made to determine the board characteristics. Recommendations were made on pressing techniques and possible markets. An examination was made of plant requirements for a company proposing to pur chase Australian rights for overseas equipment to produce waste wood-resin board in Victoria. At the request of architects and home builders recommenda tions were prepared on finishing treatments for saw dust-cement fioors and for the manufacture and use of wood wool-cement building slabs. {g) Other Investigations.\u2014Methods suitable for field use in measuring the moisture content of tannin barks were examined, and brief studies made of the suitability of moisture meters with special electrodes. Equilibrium moisture content values for wood to cover the high temperature range 212-400\u00b0 F. were compiled and charts prepared to show values for bumidities ranging from zero to saturation over this temperature range, with and without admixture of air. Limited studies were made of E.M.C. values in a ^ freezing cbamber. Limited studies were also made of new timber coatings, the drying of turned wooden bowls, the infiuence of moisture content on corrosion of metal parts in wood packages, chemical seasoning, flue gas heating, temperature distribution in commercial reconditioning chambers, the cost of kiln drying, the drying of plaster of paris, and the design of diffu.ser screens for laboratory and commercial kilns.104 The correspondence colirse on kiln operation was con tinued; 24 students were enrolled and thirteen students completed courses. 8. Veneeb and Gluing. (Division of Forest Products.) (a) Veneer Cidting and Utilization.\u2014Reduced suxi- plies of Australian veneer logs have caused increased interest in several eucalypt species for plyivood manu facture. Further investigations on alpine ash and mountain ash show that plywood of good mechanical strength can he produced, but owing to the prevalence of splits in peeling blocks, to the susceptibility of veneers to splitting in handling, and to drying diffi culties, the percentage of cabinet ])lyivood is small. On the other hand a .satisfactory market for case plywood or for structural plywood might he developed; alternatively, ash eucalypt veneers might he used for inner plies and hacks to face veneers of other species. Other Australian timbers investigated included rose gum, plantation grown hoop pine and radiata pine, and two Rew Guinea species Pentaspodon sp. and Mela- norrltoea sj). Methods for the evaluation of veneer quality have been studied. (h) Adhesives for Labels for Fruit Cases.\u2014Follow ing representations from the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, laboratory and field investigations to stndy adhesion and service of labels for export fruit cases have been continued. It ha.s been shown that much of the past trouble was due to the use of un seasoned timber and to improper preparation of adhesive pastes and application of labels to the cases. A standard,-S.A.A. (Int.) 370\u2014\"Adhesives for Fruit Case Labels \", based on this investigation, was pub lished in January, 1953, and a code recommending techniques to he used in applying labels is being prepared. (c) SilviCuUural Treatment for Production of Veneer Logs.\u2014Collaboration with State Forestry Departments was continued and further observations Were made on the quality of veneer derived from pruned and unpruned logs of hoop and radiata pines. (d) Immunization of Plyiuood against InsectAttach.\u2014Commercially produced plywood containing benzene hexachloride in the glueline continues to resist attack by Lyctus boi-ers after two and a half years' service testing. A new investigation on the manufacture ^ of plywood from veneers immunized against termite attack has been commenced in con junction with the Preservation Section. {e) Adhesives.\u2014(i) Mechanism of Coagulating of Protein Sohdions.\u2014Various physical and chemical , investigations were made into the clotting of milk by the enzyme rennet. The liberation of proteoses was confirmed, but their presence does not appear to bo essential for clotting, nor are proteolysis or denatura- tion considered to be essential steps. Observations were made on the role of organically bound phosphorus inclot foi'ination, on the solubility and ultraviolet absorp tion of casein and paracasein, and on their absorption spectra after reaction with diazotized sulphanilic acid. Mtention has also been given to the mode of action of the calcium ions on paracasein during clotting. Fromthe eifect of ionic strength and anion valency on the rate of clotting and from the stability of the clots it was concluded that the bonds formed are ionic in character. ^ (ii) Spectrophotometric Determination of Amino (froups.\u2014Based on the observation that the compoundsfoimed by the reaction of glycine and lysine withdiazotized sulphanilic acid exhibit absorption maxima in the near ujtraviolet^ A spectrophotometi'ic methodhas been developed for estimating amino groups. Other groups eontribute to the absorption of the protein at 363 m/jL, hut in many studies of a comparative nature, such as following the course of hydrolysis, deamination, the action of a proteolytic enzyme or of peptide synthesis, such interference may not be relevant. The determinations can be made simply and rapidly, and the method appears to have certain advantages. (iii) Reduciion of Cystine hy Sodium Bisulphite.\u2014 A correct interpretation of the mechanism ef the reduction of cystine by sodium bisulphite is the basis for a common method for the determination of sul- phydryl and disulphide groups in proteins. Experi ments have been carried out, using spectrophotometric technique.?, which indicate that the usually accepted mechanism may require revision. (iv) Kinetics of Rapid Reactions.\u2014A kinetic treat ment has been developed, in collaboration with the Section of Mathematical Statistics, which permits the ratios between the velocity constants of the various stages of the reaction between a potentially bifunc- tional molecule and a unifunctional molecule to be determined from observations of the initial concen trations of the reactants and the final concentrations of the reactants or products. The tfeatment is general, and allows virtually \" instantaneous\" consecutive .second-order reactions to be resolved kinetically into their comjionent steps. As an experimental method of determining relative velocity constants, the work should be of use in theoretical organic chemistry in providing data against which different methods of correlating structure and reactivity can be tested. It has heen suggested that the method might be applicable to peptide hydrolysis and peptide synthesis. (/) Other Investigations.\u2014(i) Storage of Undried Casein.\u2014Sy.^tematic tests showed that, where no facili ties for casein drying exist, undried casein can be stored for at least nine months at temperatures of \u2014 1 or 15\u00b0 F. (ii) Urea-formaldehyde Resin Glues Extended with Wheaten -Flour.\u2014Flours from wheat varieties of lowgluten content and low gluten strength, commercially available as biscuit flour, are best for extension of urea- formaldehyde glues as they require the addition of a minimum amount of water to produce a suitable viscosity. ^ Hew South \"Wales and Queensland samples gave higher viscosities ivhen suspended in water or in resin and water mixes than did \"Victorian flour. The pot life at 25\u00b0 C. of flour extended resin mixes is five to ten times that of the unextended resin. Thisincrease in pot life with flour extension may be im- liortaiit in hot weather when the life of an unextended .resin is inconveniently short. (in) General\u2014Assistance was given to the Stan-flarfls Association of Australia in drafting specifica- tions for plywood and glues, and to Commonwealthand State Government Departments, private enterprise,and householders on: plyivood manufacture, plywood and furniture, moulded plywood, ol D.Al.E masts and other laminated assemblies, corestock, prefabricated structures, caravans, boats,diving boards, doors, glue identification, and sportinggoods. Towards the end of the year the work on veneers^ and gluing was restricted and some of the Section s staff were transferred to other work. 9. Timber Utilization. (Division of Forest Products.) (a) TBnber Uses\u2014Inquiries continued at a highlevel and information was supplied on timbers forsome hundred uses and data were supplied on the properties of some 65 Species.105 (i) Manufacturvng Processes.\u2014Interest in designs tor plants to manufacture wood products was main tained. Layouts were prepared for fifteen sawmills, a dressing plant, five joinery works, and a case plant. DraAvings were prepared for a portable sawmill suit able for operation by personnel of the armed forces and progress made in preparing notes on the sawing practices to be adopted with it. Advice was given on production techniques and on the sawing of planta- tion-groAvn hardAvoods. A double-sided saAV bench gauge was described and this stimulated widespread interest. Information Avas supplied on bandmills, gangsaws, frame-saws, splitting saAvs, splitting transmission equipment, hydraulic drives, feed mechanisms, saAvdust conveyors, and stapling machines. SaAvmills Avere visited in Victoria and Queensland. Advice Avas given regarding self-loading trucks, cable rigging for moving logs in mill yards, and guards for tractors. A lecture on logging was written for the Eoyal Australian Air Force. Other problems dealt Avith concerned the staining, bleaching, liming, and polishing of timber; painting, oiling, and natural finishing of weatherboards; pro filing and finishing of flooring; the under-heating of floors; pre-forming of room units in construc tion of log cabins; fabrication of flush floors; the treat ment of crates affected by moulds; packing of heavy machinery; prevention of or cure for corrosion of crated machinery and of metal fastenings; manufacture of dimension stock, corestock, musical instruments, and model propellers; bending of staves; plugging of knots, knot holes, and pith; manufacture of pulp and paper; production of wood flour; and production of wood wool. (c) Waste Utilization.\u2014-The wider use of Avood waste as a fuel Avas encouraged, advice being given regarding conditions for efficient combustion and designs prepared for sawdust-burning furnaces for attachment to boilers of Ioav steam rating in four saAv-mills. A limited study Avas made on pine bark to evaluate it as a fuel. Data regarding the briquetting of AA'ood waste were distributed and assistance was giAmn to a firm endeavouring to market a briquetting machine. hTotes on general uses of saAvdust Avere distributed. Recogniz ing that one of the disadvantages of saAA'dust in the soil Avas its depleting effect on the nitrogen content of the soil, experiments Avere carried out to determine whether simple pre-treatments of saAvdust could lessen the effect. It was found that sawdust hydrolysed to give more than 30 per cent, alkali solubles caused an increase in nitrate, but when the alkali solubles were less than 30 per cent, nitrates were depleted. FolloAving tests on methods of attaining 30 per cent, alkali solubility, 1 ton of hydrolysed sawdust was prepared for use in field trials designed by the Victorian Soil Conservation Authority. From a 1952 series of tests no marked difference appeared between grapes packed in saAvdust and in p-anulated cork after long storage in Australia, and inconclusive reports were returned on sawdust-packed cases exported to Singapore. In the 1953 experiments, saAvdusts of radiata pine, mountain ash and jarrah, a material derived from bark of Melaleuca sp., and cork, have been used to pack export quality grapes. Some of the cases have been transported to cool stores in Sydney and others shipped to Singapore. Inspections on a comparative basis will be made early in the coming year.Sawdust from Eucalyptus reynuns was separated into fine and coarse fractions. The products from ball- milling the fine fraction and attrition grinding the coarse were mixed and converted into wet pressed hard- boards and some of these Avere of attractive appearance. The laboratory procedures for mixing pulp and pressing were improved, and hardboards of commercial strength Avere produced by dry pressing although Avet pressing gave still higher strength. The effect on strength, density and moisture content of additions of sulphuric acid and linsed oil were studied. (d) Sawing.\u2014SaAving chains of the \" scratch \" type were sharpened with three different angles of hook on the outer cutting teeth and with three raker clearances and rates of sawing and power consumptions are being determined in timbers of low, medium and high density to provide data for sharpening schedules. Initial trials Avith overseas \" chipper\" type chains indicated the need for modifying the gauging teeth for Australian eucalypts, and this is proceeding. To supplement a trade circular, instruction sheets, and journal articles, a script has been drafted for an instructional film on sawing chains. Tests have contiinied Avith the experimental circular saw bench. Information was distributed on safety- type circular saAvs, on carbide-tipped saAvs, and on the saAving characteristics of some Australian timbers. (e) Standards.\u2014Collaboration Avith the Standards Association of Australia Avas continued on matters con cerning timber standards. Executive duties were undertaken for the Timber Industry Committee and Sectional Committees, and technical assistance given in preparing and reviewing drafts of proposed stan dards. Interim standard grading rules Avere published by the Association for rough saAAui hardAVoods of eastern and south-eastern Australia, and for rough sawn brush- Avoods of eastern Australia. Australian standard speci fications Avere published for waterproof plywood, marine and standard grades, and for fibreboard con tainers for butter. Progress was made in the prepara tion of specifications for furniture plywood, synthetic resin-adhesives, protein adhesives; of revised grades for milled flooring, lining, and weatherboards of radiata pine and hardAvoods of south-eastern Australia; and specifications for poles, piles, sleepers, structural timbers, and crossarms of eastern Australian hard Avoods. The revision of the Australian standard nomen clature of Australian timbers was commenced and assistance given in drafting and reviewing a nomencla ture of timbers imported into Australia. A pre-com- mittee draft specification was prepared for wood treated Avith lycticides. \"Work Avas initiated concerning stan dards for wallboards, and field records collected by the Department of Forestry, Queensland, on the grading of sleepers were analysed. XV. BUILDIXG. 1. Genebal. The building research work of the Organization is undertaken mainly by the Division of Building Research at Highett, Victoria, AA'hich collaborates closely with the CommonAvealth Experimental Building Station of the Commonwealth Department of Works in Xew South Wales. Research is directed towards the study of the more effective use of available materials, the adaptation of traditional materials to new construc tional methods, and the development of new materials and building techniques for the improvement of both the functional aspects of buildings and the efficiency of methods of construction. The work of the Division is reported in this Chapter. Work on timber for constructional purposes is con centrated in the Division of Forest Products (see Chapter XIV.). Work on house foundations is under taken by the Division of Soils (see Chapter II.,106 Sections 3 (/;) and (k)) and work on cement and ceramics is undertaken by the Division of Industrial Chemistry (sne (Chapter XVIII., Section 4.) Division of Bvilding Research.\u2014Xo major changes were made in the research programme of the Division during the year but greater emphasis was given to the work on lightweight aggregates and the use of plaster of paris as a structural material\u2014developments that show considerable promise of reducing the costs of building. Inquiries received numbered 2,700, an in crease of 8 per cent, over the figure for the previous year. Although inquiries from private individuals and manufacturers still predominated, there was a marked increase in requests received from architects and engi neers. As in previous years liaison was maintained with the various branches of the building industry, the Standards Association of Australia, and Common wealth and State Departments. Courses of lectures were delivered to students of the University of Mel bourne and the Melbourne Technical College. 2. Lightweight Aggregates. (Division of Building Eesearch.) Considerable attention has been devoted to the pro duction of lightweight materials suitable for use as aggregates in concrete and plaster. The most promising of these are bloated clays, perlite, and vermiculite. (a) Expanded or Bloated Clays.\u2014Tests on clays and shales from Melbourne, country areas of Victoria, Queensland, and Xew South \"Wales have shown that satisfactory aggregates can be made by heating the raw materials in a rotary kiln, with or without bloating agents such as haematite or calcium, carbonate. The use of these aggi'egates in concrete has been investi gated. It has been found that the density of the concretes ranges from f)6 to 115 Ib./cu. ft. when wet and 78-100 Ib./cii. ft. when dry. The compressive strength of six-bag mixes at 28 days ranged from about 2,000 to 5,000 Ib./sq. in. The flexural tensile strengths were about one-ninth of these figures. Ground diato- mitc, 30 per cent, by weight of the cement, added to a six-bag mix increased the compressive strength from about 2,300 Ib./sq. in. to about 4,200 Ib./sq. in. and increased the wet density from 96 to 115 Ib./cu. ft. A ten-bag mix had a compressive strength between 4,500 and 5,000 Ib./sq. in. Such strengths are of the order of those required for prestressed concrete. The shrinkage of the ordinary six-bag mixes has been of the order of 0.06 per cent, which is approximately what would be expected from the corresponding dense mixes. ^ (b) Perlite.\u2014Inform.ation has been collected on the distribution in Australia of the glassy volcanic rock obsidian from which the expanded lightweight aggre- ga.te perlite is made. Exposures of the material, chiefly in southern Queensland and northern Xew South Wales, were visited and samples collected. A vertical furnace to expand the material on a pilot-plant scale has been designed and constructed. Perlite of density as low as 3 Ib./cu. ft. has been produced, but no exten sive testing is possible until larger supplies are avail able. A horizontal furnace as an alternative pilot- plant means of producing the material is being con structed. (c) Vermicnlite.\u2014Attempts to use a sample of local vermiculite as a plaster aggregate have resulted in unsightly efflorescence which has been attributed to insufficient heating of the raw vermiculite in the ex panding process. Tests on material from two deposits treated in another plant have supported this explana tion. The finer portion of both materials gave little or no trouble, but the coarser caused serious efflorescence. Wsiial examination of the coarse material revealed incompletely exfoliated pieces.3. Concrete Investigations. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (u) Theory of Rupture of Concrete.\u2014As part of the long-term study of the mechanism of failure of concrete under load, experiments have been carried out to investi gate the complex strain systems existing on the surface of various types of test specimen. In the method used, a blanket of closely spaced elec trical resistance strain gauges . was applied over the surface. D.C. measuring equipment has been found unsuitable for these gauges owing to the magnitude of thermal effects in the circuit, but consistently reliable results can be obtained by the use of A.C. equipment. A new adhesive, a proprietary acrylic resin, has been used successfully to attach the gauges to dry concrete, and attempts are being made to evolve a more rapid aging process so that it can be used with moist concrete. To investigate the stresses in an inclusion of one elastic material in another so that the relation between the strength of an aggregate and the strength of concrete made with it may be determined, investigations are being carried out to determine relations between stress functions involved in a three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic elastic medium in equilibrium. Tests on unreinforced beams, slabs, and disks in bending have shown that cracking does not propagate instantaneously in concrete. There is a measurable difference between the load at which cracking begins and its ultimate load. Strain measurements showed considerable variation in the elastic properties of the concrete throughout a specimen. Tests were therefore carried out to find to what extent such variation was due to variations in moisture content and temperature. It has been shown that both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio drop markedly as concrete dries, or as the temperature of a specimen increases. It has also been found that the tensile strength of saturated concrete at 40\u00b0 C. is about 75 per cent, higher than it is at 60\u00b0 C. Such factors undoubtedly influence the riurability of exposed structures. (h) Foamed Concrete.\u2014Investigations on foamed concrete, which is now being manufactured in this country, hav^e been continued with the object of improv ing its physical properties, particularly its dimensional stability (freedom from shrinkage) and its strength. Tests with artificial drying to determine the relation of drying shrinkage to moisture content are being continued. The effect of particle size, grading, and vibration on strength are being studied. Work has been done also on cellular calcium silicate \u2014a potential material for structural units. This is made by autoclaving a prefoamed mix of lime and silicaflour. The amount of lime needed depends on the specific surface of the silica, that is, it is greater thefiner the sand. An expression for the optimum lime: silica ratio has been derived. A compressive-strength: density ratio of 60 has beenobtained with densities of about 60 Ib./cu. ft. This ratio is about four times that of ordinary concrete and up to 50 per cent, higher than that of high strength concrete such as is used for prestressing. 4. Gypsum Plaster and Plaster Products. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (a) Reinforced Gypsum Plaster. \u2014 (i) BondStrength.\u2014The bond strength between steel reinforcing bars and gypsum plaster was found to decrease with increasing length of embedment and with increasing bar diameter. The addition of either lime or sand had no significant effect, but together they affected the strength in ar erratic and unexplained way.107 (ii) Wall Units.\u2014Small panels of reinforced gypsum walls were tested under central and eccentric concen- 1 rated and distributed loads. Panels tested after being dried to (constant weight wore niucb stronger than those tested wet. (b) Setting of Gypsum Ft,asters.\u2014(i) Measurement of Setting Time.\u2014Por correlating the various methods of determining setting times, the setting times of two commercial plasters retarded with various amounts of citric acid were measured by five different methods. Although the two plasters were retarded to different extents, the results of all five methods were affected similarly even though two measured surface hardness and the others resistance to deep penetration, tendency of the plaster to flow, and the evolution of heat of bydration respectively. (ii) Crystallization of Gypsum.\u2014Crystallization of gypsum from dilute suspensions of plaster was shown by microscopic examination to be well advanced before the temperature rise, usually considered to be caused by the formation of gypsum, of a normal mix would have begun. (c) Density and Structure of Plaster of Paris.\u2014The densities of fine powders are u.sually measured by deter mining their weight and the volume of a suitable liquid which they di.splace. \"When the densities of plasters have been determined in this way the results have depended to some extent on the liquid used. This .suggests that the particles of plaster may contain micro- scopic pores accessible to some molecules but not to others, thus giving a falsely high value for the volume of the sample. The densities of plasters have been determined with both toluene and air as the displacement fluids. The results show that between and 7 per cent, of the apparent volume of the plasters examined consists of pores accessible to oxygen or nitrogen molecules but not to the larger toluene molecules. (d) Weatherproofing of Plaster Slab Walls.\u2014Tests to make plaster slab walls weatherproof by casting them on sheets of asbestos cement showed that adequate bond could be obtained in small specimens, but not in large specimens, which failed because of differential move ment of the two materials during drying. Specimens in which plastei' had been gauged with a bitumen emulsion were an exception, however, and tests on these are continuing. (e) Decoration of Fibrous Plaster.\u2014Experimental work undertaken between 1948 and 1952 has been collated and it is now established that \" flush joint\" or sulphide staining on fibrous plaster usually results from the combined use of lead-containing compounds and proteinaceous water paints. Cement sealers, weatherproof oil, and similar materials containing lead driers can introduce sufficient lead to cause staining. 5. Lime and Lime Peoducts. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (a) Correction of Unsoundness in Magnesian Limes. \u2014The reactions between magnesium and calcium oxides and their chlorides, on which the correction of unsound ness in limes is based, have been studied. It has been established that there are two stable crystalline mag nesium oxychlorides, 5Mg(0H)2.MgCl2.xH20 and 3Mg(0II)2.MgCl2.xIl20, and one calcium oxychloride, 3Ca(OH)2.CaCl2.xH2G'; the stability fields of these compounds have been determined. The studies on the crystal structures indicate that there are differences in the structure of 3Mg(0H)2.MgCl2.xI[20 from that pro posed by overseas workers.(b) Sand-lime Bricks.\u2014Walls of a laboratory build ing, of single-brick thickness, serving as panels for investigating the durability and other properties of r.and-lime bricks, show no signs of water penetKation even in that part built without, a dampproof course. 6. Clays and Clay Peoducts. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (a) Survey of Heavy Clay Industry of Australia.\u2014 The survey of the clay resources and heavy clay industry of the provincial cities and country areas of Eew South Wales and Victoria was completed. The raw materials are drawn from deposits of all geological ages and vary from hard metamorphic schists through shales and mudstones to soft plastic clays, and from pure white kaolins to highly coloured ferruginous and siliceous materials. In Victorian country areas fourteen of the 34 brick yards use the stiff plastic process typical of Melbourne, but only three j'ards operate the semi-dry process typical of Sydney. In Eew South Wales 53 of the 89 country brickyards have adopted the semi-dry press whereas only one operates a stiff plastic machine. Forty-three country works in the two States use the extrusion process so little used in the cities. Ten works in New South Wales still make bricks by hand. (b) Clay Research.\u2014(i) Constitution, Properties, and Behaviour of Clays.\u2014X-ray and differential lhe]'mal analysis of the clay minerals show that the Ilawkcsbury and Wianamatta shales of the Sydney area are essentially similar and all contain kaolinite and illite. The Lower Wianamatta shales, distinguished by their high content of impure siderite, are too difScult to extrude but are well suited for the semi-dry press process. It is not economically feasible to improve the olive-di'ab colour of bricks from these shales. The plastic limit for materials capable of extrusion has been shown to be closely related to particle size distribution; proportions for sand, silt, and clay in mixes have been defined which represent ideal, accept able, and unsatisfactory conditions for both extrusion and drying. Studies of the melting point and other high tempera ture reactions as determined by differential thermal analysis (D.T.A.) and deformation-under-load tests reveal interesting relationships between the reactions and the stratigraphic origin of the materials. Tests indicate that the geological sequence in the Sydney area can be subdivided in greater detail than has been arrived at during geological mapping. For assessing the effect of the crystallinity of kaolinite on its thermal reactions, seven \" pure\" samples of kaolinite were divided into three particle- size fractions. Attention has been confined to the fraction which showed from its D.T.A. curves no size effect. D.T.A. curves obtained for the colloid, coarse clay, silt, and sand fractions of some twenty clays have shown that clay minerals are by no means confined to the finest fractions. Sometimes they are present in even greater amounts, not only in the silts but also in the fine and coarse sands. In an examination of the sodium sulphide meth.od for determining free oxides and hydroxides in clays and for their removal therefrom, D.T.A. curves have been obtained for samples before and after treatment. The curves show the extent to which the non-clay minerals have been removed and indicate more clearly than chemical analyses the effect of their removal on the clay. (ii) Rehydration of Burnt Clays.\u2014Eaolinites burnt to over 500\u00b0 C. and then rehydrated have beenfound to have a high strength which might be impor tant industrially.108 (iii) Deterioralion of Roofing Tiles.\u2014In co-opera tion with the Roofing Tile Manufacturers' Association of Victoria an investigation into the Australia-wide prohtem of the deterioration of terracotta tiles on roofs facing sea fronts has heen started. (c) Clay Technology.\u2014Samples of clays from all States and also from Papua and Pakistan have been examined in the pilot plant and the industrial poten tialities of the clays assessed. Experimental work on the Wianamatta, Hawkesbury, and post-Tertiary clays and shales from Sydney is continuing. It has been established that some plastic clays which Avere unsatis factory Avhen extruded under normal conditions extrude Avell after de-airing. Tests have been carried out on the fast drying and correction of excessive drying shrinkage of plastic clays. 7. Caulking Compounds. (Division of Building Research.) (a) Fundamental Rheological Studies.\u2014(i) Oil- based Caulking Compounds\u2014Measurement of the floAv properties of j>reoipitated calcium carbonate of known particle size distribution in a polymerized linseed oil shoAved that departure from JSTewtonian behaviour occurs only at the concentration when all the voids in the powder are just filled Avith oil. A relation betAveen the relative viscosity and the concentration, and the presence of structural viscosity, have been established. Some measurements Avith various asbestos fibre dispersions in the same vehicle showed that the longer the fibre the higher the yield value. (ii) Two-component Internal-set-up Mastics.\u2014 Samples of tAvo-cnmponent internal-set-up mastics from the United States of America, Avhere they are used extensively for sealing joints in concrete canal linings, have been examined. The rheological properties of dispersions of various bitumens in various oils are being studied with a vieAV to producing a satisfactory mastic from materials available in this country. (h) Investigation of the Gun-extrusion Properties of Joint-sealing Compounds.\u2014The rheological study of the gun-extrusion properties of certain joint-sealing compounds suitable for use in canal linings was completed and a report on the investigation, embodying tables for the prediction of extrusion pressures under conditions likely to be met in practice, is aAvaiting publication. (c) Laboratory Durahility Studies.\u2014An investiga tion begun in December, 1949, on the performance of joint-filling materials placed between the paving slabs of a simulated promenade roof deck Avas com pleted. In this test mechanical performance was regarded as a criterion no less important than Avater exclusion. The final condition of the materials was assessed by lifting the slabs and examining the seals in profile. The best all-round results as a joint-filler Avere obtained Avith a filling of standard 1120/30 asphalt. Eibrated bituminou's cements (cutbacks) Avere generally efiectiA^e oven though shrink age and bond loss beneath a hard crust were common. Mixtures of bitumen and rubber prepared from emul sions gave disappointing results mainly on account of re-emulsification. Hot-fill bloAvn bitumens Avere in general very brittle and unsatisfactory. fd) Field /StwiZfes.\u2014Studies of the experimental joint seals in the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission's main irrigation channel at Rocklands, Victoria, were concluded and it Avas recommended to the Commission that the joints in the 2|-mile bench flume section should be pointed with a fatty acid pitch mastic applied over a barbed rubber Avater-stop.A report on overseas practice in the sealing of joints in concrete canal linings has been prepared and sub mitted to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, vvlio requested the data, and to other interested bodies. A visit Avas made to the KieAva works area to study the performance of existing joint seals in the Bogong Creek race line after tAveh'e months' exposure. Two proprietary materials were used here\u2014one based on rubber bitumen and one based on fatty acid pitch. Of these the former was in better condition. 8. CoNOEETE Elooe Subfaoes. (Division of Building Research.) As an extension of the e.vperiment to determine the effect of difi'erent flooi' surface.9 on the foot tempera tures of test subjects in a controlled-temperature room,, the relation between these temperatures and foot com fort Avas determined by recording the reactions of the subjects when seated with their feet placed on con crete slabs which AVere either bare or surfaced with cork tiles. The impressions were then compared with the foot temperature. Eleven out of fifteen subjects gave the same relation betAveen temperature and comfort for the two floor surfaces, showing that the temperature is the only thermal factor affecting the comfort. For the other subjects the comfortable temperature on the two floors was the same, but greater changes in temperature could be tolerated on the cork floor for a given discomfort, that is, the subject was always less comfortable on the concrete. This effect is almost certainly due to a metal bias and not to thermal factors. 9. Bituminous Roofing Mateeials. (Division of Building Research.) (a) General.\u2014Work on problems relating to the performance of bituminous roofing has continued, with special attention being given to the practical aspects of roof construction. (b) Laboratory Studies.\u2014(i) Roof Surface Tem peratures.\u2014Analysis of data from records of roof surface temperatures on an experimental building was completed. (ii)_ Bituminous Adhesives for Built-up Roof Con struction.\u2014In the choice of bitumens for built-up roof construction current Australian practice differs from the standard practices of some OAmrseas countries, and experiments have been undertaken for comparing materials. These experiments incorporate both labora tory tests and pilot-scale ajiplication trials from which estimates can be made of the \" pourability \" and spreading rates of bitumens over a range of temperatures, and also of the toughness of the bitumen bond. Small variations in temperature of the bitumen markedly affect the rate of application and prolonged heating at high temperatures causes embrittlement; stringent steps should therefore be taken by roofing contractors to maintain the bitumen as near as possible to the optimum temperature. (iii)_ Experimental Roof Membranes.\u2014Detailedinspections have been made of the experimentally laid ropf membranes constructed in the grounds of theDivision and elsewhere in Melbourne over the past film years. The performance of membranes constructedwith asbestos fibre felts and coated with a single appli cation of bitumen and aluminium paint has been consistently good and markedly better than the correspond- (saturated) ra^ felt membranes wbich have shown extensive puckering. The conventional coatedrag felt membranes are in general in good condition, JMo corrosion is apparent in the aluminium foil membranes.109 (iv) Field Investigations on Flat Roofing Problems. \u2014'Frequent inquiries on flat roofing problems continue to be received. One inquiry related to leaks in a paved membrane of one of the Organization's own buildings and flooding tests have been carried out to locate these leaks, The defects have already been shown to be due in part at least to inadequate parapet flashing. Further evidence has come to hand on the defects of high-purity lead as a flashing material, failures by fatigue and occasionally corrosion by cement mortar being the usual troubles. It is thought that wider use of low-alloy leads would reduce the frequency of fatigue failures. 10. Thermal Investigations. (Division of Building Eesearch.) The factor which is at present the major unknown in the calculation of temperatures in buildings is that due to the radiation falling on the structure. Experi ments have shown that the temperature of air ^ inch from the surface of a sunlit building can be as much as 25\u00b0 F. above the shade air temperature because of a blanket of warm air, the effects of which are little known. The changes due to the size and nature of the surface and to the wind are being studied. Preliminary tests of thermal conductivity have been made in the 12-in. guarded hot-plate apparatus which has been under construction. Trials are now being made to ensure the correct functioning of the ancillary apparatus. 11. Architeotural Acoustics. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (n) Subjective Acoustics.\u2014There is no known test that may be applied to ascertain with certainty the likely _ subjective reaction of an audience to the acoustics of any enclosed space. A better test than the reverberation time test, which is far from satis factory, might arise from a consideration of the echo pattern since ordinary sounds all consist of a direct sound followed by a succession of echoes. Laboratoiy studies have been made by adding arti ficial echoes to sounds recorded with little or no echo. The results obtained from a group of subjects who were asked whether they were disturbed by the echo for numerous combinations of echo level and delay corre spond fairly well with previously expressed ideas fordesign of cinemas. They are, however, considerably different from similar suggestions for the requirements of live-artist theatres and tests have been made to resolve the reason behind these differences. (/)} Acoustic _ Absorption.\u2014The absorption coeffi cient of acoustic materials can be calculated from impedance results and it has been decided to test materials by measuring impedance by either the impedance tube or transmission chamber methods. Some developmental work is being undertaken to find a method of _ measuring absorption which would bewell based in theory and reproducible in any laboratory. (c) Ductivorh Measurements.\u2014The calculation of acoustic transmission along ducts is extremely tedious mid difficult. Studies on possible extensions of theimpedance tube method have led to good progress being made on the simplification of such calculations. If a discontinuity such as change of size or direction occurs in an acoustic duct and if beyond it all thesound be absorbed, then measurements in the input and output duct lead to simple coefficients which can be used for calculation.{d) Speech Reinforcement.\u2014The Division was approached for assistance with the speech reinforce ment system at the evening sessions of the 1953 Mel bourne Film Festival, held in March at the Exhibition Building. The section of the main hall used had a reverberation time of about five seconds empty and four seconds with an audience of 1,800 persons. For speech in such a hall the optimum reverberation time should be of the order of one to one and a quarter seconds. Two speaker systems were installed. In the first, one column of speakers at the right hand of the screen was used to direct sound to the whole audience; in the second, similar to that used in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, a column at the screen and a second column half way down the hall and fed with a delayed signal were used. Both system.? gave good results. 12. Other Investigations. (Division of Building Eesearch.) (a) Polystyrene Wall Tiles.\u2014Tests have been con tinued on materials sold as adhesives for polystyrene tiles. This work has confirmed the opinion expressed in the Annual Eeport for 1951-52 that adhesives based on drying oils or resin solutions plus filler were, despite their widespread sale, generally unsuitable. (b) Efflorescence.\u2014A study of an extensive salt formation on the inside of an underground concrete tunnel showed that it consisted mainly of sodium sulphate and a mixed sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate. These salts arose from the surrounding soil which had been contaminated with sulphuric acid from an old galvanizing plant. There was no evidence of the sulpho-aluminates which appear when concrete is seriously attacked by sulphates, but they are to be expected in time. (c) Plastering.\u2014The effect of delayed working on the strength of portland cement mortars is being studied to provide data for a proposed code of practice on plastering. Eesults suggest that the usually specified maximum time of two hours between mixing and using is unnecessarily short. XVI. WOOL TEXTILES. 1. General. A considerable programme of research is in hand embracing many problems associated with wool in the textile field, and this work is complementary in the field of wool prodnction to the work in sheep and animal husbandry described in Chapters V. and VII. Eesearch is directed to increased knowledge of the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of wool; to exploitation of the by-products of the wool industry; to improved machinery for wool textile manufacture and improved technology in the chain of processes through which wool passes in the ultimate fabrication of textiles. A major aim of this work is to view the whole field of wool production and bring cohesion and unification to the techniques of wool processing; and if possible to eliminate or modify the less desirable natural properties of ivool and thus improve by every means the competitive position of wool relative to synthetic fibres. Three establishments are now grouped under the Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories\u2014 (1) The Melbourne Laboratory at Parkville is responsible for chemical and biochemical work. (2) The Geelong Laboratory at Belmont is responsible for technology investigations. (3) The Sydney Laboratory at Eyde carries outresearch on the physical and engineering aspects of wool processing.liO Wool wax is a source of considerable potential wealth which has not been fully exploited. The Division of Industrial Chemistry has continued a study of its recovery and utilization (see Section 6 of this Chapter). It is also studying protein structure (see Section 13 of this Chapter). The Division of Entomology is studying the diges tive processes of wool-attacking insects as part of a fundamental investigation of the problem of protecting wool (see Chapter IX., Section 4 (a)). Wool Textile Research Lahoratories.\u2014Eesearch at the Geelong Laboratory on problems directly affecting the wool industry has been extended during the past year. Close collaboration has been maintained by this Laboratory with those engaged in the commercial application of the resin shrinkproofing process and with firms manufacturing the L.B.E. branding fluid to ensure that a standard product is marketed by all. Assistance was given to industry in Geelong in the recovery of wool damaged during the Barwon River floods. From the Melbourne Laboratory a new series of publications entitled \" Circular to Carbonizers \" is now being issued in addition to the \" Circular to Fellmongers\" series initiated some years ago. The purpose of this new circular is to convey information of practical interest to the carbonizing industry with minimum delay. In the Biochemistry and the Physics and Engineering Units at the Melbourne and Sydney Laboratories respectively, less attention is paid to tbe immediate problems and processes of the wool textile industry in favour of accumulating chemi cal and physical data on the properties of wool to pro vide the manufacturer with data comparable with that already available on the artificial fibres. In previous years attention has been restricted in the Sydney Laboratory to studies of the physical properties of single fibres. Staff is now becoming available to extend this work to the study of fibre assemblies and to the physical principles underlying textile processes. Constrnction of the main building at Geelong to accom modate laboratories and mill machinery is now well advanced and a limited amount of additional labora tory and workshop space has now been provided at the Sydney and Melbourne sites. The investigations on the supercontraction of wool fibres are carried out by an officer of the Sydney I.aboratory located in Professor A. E. Alexander's laboratory at the LTew South Wales University of Technology, and X-ray studies on the transformation of a-keratin to y8-keratin are being undertaken in the Physics Department of the same institution. An assistant, attached to the staff of the Geelong Labora tory, is helping with studies of crimp in wool at the Textile School at the Gordon Institute of Technology at Geelong, while the Melbourne Laboratory maintains close contact with protein research workers in the Biochemistry Department of the University of Mel bourne and has assisted this Department to obtain special equipment for protein research. Collabora tion with institutions of higher learning in Sydney, Geelong, and Melbourne not only benefits the Wool Textile Research Laboratories but also serves to draw the attention of staff and students to fundamental a.spects of problems of the wool industry. Grateful appreciation is due to the senior staff of the institutions concerned who have made this collaboration possible. 2. Beanding Fluids. (Wool Textile Research Laboratories.) Work is being continued at the Geelong Laboratory on L.B.E. branding fluid which is now widely used by graziers. Fluid prepared to the formula of XewL.B.E., with impror'ed I'esistance to immediate rain fall, is being made commercially and, as with the earlier product, no diflficulty has been experienced in its removal during processing. .V survey has been made to ascertain the views of the industry on wool now being received in view of the wide-scale use by graziers of L.B.E. branding fluid. Improvements have been reported in certain sections but the full benefits are not yet apparent, owing to the continued use of the older types of sheep-marking materials. Manufacturers cannot afford the risk of leaving any unscourable brands in their wool and. therefore, still sort all brands befoi'e scouring, even though such action is .superfluous with wool con taining L.B.E. branding fluid. It has been observed that brands sorted from wool show 50\u201460 per cent, less residual stain after scouring than before the intro duction of L.B.E. This corresponds roughly to the extent to which L.B.E. branding fluid is used. Full benefit from the use of scourable products will only be obtained when their application is universal. 3. Fellmongeeing. (Wool Textile Research Laboratories.) Fellmongering investigations are being continued at the Melbourne Laboratory. Many firms in Aus tralia and the United Kingdom are using digestion methods of recovering wool from skin pieces and from \" weevil-damaged \" or extremely ribby skins, based on recommendations issued in 1945 by research workers now attached to the Melbourne Laboratory. In the wnirse of further laboratory and works experience the imiiortance of heat shrinkage of the skin tissues and vigorous aeration during the subsequent warm-water digestion have been repeatedly demonstrated. If the aeration is adequate a further improvement is effected by the addition of 0.05 per cent, of calcium chloride to the digest liquor. In the processing of pieces from painted skins which have been delimed with acid, immersion for eight hours in a proteolytic enzyme solution immediately after shrinkage hastens ' the subsequent warm-water digestion. 4. Scouring. (Wool Textile Research Laboratories.) Owing to the growing interest in ultrasonic methods of cleaning fibres, studies have been commenced at the Sydney Laboratory on the mechanism of dirt removal by this process. The rising price of soap has stimnlated many inquiries during the past year on the use of synthetic detergents,' and advice on incthods of measuring and controlling the pH of scour liquors has also been provided. 5. Solvent Degreasing. (Wool Textile Research Laboratories.) 1 he jet solvent degreasing plant is now in working 0-1 del at the Geelong Laboratory and several batches of wool have been put through the machine. The lanolin iecoveiy unit attached to this plant has also performed well in preliminary trials. A small laboratory model of the plant was constructed at Geelong to examine the effects of various factors bcffore the pilot plant was put into operation. These laboratory tests have given information on the conditions that ai'c likely to be most cffVctive on the large scale. ^ suitable line of wool has now been obtained for use m a large-scale combing trial to enable a furthercomparison to be made between the new jet solventprocess and normal scouring. The trial reported lastyear indicated that the jet process produces a much better product.Ill 6. Wool Wax. (Division of Industrial Cliemistry.) (a) Cliemistry.\u2014The Organic Chemistry Section of the Division has continued its examination of the alipliatic alcohols occurring in combination in wool wax, with particular reference to the normal (straight- cliaiu) alcohols. There has been some doubt in the past I'pgarding the occurrence of such alcohols in wool wax; it is expected that the present work, using the techniques of chromatography and fractional distillation in the spinning-band column, will settle the question. The acidic components isolated from the natural wax ai'e also under study by reducing them to the correspond ing alcohols, and applying to these the above techniques. Catalytic hydrogenation procedures for converting the wool-wax acids to the commercially more useful alcohols have been studied. Small-scale hydrogenations under high pressure (4,000 Ib./sq. in.) at temperatures of the order of 300\u00b0 C. in the presence of copper- chromite catalysts have given good yields; it has also been found possible to reduce the copper soaps without further catalyst. Direct hydrogenolysis of wool wax itself under similar conditions has also been studied and found to proceed more readily than the reduction of the acids. Various derivatives of the wool-wax acids have been prepared hut do not appear to have any immediate industrial application. Some experiments directed towards the preparation of modified alkyd resins using wool-wax acids in formu- hitions with phthalic anhydride and glycerol have yielded products which may find a place in the lacquer industry. (/j) Racuvery.\u2014The flotation method for recovering wool wax developed in the Physical Chemistry Section of the Division has been modified so that the wax produced is superior to that usually obtained by other methods. The process in its final form consists in aerating scour liquors in modified mineral flotation machines, recirculating the froth through the flotation machine impellers to reduce its hulk, and then, after washing the froth in counterflow with water, dispersing it in hot alkaline solutions to give a concentrated emulsion from which wax is separated by centrifuging. The overall recovery of wax from the liquors is approxi mately 50 per cent, for liquors containing 1.5 per cent, wax and greater for richer liquors. One Australian scourer is already using the process successfully on a commercial scale and wide interest has been aroused both in Australia and overseas. The Geelong Lahora- toi'y of the \"Wool Textile Ilesearch Laboratories is now co-operating with the Division of Industrial Chemistry in assisting interested-firms.to install commercial units. 7. Cakbonizing. (Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) At the Melbourne Laboratory investigations on the sulphuric acid method of carbonizing have shown that \\ arying' amounts of acid can remain in the hurry wool after passing through the squeeze rollers without the acid content of the dried wool being appreciably affected. Similarly, the type of wool and its previous treatment have little effect on the acid uptake. -S. Wool Dryijxg. (Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) Wool is capable of adsorbing over 30 per cent, by weight of water and the water content has a pronounced effect on its physical properties. The laws governing the uptake of water by wool are not satisfactorily estab lished and information on the rate and heat of adsorp tion of water vapour and on the water content andswelling of wool fibres at various temperatures and humidities is required. Experiments have been com menced at the Sydney Laboratory to collect such data, for they may permit economies to he made at various stages of processing. They will also improve our under standing of the flow of water vapour and heat through fabrics when used as clothing. 9. Yarn Manufacture. (AVool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) .After a temporary delay, due to the departure over seas of the officer concerned, work is proceeding at the Geelong Laboratoi'y on the mechanism of drafting in worsted processing. Measurements of the coefficient of friction between a worsted yarn and steel have been made for a range of yarn speeds, and the physical properties, such as surface tension, viscosity, and angle of contact against wool, of the oils to he applied to the wool during processing have also been determined for a wide temperature range. 10. Bleaching and Dyeing. (Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) No further work has been undertaken in this fleld during the past year hut it is intended to resume the work shortly at the Geelong Laboratory when a trainee returns from abroad. 11. Chemical Modification of Wool. (Wool 'Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) (a) AypHcation of Resins to Wool.\u2014Eesearch in this field was developed at the Geelong Laboratory to the industrial stage during the year. Collaboration with indiLstry led to the setting up of a small plant for treatment of half-hose and goods so treated are now on the market. It was found that the most convenient method of treatment was to squeeze the goods mechanic ally ill the smallest possible amount of resin solution followed by tumbling to distribute the resin evenly throughout the material. In this way it was possible to carry out the treatment with a liquor:goods ratio of less than 2 :1. Further work is in progress to improve the method of treatment and extend the process to other types of material. (b) Mothproofing.\u2014Preliminary experiments at the Geelong Laboratory on a new process for the moth proofing of wool have given encouraging results and the economics and large-scale possibilities are now being explored. Work at the Division of Entomology on the digestion of wool by insects is reported in Chapter IX., Section 4 (a). 12. Physical Properties of Fibres. (Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) The physical properties of the Wool fibre are of considerable importance both in processing and end use, but they have not yet been sufficiently explored for the physical behaviour of a wool fibre to be predicted in all situations. (a) Mechanical Properties.\u2014A variety of mechanical forces are applied to fibres while they are being pro cessed, and the usefulness of the finished product often depends on its response to mechanical forces. A thorough investigation of the mechanical properties ofthe wool fibre has been commenced at the Geelong and Sydney Laboratories, since it will not only provide information concerning the structure of wool but mayalso show how processes can be modified or improved or even how new products can be devised.112 The mechanical behaviour of a wool fibre is compli cated. Under wet conditions it can be stretched to 30 per cent, beyond its original length without affecting its capacity to recover from the deformation. Larger extensions can also bo imposed without breaking the fibre. The relation between load and extension is not simple because wool behaves partly as an elastic substance and partly as a viscous substance. Particular attention is being paid to creep and relaxation. Under certain constant loads a wool fibre will continue stretch ing for a long time. This is termed creep. Alterna tively, if a wool fibre is stretched suddenly by a fixed amount, the tension in the fibre after stretching will fall continuously. This is termed relaxation. Some pro gress has now been made in showing the effect of variables such as temperature and stress on the creep of a wool fibre. Means of investigating elastic constants and internal friction are also being sought. Determinations are also being made of the elastic constants of keratin in the form of ram's horn, by measuring the velocity of trans mission of ultrasonic waves. A sensitive and accurate extensometer is being con structed to enable the load-extension relation of wool fibres to be measured under loads insufficient to remove crimp. (b) Mathematical Theories of Viscoelasticity.\u2014This work at the Sydney Laboratory has been carried as far as necessary for present needs, and reports are being prepared. (c) Supercontraction.\u2014^Under certain steaming and chemical treatments a wool fibre is capable of contract ing to 70 per cent, or less of its original length. This is termed supercontraction. An investigation of super- contraction is expected to provide useful information on the structure of the wool fibre and may have applica tions in processing. It has now been shown that supercontraction is markedly reduced by the adsorption of extremely small amounts of detergent on the wool. This phenomenon is being studied at the Sydney Laboratory. The work with detergents is being supplemented by the use of dyes since their distribution can be observed in fibre cross sections under the microscope. (d) Macrostructure.\u2014Ho proper study has been undertaken of the macrostructure of the wool fibre under strain, yet such a study is clearly of importance to show how strains imposed on the fibre as a whole are distributed to component parts. Microscopy methods are therefore being developed at the Sydney Laboratory for observations on distorted fibre sections. (e) X-ray Diffraction.\u2014-Wool shows a different X-ray diffraction pattern when unstretehed and stretched, corresponding to a- and ;8-keratin respec tively. The rate at which the transformation takes place would be of considerable assistance in understand ing the mechanical properties of wool and it is hoped that the Geiger counter type.of X-ray diffraction equip ment in use at the Sydney Laboratory will enable the change to be followed closely. 13. Protein Structure. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) The study of protein structure has been continued by the Chemical Physics Section of the Division. The ob jects of this work are to increase our knowledge of the structure of proteins, particularly fibrous proteins, to understand their properties and function better, and to study the relation between globular and fibrou-s proteins in an attempt to elucidate the way in which fibrous proteins are formed in vivo.On the synthetic side, methods of forming the peptidelinkage have been explored; of particular ^ interest is the use of azides in peptide synthesis. The role ofglutamic acid and related compounds in certain proteins has been the subject of some investigation; since it is possible that pyroglutamic acid is a constituent of collagen and gelatin, experiments on the acylation of this acid to form peptides and the cyclization of glu tamic acid residues in lower peptides have been made. The structure analysis of DL-aspartic acid hydro- chloride by X-ray methods is nearing completion and a three-dimensional analysis of the structure of the crystalline tripeptide, DL-leucylglycylglycine, is pro gressing satisfactorily. These and the structure analyses of amino acids de.scribed in previous Annual Keports have contributed greatly to our understanding of the way in which side chains pack in more complex pej)tides and proteins. Electron-microscopical studies of the structure at the macromolecular level have been continued. A signi ficant contribution to this field has been the charac terization of the molecule of ferritin, a protein which has special merits for electron-microscopical study. Sections of biological specimens and of protein crystals down to 100 A in thickness can be cut on a microtome recently constructed in the Section; this will extend the range of application of the electron microscope con siderably. 14. Wool Protein Chemistry. (Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories.) (a) Chemistry of Wool Formation.\u2014Studies of wool synthesis by the laboratory cultivation of the skin tissues of foetal lambs have been temporarily discon tinued owing to accommodation changes in the labora tory. The histochemical examination of sections of sheepskin, however, has been continued at the Mel bourne Laboratory and a new method has revealed the distribution of an enzyme system in and around the root at the base of the wool follicle not previously recognized at this site. The same method has been sliown to be more sen.sitivo than those previously avail able for demonstrating the distribution of sulphydryl groups in the unkeratinizod portions of the wool roots. (h) Amino Acid Composition of Wool.\u2014The pro perties of wool, like other protein materials, is largely determined by the relative proportions of the various amino acids present. Literature figures for the amino acid composition of wool have been determined by various workers using different samples of wool. As wool is known to vary slightly in composition, work is in hand at the Melbourne Laboratory to determine the complete amino acid composition on the one sample, using sensitive analytical methods which have only recently become available. (c) Preparation of Wool Dispersions.\u2014By incubat ing wool in alkaline solutions of reducing agents, such as thioglycollic acid, more than half of the wool protein is dispersed. Work at the Melbourne Laboratory has shown that careful control of the pH and of the condi tions of incubation ensures that the degradation does not proceed beyond the early stages and the products are_ therefore in a suitable state for physical charac terization. (d) Properties of Wool Dispersions.\u2014A Hepp-type osmometer has been constructed and used at the Mel bourne Laboratory for determination of the mean molecular weight of wool dispersions prepared by ex traction with urea-bisulphite solutions. The values obtained are slightly higher than those previously re ported, and the examination of such extracts in the ultracentrifuge in conjunction with measurements of the diffusion coefficient will enable further estimates of the molecular weight to be made. Measurements of113 the properties of films of the dispersed wool protein, using a recently constructed low-pressure surface balance, will also provide additional molecular weight data. A less sensitive surface balance will be used to provide evidence relating to the interaction of the pro tein extracts with other compounds. Infra-red absorp tion is being used to characterize films prepared by drying thin layers of the dispersions, especially for the determination of the relative amounts of a- and /J- keratin present. Moving-boundary electrophoresis of alkaline thioglycollate extracts of wool has shown the presence of several separate components. The con centration of one of these increases markedly in relationto the other three as the pll of the thioglycollate solu tion increases. Information collected by these methods may suggest new uses for the disj)ersed material. (e) Wool Damage in Acid Solution.\u2014Studies have now been completed at the liclbourne Laboratory on the breakdown in acid solution of asparagine and of several asparagine peptides of the type likely to occur in wool and other proteins. The rate of ammonia liberation from both asparagine and asparaginyl glycine, for example, resembles that observed during the acid decomposition of proteins and is shown to involve both the ionized and unionized forms of the carboxylic acids. The release of ammonia from glycyl asparagine and leucyl asparagine is consistent with an internal mechanism of hydrolysis in which only the unionized carboxyl groups are involved. In all three peptides the iiejitide bond was more stable to hydrolysis than the amide bond. 15. Fungal Deqeadation oe Textiles. (\"Wool Textile Research Cb enzyme of the mould Aspergillus oryzae, which acts on partly-degraded cellu lose, has been shown at the Melbourne Laboratory to contain at least eight different ^-glucosidase com ponents. One of them, which hydrolyses p-nitroplienyl- /?-glucoside, is also capable of transferring a glucose residue to methanol, ethanol, or n-butanol. The best methods of fractionating these and other enzyme com ponents in A. oryzae culture filtrates, using the tech nique of paper chromatography, have been investigated. Studies of the nutrition of a cellulose-degrading mould, Stachyhotrys alra, have shown that ammonia can be used as the source of nitrogen if sugars or acetate are also present in the medium, whereas protein serves as a source of both nitrogen and carbon. The presence of ^-glucosides in the medium is not essential for the production and purification of those enzymes of S. atra which act on unaltered cellulose and can therefore initiate attack on cotton goods. XVII. PLANT FIBRES. 1. Geneeai.. Control of the flax indu.stry by the Commonwealth Government during the, war has resulted in the establishment of a modern and profitable industry. After the war, the Flax Research Section was estab lished with laboratories at Highett, Victoria, to meet the problems peculiar to the industry in Australia. Because of the subsequent extension of the activities of this Section to include work on a number of vegetable fibres in addition to flax, it was later renamed the Plant Fibre Section. Plant Fibre Section.\u2014The activities of the Section embrace a wide field of both fundamental and applied research extending from agricultural and processing problem.? to the manufacturing and utilization of plant fibre products. The main work is with flax, the aim being to assist in the establishment of a permanent and efficient Australian flax industry. Investigations F.5189.\u20148are, however, also being carried out with a number of other vegetable fibres, the production of which in Australia or Australian Territories is being explored at the present time. Chief amongst these are jute, kenaf (and other jute substitutes), ramie, and coir. In addition to chemical, physical, microbiological, and engineering laboratories, the Section has an exjieri- ineiital flax mill complete with commercial processing equipment, and an experimental spinning mill. The sciqie of the spinning mill has recently been extended by the acquisition of a carding machine. Not the least of the available facilities is an excellent plant fibre reference library. The Section received over 200 trade inquiries during the year, either by letter or by visit, a number of them involving special laboratory work. The Oihcer-hi-chavge of the Section continues to serve on the Flax Production Committee, the Central Fibres Committee, and the Papua and New Guinea Fibres Committee. One of the Section's senior officers recently returned from overseas where, in addition to other visits, he .spent some time at Sheffield University engaged in microbiological .studies. Work on the fungal degradation of cellulose textiles cari'ied out by the Melbourne Laboratory of the Wool Textile Research Laboratories is reported in Chapter XVI., Section 15. 2. .Igeicultuilvl Investigations. (Plant Fibre Section.) Co-operation is still being provided in agricultural research on a number of fibre plants. The role of the Plant Fibre Section is to extract the fibre from the plant material and evaluate it in terms of yield and quality. Among.st the departments concerned and the projects in which assistance is being provided at the pre.scnt time are the following:\u2014 Victorian Department of Agriculture.\u2014The deve lopment of disea.se-resistmg varieties of flax. (This Department is also conducting a number of fertilizer trials initiated by the Plant Fibre Section to study the effect of the uptake of various minerals on the development of fibre in the flax plant.) ilax Production Committee (Commonwealth Department of Commerce and Agriculture).\u2014 Field trials of certain overseas and the more promising of the locally developed flax varieties. Waite Agricultural Research Institute..\u2014Tiie breeding of rust-re.sistant varieties of flax. Queensland Department of Secondary Industries. \u2014The growing and processing of jute, kenaf, j'.nd Urena lobata. Papua and New Guinea Department of Agricul ture, Stock, and Fisheries.\u2014The cultivation and processing of kenaf, manila hemp, sisal, and other fibres. Land Research and Regional Survey Section, C.S.I.R.O.\u2014The cultivation of jute and similar fibres at Katherine and Kimberley. 3. Peocessing. (Plant Fibre Section.) (rt) Method of Purehace.\u2014The present method of purchasing flax according to weight leaves much to be desired, as it is impossible to asses.3 accurately the value of the fibre in the straw until it has been pro- ces.sed. This may not occur for some months or even ycar.5. Experiments have been made ivhich demon strate that crops can be satisfactorily sampled at the time of delivery to the mill aud these samples processed114 immediately to assess the value of the crop. The results from such samples are also of assistance in checking the efficiency of the mill. (h) Deseeding.\u2014Considerable progress has been made with the development of a new type of flax-seedwinnowing machine which, it is confidently expected, will be much simpler and more efficient than existing equipment. (c) Water Retting.\u2014Turther work, on a pilot-plant scale, has been completed using the aerated retting tcciinique for treating flax. As reported last year, this method results in considerably more rapid retting than with the normal anaerobic retting and consequently makes possible an increased output from existing retting tank.s. One of the flax mills in Victoria is now equipped for aerated retting in its four tanks and the operation of these tanks under the supervision of officers of this Section is about to begin. Experiments on tlie effect of temperature on the period of retting have been made with various consignments of jute and kenaf. One problem for which no solution has yet been found is the resistaiice to retting of jute ' ribbons \". These are the bark ribbons containing the fibre which are sometimes removed from tiie green plant in order to I'educe the volume and weight of material to be handled during subsequent processing. (d) Scutching and Mechanical Decoiiication.\u2014-A detailed survey has been made of possible fields for improvements in flax scutching machinery and these fields are now being systematically explored. Already a number of belpful modifications have been dis covered. Experiments with tlie mechanical separation of the fibre from retted stalks both of jute and kenaf have been continued with satisfactory results. (e) Preparing and Spinning.\u2014Studies of the technique of preparing and spinning flax, kenaf, and other vegetable fibres have contributed to the available knowledge of these fibres and of their behaviour during manufacture. One of the more important investiga tions in liaud is of the effects of different temperatures and relative humidities on the performance of various fibres during preparing and spinning. Tlie use of .Australian timbers in place of overseas timbers for the manufacture of pressing rollers has been successfully ilenionstrated. 4. Microbiouogicaj. Iixvestioations. (Plant Eibre Section.) In orler to obtain a more complete understanding of the process of water retting and a background of knowledge which may enable improvements to be effected in this process, a detailed study is being made of retting bacteria. Growth and nutritional investiga tions being carried out include a study of the basal medium required, the effect on growth of incubation temperature and initial pll of the medium, inhibitory substances, and pectin utilization. Incidental studies are concerned with the use of the nephelometer for measnring bacterial growth and with the use of gas production as a basis for obtaining growth curves for retting bacteria. 5. Chemical Investigations. (Plant Fibre Section.) Analyses of various types of flax and other fibres have been continued to define further the constitution of the fibre and to determine the relationship between fibre quality and chemical composition. Particular attention ha.s been given to the effect of treatments with various _ concentrations of sodium hydroxide. This isthe basis of the \"boiling\" treatment to which prac tically all flax yarn is subjected. Modifications havebeen made to the method used for the determination of lignin in fibre; it is considered that a more accurate estimation is now possible. An investigation has been commenced to determine the effect of various proce.ss- ing factors on the cuprammonium fluidity of fibre. 6. Physical Investigations. (Plant Eibre Section.) .-Anatomical investigations have been extended from flax\" to jute, kenaf, and roselle. Australian-grown material is being compared with that from overseas and, in particular, a study is being made of relation- shipis between anatomical characters and fibre quality. Determinations have been carried out of the \" knot efficiency \" of yarns of jute and kenaf. This is the strength of a knotted yarn expressed as a percentage of the strength without a knot. AVith each fibre the knot efficiency is only about 60 per cent. The resistance of yarns of the same two fibres to fungal attack has also i)een studied. Both soil-burial tests and accelerated mildew infection tests have been used. Further inves tigations bave been commenced of the relation,shi]) between moisture regain and the breaking strength of canvases of Australian manufacture. An examina tion is being made of the use of an imported levelness tester for evaluating the uniformity of flax and other j)lant fibre yarns. XVIII. IXDUSTEIAL CHEMISTRY. 1. General. The Division of Industrial Chemistry represents the major concentration of chemical research within the Organization, although much chemical work is undertaken in other Divisions and Sections. This Division was formed (a) to promote greater technical efficiency in established industries, (h) to stimulate the establishment of new industries, (c) to encourage the use of raw materials of Australian origin, (d) to seek substitutes for imported materials, and (e) to find uses for by-products not utilized. In addition to its basic chemical work, the main remarch activities within the Division deal with mineral utilization, cement, ceramics and refractories, organic chemicals, wool, and brown coal. The Division's activities on wool wax and protein structure are described in Chapter XVI., Sections 6 and 13 respectively; work on the flotation of minerals in Chapter XIX., Section 5; and work on the utiliza tion of brown coal in Chapter XX., Section 9. Division of Industrial Chemistry.\u2014In addition to the staff located in Melbourne, officers work in other States on projects that were enumerated in the 1951-52 Report. The I oundry Sands Section is housed in the Metallurgy Department of the Melbourne Technical College. The Organic Chemistry Section has for many years been indebted to the Organic, Chemistry Department of the University of Melbourne for accommodation for alkaloids investigations and microanalysis. The micro- analytical laboratory has been placed on a more secure basis. AVhile the major responsibility for it rests with the Division, it is receiving financial support to the extent of \u00a3500 for the year 1953 from the Xational Health and Medical Research Council; it has useful guarantees from Monsanto Chemicals (Aust.) Ltd., Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Ltd., and Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd., and more extensive guaranteed patronage from the Universities of Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. In addition, the University of Melbourne has under taken, on a long-term basis, to continue to house the Section.115 Liaison with industry and with educational institu tions has been very cordially maintained. There have been numerous formal visits of inspection by repre sentatives of industries and associations which may lead to extensive work within the Division's labora tories. Thus, one firm had a research officer seconded to the Division for a year for work on olein, with a \\'iew to developing marketable products for this material. Again, an agreement has just been reached with Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan mining com panies under which the Division will conduct research on a large pilot-plant scale on a new method of treat ing copper concentrates. The companies will provide almost the whole of the money needed, and the greater part of the personnel required, about ten in all. The Process Equipment Laboratory continues to render substantial assistance to a wide range of industries and the Foundry Sands Laboratory to the whole industry in Australia. Officers of the Division deliver many lectures to scientific and technical societies. One was invited by the Chemical Institute and the Universities of Hew Zealand to give a series of addresses in that country. Three officers have accepted invitations to lecture in Europe and Horth America. The head of the Cement and Ceramics Section, Dr. A. R. Alderman, resigned to occupy the Chair of Geology at the University of Adelaide and has been succeeded by Mr. A. J. Gaskin, of the G-eology Department of the University of Melbourne. A numbei' of guest workers in various fields of re search have been accommodated in the Division, and several requests for scientists from other institutions to work in the Division have been reluctantly refused owing to shortage of laboratory space. The following description of the activities of the Division focuses attention on the work of the scientific and technical officers. The essential part played by the clerical and stores staff and by the workshops staff is recorded with appreciation. 2. Mineeals Utilization. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) The utilization of minerals and products derived from them offers considerable scope for chemical re search. The procedures necessary to modify the properties of the mineral to meet the requirements of particular industries are very diverse; in some instances little or no processing is required but in the majority of cases drastic changes by chemical means are necessary. It is by such chemical processing that the potential value of a niincral can be realized through its derivatives and it is through the production of a wider range of derivatives and their industrial application that developments in this field may be expected to occur. The current programme is based on some of the less common metals, minerals, and their derivatives and arises partly from the relative abundance of certain of those minerals in Australia and the increasing indus trial attention being devoted to them. It is also, in part, dictated by the coexistence of a variety of chemi cally similar metals, or elements, in several of the minerals under consideration. The separation of these closely associated elements is usually a necessary pre lude to further studies on their individual utilization and the devising of improved methods of separation becomes a major part of the investigation where, as frequently happens, the known methods of separation are imperfect. The'various research projects in the current programme, which are briefly reviewed here- uiider, provide several examples of this sequence.(a) Lanthanon and Thorium Chemistry.\u2014The chemistry of the lanthanons, or rare earths, and of the frequently associated element thorium, has occupied the attention of the Section for a considerable time past. The practical difficulties associated with the separation of most of the lanthanons from the complex mixtures in which thoy occur have, until recently, strictly limited any consideration of devising industrial uses for cer tain of them. The recent development of improved separation techniques in overseas laboratories has been chiefly related to studies on the fission products of uranium and this Section's current work has been directed towards the development and adaptation of such of these modern methods as may be applicable to the problems of industrial separation of the lan thanons and related elements from mineral sources. The natural occurrences of this large group of closely associated chemical elements are very diverse in Aus tralia, and for the most part the recovery of the minerals, or their chemical derivatives, is subsidiary to the concentration or chemical processing of other minerals. Thus monazite, the main source of the cerium group of lanthanons and thorium, is re covered in the mechanical concentration of titanium and zirconium minerals from the beach sands of eastern Australia and occurs also in many alluvial tin drifts. Minerals of the fergusonite type, in which the yttrium group of lanthanons predominates, are known to occur with tin ore in \"Western Australia and elsewhere. Certain Australian uranium ores also contain the lanthanon suite of elements as subsidiary components. These three sources hav^e been availed of in the current work on separation techniques which have been mostly based on the formation of complexes with various organic reagents followed by ion exchange. One aspect of this work has been the subject of a patent application as a new method of lanthanon separation, and several publications dealing with other phases of this work have been prepared. Preliminary investigations into new sources of lanthanons and related elements have involved examinations of a variety of Australian tungsten ores and associated gangue minerals with the result that epidote from the sehcelite deposit at King Island has been shown to contain lanthanons, although the scheelite itself does not. The occurrence of appreciable amounts of the rare element scandium in davidite concentrates from South Australia has been confirmed and small amounts of scandium compounds have been isolated from this source for the fii-st time. This work has indicated that the published chemistry of scandium in complex mix tures needs considerable revision and to this end the investigation will be continued. Fundamental work on the carbides and iodides of thorium relating to the thermal deposition of the pure metal was con tinued. Work is also proceeding' on the fluorides of ((udum and their ]iossible fluorinating agents. (h) Titannim and Zirconium Chemistry.\u2014Investi gations on the preparation and properties of titaninm nitride have been continued. Tliis material, which is derived from rutile via titanium tetrachloride, shows ])romise for the preparation of various industrial hard metal\" compacts analogous to those composed of tungsten carbide. The many variables involved in the composition, melting, bonding, and sintering of the nitride have necessitated a very extensive series of test pieces being made and compared for performance. The possibilities of using titanium nitride as a com ponent of special types of electrodes and as an in gredient of the composite ceramic-metal compositions known as ceriiiets have also been examined. series of investigations on the properties and possible uses of other binary compounds of titanium was commenced. The electrical properties of sintered polycrystalline compacts of partially reduced titanium116 oxide were studied in conjunction with those of sintered titanium oxide rendered photosensitive by introduced impurities. Work on the chemical separation of zirconium from associated hafnium was continued with satisfactory results. A new process devised for this separation ha-s proved effective in laboratory-scale tests and the equip ment necessary for pound-scale tests was designed and assembled. (c) Graphite Investigations.\u2014The work on lamellar compounds of graphite has been continued and the capacity of graphite to form molecular compounds by the intercalation of various foreign substances in the interpianar spaces of the crystal lattice has been investigated in some detail. Recognition of criteria which determine the high degree of selectivity shown by graphite in forming this type of compound has resulted in the discovery of a large number of new compounds. The conditions under which such com pounds are formed and subsequently decomposed sug- gast that important applications of the principle may be devised to effect various separations of industrial importance. The theoretical and applied aspects of this project have been considered concurrently and ai'e' being extended. (d) Chemical Crystallography of Minerals.\u2014The chemical crystallography of minerals possessing structural defects in the lattice of the crystal has been continued and the crystal structures of the two manga nese minerals psilomelane and chalcophanite have been determined by Fourier methods of X-ray analysis. The synthesis by means of the Verneuil, or fi'ame fusion process, of single crystals of various inorganic compounds with, defect structures predicted from X-ray studies, has met with initial success; The products, which have potentially useful electrical pro perties, are being examined. (e) Germanium Survey.\u2014Wide interest in the use of germanium for transistors and similar electrical devices has suggested the desirability of a survey of Australian sources of this uncommon element. It is known that certain Australian coals and their derived flue ducts, like those reported elsewhere, contain smallbut signiricant amounts of germanium. The survey has been planned to include not only coals but a number of _ minerals _ and metallurgical by-products. As yet this work is in the preliminary stages. C/) Uranium Ores.\u2014Work on the extraction of uranium from the davidite ore from Eadium Hill, South Australia, was concluded and four of the Sec tion's stall\" joined the research staff of the South Aus tralian Department of Mines to continue investigations on the treatment of this ore and related problems. Current work on davidite ore in this laboratory has been restricted to devising methods for the isolation of scandium and recovery of lanthanons from by products obtained in the treatment of the ore. Investigations were continued on the treatment of uranium ore from Hum Jungle, in the Northern Terri tory, with satisfactory results. This work has been done in collaboration with Consolidated Zinc Pty. Ltd. who have supplied ore samples from the mine, and also with the South Australian Department of Mines and the Melbourne University ore-dressing laboratory. 3. Cement and Ceramics. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) Work has continued on the study of portland cement and pozzolanic cements, on ceramics including refrac tories, on the survey of Australian resources of ceramic clays, and on the structure and properties of the clay minerals.As in the past, assistance has been given to Govern ment Departments and instrumentalities by testing various materials proposed for use in large concrete structures. As a result of this work unsuitable materials have been rejected and replaced by others which met the necessary standards. Samples of con crete from damaged or disintegrating concrete struc tures have been examined, causes of failure determined, damage assessed, and remedial measures suggested. Though it has not been possible to undertake tests, except in special circumstances, assistance has been gi\\eii in several instances by providing details of, and instruction in, testing procedures and the interpretation of the results. Assistance has also been given to various industries engaged in the manufacture of cement, ceramics, and refractories and to several users of these materials. Both practical and financial assistance has been received from the Cement and Concrete Associa tion of Australia and from the National Gas Association. (a) Cement and Concrete.\u2014The research programme covers a number of factors that influence the setting and hardening of portland cement and the durability of concrete. Various reactions that take place during the setting of portland cement are being studied, and they are being correlated with actual setting and strength development. This includes the action of accelerators and retarders, and the factors that give rise to \" false \" setting and \" flash \" setting. In addi tion, work on the hydration of cement minerals and the development of strength was recently commenced. All these investigations are directed to obtaining informa tion which could lead to the development of stronger, more rapidly acting cements and more durable concrete. Various aspects of the disintegration of concrete are being studied, with particular reference to the types of disintegration brought about by sulphates and chlorides, by frost, salt scaling, and magnesia hydration. The investigation of alkali-aggregate reaction pre viously reported has led to 'further work to determine how crack patterns develop and how a concrete struc ture disintegrates. It has been demonstrated that cracked mortar specimens can be so treated that their tensile strengths are increased and their permeabilities to air and water are decreased. It has been observed that cracked mortar specimens, when subjected to the influence of various salt solutions, expand in a marked fashion as a result of the widening and propagation of the cracks. An investigation of the mechanisms of shrinkage and the development of shrinkage cracks in cement paste and mortar specimens has commenced. This should ultimately assist in the design of concrete mixes and concrete structures that do not undergo excessive shrinkage. Studies on the mechanism of air-entrainment in cement and sand pastes have been continued, and have provided useful data on the effect of the physical and chemical environment in a cement paste on the properties of surface-active agents and their effective ness in promoting the entrainment of small air bubbles. ^ A study of the behaviour of certain finely ground siliceous materials known as pozzolanas, and the development of strength of blended portland-pozzolanacements in mortar has been continued. These pozzolanic materials have considerable value in improving the durability of concrete under certain conditions, and for use in mass concrete such as in gravity dams. Although much of the mineralogical work on cementclinker has been suspended, the study of the separation of \" glass \" from portland cement clinker at high tem peratures and determination of its composition has117 continued. Further studies are also being made of the action of this glass on clinkering and the formation of compounds in the clinker. (l) Cement-hihi Refractories.\u2014The work in this field, which is concerned with the investigation of factors which affect the life of kiln linings, includes a study of the attack by potash volatilized from the kiln feed on high alumina and chrome-magnesite bricks. It has been shown that the interstitial bonding material is attacked and that its physical properties are altered. As a result it has been possible to indicate how this form of attack on, certain aluminous bricks may be minimized. Because of the extensive overseas use of bauxite as a raw material for high-alumina refractories, the possibility of making suitable bricks from Gippsland bauxite is being investigated. Though the amounts of certain impurities are higher than is considered desir able, bricks have been made from it and their properties are being evaluated. The influence of purely mechanical stresses on the life of refractory bricks is also being investigated. A study of the changes of cross section taking place in the kiln shell during rotation has indicated the nature of the disruptive forces and how they may be minimized by placing stiffening rings around the shell. (c) Gas-ivorhs Refractories.\u2014The investigation of factors limiting the durability of gas-works refractories under conditions of heavy steaming has been continued. Under these conditions the life of the retort is reduced by an increased tendency to slagging and cracking. An attempt is being made to diagnose the cause by repro ducing those deleterious effects in the laboratory under conditions which simulate those in a retort during operation. (d) Survey of Clay Resources.\u2014Work on the ceramic and refractory clays of Western Australia has now been completed and will be published by the Western Australian Department of Minos. A similar survey of clays from Queensland is being made in collaboration with the Queensland Geological Survey. In addition samples obtained from other areas, which appear likely to have industrial uses, are being examined. ~ i | In the course of this work the use of adsorption of a dye by clays as a rapid indicator of their cation- exchange capacities and dry strengths was studied. Thi.9 required an examination of the factors affecting the determination of all three, and improved procedures were developed. Using these methods a good correla tion was found and the dye-adsorption technique is being simplified to make it suitable for the rapid characterization of clays for field surveys and for the laboratory control of raw materials in ceramic industry. (e) Clay Mineralogy.\u2014In ceramics, agriculture, and other industries the behaviour of clay-water systems is of major importance. In order to control or alter the properties of such systems effectively, it is necessary that the structural make-up of the clay minerals should be fully understood. Much interest centres around the constitution of montmorillonite, the main constituent of the bentonites, fuller's earth, &c. It is a highly reactive clay mineral, but because of the fine state of subdivision in which it occurs it does not lend itself to structure analysis by existing physical methods. However, the mineral vermiculite, which is a con stituent of certain soil-clays and also occurs in nature as flakes larere enough to be examined bv single-crystal X-ray techniques, apuears to be so similar in structure and properties to montmorillonite as to simo'est that its study, important in itself, should also provide informa tion about montmorillonite.The structure analysis of vermiculite, mentioned in last year's Report, has now been completed and an account of the work is in the press. Ho comparable study of any clay mineral has been published. Clear evidence has been obtained of the atomic structure of the mineral, together with the configuration of the associated water films and exchangeable cations. Con siderable light has been thrown on the mechanism by which exchangeable cations are held at the active surfaces of clay particles. The behaviour of the cations on hydration seem to play an important role. The extent to which the results obtained can be used in explaining the properties of montmorillonite is under investigation by chemical methods. In the casting of ceramic bodies kaolinitic clay is customarily deflocculated by the addition of alkali\u2014 usually a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium silicate. This confers upon the slip the properties of both high density and fluidity. Control of the degree of deflocculation and thus of the properties of the cast ing slip are of importance in the maintenance of repro- ducibly high standards in pottery and porcelain manu facture. The mechanism of deflocculation in pure kaolinite suspensions has been the subject of study at Rothamsted Experiment Station, England, by an officer of the Section. Erom it has emerged a new interpreta tion of the process, which should be of value in all processes in which deffocculation plays a part and in the prediction of the colloidal behaviour of mixed clay minerals. In addition, it has established a new method for the estimation of the specific surface of a kaolin. (/) Silica for Brides.\u2014Efforts are being made to discover sources of silica in this country suitable for the manufacture of bricks comparable in quality with the South African \"silcrete\" bricks. From rocks of the \" silcrete\" type silica bricks can be made which have a low porosity and high degree of conversion to crystobalite and tridymite. It is to these stable high- temperature forms of silica that these bricks owe their low after-expansion which is so desirable in refractories used in gas retorts, open-hearth steel furnace roofs, and glass-tank crowns. A number of easily accessible deposits of silica were examined but they were not superior in quality to those at present used in local manufacture, owing largely to the relatively large size of the crystals of which the rock is composed. The survey is now being extended to regions where micro- crystalline forms of silica are known to occur but have not previously been tested with a view to the manm facture of silica bricks. (^) Whiteware and Related Tnvesfioations.\u2014A study of porosity in whiteware bodies which has just been published shows how porosity may be influenced, insd- vertently or deliberately, by the method of processing. Another recent publication shows the effect of extrusion and other processes on the microstructnre of^ clay. Re-orientation of the particles and the formation of slip planes alter the structure of an extruded column of clay and affect its tendency to undergo crackina and lamination. Although extruders are used throughout the ceramic industries, there has been little under standing of the behaviour of materials snbseouent to extrusion or of methods of controlling it. Further studies are relating these results to differential drying shrinkage, strain, and cracking, which are problems of aeneral interest to the ceramic industries. There is evidence that the formation of a vesicular structure known as \"bloating\" in ceramic bodies is agsrravated if the feldspar used as a flux has pre'^'innsly uinlprsone annreciable decomposition by weathering. Work is continninir on the mechanism of bloating and the melt ing of feldspathic fluxes.118 (h) Special Ceramics.\u2014Attention is being given to special oxide refractories, and to the ceramic-metal combinations known as cermets, which have many special uses, such as for high-temperature jets and turbine blades. (i) Other Investigations.\u2014Assistance has been given in response to many inquiries by both potential and actual manufacturers on the availability of ceramic materials, in Australia, and on the production of ceramic bodies from these materials, particularly in the production of articles of a similar kind and standard to some at present imported. Other inquiries have led to a diagnosis in the laboratory or on the plant of faults arising during manufacture. In addition, the Section has produced a number of special ceramics for use in investigations by other Sections of the Division. (j) Adelaide Ceramics Lahoratory.\u2014This labora tory, which is operated in conjunction with the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, provides for the ceramic industry an advisory service which has been much in demand. In addition to this work, surveys of a number of deposits of clays and shales have been made, and detailed laboratory tests have shown how they may best be used, alone or blended, for brick-making and other purposes. This work will be reported in the Mining Review published by the South Australian Department of Mines. 4. Foundey Sands. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) The metal founding industi'y requires supplies of a range of different grades of sand for production of moulds and cores, the types of sand employed depend ing on the nature of the castings required. Changes in moulding practice bring demands for new types of sand. Much of the work has been devoted to maintain ing an up-to-date catalogue of the known sand deposits adjacent to Australia's principal cities and towns in which foundries are situated. During the year numerous additional deposits of sand have been sampled and subjected to standard tests. The Victorian Depart ment of Mines has collected many samples in a search for new deposits and these have been tested for suita bility as foundry sands. The recently developed foundry technique of shell moulding requires a sand with unusual physical proper ties. Surveys have been made of two deposits of sand considered suitable for production of shell moulds, and samples have been subjected to standard tests and employed in experimental moulding operations. The advisory service provided by the Section in general foundry problems has involved several minor laboratory investigations, including small-scale casting operations. Work has been continued on production of synthetic moulding sands using Australian bentonitic clays. 5. Physical Chemistry. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) This research programme comprises physico-chemical studies, both fundamental and applied, of the proper ties of surfaces, the properties of fluids, and the transfer of materials from one phase to another. Pundamental studies include liquid-vapour equilibria of value in distillation problems; the properties and reactions of fluids under high pressure, providing data of value in predicting the properties of liquid and gaseous systems; and the mass transfer of materials across liquid inter faces. On the applied side, set against a background of fundamental surface chemistry, are the selective flotation of minerals, the recovery of wool wax, dropwise condensation in condensers, the control of evaporationby surface films, continuous methods of separation, and the principles governing the effectiveness of fillers in rubber. (a) Rroperties of Liquids.\u2014Th.Q wide uses of indus trial chemical processes involving liquids, such as distillation and solvent extraction, make an understand ing of the thermodynamic properties of liquids and solutions of fundamental importance to the chemical engineer. The combined experimental and theoretical .study of this problem has therefore been continued. The liquid-vapour equilibria and heats of mixing of the system ethyl alcohol -(- carbon tetrachloride have been measured and the behaviour of the mixture has been explained theoretically. -Y convenient and accurate method has also been developed for the calculation of the composition of the vapour in equilibrium with a solution from the total vapour pressure. A theory previously developed for fU'edicting the properties of solutions containing alco hols has been extended to cover solutions of a number of other \" associated\" liquids, many of which are of industrial importance. A further theoretical advance has explained some of the properties of two-phase liquid .systems, particularly those which become completely miscible at both high and low temperatures. (b) Chemical and Physical Effects of High Pressure. \u2014The industrial importance of the accelerating in fluence of high pressures on some chemical reactions i.s now well established. But the amount of quantitative work which has been done on even simple chemical reactions is surprisingly small. A systematic study has therefore been initiated at the Division's High Pressure Laboratory in Sydney of both theoretical and experimental aspects of the chemical effects of pressure. This has established the underlying cause of many of the reported effects of pressure. Measurements are continuing on the displacement of equilibria and the changes in reaction rates brought about by pressures up to 12,000 atm. Further measurements have been made of the pressure-volume-temperature relationships of gases at both low and high pressures. The volumetric behaviour of hydrogen and deuterium at low temperatures has been shown, both by theory and experiment, to he subject to large quantum effects not found in heavier gases. The second and third virial coefficients (indicative of the departure of actual gases from the behaviour of an ideal gas) of a number of hydrocarbon gases have been computed from their published compressibilities and a molecular theory of these coefficients for polyatomic molecules in general is being worked out. This theory should be useful in predicting many of the properties under high compression of gases with complex molecules. (c) Continuous Adsorption Processes.\u2014The work on the purification of antibiotics by two fractional adsorp tion processes has been concluded and the results of one are in the press. These processes are being followed up by a local manufacturer. Some of the techniques devised for this work have been used in a continuous ion-exchange process with the ultimate aim of applying them in large-scale metallurgical processes. Special importance has been attached to the development of a continuous process. Previous attempts elsewhere have failed because of the use of vertical towers; these cause difficulties in moving a bed of ion-exchange resin in a uniform manner countercurrently to a flow of liquid. Difficulties are also encountered in removing resin uniformly over the whole cross-sectional area, and in avoiding abrasion of the resin. These disadvantages have been overcome by adapting a mineral jig, and the process developed provides ease of control and economy of resin, and it may be used for either stripping or fractionation. A bed of ion-exchange resin retained on119 a screen in a long narrow trough is maintained in a non-turbulent semi-fluid condition by a simple pulsating upflow which causes it to move linearly along the trough. Initially water softening was chosen as a process for study because of its experimental advan tages. Calcium ions are continuously removed from hard water in a softening unit and the calcium resin is regenerated (after removing excess water on a filter) by a countercnrrent flow of brine in a separate unit. The resin is then rinsed, de-watered, and returned to the softener. Thi.s proces.s, which is being operated on a pilot scale, appears likely to be adaptable to other operations, and a patent application has been lodged. (d) Mass Transfer.\u2014In connexion with some work which is being done on the separation of the com- ])onents of wool wax by solvent extraction, a study is being made of the effect of hydrodynamics in mass transfer of materials from one liquid phase to another. Basic information is being sought on the factors which govern the rate of extraction of a dissolved substance by the second liquid phase, in particular the kinds and extent of motion in the phases and, if one phase is present as droplets, the nature of movements within them. This information is being obtained by studying droplets in a hydraulic tunnel. (e) SvrfacR Films.\u2014A study has been made of the ])hysical and chemical projierties of spread mono- molecular layers of compounds .similar to those present in wool wax. It has been shown that the monolayer techniques may be used advantageously for deter mining the general architecture of molecules contain ing between 12 and 40 carbon atoms, and for determining the positions within the molecule of chemi cally reactive groups. It is considered that the tech niques will be particularly useful in determining the structure of material.s available only in small amounts, since only 0.0001 g. is required. The structure of eburicoic acid, a triterpene occurring in certain wood fungi, has been determined and shown to be similar to lanosterol, a constituent of wool wax. The configurations of a number of other compounds have also been determined. Attempts have been made to reduce evaporation from free water surfaces, a problem of some importance in areas of low rainfall, by covering the surface with insoluble surface films. A number of films were developed and found to he unaffected by wind and dii.st. jSleverthcless these films failed generally to reduce the natural rate of evaporation of w^ater. As a consequence the long-held view that the failure of .surface films results from damage has been abandoned, and the lack of success has been traced to compensating eft'ects resulting from heating of the water by the sun. Alternative methods of water conservation are being examined. (/) Wool Wax Recovery.\u2014The flotation method of recovering wool wax from scour liquors which was devised and developed in this Section has been modified to produce a wax superior to that usually obtained by other methods. It has aroused wide interest in Aus tralia and overseas and has recently been brought into commercial use. The process is described in Chapter XVI., Section 6. {fj) Flotation of Cassiterite.\u2014Work on the flotation of cassiterite from the ore from Maranboy, Xorthern Territory, was suspended Avhile still in its preliminary stages in order to complete the dcA^elopment of the process for recovering wool wax from scour liquors. Work on this ore has noAv been resumed and the results have been sufficiently encouraging to .justify an intensive investigation. (li) Condensation of Steam.\u2014The greatly improved beat transfer coefficient of a condenser surface on which condensation occurs as droplets rather than a film hasbeen further investigated by the use of an experimental boiler and condenser. A number of substances has been used to render the surface of the condenser hydro- phobic, but so far their effect in causing vapours to condense in a drop-wise fashion has been only tem porary. The range of surface treatments is being extended. Concurrently, a study is being made of the fundamental mechanism and kinetics of the pro cess. A quartz microhalance is being made for the measurement of the adsorption of Avater on hydro- phobic surfaces and is nearly complete. It will be of general value for adsorption studies, and for the deter- 111 illation of surface areas of powders. (/) JJclerof/enenvs Catalysis,- \u2014Because of the wide spread use of catalysts to accelerate reactions in tlie manufacture of chemicals, an understanding of liicir functions is of considerable importance in achiev ing maximum yields at Ioav temperatures. Work Avas concluded during the year on the rate of transport ol ase? and their reaction in the pores of two industrialh' important catalysts, thoria and alumina, and the wa.y rhe.se rates are affected by pressure, temperature, and size of pores. This work is described in a series of ])apers noAV in the press. (/') Reirifarcing and Extending Fillers for Biihher. \u2014.Vt present, reinforcing fillers for rubber, such blac'is and the .so-c.alled Avliite fillers (silica, alumina, and clays), are imported, and it is of both strategic and economic importance to delennine ubetl.i-r lo(-al raw nuiterials can be used successfull.y for this purpose. The mechanism of reinforcement is not fully understood and an attemqit is being made to deiermii e Avhat factors control it, and from this to develop laboratory methods which can be used to predict the reinforcing activity of a filler Avithout recourse to the time-consuming process of compound ing and testing samples of the filled rubbers. If simple technique.\u00ae could be developed it would greatly facili tate a .siir\\-e.y of Australian raw materials. Recent tests suggest that some Australian clay minerals may- prove .suitable as substitutes for some imported fillers. 6. Chemical Physics. (Division of Indu.strial Chemistry.) The main investigations in this field are: (i) the cbeniistry and physics of defect solids, basic to the whole of chemical industry; (ii) the structure and energetics of molecules, a problem of major importance in both iirimary and secondary industry; (iii) the structure of proteins; (iv) the development of specialized instruments and techniques. The Section has continued to give specialist service to industry, university science departments, research institutions, and other branches of this Organization. Xo fewer than 37 projects, some of a long-term nature, have been undertaken during the past year. Most of the tech niques first introduced into the country by the Section are now well established in scientific centres throughout the Commonwealth. One of Australia's most pressing needs is a scienti fic instrument industry adequate to meet the increasing- demands of national defence, chemical industry, and scientific inAmstigation. Details of instruments deA'e- loped in the Section and in other parts of the Division have been in demand all over the world; in one instance, in Avhich an instrument based on a neAv prin ciple was patented, licences have been sought by leading mannfacturers of spectroscopic instruments in both the Ignited Kingdom and the United States of America. The Division's experience in instrument development could well form a very significant part of the technical background essential for adequate expansion of instrument manufacture in Au.sti-alia.120 (ft) Frotein Structure Studies.\u2014Investigations of the structure of proteins, particularly fibrous proteins, such as wool, which are essential to an understanding of their properties, and of biological function, have been continued. This work, which includes the syn thesis of peptides, structure analysis by X-ray methods, and elcctron-microscopical studies at the macro-molecu lar level, is described in Chapter XVI., Section 13. (b) Chemical Physics of the Solid iStftte.\u2014Imper fections and defects in solids aie now widely recognized as the operative factors in chemical reactions in solids, ill the operation of catalysts, and in many important physical properties. The aim of this work is to obtain information on the nature and properties of defects in solid systems, so that their chemical properties may be interpreted. The apparatus for obtaining precise optical con stants of evaporated films of insulating solids has been completed and data have been obtained for zinc sulphide films over the visible and quartz ultra violet spectral regions. Techniques for obtaining reproducible evaporated films and for the measurement of their thickness by multiple-beam interferometry have been established. By studying the low-tempera ture photoconductivity simultaneously it is hoped to obtain an unequivocal energy level diagram for a par ticular solid. The luminescent properties, from which the nature and probability of electronic transitions in these solids may be determined, are being investigated by jieriodic excitation methods. Simple reactions, such as the oxidation of metals, are being studied to establish their mechanisms and the role of defects in the product oxide phase. An appara tus, incorporating a number of novel features, has been developed for this purpose. It is planned to follow this work with investigations designed to establish the nature and behaviour of the operative defect in each oxide phase. Electron diffraction studies on solids containing struc tural imperfections, such as dislocations, have allowed the nature of the dislocation and its relationship to the crystal symmetry to be established in specific instances. Some anomalous results in electron diffraction and the growth and habit of certain crystals (for example, copper oxide and zinc oxide formed under certain condition,?) have been explained. The structural im plications of impurity defects have been deduced for y-alumina containing small amounts of nickel, and gold containing small amounts of dissolved oxygen. (c) Molecular Slruc^vre Studies.\u2014Both experi mental and theoretical methods have been used in elucidating the structures of molecules and evaluating the mechanisms and energies associated with molecular processes. Data of these kinds are in continual demand for the solution of problems of applied chemistry. The development of new and more powerful method.? has played an important part in this work; this is dis cussed in more detail in Section G (d) below. fi) Structure Auahjsis hy X-ray Diffraction Methods.\u2014 Apart from the analyse.? wliich form partof the protein programme, the X-ray group has been engaged in two major structural studies. The struc ture of the physiologically interesting alkaloid, crypto- pleurine, is being analysed by the heavy-atom method, since chemical methods have failed to give definite infonnation on the structure of the molecule. The .structure analysis of the clay mineral vermiculite, undertaken in collaboration with the Cement and Ceramics Section, has been completed. (ii) Structure Analysis hy Electron Diffraction Methocls.\u2014Smgle-crystal structure analysis by elec tron diffraction method.? was pioneered in this Section.The specific advantages over the X-ray method, to which it is to some extent complementary, are that extremely small crystals may be studied and that the lighter atoms scatter electrons relatively more efficiently. Experimental and interpretive techniques have been refined. .Hydrogen-bond configurations have been demon strated directly in Fourier projections of the layer structure of boric acid; some unusual features of this configuration, neither known nor suspected, were found. From the fine .structure of reflections from small crystals of regular habit the structure factors for these reflection.? may bo deduced. The possibility of collect ing data in this way for subsequent structure analysis has been examined and a Fourier section of the MgO structure has been computed; this repre.sents the first structure analysis carried through by Fourier methods without reference to intensities of reflections. The potentialities of this method are considerable; problems associated with its application to unknown sti'uctures are being examined. (iii) SjiPctroscopic Studies of Molecular Interac tions.\u2014The absorption .spectra of simple compounds in .solution have been studied to obtain data on the nature and magnitude of interactions between molecules in solutions. The assignment of the electronic energy .state,? of iodine has been revised and potential energy curves have been computed from the available band .speetroseopic data. This is a neces.sary preliminary to a complete interpretation of iodine solution spectra. An officer of the Section, located in the Chemistry Department, University of Western Australia, has continued to work in collaboration with Professor X. S. Baylis.? on solution spectra in the vacuum ultraviolcc regio]i. (iv) Molecular lonization Potentials and Bond- Energies.\u2014Considerable progress has been made in the work directed tov.mrds the measurement of dissociation energies of bonds in molecules, of importance in chemi.stry, and the study of low-pressure ionization processes, of value, for example, in the physics of the upper utmosj)here. A new method of making these measurements, dis cussed more fully in Section 6 (d) below, has been devised. A completely unequivocal solution to the problem of interpreting ionization efficiency data has resulted; this is the first step in using these data for tbe deduction of reliable ionization potentials and bond disaociation energies. (v) Mechanism of Molecular Decomposition.\u2014One of the basic problems of chemical decomposition reac tions is the molecular mechanism by which it occurs.It is generally agreed that the initial step in photo chemical, thermal, or radiochemical decompositions inthe ga.=eous phase may be either the direct production of free radicals or an intramolecular rearrangement. The mass spectrometer has been used as an analytical (rel in the study of the photolysis of ketones. It is found that intramolecular rearrangement in such pro cesses involves migration of a hydrogen attached to a y-carbon atom to an a-carbon atom and rupture ofthe a-B carbon bond, whereas free radical decomposi tions occur in molecules for which this is not po.?sible (e.g. Mopropyl methyl ketone). (vi) Theoretical Studies.\u2014The calculation ofmolecular energies by existing methods is restricted bycomplexity to the simplest systems. A new method,ba.sed on an electrostatic approximation, ha? been developed It can be used to investigate molecules ofconsiderable complexity and the calculations may be made with less labour and greater accuracy.121 (i^) Development of Ohemico-physical Terhniquea. \u2014The development of new techniques and the improve ment of existing instruments and techniques is essen tial to the Section's programme of work. Scientific progress is often associated with advances in technique; it is this fact which has prompted close attention to technique and instrumentation in the Section. (i) Electron Microscopy.\u2014A microtome for cutting sections of biological specimens thin enough for ('lc(^tron-microscopieal examination has been con structed. This problem has received a great deal of attention in the last ten years, but only recently have real advances been made. This microtome has proved capable of cutting sections of protein crystals down to one molecule in thickness. Artefact detail is frequently encountered in electron micrographs of crystalline substances. These arc usually associated with electron reflection and inter ference. One such artefact, consisting of fringes of spacing 20-200 A over large areas of the surfaces of .lamellar crystals, has been investigated in an attempt to establish its origin. Acute shortage of laboratory space has delayed develo]>nient of an electron niicro.scope incorporating novel design features and electron-optical principles. (ii) Eleclron Diffraction.\u2014A direct and rapid method for the measurement of the intensities of diffracted electron beams by purely electronic means is being developed. The deficiencies of photographic methods may be circumvented if the method proves to be as successful as preliminary trials indicate. A new electron diffraction camera, in which small crystals giving a diffraction pattern may be observed electron-microseopically, is almost complete. This instrument has been designed to allow maximum possible information on the structure and habit of very small crystals to be obtained. (iii) X-ray Diffraction. \u2014 The high-temperature .adaptor for powder diffraction studies has been com pleted and used successfully. Adaptation to single- crystal specimens is under comsideration. An X-ray goniometer for automatic recording of single-crystal reflection intensities has been designed, and its construction is in progress. (iv) Spectroscopy.\u2014A novel approach to the spectro- ehemical estimation of elements, involving atomic absorption rather than emission, is being developed. Experiments have proceeded far enough to establish the superiority of this approach over conventional emis sion methods in sensitivity, reproducibility, and sim plicity. The technique is expected to have wide applica tion. The multiple-pass principle, used so successfully in infra-red spectrometers, has been applied to monochro- mators for use in the visible and ultraviolet employing photomultiplier detectors. The resolution attainable was found to be limited not by the optical resolution of the monoehromator but by the noise originating in the photomultiplier, proportional to the total radiation (chopped and unchopped) falling on the detector. A provisional patent specification has been lodged describ ing a method of circumventing this difficulty. The incorporation of the multiple-pass principle in a double- beam spectrometer is proceeding. (v) Mass Spectroscopy.\u2014Accurate ionization effici ency data are required for estimation of bond dissocia tion energies and ionization energies. An instrument which produces and displays the first and second deriva tives of ionization efficiency curves has been constructed for use with the mass spectrometer. The electricaloutput signals, corresponding to values of these deriva tives at discrete electron bombardment energies, are converted to digital form for ease of mathematical manipulation. (e) Service Work.\u2014Demands for service work con tinue to be heavy. Some of the more important problems are listed below. (i) Electron Microscopy.\u2014Characterization of a polyhedral insect virus; morphological study of plant mitochondria; examination of several strains of bac- teriophage; study of the peritrophic membrane from insect gut; identification of infective agent in certain plant virus diseases; study of the products of hydration cycle in kaolinite. (ii) Electron Diffraction.\u2014Identification of finely divided phases in clay and silica samples; identification of blemish on stainless steel; examination of aluminium films on mica for condensers. (iii) X-ray Diffraction.\u2014Identification of series of long-chain fatty acids; phase composition of iron oxides for town gas purification and its relation to efficiency; examination of ash from brown coal combustion; high- temperature study of mineral quartz of unusual thermal properties; phase composition of coal specimens. (iv) Spectroscopy.\u2014Investigation of ultraviolet ab sorption spectra of alkaloids; study of deterioration of paint films by reflection spectroscopy and establishment of colour standards; assay of chlorophyll concentrates; development of method for assay of antimony ores; spectrographic analysis of many alloy and mineral samples; systematic study of infra-red absorption of the porphyrins, compounds of considerable biochemical significance; study of the molecular structure of substi tuted sulphonamides; study of hydrogen-bonding in crystals of long-chain aliphatic compounds. (v) Mass Spectroscopy.\u2014Isotope analyses of gas mixtures from kinetic studies; determination of isotope ratios in nitrogen from metabolism experiments. (/) Instrument Laboratory:\u2014The major'items com pleted in the past year include: recording microtome for ultra-thin sectioning; vacuum zone plates; apparatus for micro-determination of nitrogen; amplifiers and power supplies for a variety of purposes; continuous circulation gas purification systems; ionization-type vacuum gauges; quantities of glass vacuum taps of special design; constant-pressure reaction system and control unit. The Instrument Laboratory has been responsible for the reconditioning, modernizing, and calibration of an ozone spectrophoto- meter and has advised on the production of large diameter gear wheels. The construction of a new electron diffraction camera, designed in the Section, is well advanced. 7. Organic Chemistry. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) The research programme has continued in the main directions described in the previous Report and is chiefly directed to the study of the chemistry and utilization of wool wax and sugar-cane wax, the examination of Aus tralian plants for alkaloids of po.ssible pharmaceutical value and of substances toxic to livestock, plastics investigations with particular reference to the mechanism of the phenol-formaldehyde reaction, and the examination of seed oils from Australian plants. (a) Wool Wax Derivatives.\u2014Further work has been done on the alcohols and acids of wool wax and on a number of their derivatives. A study is also being made of the catalytic hydrogen a tions of the acids to convert them into the commercially more useful alcohols, and of the possibilities of using the acids in the preparation of modified alkyd resins. These investigations are described in more detail in Chapter XVI., Section 6.122 (h) Svgar-cane Wax.\u2014The systematic examination of derived waxes, prepared from the mixture of free fatty acids which results from the bleaching process, has been continued. These derived waxes are made by Bsterifying the carboxyl group with a polyhydric alcohol or by converting it to a diamide; the effect of such chemical modification on the physical properties has been studied, concentrating on the requirements for a solvent paste polish. The requirements of a hard wax for this use are exacting, so that if a derived wax could be made Avhich satisfied them, it should he possible to make waxes from sugar-cane wax suitable for most industrial uses. The methylene and ethylene diamides and the pentaerythrityl ester waxes are the most promis ing of each group, and confer very high gloss on polishes made with them, while blends of the two groups are valuable in eliminating certain defects of each. The waxes mentioned compare very favorably with earnauba wax or its synthetic substitutes. It has also been shown that the differences in properties between bleached acidic waxes prepared with and without vacuum refin ing are reduced in their derivatives, and it appears possible that cheaper yet still useful derived waxes may be obtained by omitting the distillation under reduced pressure. A patent application covering the use of sugar-cane wax derivatives in polishes has heen made. A patent covering earlier stages of the process has been obtained here and in the ITnited States of America. Solvent refining of crude cane wax has been further studied, principally in regard to the use of acetone at pressures above atmospheric. (c) SInch Poisons and Plant Alkaloids.\u2014Work on stock poisons continues to centre on the pyrrolizidine bases which cause liver damage in stock. Both helio- triiie find lasiocarpine iV-oxidcs have now been isolated directly from Heliotropium europaeiim, as have three of the minor alkaloids. The importance of these amine oxides which accompany the parent hases has been con firmed in the Division of Animal Health, where it has been establi.5hed that heliotrine A-oxide has quali tatively the same liver-damaging properties as heliotrine itself. Progress made with the structure of the more important of the minor alkaloids shows that it is closely related to heliotrine. The alkaloids of Crotalarin retusa, now believed to be the species mainly responsible for Kimberley horse disease, have been isolated, and the principal con stituent identified as monocrotaline. Ragwort (Senecio jacohea), which is troublesome in parts of Victoria, is under investigation, and, of the two main alkaloids previously reported, one has been shown to he identical with a base occurring in certain other Senecio species. Other plants shown to contain alkaloids, probably of the pyrrolizidine group, are Echium plantagineum (Pater- son's curse or Salvation Jane) and Amsinckia inter media. The latter has caused liver necrosis in stock in the United States. In consequence of the experience gained with this group of alkaloids and of the fact that recognition of them hy chemical means should be quicker, cheaper, and perhaps more certain than feeding tests, arrange ments have been made to examine all plants belonging to pyrrolizidine-containing families which are under consideration for introduction into Australia. Indigo- fera endecaphylla has been examined in this regard; it contained a negligible amount of alkaloid. An investigation of Phalaris tuherosa, in collabora tion with the Divisions of Biochemistry and Animal Health, has been initiated with the object of isolating the neurotoxic principle which gives rise to \" Phalaris staggers\", a disease causing considerable losses on certain soil types.Structural work on the unique vesicant alkaloid cryptopleurine continues, and progress has been made in the search for suitable methods of degradation. Bio logical tests with cryptopleurine have shown that under certain conditions it stimulates nerve regeneration. It does not retard the growth of rat carcinoma 256. Biological testing of D-magnocurarine (from Gyro- carpus americanus) in the Physiology Department, University of Melbourne, shows it to pos.sess eurariform activity, but its potential value lies in its activity as a ganglionic blocking agent. Two new alkaloids have been isolated from an unnamed Kopsia species from north Queensland, and progress has been made with the structural examination of them. Fractionation of the physiologically active water-soluble extract of the bark of Balanops australa- ,sica has led to the concentration of the irritant material and the recognition of the presence of two active prin ciples. Work has been commenced, in collaboration with the Division of Entomology, on the extraction of timbers immune to Lyctvs, where there is evidence that the immunity is due to the presence of a substance or substances toxic to tbe insects. (d) E'als and Oils.\u2014 (i) Investigation of Potential Seed Oil Pesources.\u2014The examination of native oil- bearing plants for oils of possible industrial or scientific interest is being continued. The seed-kernel oils of Alectryon suheinereus (Sapidinaceae) and IBoth arc semi-drying oils; the latter may warrant further investigation because of its relatively high oil content. The e.xamination of the seed oil of the Kerguelen cabbage, described last year, has been com pleted; it is a semi-drying oil containing significant amounts of C^n aud O02 unsaturated acids, as do other members of the Cruciferae. (ii) General Chemistry of Long-chain Aliphatic Compounds.\u2014With a view to the conversion of the mono-unsaturated components of fats to more valuable materials, a study has been in progress of methods for increasing the unsaturation of mono-olefines. The principal difficulty is that the reagents examined show satisfactory activity with certain types of olefines only; with others undesirable competing reactions occur. .Attempts are being made to clarify the principles under lying the different types of reaction and, if possible, to find means of making the reaction generally applicahle for chlorination in the allyl position. A research chemist of an industrial firm has spent the current year working in this Section upon new outlets for fatty acids in this country. Several promising lines have been examined and some carried through to the pilot-plant scale. One of the officers working in the field of fats and waxes spent a few months in the Chemical Research Laboratory at Teddington developing a vapour-pressure method for the detection in long-chain organic com pounds of small amounts of closety related impurities. The method is capable of detecting, for example, 0.1 per cent, of palmitic acid in stearic acid. In the determination of the structures of long-chain compounds, it is often desirable to degrade the chain in a_ controlled manner, with as little disturbance as possible to the functional groups. Hew methods for effecting this are being studied. Work in this Section on long-chain compounds often makes it possible to supply samples of chemical otherwise difficult to obtain to people needing them. A number of samples of high molecular weight saturated, unsaturated, and hydroxy-acids have been made avail able in this way to researeh groups in universities and other institutions.123 (e) Plastics Investigations.\u2014(i) Kinetics of the Phenol-formaldehyde Peaction.\u2014It is proving difficult to interpret the results so far obtained in the study of the rate at which formaldehyde reacts with certain phenols. An exact interpretation is being sought, with out the approximations and assumptions which have hitherto been made in published work on the subject. One complicating factor is that the rate of the con comitant Cannizzaro reaction of formaldehyde is in fluenced by the pre.sence of the phenol. Moreover, experiments have shown that the mechanism of this reaction is still not clear. As a knowledge of this is important for the solution of the main problem, time has had to be spent in seeking accurate values for the ionization constants of formaldehyde and examining the true mechanism of the Cannizzaro reaction. (ii) Aniline-formaldehyde Resins. \u2014 Although detailed work on this project ceased two years ago, some aniline-formaldehyde resins have been prepared and the mechanical strengths of their mouldings examined. The object was to test whether certain additives, furfural and benzylaniline in particular, would enable good mouldings to be obtained as they had previously been shown to plasticize the resin. It was found possible to lower the moulding temperature and obtain high mechanical strengths; both initial plasticizing and subsequent hardening could be obtained, but both were insufficient for a good commercial mould ing powder. (iii) Tigaso Oil.\u2014A ISTew Guinea oil, known by this and other names, is an exudate of the tree Campnosper- muin brcvipetiolatnm and a local article of commerce. Some twenty years ago, work in the University of Queensland showed that it was chemically similar to the liquid secreted in the cashew-nut shell, a substance which is the basis of a variety of phenolic resins greatly in demand for their chemical resistance and rubbery properties. The sample examined by the Queensland workers came from a different locality and differed in some of its properties from the material now under investigation. A study of its constitution is being undertaken, preparatory to investigating its value as a resin constituent. (/) Microanalytical Laboratory.\u2014The microann- lytical laboratory is now well established, and its ser vices have been widely used by organic chemists of the Organization, the universities, and industrial laboratories. The range of determinations available is steadily widening, and now includes carbon and hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, all halogens, sulphur, methoxyl, U-methyl, C-methyl, acetyl, active hydrogen, molecular weight, ashes and sulphate ashes, and various metals. During the past year some 3,600 separate determinations were carried out, of which approximately 50 per cent, were for university workers, and 25 per cent, each for the Organization and for industry. In addition, some special analytical investi gations were done to assist an industrial laboratory with their research programme on the pulping of wood from different eucalypt species. Analytical research has also been in progress. Apart from general work on the improvement of standard procedures, this includes the development of new and more rapid methods for some constituents. 8. Chemical Engineering. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) Fundamental studies of particular application in chemical engineering are the investigation of liquid- vapour equilibria, the physical and chemical effects of high pressures, and the development of new chemical engineering techniques. These have been described under the heading of Physical Chemistry. The majorinvestigations in the applied field have been directed to fuel research, but work has also been done on the fluid-bed roasting of alunite, and a start has been made on the construction of a large pilot plant for the conversion of copper concentrates to sulphates by roasting in a fluid bed. (a) Coal Litilimtion Research. \u2014 Investigations related to the gasification of brown coal have been con- tinned. An account of this work will be found in Chapter XX., Section 9. (b) Alunite Investigations.\u2014The utilization of Western Australian alunite as a source of potash fertilizer is vitally dependent on the control of the roasting process ivhich breaks down the alunite struc ture and renders the potassium sulphate portion soluble in water. The industry based on this process, which was founded during the war, failed as an economic \\enture because, after treatment in the type of roaster used, a rotary kiln, only 65 per cent, of the available potash could be recovered in a soluble form. It became obvious that very close control of the temperature and other conditions was required during roasting to pre vent the interference of secondary reactions by which potassium sulphate was again locked up in an insoluble form. It appeared that by roasting in a fluidized bed this control might be achieved. During the year a series of batch roasts was carried out in a 8-in. diameter fluid- l;cd roaster, to determine the optimum conditions for I'oasting alunite. The results were encouraging and plans are now being made to convert this unit to enable continuous roasting tests to be performed. It ajipears likely that yields of potassium sulphate of up to 90 per cent, may be obtained by this means; this would make the process more attractive economically. However, considerations of heat economy may make the design of the full-scale roaster somewhat complicated and expensive. Concurrently with this work an officer located in the University of Western Australia studied the chemistry of alunite, and the convergence of these two approaches has led to his joining the group in Melbourne. (c) Roasting of Copper Concentrates.\u2014During the year the Organization entered into a co-operative arrangement with Mount Morgan Ltd. and the Mount Lyell Mining and Eailway Go. Ltd. to build and operate a pilot plant incorporating a 3-ft. 6-in. diameter thiidizcd bed to investigate the sulphate roasting of their copper concentrates. Both companies believe that very great advantages may result from a major change in their processes for the recovery of copper and precious metals from mill concentrates. The new pro cess involves roasting to obtain most of the copper in a soluble form as copper sulphate, leaching of the cal cines, and electrolysis of the pregnant leach liquors. The gold and silver remain in the leach residues and may be recovered by cyanidation. Until the advent of the fluidized-solids technique as applied to roasting, it was not possible to control the roasting conditions sufficiently to obtain the copper consistently in the desired form. Preliminary tests in fluid-bed roasters have given very favorable results but, because of the large capital expenditure which would be involved in such a major change in their operations, the two companies desire to investigate the process on a considerably larger scale before making a decision. The pilot plant envisaged will roast about 3 tons per day of concentrates. Most pf the equipment required for this plant has been delivered or is on order and erection has started. It is hoped to commence operations towards the end of 1953. (d) Process Equipment Laboratory.\u2014This year there has been an accelerated demand for the services ofthe Process Equipment Laboratory, chiefly for pilot- plant testa and large-scale extractions 'of natural124 materials preliminary to laboratory investigations. In all, seven pilot plants have been completed, fifteen tests have been carried out on process equipment, and 31 extractions made from natural materials. In a number of instances substantial savings in the cost of develop ing new processes have been possible as a direct result of the availability of pilot-scale equipment. The range of equipment available for this type of work has also been improved by the installation of a four-stage steam- jet air ejector XIX. MIXERAGEAPHY AXD OEE-DEESSIXG. 1. General. The importance of investigations for the development of the mining industry and the utilization of Aus tralia's mineral resources has not been overlooked by the Organization. Mineragraphic work to provide information on the mineral composition of ores has been in progress in Melbourne since 1927. The techniques used are highly specialized and require considerable experience, so that it is only rarely that they can be applied by the staffs of the operating mines. The current work of the Mineragraphic Investigations Unit is described in Section 2 of this Chapter. The Ore-dressing Laboratories operated in Melbourne in collaboration with the University Department of Metallurgy and in Kalgoorlie in co-operation with the School of Mines investigate the composition of ores and provide advice on the most suitable methods for their full-scale treatment. This work is reported in Sections 3 and 4 of this Chapter. Work on the utilization of minerals is carried out at the Division of Industrial Chemistry (see Chapter XYIII., Section 2). Work by this Division on the flotation of minerals is reported in Section 5 of this Chapter. 2. Mineeagbapiiic Investigations. (Mineragraphic Investigations Unit.) Thirty-seven investigations have been carried out into the mineral association of rocks, drill cores, and mill products submitted by mining companies and institutions. Several of these are related to the search for new mineral deposits and twelve have been con cerned with the experimental treatment of ores in the Ore-dressing Laboratories. The latter include ores and concentrates from the Home of Bullion mine. Pioneer Scheelite mine, Coronet Hills mine, and the Peko mine in the Horthern Terri tory, and from the Jackass mine at Inveragh and the Grasstree Gold mine near Mackay in Queensland. During the year Dr. A. B. Edwards completed the editing of a symposium on the Geology of Australian Ore Deposits for the Empire Mining Congress in Aus tralia in 1953. The work brings into a single, docu mented volume the substance of published and unpub lished information on the composition, structure, and regional setting of Australian ore deposits. A further study of the lead-zinc ores of Captain's Flat, Hew South Wales, has shown that the deeper levels of the mine maintain the same hoinogeneous composition and mineral relations that have been re ported in the upper levels. Features in Keating's ore body which are repeated in the wide section of Elliot's ore body indicate that the behaviour of Keating's lode in depth may be a guide to the likely behaviour in depth of the northern section of Elliot's lode. Keating's lode, after attaining a maximum zine:lead ratio of 2:1 on the 1,070-ft. level, has shown a decline in the zinc:lead ratio, in overall grade, and in metal content below this level.A study of garnets at Broken Hill in all rock types from the lode outwards to the Hanging Wall gneiss has shown that they are all almandines and that there is no significant variation in properties or composition that could be used to distinguish a particular bed or to indicate the origin of the garnets. Lode garnets are, by contrast, rich in manganese and, in some cases, lime as well as manganese. The differences are striking and indicate that the conditions making for manganese garnets or manganese-calcium garnets did not extend beyond the confines of the lode. Assays of bauxite from Hapier's quarry, Mirboo North, have indicated, from time to time, that the whole of the aluminium hydroxide is not present in the form of the trihydrate, gibbsite. The presence of the mono- hydrate, boehmite, was therefore suspected and its existence at Napier's quarry has been confirmed by X-ray powder patterns by Dr. J. McAndrew. X-ray powder patterns have also confirmed the presence of tellurobismutite in the auriferous ore from the Grass- tree Gold mine, Queensland, the presence of halloysite as the siliceous impurity in the alunite ore from Bulahdelah, New South Wales, and the existence of a mixed layer hydromica in sandstone from the Styx coalfield, Queensland. The examination of specimens of oolitic iron forma tion from north-west Western Australia directs atten tion to the possibility of the presence of low grade oolitic iron ores in Australia. The specimens contain much silica and no lim.e by comparison with English oolitic iron ores, yet they indicate the desirability of further investigation of the deposits. The investigations have been facilitated by contribu tions from a number of mining companies through the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. The University of Melbourne has also co-operated in provid ing laboratory accommodation. 3. Oee-deessing Investigations. (Melbourne Laboratory.) At Melbourne, where work is done in co-operation with the Department of Mining of the University, 30 reports were issued (Nos. 423-452 inclusive). These refer to the development of treatment methods for ores of gold, copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, and tin, and to work done on beach sands, magnetite, alluvial diamonds, antimony slag, brown coal overburden, and brass dross. Together with investigations not yet completed, these indicate continued interest in the treatment of tin and tungsten ores, and in the recovery of gold from sulphide concentratas produced at Victorian gold mines. 'There is also a revival of interest in cobalt ores. Work was done on the application of gravity and magnetic methods of concentration to recover wolfram and scheelite from a fine-grained ore from southern New South Wales. The relative efficiencies of two flow slieets, each of which involved stage-grinding and concentration, were compared. An interesting feature of this ore is that not only the wolfram but also a large proportion of the gangue is magnetic. Following the investigation of samples of magnetic ore, a plant has been erected in New South Wales to provide magnetite medium for heavy media coal clean ing plants. Work reported in connexion with beach sands has been to a large extent concerned with the production of high grade monazite concentrates. Work, not yet re ported, has been done on the elimination of chromite from an ilmenite concentrate by magnetic separation after heat treatment. Investigation of an alluvial gravel from New South Wales showed that the diamonds were very poor con ductors, while the gravel (mainly quartzite and tourma line) was relatively conducting. The relatively high125 conductivity of the quartzite was unexpected. Electro static separation was possible at a size coarser than 6 mesh. The company concerned has since built a pilot roll-type separator to carry out tests in the held. Work, not yet reported, has been done on the electro static separation of silica from granular lime-sand from Western Australian beaches. jMo appreciable separation was possible when the mixture was cold even after thorough drying. However, on heating to 90\" 0. the silica developed strong negative charges and the lime positive charges, which made possible a remarkably good separation. The Western Aus tralian Department of Industrial Development has since built a pilot pilate-type separator. Investigation of the rate of adsorption of caprylic acid at a nickel-water interface indicated that the adsorption proceeded with no activation energy. The adsorption was reversible and followed the Gibbs adsorption equation. Multilayers of acid were formed on the metal surface. Further development of a polarographic method for the determination of oxygen in treatment-plant solu tions has taken place. It is possible to determine the oxygen content of simple flotation and cyanide pulps quite readily with an accuracy better than 5 per cent. Ions of Oh, 804^\", GHS~, SaOs^\", Fe(CJSr)6''~ in con centrations normally met in practice do not interfere; neither does 0.1 per cent. On. In the presence of zinc the determination is possible but more difficult. Lead at low alkalinities has no efi'ect, but at high alkalinities there is serious interference with the method. Further work is proceeding. 4. Oee-dressing Investigations. (Kalgoorlie Laboratory.) Sixty reports were issued, and of these 20 covered metallurgical investigations and the remaining 40 covered assays or analyses. Six investigations were concerned with gold ores or treatment problems. One of these investigations gave a method of treatment for a complex silver, gold, copper sulphide ore. Eight reports dealt with the results of work on a variety of tungsten ores, and included the results of some pilot-plant work. Three lead-silver or lead-zinc ores were examined. The remaining three metallurgical investigations were shorter ones, and were concerned with spodumene, talc, and tin ore tailings. The assays and analyses included a variety of determinations. A few gold assays were made, but the work mainly con sisted of determinations which could not readily be made elsewhere in Kalgoorlie. The volume of inquiries for technical assistance from industry was maintained. During the year most of the equipment required for an 100-200 Ib./hr. pilot plant was received. 5. Flotation Investigations. (Division of Industrial Chemistry.) Following some encouraging results from pre liminary tests, the Physical Chemistry Section of the Division of Industrial Chemistry has commenced an intensive investigation of the flotation of cassiterite from an ore from Maranboy, Northern Territory. XX. FUEL. 1. General. The main research centre for the Organization's investigations on fuels is the Coal Eesearch Section, located at Eyde, New South \"Wales. The work of this Section is reported in Sections 2-7 of this Chapter. The Division of Industrial Chemistry undertakes work on the engineering aspects of gasification and utilization of low-rank coals, and this is reported in Section 9.Co-operative investigations' on the fossil pollen m brown coal are undertaken in the Botany School of the University of Melbourne, and are reported in Section S. During the year a Consultative Committee for Brown Coal Eesearch and Development was estab lished to co-ordinate the separate endeavours of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, and the Organization in Ihe field of brown coal research. Coal Research Section.\u2014This Section was estab lished to undertake a fundamental and comprehensive study of the physical and chemical characteristics of Australian coals. The main object of this study is to make available for indigenous coals data on: (1) coking, gas-making and burning properties, and behaviour on carbonization and combustion; (2) the beneficiation likely to result from coal cleaning and preparation; (3) the most rational methods of thermal and chemical utilization. The Section's laboratory is now being equipped for tar and gas analysis, and for the determination of ignition temperatures and reactivity of solid fuels. Accommodation for carbonization plant, coal combus tibility test furnaces, and physical testing apparatus has been completed and a considerable portion of equip ment installed. A building for coal washing equipment is Hearing completion. For maximum economy in the laboratory work con nected with the search\" in New South Wales for coal deposits suitable for open-cut development, the Joint Coal Board has transferred its laboratory and staff at North Eyde to the Organization, which has under taken the examination of bores drilled in this search by the Joint Coal Board and by the Bureau of Mineral Eesourees. Thus it is possible to include in the coal survey seams which might not otherwise have been available for many years. Liaison between the Coal Eesearch Section and the major coal producers and users in New South Wales has been established by the setting up of the Coal Eesearch Advisory Committee as a sub-committee of the New South Wales State Committee of the Organization. The Officer-in-charge, in his capacity as Australian member of the Commonwealth Committee on Fuel Eesearch, continues to act as co-ordinator of reviews of fuel research dealing with physical testing of coal and petrographie investigations generally and with work on brown and sub-bituminous coals. Liaison con tinues to be maintained with Australian and overseas standards authorities. Senior officers of the Section have assisted to establish an active group of the Institute of Fuel in Australia. Fifty technical inquiries have been received during the year. Officers of the Section assisted in the presentation of a series of post-graduate lectures in solid fuel technology given under the a'uspices of the University of Sydney and the New South Wales University of Technology. 2. Examination of Coal Seams. (Coal Eesearch Section.) (a) Western Field of New South Wales.\u2014An initial survey of the western field involving the examination of some eighteen pillar and channel samples has been completed with the sampling of the cross measure drift driven by a New South Wales State coal mine. However, the information obtained from this drift was not as useful as expected, because of the poor develop ment of the seams exposed between the Lithgow and the \" dirty \" seams.126 (b) Southern Field of New South Wales.\u2014A pre liminary survey of the Bulli, Wongawilli, Tongarra, and Woonona seams of the southern field has been com pleted. Altogether 34 pillar or channel samples and seven deep bores were examined in the course of this work. (r) Northern Field of New South Wales.\u2014A .survey of the Greta coal measures in the Maitland-Cessnock- Muswellbrook district of the northern field has com menced and samples have been obtained from three of the five collieries working the Homeville seam. Samples from the available Tomago series, including the Donaldson's Rathluba, and Big Ben seams, from four collieries in the East Maitland district, have been examined. A further number of samples from trial shafts put down by the Joint Coal Board in the Muswellbrook- Singleton district has been examined. The shatts penetrated uncorrelated seams, probably Muswellbrook- Greta and associated seams, in the Balmoral-Broke open-cut areas. The four or five seams in this area are of variable thickness. Although comparable in ash content, they are generally lower in volatile matter, have variable coking properties, and are inferior for gas-making to the Greta coal of the Cessnock area. One or possibly two of the seams are second-grade gas coals. ISTine deejr bores, put down by the Joint Coal Board in its deep drilling programme to determine structure in the northern district, have been examined. These penetrated the Wallarah, Great TTorthern, Fassifern, Pilot, Australasian, Montrose, \"Wave Hill, Fern Valley, Victoria Tunnel, Young Wallsend, and Borehole seams and some others so far uncorrelated. Reports on 160 cores from bores drilled in connexion with the Joint Coal Board's open-cut programme have been prepared. 3. CAmbustiojs' PiiOPjiKTiK.s OF Austrai.ian Coals. (Coal Research Section.) The importance of this field of fuel utilization can be gauged by the fact that it absorbs more than half the Australian deep mine coal. It is not yet possible to predict the behaviour in use of Australian coals from the results of chemical analysis or from abnormalities observed with respect to the methods of classification of coal used overseas. Because of this, and to establish correct usage of various types of coal, a survey of the ignition and combustion characteristics of Australian coals with particular reference to the evaluation of coal for combustion is being carried out. Experience has shown that no one burnability test can be used universally to assess combustion characteristics of a fuel under all conditions of use. Therefore equip ment for carrying out tests on the reactivity of coal and coke, determinations of ignition temperatures of solid fuels, the rate of propagation of ignition in beds, the inflammability of coal dusts in suspension, and the burning of coal and coke fired in underfeed and over feed fuel beds has been installed. W.ork has also been carried out to establish the technique of operating an experimental furnace fur measuring the velocity of ignition of different coal typos. The pilot-scale com bustion furnaces for studying the burnability of coal fired in underfeed and overfeed fuel beds are almost complete. Preliminary tests have been carried out to determine the iiermeability of fuel beds, in order to arrive at standard conditions for use with these furnaces.The ignition temperature of a number of representa tive Australian coals over a wide range of rank has been determined, and correlations with other properties are being made. Typical results are: Collie coal(Wc.-tern Australia), l'24\u00b0 C.; Greta coal Moorland.? coal (South Australia), i60\" C.; Bulli coal (Yew South Wales), 172-177\u00b0 C. It i.s intei'csting to note that the ignition temperatures of coal from Blair Athol, Callide, Yallourn, and Lithgow are within a narrow range of 142\u00b0-146\u00b0 C., ami that Collie coal is the most reactive of Australian coals as indicated by this method. 4. Carbonizing Properties. (Coal Research Section.) The carbonizing properties of Australian coals are being investigated using a pilot-scale plant similar to that designed jointly by the United States Bureau of Mines and the American Gas Association. During the year, this has been completely overhauled, struc tural modifications made, and the plant reassembled in a new building. Results of test runs previou.sly carried out on coal from the Liddell, Yattai Bulli, and Greta seams are being computed. 5. Physical Properties. (Coal Research Section.) Knowledge gained from the physical testing of coal is essential for good mining practice and the develop ment of efficient coal handling and crushing plant. The growing demand for pulverized fuel and the increasing attention being paid to the sizing ami cleaning of coal emphasize the importance of investiga tions into .size degradation processes. Studies of the ])liysical properties of coal include measurements of coal sti'ength, friability, particle size distribution of the broken material, resistance to breakage by attri tion and by impact, grindability, and abrasiveness. The installation and testing of equipment for carrying out abrasion and grindability investigations have been commenced. 6. Coal Constitution. (Coal Research Section.) (a) Permanganate Oxidation.\u2014Further samples of coal have been tested in connexion with the investiga tion of the correlation between rank and reactivity to boiling alkaline permanganate. The effect of drying of earthy brown coal on its permanganate reactivity was examined and found to be negligible. (h) Petrography.\u2014The stratigraphic zoning of the Permian coal-measures in Yew South Wales presents Jifficulties since the absence of reliable zone macro- tossils has made the precise intercorrelation of se]iarate coal basins a difficult ta.sk. The possibility of using the distribution of certain mierospores for this purpo.se as well as for correlating individual coal .-earns is being iuvestia'atcd. The work of classifying, (citaloguing, and studying the distribution of spore types in major coal beds has commenced, and a .first report on the spore flora of the Lithgow seam has been drafted. The investigation of the petrographical com- pusition of Au.-tralian coals by the microscopic exami nation of thin sections using transmitted light and of polished and etched sections using incident light, con tinued throughout the year. Profiles of the Bulli, Tongarra, Top Greta, and portion of the Main Greta .seam.s are being studied. (r) Minor Constituents.\u2014The examination of coal ashes by emission .spectrography has continued and serni-quautitative estimations made of the elements present. Preparations are being made for quantitative127 estimations. Examination of composite samples from tlie Bulli seam show traces of manganese, nickel, copper, molybdenum, and lead, and vanadium and zinc in larger quantities. All these elements are present in the Bulli seam throughout the coal-field, but cadmium and zirconium have been detected in coal from the northern area only. The occurrence of germanium in quantity higher than is usual has been detected in a sample from the seam taken in the Burragorang Valley. (d) Mineral Matter-Ash Relationships.\u2014In order to classify and compare coals for certain purposes, it is necessary to know accurately the carbon content of the pure coal, that is, mineral matter and moisture free coal substance. Estimation of the mineral matter in coal is usually made from a knowledge of the composition of the ash, but this is a laborious process and a method of estimat- \"ing mineral matter in coal which does not involve deter mination of ash comijosition is desirable. The relation ship between mineral matter and ash in Australian coals is being investigated using several different techniques. A study of the examination of coal by ultraviolet light microscopy has established that, owing to very strong absorption, it is not practicable to obtain trans mission photomicrographs of thin sections of coal or coke with ultraviolet radiation. Transmitted ultra violet radiation reveals finer structural detail in some minerals, but used alone is not suitable for their identification. Work on the examination of coal by X-ray diffraction has commenced, and identification of .-some minerals present has been made. In the Bulli and Tongarra seams occurrences of well-preserved wood structure have been observed, in which the agent of petrincation has been shown to be kaolinite. 7. Mxthods or Analysis. (Coal Besearch Section.) G-euerally, the methods of analysis used by this Section are those specified by the Australian and British Standards institutions or by the British Fuel Research Station. Investigations of and comparison with other methods continue. (a) Approximate Ash Analysis.\u2014It has been sug gested that the tendency of a coal ash to form clinker may be predicted from an estimation of the water- soluble, acid-soluble, and insoluble fractions of the a.sh. This approximate ash analysis is stated to be le.ss time-consuming than the full silicate analysis, and the method and its usefulness as applied to Australian coals have been investigated during the past year. (b) Direct Determination of Oxygen in Coal.\u2014The oxygen content of coal may be determined either by difference after the estimation of other constituent elements or directly by tlie incorporation of the oxygen in determinable compounds. These methods applied to .such a complex and heterogeneous sub.stance as coal are liable to error, and methods for the direct determina tion of oxygen are being investigated. (c) Sulphur in (7oaL\u2014Some coals are difficult to u.se for certain purposes because of their high sulphur content, and investigations have been continued into the occurrence of different forms of sulphur in coal. It has bctm found that coal thio-ether.s react with methyl iodide as dialkenyl sulphides and not as dialkyl sulphides. (d) Tar Analysis.\u2014Analyses of tars from the carbonization plant have continued and a number of methods of determining the constituents of coal tar arc being investigated.8. Mickostbuotube of Bbown Goal. (Pollen Research Unit.) The Pollen Research Unit at the Botany School, University of Melbourne has continued studies on the fossil pollens in brown coals. Five papers have been published during the year on this work. Samples from Gomaum, South Australia, are being investigated and it has been shown that the pollen content of a coaly deposit occurring at 620 feet is completely distinct from that of a sandstone at 650 feet. The composition of the younger flora E identical with that of a Tertiary clay at Wensleydale, Victoria, whereas the older has a Jurassic aspect. The Unit is also studying Gretaceous rocks from various parts of Australia in the hope that the pollen in these rocks will shed light on the development of the Tertiary flora. 9. Utilization of Low-bank Goal. (Division of Industrial Ghemistry.) Investigation of the gasification of Victorian brown coals has continued. Modifications have been made to the coal feed equipment, and to the control system of the fiuidized bed synthesis gas pilot plant and a number of experimental runs has been completed. The analysis of the experimental data from these runs is complicated by the difficulty of determining accurately the water vapour content of the product gas. Many of the proposed methods for carrying out this determination have been investigated experimentally but a completely satisfactory method has not yet been devised. The erection of equipment required for the investi gation of the production of gas of high calorific value by the pressure gasification of brown coal is Hearing completion. The equipment is designed to investigate under continuous steady-stage conditions the reaction between brown coal and carbon monoxide-hydrogen mixtures at pressures up to 50 atm. The aim of this work is to obtain information on the mechanism and rate of methane formation during pressure gasification, and to make a preliminary evaluation of a new two- stage pressure gasification process. The first part of the pilot plant, which has been designed to produce and store up to 3,000 cubic feet of a hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture in a given ratio, has been completed and tested. The erection of the second part, the actual reaction system, is well advanced. The major pilot-plant projects described above are being supported by fundamental studies related to the gasification of coal. The study of the cataly.sis of the gasification reaction by ash constituents has been con tinued, and subsequently completed as far as the water- gas shift reaction is concerned. Some work has been (uirried out on the influence of inorganic constituents on the reactivity of carbon towards steam, and attention is now being given to the catalysis of methane syn thesis by ash constituents. Apparatus has been built to study the flow and diffusion of gas within the pores of the powdered solid catalyst and to determine the poi'e size and distribution in coal-char particles. Some progress has been made on the investigation of the influence of pressure on the kinetics of the carbon-steam reaction but it has been limited by shortage of staff. XXI. PHYSICAL METALLURGY. 1. General. A considerable programme of research in metallurgyis undertaken at the Section of Physical Metallurgy established in the Research School of Metallurgy at theUniversity of Melbourne under Professor\"'.!. XGreenwood._ This work is described below. \"Work oiimetal physics is in progress within the Division of Iribophysies (see Chapter XXII.).m Tlie work of the Division of Industrial Chemustry on foundry sands is reported in Chapter XVIII., Section 4. Section of Fliysical Metallurgy.\u2014The investigations have progressed along the lines indicated in the pre vious Annual Report, the main topics being; titanium alloys, the oxidation of titanium, and the mechanism of plastic deformation in metals. Advice has been given to industrial firms and Government Departments on a wide variety of topics including heat-treatment problems, prevention of cor rosion, the selection of alloys for unusual applications, and the use of the new microscopical techniques which have been adapted by the Section for the study of metallurgical problems. Officers of the Section have continued to assist in the training of post-graduate students. 2. Titanium and its Alloys. (Section of Physical Metallurgy.) (a) Alloys.\u2014The chief aim of this work has been to provide a general understanding of the factors which affect the alloying properties of titanium. The study of titanium alloys containing elements with atomic sizes close to that of titanium has been continued and detailed investigations of titanium-tin and titanium- silver alloys have been completed. The results of these and earlier investigations by the Section have been considered together with results from overseas labora tories, with a view to deducing empirical laws relating to the formation of solid solutions in the allotropes of titanium. It has been found that solutions of non- transitional elements in both forms of titanium seem to conform with rules relating to atomic size and crystal- lattice geometry. Solutions of the transitional metals in the high-tcmpcrature form of titanium also appear to obey these rules, hut solutions in the low-tempera- lure form do not. {h) Reaction with Oxygen.\u2014The extremely rapid oxidation of titanium and it.s alloys at temperatures in excess of 500^ 0. is a major problem in the develop ment of these materials for use at high temperatures. It has been found that the diffusion of oxygen in the titanium metal during the progress of oxidation largely governs the rate at which the oxidation proceeds. This is unusual because, in general, the oxidation of metals and alloys is almost invariably controlled by the diffu sion of metal or oxygen through the intervening oxide layer. An oxidation mechanism which is controlled by diffusion of oxygen within the metal itself suggests that the high-temperature oxidation of titanium may he reduced by suitable alloying of the metal. This aspect will be investigated. An X-ray diffraction study of the lower oxides of titanium has been completed and the results have been used in interpreting the composition and structure of various oxide scale layers formed during the oxidation of titanium. (c) Chemical Studies.\u2014The chemical compositions of the oxide scales formed on the surface of metallic titanium in the oxygen .surface-reaction work have been investigated. It has been found that the presence of some metallic foreign elements can have an important effect on the oxidation rate. Chemical methods have been used to verify the oxygen distribution between the scale and the metal. The reactions between titanium monoxide, sesqui- oxide, and non-stoichiometric dioxide and chlorine have been investigated. The thiocyanate-tungsten reaction is being investi gated as a method for the estimation of tungsten in titanium metal..3. Creep of Lead and its Alloys, Aluminium AND Zinc. (Section of Physical Metallurgy.) The use of lead and lead-thallium alloys as con venient materials on which slow deformation can be studied at room temperature has been continued. At the same time, the effect on the creep characteristics of additions of an alloying element (thallium) within the range of solid solution have been related to (a) grain size in relation to cross-sectional area of sjsecimcn, (b) grain refinement in alloys whose lattice spacing is very close to that of lead, (c) increased crystal strength in other alloys. Alloys in groups (a) aiid (b) may be regarded as pure lead of varying grain size and have been used in detailed observations of microstructural ehanges during creep. Ordinary microscopy was supplemented by the oi phase-contrast, multiple-beam interferometry, polarized light, and X-ray diffraction. It has been found that- there is a complex interrelation of various types of slip, deformation bands, and surfaee steps with bodily move ment and rotation of grains and migration of their boundaries; this relation also depends on grain size and rate of strain. A sub-structure in X-ray reflec tions has been observed under specific conditions, but this does not appear to correspond with sub-grains, as in aluminium. The above investigations have led to a re-examination of work on the creep of lead-tellurium alloys, which crack markedly. In consequence, collaboration with the School of Metallurgy has been extended and new experiments are in progress; already, the influence of grain size has been found to be important. In conjunction with the Metallurgy Research Department of the University, an investigation into the formation and development of sub-structures in aluminium and zinc has been carried out, using polarized light and multiple-beam interferometry. The main result emphasizes the importance of defor mation bands. XXII. TRIBOPHYSICS. 1. General. 'I'he Division of Tribophysics has developed from the former Lubricants and Bearings Section established during the war to assure essential information to Aus tralian engineering industry in the manufacture of bearings for aero and other engines. The original investigations have been continued and extended to include fundamental studies in metal physics and work on reaction kinetics. Major advances have been made in the knowledge of distortions in metals produced by plastic deformation, of phase changes in metals, and of the mechanism of slow combustion of hydrocarbons. Division of Tribophysics.\u2014During the past year a major advance has been made in the understanding of the disturbances which are produced in a metal by plastic deformation, and it has been possible to correlate distinct types of disturbances with changes in proper ties of a metal cansed by this deformation. The new laboratory built for the Division in the grounds of the University of Melbourne has partly been occupied. Thanks are due to the University of Mel bourne for the generous hospitality the Division has enjoyed since its inception, in the Chemistry School. Active co-operation with the Chemistry, Metallurgy, Physics, and Engineering Departments has continued. Prequent advice and assistance was given to many industrial and governmental organizations and officers of the Division have continued to act on various com mittees, in particular the Engineering Group Com mittee.129 2. Peopekties of Suefaces. (Division of Tribopliysics.) Apart from investigations on some practical aspects of friction and lubrication, tbe work on the physics and chemistry of solid surfaces is concerned mainly with the effects of the arrangement of the atoms in the surface on its properties. Work is also being done on such properties of silicone oils as are important for lubrication and surface protection. (a) Bearing Testing.\u2014The relative jjroperties of tin Babbit and cadmium-silver bearings have been investigated mainly in relation to running-in and seizure behaviour.- The Babbit bearing appears to be less sensitive to overload or other extreme conditions during run-in than is the cadmium-silver and will more easily heal up local seizure damage with negligible loss in ultimate performance. Tests on very narrow bearings with length; diameter ratio down to 0.25 show that high loads can be carried at low friction values provided that clearance is small enough to minimize side-leakage of the lubricant. Under these conditions, the geometric accuracy and surface finish of the journal surface becomes more important, mid the effects of these variables arc being investigated. There is some evidence so far that very smooth journal surfaces, such as may be obtained by superfinishing, run the bearing in very slowly and are more liable to seizure during this stage. (b) Adsorption.-\u2014Information on adsorption on solid surfaces is being obtained by a study of the particular phenomena exhibited by the adsorption ol long-chain polar (amphoteric) compounds. The work is at present concerned with monomolecular films of substance.3 either soluble or insoluble in water. It has been found that some of these substances adsorb from an aqueous solution to form a hydrophobic layer only over a restricted concentration range which depends upon the substrate material. Stearic acid is insoluble in water and can form a film of monomolecular thickness on a water surface. This film can then be transferred to a solid surface where it is subsequently adsorbed. The mechanical properties of the films on water are profoundly affected by small concentrations of metallic ions in the water. The molecular packing in compressed films has been found to change abruptly at pH values which coincide with those for precipitation of the metallic ions in the aqueous substrate. (c) Diffusion.\u2014The diffusion of certain organic compounds over the surfaces of metallic single crystals and quartz glass is being studied. A radioactive sul phur atom is chemically incorporated into the com pound whose distribution over the solid surface can be then accurately traced with a special Geiger counter. The technique will reveal the presence of extremely minute quantities. Measurements with Ioav activity mercaptostearic acid, on silver and quartz glass, have shown that diffusion of this compound (if it occurs at all) takfs place by tbe movement of molecules in a layer of monomolecular thickness or less. This is observed at tempei'atures up to 50\u00b0 C. above the melting point of the acid. More sensitive experiments with higher activity material are needed to elucidate the process further. (d) Catalysis on Single Crystal Surfaces.\u2014The investigation of the influence of the atomic configura tion of a surface on its catalytic properties has con tinued. The method of preparing single crystals in the form of thin sheets has been improved. Measure ments of the rate.s of the zero-order decomposition of formic acid vapour on silver crystals have shown that the activation energy for the reaction depends strongly F.5189.\u20149on the orientation of the crystal, being lowest when the most densely packed atomic layers lie parallel to the surface. Ah apparatus is being constructed for the study of adsorption on the crystal surfaces with a view to obtaining close insight into their catalytic properties. 3. Metal Physios. (Division of Tribophysics.) The work is concerned with the plastic properties of metals and with the mechanism of phase changes. A better understanding of these phenomena should make it possible to state the optimum conditions of a material for its various applications. (a) I'lastic Deformation.\u2014It is recognized generally that plastic deformation of metals occurs by the motion of lattice imperfections known as dislocations. How ever, it is likely that other types of imperfection, such as vacant lattice sites and interstitial atoms, are created during deformation. The presence of such imperfec tions cause.3 a small percentage of the energy expended during deformation to be stored in the metal. This stored energy is released when the deformed metal is heated and, from determinations of the magnitude of the energy stored and the temperature at which the energy is released, information may be obtained con cerning the imperfections present. By combining tbese measurements with those of other properties, such as resistivity, hardness, and macroscopic density, it is likely that the parts played in plastic deformation by the various imperfections may he determined. (i) Energy Stored in a Metal during Deformation.\u2014 In previous experiments on pure copper practically no liberation of energy was detected below the recrystal- lization temqierature and it is likely that in this case the only stored energy measured was that associated with dislocations. With such pure metals any energy stored in the form of vacant lattice sites could be liberated at room temperature and thus would not be detected with the present apparatus. This difficulty is overcome by using higher melting point metals, and also by the addition of impurities to the lower melting point metals. Measurements have been made on nickel of com mercial purity. With this metal a large percentage of the stored energy is released well below the recrystal- lization temperature and this release of energy is asso ciated with the disappearance of the majority of the increase in resistivity due to the deformation hut does not cause any reduction in hardness. As in the case of pure coqiper the release of the remaining energy occurs at the recrystallization temperature and is associated with a sudden drop in hardness. These measurements, Avhen combined wdtli those of macroscopic density, sug gest that a considerable proportion of the energy stored during plastic deformation resides in the form of vacant lattice sites. A similar series of measurements is being made on arsenical copper. The manner in which the release of energy a.?soeiated with vacancies and with dislocations varies with the amount of deformation is being studied. (ii) Shape of X-ray Interference Lines.\u2014Eeqiro- ducible measurements of line shapes have been made on annealed and deformed specimens of filed copper and some measurements also on solid nickel specimens deformed in torsion. The X-ray spectrometer has been improved further by the addition of a new monitor which functions on the X-ray beam leaving the crystal monochromator and thus compensates for any variations in intensity due to the monochromator itself. (iii) Changes in Electrical Resistivity due to Cold- v'orhing.\u2014The difference in electrical resistivity be tween a deformed and an annealed wire has always130 been found to be independent of the temperature at which the resistivity was measured. In collaboration with the Division of Electrotechnology a method of measurement of very high accuracy has been developed. The results show that the difference is smaller at higher temjjeratures for all metals and alloys investigated. This means that the contribution to the electrical resistivity by the thermal vibrations of the atoms is not independent of that due to lattice disturbances produced by deformation. Probably the atomic vibra tions are different in deformed and in annealed metals. (iv) Continuily of Slip JAiies across a Grain Boundary.\u2014Slip lines on the surfaces of polished and subsequently strained specimens of aluminium and 70/30 brass are sometimes continuous across a grain boundary. Investigation of the interior of the brass specimens shows that this is not merely a surface effect but that the line of intersection of the slip planes in the two crystals does lie in the grain boundary. When the duration of annealing, prior to the final deformation, is increased there is within a given surface area, an increase in r.he number of grain boundary sections where slip lines cross. It is, therefore, suggested that the boundary configuration favorable to slip line crossing has a low interfacial free energy. (v) liecrystallization.\u2014The use of polarized light to study inhoniogeneities of deformation in polycrystaT line specimens of zinc has been found not to yield an unequivocal index of these phenomena. The possible use of various other techniques has been investigated without success. At present, metallographic studies of the free surface of deformed specimens and examina tion by means of polarized light are being employed to .study the inhoniogeneities, with a view to determining (heir relation to the erratic growth of new grains id).served during recrystallization. (6) Phase Changes.\u2014Phase changes in solids are of tiyo types. In the first type the nucleation and growth of the new structure are effected by means of the thermal movement of the atoms (diffusion). In the second type,_ thermal movement plays no part and the transformation can occur extremely rapidly at very low temiieratures. This type (inartensite transforma tions) occurs by small displacements of atoms relative to each other so that each atom in the new structure has the .yarne neighbours as it had in the old. The atomic displacements can be deduced from various observable geometrical features of the transformations. The theoretical study ha.s been continued and the formulation of the theoiy developed has been generalized. .\\n adecpiate test of the validity of thistheory will involve the comparison of the predicted and obsei'ved geometrical projierties of many indivi dual transfoi'mations. So far, .such comparisons havebeen made for the face-centred cubic to body-centred the diffusiontransformations^ in copper-beryllium and copper-gold. The theory is in agreement with observation for allthese transformations and the geometrical similarityof the two types of transformation is partly established. Experimental^ investigations of the order-disorder tran.sformation in copper-gold and of the precipitationof the copper-beryllium phase from the supersaturated a-solid solution are still in progress. 4. Reaction Kinetics. (Division of Tribophysics.) The kinetics group has been concerned mainly with two problems; the .study of the kinetics of oxidation of organic compounds and the inca.sureinent of thermal conductivities of organic vapours.(\u00ab) Kinetics of Oxidation of Organic Compounds. \u2014Oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic com pounds occurs by a highly complex chain reaction. In many cases the intermediate formation and decom position of peroxides have an important hearing on the progre.ss of the reaction. Oxidations in the gas phase are also influenced by the transitory production of aldehydes. Details of reaction inechanisms, however, are obscure, though some progress has been made. In the iiresent work, three aspects of the problem have been studied, the systems being chosen to eliminate com- jilicating factors: (i) the kinetics of pieroxide forma tion from benzaldehyde in solution, (ii) the mechanism of the early stages of the oxidation of projiyleiie in the gas phase, and (iii) the mechanism of decomposi tion of benzoyl peroxide in the presence of phenolic and other anti-oxidants. (i) Kinetics of Oxidation of Benzaldehyde.\u2014Work has continued on both the peroxide-catalysed and the uncatalysed reaction. The rather unexpected kinetic behaviour of the uncatalysed reaction found previously has been shown to occur over a wider range of conditions. (ii) Mechanism of Oxidation of Propylene.\u2014The rate of development of the reaction in the early stages depends on the formation of formaldehyde and higher aldehydes. Formaldehyde is iiroduced progressively by a slowly branching chain reaction. Higher aldehydes, on the other hand, appear relatively abruptly and cause an immediate rapid acceleration of the reaction. The m-idence suggests that the higher aldehydes are formed as a result of the decomposition of peroxides which arc produced by a similar mechanism to that which obtains in the .simpler liquid-phase reactions ((i) above). Peroxides, thus, do not promote the oxidation directly but act via the production of aldehydes. (iii) Effect of Phenols on the Rate of Decomposition of Benzoyl Peroxide.\u2014Benzoyl peroxide decomposes simultaneously by a molecular and a chain reaction. The chain reaction is suppressed by the addition of ]du'nol.s, but in some cases there is an optimum con- cditration beyond which the phenol cau.ses accelera tion. The magnitudes of the inhibiting and promot ing effects depend on the molecular structure of the jihenol, the nature of the solvent, and the presence of other inhibitor.s. The results suggest that the view commonly held regarding the mechanism of inhibition by phenols requires revision. (b) Thermal Conductivities of Organic Vapours.\u2014 Work on the thermal conductivities of organic vapours has been continued and the temperature range of the measurement.s extended up to 200\u00b0 C. The results have been used to make a detailed examination of therelation between thermal conductivity and visco.sity.h or non-polar vajjours the effect of temperature on this relation is found to be in accord with theoretical expectatipn. For polar vapours, however, discre pancies occur which are attributed to exchange of the translational and external energy of the molecules in collision. XXIII. XATIOXAL STANDARDS LABORATORY. Ihe Rational Standards Laboratory was founded in 193b as a result of the Commonwealth Government's iltjcisioii to extend tlie activities of the former Councilf 01 Scientific and Industrial Reseai'ch to secondaryindustry. Its main purpose is to maintain precise standards of measurement for the Commonwealth andto provide a calibration service for science and indus- tiy. The Laboicitoiy is established in the grounds ofthe University of Sydney, and is now able to meet most of the requirements of industry and governmental and131 semi-goveniinental authorities for the calibration of sub-staudards and precision measuring equipment in terms of internationally recognized standards of measurement. Legal status is given to the standards of measure ment maintained in the National Standards Labora- tory, by the Weights and Measures {National Stan dards) Act 1948, which makes the Organization the custodian of the national standards of measurement. Under this Act the standards of measurement of the States are derived from the Commonwealth standards of measurement maintained by the National Standards Laboratory. The Commonwealth legal units and standards of measurement are to be defined in Regula tions made under this Act, which also provides for a National Standards Commission to advise the Com monwealth Government on weights and measures. The statutory functions of the National Standards Laboratory in maintaining standards, testing, and cali bration are carried out by the Divisions of Metrology, Physics, and Electrotechnology. The three Divisions ot the Laboratory carry out research in matters directly related to the maintenance of standards of precision measurement, and also provide an important service to industry by giving advice on methods of measurement and by investigating special problems. The Divisions also engage in research of a more fundamental kind. Last year an invitation was received from the Inter national Bureau of Weights and Measures to take part in an international comparison of end standards of length. The construction of the end standards in the Laboratory and the necessary measurements have been completed and the standards forwarded to the Bureau for measurement. A similar invitation has since been received from the Bureau to participate in an inter national comparison of temperature standards used in the maintenance of the International Temperature Scale below 630\u00b0 C. A comparison is also in pro gress between the Laboratory and the National Physical Laboratory, Great Britain, of standards used in main taining the Scale in the optical pyrometer range, that is, above 1,063\u00b0 C. The Issue of a series of test pamphlets giving details of the work of the Laboratory and the tests carried out was begun during the year. These pamphlets cover the following fields: (i) engineering metrology, (ii) heat, hygroinetry, and viscometry; (iii) optics and photometry; (iv) electricity and magnetism. Details of the work of the Divisions of Metrology, Physics, and Electrotechnology are given in Chapters XXIV., XXV., and XXVI., respectively. XXIV. METROLOGY. 1. Gbnebal. For efficient and economic methods of production to be maintained in industry accurate measurements are essential. Measuring equipment must therefore be checked and calibrated at regular intervals against working standards of measurement which are in turn calibrated against national standards maintained by the Division of Metrology. Division of Metrology.\u2014The Division as part of the National Standards Laboratory is responsible for the Commonwealth .standards of measurement of length, mass, and time interval, and the associated physical quantities. The main cft'ort of the Division has been directed towards statutory and industrial requirements in respect to national standards, but the Division also engages in research on matters concerned with pre cision measurements in metrology and appliedmechanics. The most important project of the year was the production and measurement of three end standards and platen for an international intercom- parison arranged by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. The Division took a prominent part in the Exhibition arranged by the New South Wales Division of the Institute of Physics. The work of the Division was inspected by groups from the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, Departments of Education, Government Departments, and industry. Addresses have been delivered to tech nical institutions and gatherings and co-operation has been maintained with governmental and eemi-govern- mental institutions and technical bodies. Officers have taken jJart in the work of the Standards Association of Australia; they have .served on Advisory Com mittees and panels of assessors of the National Asso ciation of Testing Authorities, and on the Optical Munitions Technical Advisory Committee. 2. Length and Associated Quantities. (Division of Metrology.) (a) Standards.\u2014(i) Line Standards.\u2014Two new line standards, a yard and a metre, have been received and are to be used as Laboratory reference standards. Both standards are of 58 per cent, nickel steel. The metre standard has been calibrated by the International Burean of Weights and Measures. The yard standard will be calibrated at the Laboratory by comparison with the standard yard already held by the Laboratory. Extensive intercomparisons have been made between the Laboratory standard yard and two-yard standards, made in 1845, which are very similar in construction to the Imperial Standard. The results obtained showed that the diiference in length between the old standards had remained substantially constant, but their actual lengths were found to depart from their original values by a significant amount. (ii) End Standards.\u2014A set of reference end stan dards, ranging in size from 4 to 36 inches, have been received. These bars, which have been calibrated at tbe National Physical Laboratory, will form the basis for end measurement at the Laboratory. It is proposed that these bars shall ultimately be calibrated in terms of the Laboratory's standard yard, and the necessary equipment to effect the transfer from line to end measure is being manufactured at the Laboratory. Measurement of the shorter hars, up to 18 inches, by interferometric methods is to be under taken at an early date. (h) Universal Comparator.\u2014This comparator has had considerable use during the year. The control and measurement of the tempei'ature inside the tanks has been a major problem. Consideration has been given to improving the design of the tanks to enable more satisfactory control. (c) Geodetic Base.\u2014Necessitated by the apparent movement of some of the microscope piers under the weight of the 4-m. carriage, modificatiom; to the base have been completed and this movement has been reduced to a negligible amount. Work is now proceed ing on file calibration of the 4-m. standard prior to the calibration of the base itself. (f/) Dividing Engines.\u2014Several scales have been lirodiiced by the double evaporation process and the technique developed to permit the production of lines up to 0.002 inch thick. Othei' work has im-luded the graduation of invar tapes, and the production of ])rccision .sector disks for the Division of Physics. (e) Gears and Gear Ilobhing Equipment.\u2014Mathe matical investigations on the geometry of gears and hobs have been continued and theoretical work on the elastic deformation of gear teeth under load i.s being undertaken.132 (/) Interferometry.\u2014Further work has been done on the development of equipment for the determination of long lengths directly by interferometry. Multiple- beam interferometry has been used in problems con nected with the surface structure of metal surfaces, the optical properties of thin films, and phase-change eft'ects at metal surfaces. The coating plant has been used frequently for the deposition of various metal and dielectric films. A .krypton 86 isotope lamp has been received from the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesanstalt, Brunswick, Germany, for use in experimental studies with other isotopic light sources. A group of end standards has been measured directly by interferometry and forwarded to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, Hevres, France, for an international comparison of standards from eight national laboratories. This work, together with wave length determination of isotopic light sources, is part of a general study by national laboratories of the suitability of one of the wavelengths emitted from such sources as the ultimate unit of length. (i) International Calibration.\u2014Measurements were done on end bars 50, 75, and 100 mm. in length using the Kosters interferometer that has been recently com pleted and an electrodeless mercury 198 isotope lamp. (ii) Kosters Interferometer and Wavelength Deter minations.\u2014As indicated in last year's Report the Kosters interferometer is being used to measure lengths directly by interferometry. With an electrode- less mercury 198 lamp lengths of up to 18 inches can be determined directly in terms of light waves. Equipment for the control of temperature to 0.001\u00b0 C. and the determination of lengths in vacuum has been completed. Equipment for the measurement of temperature to 0.001\u00b0 G. is almost completed. (iii) One-metre Interferometer.\u2014The detailed design of this equipment is proceeding and all optics have now been received. (iv) Multiple-beam Interference Comparator.\u2014^A comparator has been designed for comparing end standards with high precision using sharp multiple- beam transmission fringes. The comparator will take standards up to 1 m. in length, and it avoids the need for calibrated levels as used in the level comparators. (v) Interference Microscope.\u2014A simple interference microscope has been set up permanently using an ordinary microscope with a vertical illumination attachment. This equipment has been in continuous use. (vi) Phase Loss Studies.\u2014^Investigations are pro ceeding to identify and distinguish between the con tributions to the phase loss made by the nature of the material of the surface and the surface structure of the surface. (vii) Liquid Surface Interferometry.\u2014Attempts are being made to extend the use of liquid surface inter ferometry to multiple-beam systems. To do this a mercury surface is being used as an absolute reference of flatness and multiple-beam interference fringes between the surface and a silvered optical fiat have . been observed showing very little vibration. Further anti-vibration precautions are being tried to remove the vibration completely. The Lumuer-Gehreke inter ferometer principle has also been used to obtain multiple-beam interference between a liquid surface and an opaque surface. A method of measuring surface tension of liquids is being investigated. (viii) Adhesive Films between Metal Surfaces.\u2014The work on the nature of the so-called wringing filmsthat enter into all aspects of length metrology has progressed in some degree, though depletion and 'shortage of staff have delayed activities. Equipment hasbeen set up to attempt to obtain definite measurement of the contact error that arises in wringing by using multiple-beam interference. Experimental work already done by electrical and multiple-beam inter ference methods indicates that there is not necessarily a definite film thickness between surfaces in wringing contact. (ix) Graticule Production.\u2014A series of graticules have been produced by the double evaporation of zinc and chromium and of aluminium and chromium which give fine durable lines of chromium on glass. (x) Wavelength Data and Correction Tables for Interferometry.\u2014A comprehensive series of tables have been compiled giving all the necessary wavelength and refractive index data and correction factors that have to be used in reducing results in length interferometry. The tables cover the wavelengths of cadmium, krypton, and mercury 198. (xi) Photoelectric Setting Device.\u2014A photoelectric setting device described recently in an overseas journal for making accurate settings on interference fringes or spectrum lines has been built up in experimental form. The setting accuracy is of the order of 0.2,/n (0.00001 inch). With ruled lines on opaque surfaces the setting accuracy is 0.1 y. (xii) Excitation of Gas Discharge Lamps.\u2014Develop mental work on the v.h.f. exciter for mercury 198 isotope electrodeless lamps has been carried to an ad vanced stage. A power output of 130 W. into a resistive load has been measured at 193 Mc/s., and satisfactory operation of the lamp, both with and with out water cooling, has been obtained. It has been found possible to initiate the discharge in the lamp without the aid of auxiliary apparatus and the design is such that misadjustment of the lamp circuit cannot cause damage to the radio-frequency power amplifying valves. A simplified exciter, which is operated from the 50 c/s a.c. main, has been developed for the mercury 198 cold cathode discharge lamp. A study of the operation of krypton and mercury 198 discharge lamps with inductive stabilizing imped ances at an operating frequency of 50 c/s has been made. (xiii) Test Worlc, Assistance, Advice, and Exhibits. \u2014A small amount of test work has been done and assistance and advice given to Universities, industry, and other Divisions and Sections of the Organization. (g) Capacitance Displacement Meter.\u2014^Displace ment meter type B is nearing completion. This instru ment is a compact development from the earlier equip ment, type A. The stability of the type B meter com pares favorably with that of type A. It has been concluded from this developmental pro gramme that the stability of frequency-shift displace ment meters depends principally on the frequency stability of the oscillatory circuits. Temperature con trol of the oscillatory circuits has been found to suffer from two disadvantages, (i) a considerable time is required for the isothermal enclosures to reach thermal stabilization, and (ii) after the controlled temperature of the oscillatory circuits has become constant, a con tinuous drift in frequency is observed. This frequency drift, which is of the order -)- 5 p.p.m./hr. in frequency, is thought to be due to mechanical instability of the components of the oscillatoi'y circuit under conditionsof elevated temperature (50\u00b0 C.). In the present dis placement meter two similar oscillatory circuits are employed. ^ A practical compromise has been obtained by equalizing the frequency sensitivity with respect to change in temperature of these two timed circuits and ai'ranging that both suffer approximately the same change in temperature.133 The development of a recorder-amplifier is nearing completion. This unit will enable the capacitance dis placement meter or any other source of voltage with an output of the order 100 mV from, a high resistance to he used in conjunction with an ordinary recording milliammeter. It is hoped to produce a stability of meter reading comparable with that of the displacement meter. (li) Abrasives and Lapping.\u2014The most important project completed was the production of a set of end standards for use in a series of international intercom- parisons. Some work has been done on the development of techniques for producing surfaces of suitable quality for ruling the high grade line standards. (f) Photogrammetry.\u2014The permanent equipment installed for the calibration of aerial cameras was put into service during the year and has proved quite satis factory. Measurements have been made of the effect of using various filters on the principal distance and distortion of a camera lens. (j) Measuring and Consultative Service.\u2014There has been no diminution in the volume of work submitted to the Division for examination and calibration, nor in the inquiries concerning problems relating to precise measurement. Some item.s of interest in this work are as follows: (i) The shafts of a large acetylator vessel were aligned on behalf of a commercial organization, (ii) An investigation was made of a damaged aircraft propeller assembly, (iii) A machine has been designed and constructed for the production and examination of standard templets used in the calibration of leather- measuring machines, fiv) A co-ordinate measuring machine used by the Comm.onwealth Observatory has been reconditioned and modified and its accuracy con siderably improved. Items of equipment submitted for test include sets of slip gauges, eom.bination end bars, limit gauges of all types, surface finish specimens, lathes, and a wide variety of measuring instruments and other equipment. Several items of equipment have been designed and manufactured for use within the Division including a travelling microscope having co-ordinate movements of 6 inches and 1 inch, a 20-in. sine-tahle for the accurate generation of small angles, and an apparatus for use in testing dial gauges. 3. Mass and Associated Quantities. (Division of Metrology.) (a) Standards of Mass.\u2014The work on the metric standards of mass has been continued and a number has been finished. The final polishing and adjustment to nominal mass has been performed simultaneously by the use of electrolytic polishing. The design has been completed of equipment for interchanging the weights on the pans of a balance without having to open the balance case. The pro vision of this equipment will enable the conditions inside the balance ease to be kept very steady during an intercomparison. (h) Investgations on Balances.\u2014The 100-kg. balance which was rebuilt has been thoroughly tested out and its performance found to be entirely satisfactory up to a load of about 80 kg. Above this load there appears to be a slight instability of the rest point reading. It is satisfactory to record that the sensitivity-load rela tionship determined experimentally agrees well with that deduced from measurements of the dimensions and elastic properties of the beam.(c) Density Measurement.\u2014A considerable volume of work has been done with this equipment on the determination of the densities of solids and liquids and in the calibration of hydrometers, and results obtained over a period of several months show excellent agree ment. (d) Barometry and Pressure Measurement.\u2014The long-range gauge barometer based on a National Physical Laboratory design is very nearly completed. Equipment for the purification of mercury has been made and is in course of assembly. The design has been completed of a pressure-vacuum vessel for the calibration of mercury barometers. 4. Applied Mechanics. (Division of Metrology.) Liaison with the engineering industry has been further strengthened throughout the year. An example of this is the active assistance given to the Sydney Section of the Institution of Production Engineers in an industrial investigation necessitating the co-opera tion of a large number of engineering firms in New South \"Wales. The project involved an analysis of existing design practices in engineering. The response from the firms was very satisfactory. As a result of this analysis, evidence now exists to point the way in which considerable economies in engineering produc tion might be achieved in industry. Alongside these developments in industrial research must be placed demands from industry for advice and assistance on all sorts of vibration problems. Such demands have been heavy enough for the Division to survey existing tech nical facilities and to collect and collate modern tech nical knowledge on vibration isolation. (a)' Machining.\u2014During the year an officer of the Section toured parts of Europe and the United States of America with the object of studying modern over seas developments in machining research. Machining research and other allied topics were discussed with most of the well-known production engineering research workers in the world. Information obtained on this world tour is now being used in the Division as a basis for establishing research programmes in machining and for selecting the m.ost suitable equipment. The first project on machining research undertaken consisted of a review of some overseas developments in surface finish with reference to the effect of finish on function as well as the factors affecting finish in machining. A review is now in hand of the specifica tions for surface finish prepared by the international standardizing bodies of various countries. Work is proceeding on methods of defining and measuring sharpness of the edges of cutting tools. An investigation was made into a suitable method for comparing the cutting performance of Swiss needle files. Some difficulties were experienced in developing a satisfactory test based on workshop conditions, but finally a compromise solution was adopted and a commercial filing machine was successfully adapted for the purpose. The nucleus of equipment required for machining research is now being installed. (h) Engineering Design Analysis.\u2014\"Wliilst on tour in Europe the officer mentioned above accepted an invitation from the Institut Superieur des Materiaux et de la Construction Mecanique to describe the Divi sion's work on engineering design analysis. Officers of the Division have taken a leading part throughout the year in a project of a working group which was estab lished by the Sydney Section of the Institution of Pro duction Engineers to analyse design and drawing prac tices in New South Wales. This group was formed following the analysis carried out by the Division in134 connexion with tlie 1951 Engineering Jfrocluotion Con vention. This analysis revealed that considerable economies might be achieved in the engineering industry by a proper analysis in design and intelligent use of a common series of basic engineering standards. The group established by the Institution adopted the tech niques develojied by the Division, including the \" design problem technique\" for conducting the analysis ami applied these techniques in a similar manner hut on a wider basis. The group's analysis confirmed the finding that considerable economies could be achieved in engineering by the adoption of the rational design methods and practices recommended by the Division. Inve.stigations are proceeding on a programme of research aimed at determining accurately the tolerances ajiiiropriate to particular manufacturing Ijrocesse.s. This research work will be done partly in the Laboratory and partly in industry. (c) Vihralion Measvrcmeni.\u2014The development of a technique for the calibration of sensitive vibro- metei-s by mnltiple-heam interferometry has concluded. Arising out of this work a short paper has also been ])uhlishcd, describing an adjustable mount u.sing differential screws, which has been used successfully for the Hue adjustment of interferometer plates and electrical capacitance plates. The investigation of the characteristics of two types of .self-generating vibration pick-ups developed within the Division has now been ooncluded. Assistance has been given to industry in a number of vibration measurements. Once more, the demands from industry have pointed to the need for adequate permanent facilities for the calibration of vibration measuring instruments. (d) Yihration Isolation.\u2014Work is proceeding on the preparation of a survey of existing knowledge on vibration isolation. Some preliminary investigations have been made to determine the level of vibration within the Laboratory building, particularly with the object of identifying (he sources of vibration and arranging for isolation mountings wliere necessary. (e) Measurement of Physical Quantities for Indnstry.\u2014(i) Force\u2014Negotiations have continued for the provision of a 50-ton dead-weight testing machine for the calibration of proving devices. In order to extend the existing range of proving equip ment a 1-ton proving ring is under construction, and a 25-ton ring is also being designed. A table of gravity correction factors has been prepared for reference in making this type of adjustment. (ii) Pressure.\u2014In the verification of the piston-type of pressure-gauge tester, which is used for the precise determination of pressure, it is necessary to determine accurately the effective hydraulic area of the piston/ cylinder element. This is particularly necessary for high pressure, small diameter units. Work is now proceeding on the development of a numerical pro cedure for this purpose which will take into account the measured errors in the profiles of the piston and cylinder. (ill) Hardness.\u2014Work has continued on the improvement of methods for the complete verificutiou of hardness testing machines, which involves check ing the accuracy of the applied load and of the device for mepuring the indentation. Various methods of ineasuring the indentor load are being investigated including the use of mechanical levers and diaphragm- typo capacitance transducers. A technique has also been developed for verifying the depth indicators of Rockwell hardness machines, and a paper describingthe technique has been submitted for publication. In practice it is often sufficient to use hardness test blocks to check the overall performance of these machines, and the calibration of such test blocks is most iicciirately accomplished by the use of a dead-weight liai'dness testing machine. One such machine, to N.P.L. de.sign, is being constructed and installed at the Labor.atory. Similar attention is being given to the determination of indenter force and depth of penetra- lioii in the case of rubber hai'dness testers. (f) \\'eriticf'finn of Materials Testing Machines and Pc/uipinenl for Industry.\u2014The examination of materials testing machines in New South Wales and (Queensland has continued on behalf of the National .issoeiatiou of Testing Authorities and the Services Inspei-tion Authorities, and at the request of private lirnis. in addition, many types of portable engineering instruments and equipment have been received and calibrated at the Laboratory. (</) Survey of Dynamometers.\u2014Frequent inquiries arc received from industry for the dynamometer power testing of engines, tractors, and the like. On behalf of the Engineering Group Committee of the C.S.I.R.O. and the Dejiartment of Supply, an Australia-wide survey has been made of the facilities available for Kiicli work. This survey has been completed. (/i) Information and Assistance to Industry and Other 0rganizations.\u2014Information has been given on such subjects as the design and construction of proving rings; force applied by a screw; spring testing; rating of power presses; performance testing of fans and internal combustion engines; pressure measurement and the construction of pressure gauges; weighing device.'s for meat dehydration investigations; physical testing- of rubber; retardation testing of elevators; calibration of instrument sf)rings; materials testing machines; relation of surface finish to work process; cutters used in steel wool manufacture; testing of a torque convertor; hardness number conversions; stress in a propeller shaft of a ferry; performance testing of petrol engine.?; applications of stroboscopes; dynamic balancing principles and techniques; vibration isola tion of galvanometers, compressors, machine tools, and balances; nature of vibration associated -with various types of industrial equipment; apparatus and tech nique for vibration measurement and for the calibra tion of vibrometers; theoi-y of automatic dynamic- balancing devices; design of fan brake for testing- engines ; reduction of vibration in electrical machinery. Assistance has been given by undertaking special test -nmrk, including the calibration in situ of an electromagnetic vibrator in the range 0.060 inch at 20 c/s to 0.00001 inch at 6000 c/s; headstock vibra tion measurements on an industrial lathe; vibration measurements to determine the best position for sen sitive apparatus; measurements of the vibration due to a large forging hammer; calibration of a stroho- scope; screwdriver torque tests to determine the hold ing strength of screws in domestic electrical fittings and the torque that can he applied manually by a screwdriver; flexure tests on glass rods; pressure te.-'ts on hui'.oting disks. XXV. PHYSIOS. 1. General. The Organization is engaging in many aspects of physical research -nfithin a number of Divisions and Sections. The_ present Chapter is concerned with thework of the Division of Physics, which forms part of the National Standards Laboratory.135 DivLslon of Phynm.\u2014The Division is responsible for maintaining the Commonwealth standards of measure ment of heat, light, and other closely related physical quantities, and also the primary standards of resistance and voltage. Assistance has been given as in the past to industry. Government and Univer,sity Departments and to other i.-ivisions of the Organization on a wide variety\" of problems. One investigation which merits mention was undertaken in connexion with the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. This involved finding a rapid method for determining rather accurately the moisture content of soil to be used as filling in the construction of the Eucombene dam. Progress in this problem has been facilitated by the secondment from the ISTew South Wales Department of Worlcs of an officer to work undci- tJio direi-tioji of the OlHcor-in-chargo of the Heat Section. Officers of the Division contributed materially to the work of the Standards Association of Australia, the Vustralian H^ational Committee on Illumination, the i*Iational Association of Testing Authorities, and the Optical Munitions Technical Advisory Committee of the Department of Supply. The Division has also undertaken work on rain precipitation in collaboration with the Division of Radiophysics. This Avork is re ported in Chapter XXVIII., Section 8. The Division's work on solar physics is described in Chapter XXTX., Section 2. 2. Heat. (Division of Physics.) The main fields of research and investigational Avork are concerned with phase nucleation, low-temperature physics, and temperature mea.surement. The most significant development has heen in low-temperature physics Avhere the experimental programme has com menced with the examination of the thermal conduc tivities of various metals. At the invitation of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures tentative arrangements have been made for the Laboratory to participate in an international intercomparison of that portion of the International Temperature Scale maintained by reference to resistance thermometers. (rt) Measurement and Control of Temperature.\u2014 (i) International Temperature Scale.\u2014Improvement.\" have been effected in some of the technical procedures involved in maintaining the International Tempera ture Scale. For example, platinum resistance thermo meters of improved stability have been constructed, triple point of Avater cells has been brought into regular use as an alternative to the ice point, and an examination has been commenced of the repro- ducibility of the temperature obtained by the use of the latter fixed point. \"Work is proceeding on the develop ment of equipment for the control and precise measure ment of the pressure in apparatus for realizing boiling- point temperatures defined on the International Tem perature Scale. To facilitate the calibration of stan dard thermocouples, automatic control of the melting-point furnaces and automatic recording of the melting-point temperatures haA'e been installed. To check the maintenance of the International Tem perature scale in the optical pyrometer region, arrange ments are in hand for an intercomparison of the tem perature scale above 1063\u00b0 C. maintained at this Laboratory and at the Xational Physical Laboratory, England. (ii) Therm,oelectric Effects due to Strain.\u2014The in vestigation of the thermal e.m.f.'s produced by longi tudinal strain in otherwise homogeneous wire Avhenplaced in a temperature gradient has been continued. The results obtained with eleven different metals are hi general agreement Avith and considerably extend previous investigations of this phenomenon. (hi) Pyrometry.\u2014In addition to the calibration of pyrometric equipment, numerous requests for advice on temperature-measurement problems have been made by industrial and scientific establishments. As in past years, a formal course of instruction in temperature measurement Ava.3 given to industrial personnel. An automatic 2;\")-point selector SAvitch Avith very small Ijarasitie which the thcimal o.m.t.'s are loss than O.Ol/iv., haA'e been con- use in thermocouple circuits. {h) Hygromeiry.\u2014Although the psychrometric method of measuring relative humidity is capable of high precision, the theory of the behaviour of a wet element in a moving air stream is not sufficiently Avell developed to permit of the Avet bulb temperature being regarded as other than empirically related to relative humidity. Such a criticism does not apply to the tem perature of adiabatic saturation of air, and several expeidmental arrangements Avere developed with which this temperature could be realized. It Avas concluded, Imwever, that an instrument designed on these prin- cijjlcs Avould lack A'ersatility and convenience and Avould, therefore, not provide a sufficiently useful tool to justify its development. As a more convenient covering than crotton for the Avet element AAdien fine thermocouples are used as psychrometric elements for the measurement of relative humidity, it has been shown that gelatin film is quite satisfactory if suitable precautions are taken to eiisure its Avetncss. An automatic photoelectric dcAv- point hygromete]' designed to have rapid response is Hearing completion. (c) Moisture C'ontent.\u2014Recently the XeAV South ATales Department of Public Works sought advice on the most suitable method for rapidly determining the moisture content of soils to be used in the constructionof the Eucumbene earth-Avall dam at Adaminaby, Xew South Wales, the requirements being that each measure ment should be made in about 3 minutes to an accuracy of about \u00b1 0.5 per cent, in moisture contenton 1-lb. samples. In collaboration Avith the Department of Public Works a detailed investigation is almo.st com pleted of three promising methods in Avhich measure ments are made of, respectively, (i) soil density, (ii) pressure of gas generated by a reaction with the soilmoisture, and (iii) loss of Aveight produced by rapid drying. Field trials Avill be made at the conclusion of the laboratory investigations. (d) Phase Nucleation.\u2014The process of the initia tion or nucleation of one phase from another is of con siderable practical importance, for instance, in the formation of bubbles in superheated liquids, the con densation of A'apour on solid surfaces, crystallization,and the formation of ice in the atmosphere. Both theoretical and experimental work have been continuedin this field, particular attention being giA'en to the vapour-liquid change on solid surfaces and to the liquid- solid change in pure water. The theoretical investigation by an officer of the Division of the condensation of vapour on a solid surface hp .shoAvn that at very Ioav supersaturations condensation must be attributed to imperfections of thesurface. An experimental test of this theory is inprogress and these iiiA'estigations will, it is expectedprovide infoiTuation on other problems of phase nucleation. (e) Prmp^7aHou.\u2014Investigations on the sublima tion ot solid cp-bon dioxide in super-cooled loo's the production of ice crystals by this process, and^of thecollision cross .section of raindrops relative to mist136 droplets have been continued. These investigations are of relevance to the processes of artificial and natural production of rain, and are described in greater detail in Chapter XXVIII., Section 8. (/) Lo-w-temperafurc Physics, Theoretical Research. \u2014The importance of experimental and theoretical re searches on the ])ropertios of substances at very low temi)eratures has been commented on in previous Eeports. Theoretical studies have been carried out during the year or are, in progre.ss on the following:\u2014 (1) The solution of the heat transport equation for pure metals. (2) The implications of the experimental results obtained in the Laboratory on the thermal con ductivity of monovalent metals at low temperatures. (3) Heat transport processes in metals in the super conducting state. (4) The heat conductivity of dielectrics, including highly anisotropic substances such as graphite; this work has apparently resolved incon sistencies between the observed specific heat and the observed thermal conductivity of graphite. (5) The anomalous electrical and thermal resistance of certain metals at very low temperatures. (6) The electrical condiictivity of cold-worked metals. (7) The theory of the electron gas in metals and semi-metals. (y) Low-temperature Physics, Experimental Re search.\u2014(i) Helium Liquefier.\u2014The liquid helium plant has operated very satisfactorily during the year and numerous improvements have been made, the main results of which have been: (1) Reduction of starting time to 1 hour. (2) Reduction of stripping down and reassembling time from 4 da.ys to 1. (3) Economics in the use of liquid oxygen. (4) Improved liquid helium transfer facilities. (ii) Thermal Conductivity.\u2014To provide more in formation for theories of the electrical and thermal transport properties of solids, measurements in the range 2-200\u00b0 K. have been made of the thermal con ductivity of the monovalent metals gold, silver, and copper in various states of physical and chemical purity. \"Work has also commenced on certain binary alloys and on selenium. (iii) Electrical Conductivity.\u2014To test the validity over a wide temperature range of the Weidemann- Franz law of electrical and thermal conductivity a cryostat has been built for determinations of the elec trical conductivity of metals suitable for the range 1-300\u00b0 K (iv) Specific Heats.\u2014The construction of equip- meiit for the measurement of specific heats down to very low temperatures is well advanced. 3. Light. (Division of Physics.) Research on the theory of optical instruments, in particular reflecting microscope objectives, has con tinued and considerable progress has been made in the construction of equipment for solar research. (a) Photometry.\u2014(i) Photometric Standards.\u2014The variability of output and the apparent instability of photometric standard lamps is one of the serious diffi culties of photometry. Receipt of a group of new standard lamps calibrated at the Hational Physical Laboratory, England, has given opportunity to study these uncertainties in some detail by intercomparison of the present outputs of the lamps with those found before despatch to Australia. The conclusion is that some, at least, of the difficulty encountered with standard lamps arises from shock during transport. Some of the differences among the intensity standard lamps, however, are almost certainly due to the difficulty in re-establishing the precise alinemcnt of the lamp, and it has been shown that insome eases the intensity varies by as much as 1 per cent, for a change in oi'ientation of 0.5\u00b0. Other causes of lamp variability are under investigation. (ii) Colour-temperature Photometer.\u2014A photo electric flicker photometer has been designed and con structed for the precise measurement of colour tem perature. With this instrument colour temperatures are readily reproducible to an accuracy of 2\u00b0 K. (iii) Spectrophotoinelry.\u2014-Accurate spectrophoto- metry forms the basis of most photometry, and a large iirecision double monochromator to be used for spec- trophotomctric standards has been completed, apart from the 6-in. prisms on which final figuring is now being done in the optical shop. This instrument embodies several novel features. An investigation of the errors in the intensity scale of tlie Division's automatic spectrophotometer and other spectrophotometers has been completed. (iv) Standards of Spectral Reflectance.\u2014To meet demands for reflectance standards in industry a group of white \" Vitrolite\" glasses has been calibrated as standards with respect to the reflectance of a mag nesium oxide surface. A number of magnesium samples of different origin have been used, and con sistent results obtained to within 0.2 per cent, over the range of the visual spectrum. (v) Photometry of Road Signs.-\u2014During the revi sion of the Road Signs Code by the Standards Associa tion of Australia, the need arose for a means of specify ing the optical properties of reflectorized road-signs materials which are used to make signs visible to car drivers at night. A portable photoelectric photometer, incorporating an autocollimator, has been developed for this purpose, and has proved equally suitable for testing road-sign reflector buttons. (h) Optics.\u2014(i) Reflecting Microscopes.\u2014The optical properties of reflecting microscopes differ from those of lens systems in that there is always a central obstruction in the light beam. The diffraction effects of this obstruction cause loss of image contrast. The magnitude of this has been investigated theoretically by an oflicer of the Division while holding a C.S.I.R.O. Studentship at the Institut d'Optique, Paris. As a result, precise tolerances can now be stated for the amount of obstruction permissible without causing a noticeable loss of image contrast. These tolerances cannot be satisfied by two-mirror objectives. For comparison with theory, various types of objec tives using three and four mirrors are being studied; the performance of these objectives should be equal to those of lens objectives. (ii) .Definition in Optical Instruments.\u2014The per formance of an optical instrument is never perfect, since aberrations are inevitably present. Quality of performance is usually judged by comparison with other instruments of the same type. Such a method l\"ads to considerable variations in interpretation and demands considerable training on the part of the observer. The theory, referred to in Section 3 (b) (i) above. Worked out initially for reflecting microscopes, is also applicable to the testing of optical instruments ingeneral, and suggests a line pattern having a sinusoidal variation in density as test object for measuring defini tion. There is considerable advantage in the direct measurement _ of image contrast which this methodgives, since it avoids subjective errors in assessingdefinition. Two such systems are being constructed for the photoelectric measurement of contrast in micro scope and telescope images.137 (iii) Diffraction hy Generalized the pi-incipal con tributions to optics in recent years has been the study in various places of diffraction effects produced by apertures which introduce phase or amplitude changes in the transmitted light. One of the results has been the development of the phase-contrast microscope, another the hologram. The effect of phase changes pro duced hy striations in lenses may also bo treated from this point of view. Eesults of considerable interest have been obtained in the Division in theoretical .studies of such phenomena. (c) Solar Physics.\u2014An account of the Division's work in Solar Physics will be found under Extra- terre.sti'ial Physics, Chapter XXIX., Section 2. 4. Electeical Standards. (Division of Physics.) The Division maintains the Commonwealth primary standards of electromotive force and resistance by means of standard cells and resistors which are periodically compared with the standards of the Xational Physical Laboratory, England. The maintenauce of the volt by means of standard cadmium cells involves the periodical intcrcomparison of a large number of cells. A new procedure for this process has been adopted which is considerably faster and also more reliable than that used previously. 5. Electeonics. (Division of Physics,) (a) Mass-spectrometer Leah Detector.\u2014The con struction of a modified mass spectrometer for the detection of vacuum leaks has now been completed. (b) Colovr-filter Computer.\u2014The colour-filter com puter mentioned in last year's Report has been redesigned in order to avoid mechanical switching of the electrical circuits; and a new instrument is under construction. (c); Nuclean- Magnetic Eesonance.\u2014Apparatus is being set up to observe the phenomenon of \"nuclear magnetic resonance which occurs when a substance containing magnetic atomic nuclei is exposed to crossed magnetic fields, one being steady and the othSr oscillat ing. The phenomenon may be used to provide precise control of magnetic fields .as, for example, in nias.s spectrometers. XXVI. ELECTROTECHXOLOGY. 1. General. The electrical research of the Organization is under taken mainly within the Division of Electrotechnology, but much electrical work, particularly in electronics, is also undertaken in other Divisions and Sections as an integral part of research in other fields of investigation. Division of Electrotechnology.\u2014As part of the Xational Standards Laboratory, the Division is responsible for the maintenance of the Common wealth standards of measurement of electrical quan tities other than the primary electrical standards\u2014 the volt, the ampere, and the ohm. In addition to its research on electrical measurements and standards, the Division also undertakes research in electrotech nology. The Division has continued to give assistance and advice to many inquirers from industry and else where, and members of the Division serve on advisory and technical committees of the Xational Association of Testing Authorities and of the Standards Associa tion of Australia. The Organization also collaborates with the Electricity Supply Association in encouragingelectrical research within the Universities through its Electrical Research Board. Work of the Division of Electrotechnology is reported in Sections 2-8 of this Chapter, and that of the Electrical Research Board in Section 9. 2. Dieect Cueeent. (Division of Electrotechnology.) A 1 to 100 ohm \" build-up \" resistance box has been constructed and is being adjusted. By providing a precise 100:1 ratio it will facilitate the direct com parison of a 100-ohm resistor with a known 1-ohm resistor. It will also be of use in the measurement of standard resistors of other values. A 100 to 10,000 ohm \" build-up\" resistance box of similar design is also being made. Apparatus for the measurement of direct currents greater than 5,000 A has been made and tested and an adjustable voltage source has been constructed for use in calibrating voltmeters. 3. PowEE Feequenot. (Division of Electrotechnology.) There has been an inci'easing demand for calibra tion of current and voltage transformer testing sets. In order to speed up this work, equipment has been constructed to simulate an instrument transformer with \" error's \" which are adjusted by means of manually operated controls. Simple electrical circuits have been developed by means of which the conventional vibration galvanometer of a current transformer testing set may be replaced with a cathode-ray oscillograph detector. 4. Audio and Radio Feequenot. (Division of Electrotechnology.) (a) Impedance Measurements.\u2014Most of the methods that have been used for an absolute determination of the ohm have been based on the calculation of induct ance from linear dimensions. An alternative method based on the calculation of capacitance involves a knowledge of the velocity of light. In recent years a number of determinations of the velocity of light have been made and the accuracy claimed is now better than the limit to which the ohm is believed to be known. A determination of the ohm based on capacitance would give valuable confirmation either of the ohm or the velocity of light. With capacitors the metrological measurements are simpler and the Laboratory has had considerable experience in the electrical measuring techniques. It is considered that these can be refined sufficiently to make the metrological measurements the limiting factor. A number of components has been developed for the measuring system proposed and good progress has been made with others. A new bridge method for the comparison of capacitance and resist ance has been investigated and is capable of the precision required. Fur use with a capacitance-type pressure gauge a capacitance bridge for the precise measurement of capacitance in the range of 100 to IQ-^ pF. has been constructed. Another three-terminal capacitor designed for_ the measurement of very small currents from ionization gauges has been made with extremely high insulation resistance. One limitation of a tuned amplifier for detecting a small signal in the presence of harmonics is the spurious fundamental produced by intermodulation of the harmonies. This effect has been investigated .and an amplifier has been constructed in which the intermodulation is negligible for the harmonic levels associated with precise bridge measurements. (b) Dielectric Measurements.\u2014Measurement of the relative permittivity and loss of dielectrics can bemade over a wide range of frequencies extending138 froiii 10~- to 2.4 X 10'\"fi/s. Over most of this range of frequencies measurements can be undertaken at any temperature between \u201480 and 0. and in some eases at temperatures approaching \u2014190\u00b0 C. (c) Frequency Measurement.\u2014To the original fre quency standard, consisting of three quartz crystal oscillators, two more oscillators and associated beat counters for comparing their frequencies have been added. Investigations are being made of the effect of changes in room temperature on the frequency of the oscillators. The equipment for the precise measure ment of frequencies above 100 Mc/s. has now reached the stage where marker signals, whose frequencies are known with great accuracy, may be generated at freipiencic.s up to 35,000 Mc/s. (d) Noise Generators.\u2014Fundamental investigations at 200 and 3,000 Mc/s. of the electron velocities and random noise radiated from experimental neon dis charge tubes over a range of gas pressures and dis- cliai'ge currents have boon completed. Work at 3,000 Mc/s. on random noise generators for deter mining the absolute sensitivity of radio receivers has been directed mainly towards improving the accuracy of measuring the power output from a black-body radiator of low but known uniform temperature, wliieli is used as an absolute reference level. (e) Microwave Spectroscopy.\u2014Experience gained in the operation of the microwave spectroscope has led to modifications of the existing equipment and to the development of new apparatus. High frequency (105 kc/s.) sine-wave and square-wave Stark modulating systems have been employed. A programme of investi gation into microwave spectra using the spectroscope has commenced. (/) Millimetre Wavelengths.\u2014-Apparatus for the generation and detection of radio energy at a wave length of about 8 mm. has been put into operation, and similar equipment for a wavelength of about 6 mm. is under construction. 5. Magnetic Measuebments. (Division of Electrotechnology.) In addition to routine calibration work, a good deal of effort has been put into the detailed cheeking of the measuring instruments and equipment used in magnetic testing, xissistance has been given to another Division in the design of an electromagnet, and to a manufacturer of electric motors in the development of a rapid production tester for stator laminations. 6. Dieleoteio Investigations. (Division of Electrotechnology.) Work has been continued on the relationship between the chemical and physical structure of organic com pounds and their dielectric properties. All the measurements on solids in previous years have been carried out on polycrystalline material. Some measure ments have now been made on single crystals, in the course of investigations on clathrate compounds. (a) Theoretical Work.\u2014Consideration has been given to the much discussed problem of a satisfactory dielectric breakdown criterion and, while some hitherto puzzling features of breakdown can be explained by the ideas of various authors, an adequate description of the phenomenon has not yet been given. The present experimental work on the influence of electrode material on the apparent breakdown strength of a dielectric is also inadequate for forming definite conclusions. (5) Dielectric Properties of Mixtures.\u2014This work lias been concluded and the results are to be published.(c) Dielectric Absorption on Hydroxy-compounds.-\u2014 The investigation of dielectric loss in hydrogen-bonded compounds is being continued. In order to obtain more information on the mechanisms leading to this type of loss, measurements are being made with mix tures and compounds containing hydrogen-bond chains of only two or three hydroxyl groups. In conjunction with this work, the same materials are being subjected to infra-red measurements at the Division of Industrial Chemistry. (d) Clathrate Compounds.\u2014Some clathrate (cage like) compounds have been investigated more fully. Measurements on these compounds have yielded infor mation about the energy barrier opposing rotation of the small molecules entrapped in the parent crystal lattice and as to the axes about which rotation is possible. (e) Combined Investigation of Dielectric and Thermal Properties.\u2014^Many chemical compounds exist in different crystalline phases which are stable at different tempei'atures. In work on the dielectric pro perties of such materials it is desirable to obtain parallel information on their thermal behaviour. To facilitate this work, apparatus has been set up to record automatically the cooling curves of chemical com pounds. For this apparatus a commercial recording- potentiometer has been modified to record tempera tures, ill the range of \u201450 to 105\u00b0 C., to ivithiu \u00b10.05\u00b0 C. The dielectric properties of a number of long-chain acetates, in both a and J3 phases, have been investigated. (f) Protein Structure.\u2014An examination is being made of the possibilities of using the dielectric pro perties of protein solutions in water to obtain infor mation about the size and shape of the protein molecules. This work is being done in association with the Biochemistry Unit of the Wool Textile Eesearch Laboratories. (g) X-ray Crystallography.\u2014The study of the crystal .structure of the secondary alcohol 14-hepta- cosanol, using a Weissenberg goniometer, is well advanced and has already yielded valuable information on the likely causes of dielectric loss in this type of compound. ^ 7. Si'EoiAo Instruments. (Division of Electrotechnology.) (a) Teniperahire-salinify-dcplh Recorder. \u2014 The design of an instrument to record the temperature and salinity of the ocean as a function of depth has been started. The instrument is required by the Division of Fisheries for oceanographic research (see Chapter XI., Section 4 ())). (b) Straight-line Flight Indicator.\u2014In collabora tion with the Division of Radiophysics an instrument was developed several years ago for assisting the pilot of an aircraft fitted with a Shoran radar set to fly along straight lines. This instrument has been modified to provide a number of different scales and also to plot the course of the aircraft and has been handed over to the Bureau of Mineral Resources for u.se in aerial survey work. 8. Vacuum Electronics. (Division of Electrotechnology.) The Division s work on electronic computation is described in Chapter XXXI., Section 4. 9. Electrical Research Board. The general objective of the Electrical Re.5earch Board is the fostering of fundamental electrical research in Universities and the training of graduates in research methods. Grants are made for jiroject.s suggested by the Universities.139 The Board is represeiitatiA'e of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia, the Universities, and the Organization. Financial support from member organizations of the Electricity Supply Association has enabled the Board to support investigations in moat of the Universities of Australia. Stability of power supply systems is being inves tigated in the University of Adelaide with simulating networks and in the University of Melbourne by a model rnnchine technique. Ti-an=ients are being studied in the University of Tasmania. In the University of Queensland the programme on the protection of elec trical plant against lightning- is being continued with field studies and the development of laboratory efjuip- ment for impulse testing. The University of Sydney has commenced work on the fundamental properties of semiconductors. In collaboration with the supply authorities the University of Western Australia is determining the operating characteristics of steel con ductors for rural distribution lines.Univer.tjties. The Board's full-time stall' has been located - at the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Sydney, and at the Commonwealth Obser vatory, Mount Stromlo. Approved projects have also been .supported at the Universities of Queensland, Tasmania, and Adelaide.- Ulose co-operation exi.sts between the Board's stall and that of the Ionospheric Prediction Service of the Department of the Interior. During the year the Board's .'^tatf has handed over to the latter the detailed results of its studies of the morphology of ionospheric .storms. As Japan was not represented at the General A.ssembly of U.R.S.I. the Japanese ZSTational Com mittee of Radio Science invited the Board's Chief Scientific Officer to visit Japan for three weeks in May, 1953, when he .outlined to radio scientists the proceedings of the A.ssembly. The work of the Board is outlined in Section 7 (a) of this Ohaj)tor. XXVII. RADIOPIIYSICS. 1. Genek.vi,. Research and developmental work on radar for the .services was commenced in Australia during the Second World War with the establishment of the Division of Radiophysics in Sydney. With the return of peace-time conditions the Division's ctTorts were transfei-i-ed to fundamental research in radio and radar. The Organization has also continued radio re.search in collaboration with the Services, the Post master-General's Department and the Universities under the direction of its Radio Research Board. During the year a Consultative Committee oii Radio Research has been e.stablished to facilitate liaison between the various bodies carrying out research in the radio field and tho.sc who make use of the research. In August, 1952, the International Union of Scienti fic Radio (U.R.S.I.) held its 10th General Assembly in Sydney. This was the first occasion on which any international scientific union .had held a meeting in the southern hemisphere, and -was an indication of the interest of world radio science in Australian researches in this field. This Assembly was generally considered to be one of the most successful and best organized con- lerences yet held by the Union. The staffs of the Division of Radiophysics and of the Radio Research Board contributed substantially to the successful organization of the meeting, and made considerable scientific contributions to its deliberations. Division of Radiophysics.\u2014The Division is carrying out fundamental research in rain physics and radio astronomy, while, on the applied side, investigations connected with electronic computing and radio aids to navigation are proceeding. The Division's work in rain physics and radio astronomy is now well estab lished internationally, as witnessed by the selection of Sydney by the International Union of Scientific Radio for its General Assembly in August and the invitation to the Chief of the Division to visit the United States of .Vmerica to advise on the establishment of a research programme on cloud and rain physics to be undertaken at the University of Arizona. The work of the Division is outlined in Sections 2 and 7 (b) of this Chapter, Sections 9 and 10 of Chapter XXVIII., Section 3 of Chapter XXIX., and Section 3 of Chapter XXXI. Radio Research Board.\u2014The Board has continued its policy of concentrating the efforts of its staff on a few fundamental problems and at the same time foster ing and a.saisting complementary investigations in the2. R.vmo Aids to XAvm.-ixiOiV. (Division of Radiophysics.) There is considerable interest in the application of radio techniques to the navigation of aircraft over distances of 1,000 miles or so. On long ocean flights landmarks are few and it is necessary to rely on celestial navigation and dead-reckoning, supplemented, where possible, by medium-range radio \" fixes \" from islands or weather sliips. Xone of the long-range radio aids at present in use are entirely satisfactory for the naviga tion of civil aircraft, because simple, automatic pre sentation of the information is lacking. Following the successful development of the short-range Distance .Measuring Equipment (D.M.E.) by the .Division, it was decided to ex^ilore the possibility of extending the method of long-range navigation. Details of this -nmrk and of another project are given below: (a) Long-range Navigation by Distance Measure- in ent.\u2014Radio propagation round the curve of the Earth is only possible with low-frequency ground waves or with high-frequency sky waves reflected by the ionosphere. To investigate the reliability of the latter method, a radar-tyjie beacon has been installed at Townsville, Queensland, and is triggered by pulses radiated from Camden, Xow South Wales. Multiple reply pulses, corresponding to the various paths through the ionosphere, are received at Camden from the beacon and are photographically recorded. The interpretation of these records in terms of ionospheric structure is assisted by comparison with other data obtained regularly by the Radio Research Board in Brisbane, which is near the mid-point of the 1,100- mile Camden-Townsville circuit. The number, length, and absorption of the iono spheric paths vary_ diurnally and seasonally. Thosepaths due to reflection by the lowest ionospheric layer (the E layer) are the most stable in length and are most likely to be of value for distance measurement. At thefrequency of the present experiments (9.8 Mc/s.),signals via these paths can be received throughout theday. During the night, reception is often patchy, even with Ingh power, and appears to correlatb with sporadic E ionization over Brisbane. A practical navigation system would require a number of channelsand it is therefore proposed to extend the present measurements to a lower frequency. A conventional- tvpe D.M.E. would need an aircraft transmitter of great power, and an alternative technique of distance measurement requiring only receiving equipment inflip aircraft has therefore been proposed. A transmitter IS located at each end of the flight path, and the140 distance jneasuremeiit is most accurate on the great circle path between the two points. The method is therefore suitable for well-established routes. Ajiart from their application to the navigational problem, the present experiments should add to funda mental knowledge of the ionosphere and are of con siderable interest in connexion with communication .service forecasts. Investigations of this type include the study of absorption and the accuracy of maximum usable frequency predictions. (b) Homing Glider.\u2014A recoverable glider for use in high-altitude research has been designed in co-opera tion with the Aeron.nitic.s Department of the University of Sydney. The weight is 12 lb., including a payload of 2 lb., and it is intended to be carried to a predeter mined altitude by means of a balloon and then released. Signals from a ground beacon automatically actuate the j'udder so that the model always glides towards the ground station. I'lie first models should shortly be ready for .light testing. 3. Mathematical CoMPUTA-noN. (Division of Eadiophysics.) The Division's work on mathematical computation is reported in Chapter XXXI., Section 3. 4. Cloud and Eain Physics. (Division of Eadiophysics.) This work of the Division is reported in Chapter XXVIII., Section 9. 5. E.\\dio Astronomy. (Division of Eadiophysics.) The work of the Division on radio astronomy is reported in Chapter XXIX., Section 3. 6. \"Wind Measurements at Great Heights. (Division of Eadiophysics.) This work by the Division is reported in Chapter XXVIII., Section 10. 7. The Ionosphere. All long-distance radio propagation takes place through the ionosphere. The normal ionosphere is maintained in its ionized condition by radiation from the Sun and it therefore shows daily and seasonal varia tions. These are now reasonably well known for most regions of the Earth. Less is known about the abnor malities, such as ionospheric storms, which disrupt radio communications from time to time, particularly when sunspots are active on the visible solar disk. The most common method used for studying the properties of the ionosphere involves reflection of radio signals. An alternative method consists of making use of radia tion from cosmic radio sources and determining the effect produced by the ionosphere on this radiation as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. These effects may change with time either slowly or rapidly. (ff) Investigations hy the Radio Research Board.\u2014 (i) Ionospheric Winds.\u2014The Board pioneered the investigation by radio means of movements of ionization in the upper atmosphere some 200 miles above the Earth, and much information has now been obtained. Besides affecting radio propagation, these movements are important in upper atmosphere meteorology, and possibly also in high-altitude flight. It has now been established that these movements have regular seasonal and diurnal changes of direction. Till recently observations have been confined to the day time, but with recent improvements in equipment, it has become possible to study night-time conditions. Most ofthe observations so far have been confined to heights of about 200 miles. However, with the aid of a new variable-frequency recorder, designed and built by the Board's staff, the observing range has been extended both upwards and downwards. Eecordings of travelling disturbances have led to a comparatively simple explanation of irregularities as due to \" kinks \" in the ionosphere. The elucidation of these phenomena permits the derivation of information on disturbances from recordings which have been made regularly in many parts of the world over the last ten years, thus providing a world-wide picture of upper atmosphere movements. Tbis information has permitted checking of certain theoretical deductions about the mechanism of radio wave propagation. Eor example, it has been known for some years that a radio ray travelling upwards is split into two rays in the ionosphere, and it has been deduced that these rays diverge and are reflected at different points. Erom the study of travelling disturbances it has been possible to confirm this and to measure the separation of the reflection points. (ii) ElectHcal Conductivity.\u2014The theory of the abnormal conductivity of the ionosphere has now been thoroughly worked out, in collaboration with Dr. \"W. G. Baker of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd. It has also been extended to derive the drift velocities of ionization at all levels in the ionosphere, and at all lati tudes, under the influence of either winds or electric fields. In the course of this work it has been found that the movement of ionization is unstable at heights near 100 km., where a uniform ionosphere must break up into clouds or patches of irregular density. It is believed that this somewhat accidental discovery has revealed the reason for the occurrence of sporadic E ionization (Es) at heights of about 100 km. Eg is responsible for much anomalous long-distance propagation of radio waves, and is at present being studied extensively in the United States of America as a possible practical means of ensuring continuous radio communication at all times. (iii) Ionospheric Effect of Magnetic Storms.\u2014This work has been extended, and the theory developed in detail. It is believed that it is now at a stage where it can be used by communications authorities to minimize traffic interruption. The Board's Chief Scientific Officer has been appointed Chairman of a Sub-commis sion of U.E.S.I. charged with the task of preparing a special report on the subject for the U.E.S.I. Assembly in 1954. (iv) Other Investigations.\u2014The Board is also investigating the theory of magnetic storms, and of the polar aurora, whose causations are still imperfectly understood. It has also commenced study of the non- polar aurora (air-glow) which appears to emanate from tbe ionosphere. (h) Investigations hy the Division of Eadiophysics. \u2014(i) Twinhling of Radio Stars.\u2014Just as irregularitiesin the lower atmosphere of the Earth cause twinkling of visible stars, so irregularities in the upper ionized' atmosphere cause rapid changes or twinkling of \" radio stars \". This fact has been used to provide informationabout the ionospheric irregularities. Eecently, the method has been extended by use of the radio spectrometer. Instead of a study of effects at a narrow, isolated part of the spectrum, measurements over a wide range of frequencies can now be undertaken. (ii) Adsorption hij the Ionosphere.\u2014Slow changes in the intensity of radiation from cosmic sources have beenstudied at the comparatively long wavelength of 16 m.The calculated absorption produced by the lower layer of the ionosphere has been found to agree with resultsobtained by the reflection method. For the higherlayers, however, the two methods give conflicting results.It is thought that the resolution of this disagreement141 will lead to a better knowledge of the ionosphere, especially when similar measurements are made in other parts of the world. (iii) Investigations hy Eeflected Signals.\u2014Work carried out earlier on measurements of the temperature of the lower layers of the ionosphere has led to an investigation of this region by reflection techniques. The region is of particular interest because it is largely responsible for the attenuation of short-wave radio signals. The new work differs from that of other ohservers in that very much weaker reflections can be detected. As a result, the first clear demonstration was given of the existence of a distinct layer or layers at a height of 70 km. above the surface of the earth. During the course of the work, a new method was devised for determining electron density and collision frequency in the ionosphere. It is expected that this technique will find more general application in ionospheric work. xxvni. ATMOSPHEEIC PHYSICS. 1. General. Although for many years systematic meteorologists have studied the day-to-day changes in Australian weather, studies of the fundamental phenomena under lying these changes have rarely been undertaken. The Organization has embarked on intensive studies of the physics of the atmosphere, as only through a knowledge of the basic physical phenomena can radical new developments emerge. Work on dynamical meteorology, general circulation, heat balance, and micrometeorology is being carried out within the Section of Meteorologi cal Physics at Highett and Aspendale, Victoria (see Sections 2\u20147 of this Chapter). Arising out of studies on the propagation of very short radio waves, the Division of Eadiophysics has been working on the physics of rain and cloud formation (see Section 9 of this Chapter). The Division of Eadiophysics has also worked on the measurement of wind velocities at high altitudes (see Section 10 of this Chapter). The Division of Physics at the Xational Standards Laboratory has also undertaken work on rain precipita tion in collaboration with the Division of Eadiophysics (see Section 8 of this Chapter). Statistical analysis of rainfall records is made by the Section of Mathemati cal Statistics, Adelaide (see Section 11 of this Chapter). Section of Meteorological Physics.\u2014The Section has a programme of study whose main object is to attain a more fundamental understanding of the weather and\" of the physical processes which control it. Meteorology is a public utility on which almost every phase of community life depends in some way. Whereas meteorology already provides a wide range of services to the country, these can only prosper and improve against a background of basic research into the many problems as yet unsolved. Thus, while some of the fields under investigation in the Section are capable of application to the immediate benefit of the community, the main task is to consolidate the foundations of the subject, to strengthen it against the continually grow ing demands for meteorological information and advice which are rnade by aviation and other transport ser-yices,_ by primary and secondary industry, and by the individual in his private life. 2. General Ciroulation. (Section of Meteorological Physics.) Work has continued on the study of the large-scale transport of heat, water, and momentum by the variable air currents extending through the atmosphere from the surface to about 50,000 feet. These transports aremajor factors in determmmg the average pattern of wind, temperature, and rain over the whole earth, and the study may continue for many years so that not only the pattern and its variation with season, but also its variation from year to year, may be better under stood. The research involves the working-up of northern as well as southern hemisphere data, since the number of good observing points in the southern hemisphere is not sufficient to allow the problems to be tackled on the basis of these data alone. Parallel work is pro ceeding in many countries, much of it following the lines pioneered in Australia; the work is an example of international collaboration on an international scientific problem. An exploratory study has been completed and pub lished of another aspect of large-scale weather\u2014the trends in temperature, rainfall, &c. which occur during periods of the order of a century. This has shown that, concurrent with the well-established and marked changes which have taken place in the northern hemi sphere, jjartieularly since about 1900, changes have also occurred over most of the south-east part of the Aus tralian continent which may well fit into a consistent picture of global change. Inland summer temperatures have declined appreciably and summer rainfall in South Australia and Victoria has increased by amounts of the order of 20-50 per cent. 3. Dynamic Meteorology. (Section of Meteorological Physics.) (a) Large-scale Systems.\u2014The study of climatic features in Australia is largely concerned with the distribution of temperature and rainfall especially with regard to position relative to the coast and the eastern mountain ranges, and to latitude. The very marked changes in climatic conditions from place to place are broadly understood, although much work has still tobe done in this field. Less is known concerning the occurrence of extraordinarily marked variations from year to year in some _ regions. These variations are shown up particularly in the areas subject to monsoonal seasons where a normally regular phenomenon may occur unduly late or even fail to appear, and their study calls for a physical approach rather than for the statistical methods normally used in climatology. A preliminary programme of research into three of the basic processes affecting these changes in Australia was set up early this year. Most of the west and north-west of Australia in summer is dominated by a dry-monsoonal circulation, apparent as a_ surface low pressure area subject to diurnal oscillations. The intensity, position, and struc ture of this system are being investigated statistically. Efdatious to the large-scale features of the region, and in particular to the trade winds and to the northern wet-monsoonal circulation, are under examination. _ Variations in the effective solar heating may be associated with the climatic anomalies in the region. A formula has been developed which allows the heatinput to be calculated from suitably analysed charts and the results are being studied on a continent-widebasis. Computations on similar thermally impressed patterns in other parts of the world are being made simultaneously. Particular attention is now being given to the mutualdependence of the slow moving or nearly stationarylarge deformations and the smaller, more rapidly moving, disturbances which account for the typical weather sequences of Australia. Some aspects are being treatedin collaboration with the Meteorological School at the University of Melhourne.142 (b) Convection.\u2014Work in recent years on thepliysics of rain has concentrated on the physical behaviour of cloud particles and drops, Avith rela tively little research into the dynamical process of upward air movement or convection Avhich provides the condition under which the drops can grow, and without which little rain can occur. A theory has now been developed for the motion and thermal behaviour of an clement of air, of any size, moving under buoyancy in a turbulent environment. 4. Miceometeoeology. (Section of Meteorological Physics.) Micrometeorology is that branch of the subject con cerned with the study of the physical processes that occur in the layer of air close to the ground. The three variables which control these processes are tem perature, water vapour content, and wind structure, and measurement of these quantities with suitable in struments reveals in each case two outstanding features\u2014 (tt) A pronounced fluctuation in space and time. Instruments of the highest resolving power used to date fail to reveal a lower limit either to the period or dimension of these fluctuations, and the upper limit appears to be reached only at the scale of the largest Aveather systems. (b) A marked stratification in the mean value of each quantity so that each may change rapidly Avith height in the loAvest feAv feet. In general the nature of the change depends on the time of day, becoming reversed at night in the case of temperature and humidity, and its intensity depends on such factors as weather and type and condition of the soil and vegetation. This comiAlete structure lias a profound influence on a wide range of superficially unlike jAhenomeua, such as the Avarming of the atmosphere, the evaporation of water from land and sea, the frictional interaction between atmosphere and earth, the transport of light seed.s, the dispersal of smoke from factories, &c. In particular the factors mentioned aboA'e determine the nature of the climate in and around crops, which, being subject to greater extremes, may be substantially different from that revealed by standard climatic data which refers to conditions at a height of four feet aboA^e a short grass surface. From the meteorological aspect the importance of studying these processes lies in the fact that it is in tills region that the exchanges of heat, Avater vapour, and momentum between the atmosphere and the under lying surface are effected. The energy of wind, rain, and heat in the atmosphere derive originally from these interactions. The micrometeorological Avork so far carried out in the Section has been mainly of a fundamental nature, though the knoAAdedge so gained has already found useful application in other connexions, for example, in the problem of frost prevention in orchards. The in strumentation designed for this investigation comprises apparatus of sufficiently rapid response to record the fine structure of temperature, humidity, and Avind, and a mechanical analyser Avhich, by providing correlations betAveen the variables, yields values of the fluxes of heat, Avater vaiiour, and momentum. The fiiie-structuro apparatus has recently been improved by the deA^elop- ment of a hot-wire anemometer linear over the lower range of Avind speed. So that account may be taken of all factors in the heat balance at the ground surface, instrunients have also been designed to measure the net incoming radiation and the heat flow into the ground.The field work at the experimental station at Edith- vale has mainly been an extension and consolidation of that of the previous year. To investigate the struc ture of wind gusts in the lowest 500 feet of the atmo sphere, anemometers were designed and installed, in co-operation Avith the Postmaster-General's Department, on a radio mast in open country near Sale. The purpo.se Avas to provide designers of radio masts and other tall structures Avith more reliable information on the maximum Avind pressure which may be encountered. Wind pressure calculations are at present based largely on old observations of the variation of the average Avind velocity with height and reliable measurements of the variation of gust velocities Avith height have been almost completely lacking. Sensitive recording anemometers, of rapid response, were installed at heights of 40, 210, and 500 feet above ground level and records Avere obtained on 35 occasions of strong or gale force Avind during the period August-December, 1952. Analysis of these records is now well advanced. Another product of the Avork in micrometeorology is the development of fine probes capable of measuring temperature and humidity, and fluctuations thereof, in A'ery small areas between the leaves &c. of trees and other crops, where conditions may differ greatly from those outside. 5. Feost Peevention. (Section of Meteorological Physics.) Trials have continued on the protection of fruit from fro.st by means of fans, the action of Avhich is to draw air from heights of 40 or more feet above ground where the temperature on frosty nights is from 5 to 10\u00b0 F. Avannor than near the surface. The object of the work is to determine the most efficient design of fan of a size likely to be suited to Australian requirements. The 1952 Avinter trials in citrus at Griffith {see Chapter IV., Section 3) were made using a 12-ft. diameter airscreAV of good aerodynamic design in place of the cruder 21-ft. rotor. The 12-ft. fan Avas found to give, Avith an axis tilt of 60\u00b0 to the vertical, a perform ance equal to that of the larger 21-ft. fan used pre viously on a vertical axis. The poAver consumption Avas the same in each case but the smaller fans have the advantage of being cheaper and more robust than the large types. A set of 60 electrical thermometers Avas provided and a lu'ogramme of observational Avork undertaken in con nexion Avith a frost fan installed in a jAineapple field in Queensland. The pineapple industry in Queensland suffers, in some Avinters, losses due to frost damage of up to \u00a3500,000 and, oAving to the high value per acre of this crop, some method of frost protection may Avell be economically sound. The results obtained Avith the fan AA-ere, however, distinctly disappointing in comparison Avith those ob tained in citrus at Griffith Avith an exactly similar machine. This Avas found to be largely a result of the smaller increase of air temperature Avith height at the Queensland site than at Griffith on clear calm nights. To ascertain AAdiether or not this is a result of the local topography, apparatus to record the temperature at various heights has uoav been installed at three pine- api)le plantation.s some miles apart. Work has recommenced this season at the Queensland site in co-operation Avith the Queensland Departmejit of Agriculture and Stock, on a series of trials compar ing the effect of the frost fan Avith that of a layout of oil-burning orchard heaters of the type used in the Mildura district to protect vines. Some trials will also be made on a combination of the fan and a small number of heaters, a system uoav much favoured in Oalifornia.143 In addition to the work on frost fans, a large number of observations of tbe rate of loss of lieat from the ground by radiation and of other factors bearing on the incidence of frost were made at Griffith with the object of providing improved aids to forecasting frost in this irrigation area. iVvailable instruments for frost alarm signals, em bodying mercury-in-glass thermometers with inset control, have not proved completely reliable. Accord ingly some consideration has been given to the suit ability of other types. Tests with a simple bimetallic type of instrument have given promising results; these will be continued. 6. Kadio MeTJ\u00a3OEOLOGY. (Section of Meteorological Physics.) Some relationshijj might be expected between varia tions in conditions in the troposphere and in the ionosphere since both are due ultimately to solar in fluence, though the nature of the two influences are quite different. Correlations which appear to have definite prognostic value to the meteorologists have been claimed to exist in different parts of the world and similar relations, particularly beween parameters of the tropopause and the /'Mayer critical frequency, have been sought in an investigation undertaken in the Section. Australian data have been limited to Canberra, where surface pressure was used in the absence of tropopause data. A more extensive examination was made of data from south-east England. In Australia, though corre lation between critical frequency and sea-level pressure appeared to exist, this occurred only at certain times and nothing was found to provide a criterion for the occurrence of such periods. In south-east England, again for certain periods only, there was evidence of correlation of /'Mayer height with tropopause tempera ture, and of critical frequency with tropopause height; there was some indication that the occurrence of the former was connected with wind conditions near the tropopause. A report is being prepared. 7. Minoi! Investigations. ,(8eetion of Meteorological Physics.) (ft) Uzone Invesiicjation.\u2014Measurements of the total concentration and vertical distribution of ozonein the iqiper atmosphere have now been made for many years at a number of stations in other countries, chiefly in the northern hemisphere. The absorption of radia- tiou by ozone plays an important part in the radiative equilibrium of the atmosphere. Besides this, ozone variations^ apjiear to be closely associated with thesynojitic situation and to provid'e an index of dynamic development in the upper atmosphere; their study is therefore of potential value to the synoptic meteoro logist. It is proposed to make ozone studies in Australia with three _ ozone spectrophotometers which are at present being recalibrated. (/) Sea Surface Temperature Measurement.\u2014The standard method of measurement of sea surface tem perature by dip bucket is being cheeked by a radiation method. (c) Evaporation Survey.\u2014Tio further work on an evaporation survey has been done in the Section since the task has been taken up by the \"Waite Institute Adelaide. ' (d) Wind Tunnel\u2014A number of anemometers and airnieters were adjusted and calibrated for outside in terests during the year.8. Peecipitation. (Division of Physics.) Investigations on the sublimation of solid carbon dioxide in super-cooled fogs and the production of ice crystals by this jirocess and of the collision cross section of raindrops relative to mist droplets have been continued. Experiments on surface accretion of ice on solid carbon dioxide pellets and on the efl'ects of fog density on the sublimation rate of such pellets, together with direct measurements of the free water content of typical laboratory-produced fogs liave been made. An analysis, making use of dimensionless parameters, of the results for carbon dioxide sublimation in moving air streams has led to a formula for representing the sublimation rate as a product of powers of the temperature difference, pellet mass, and air speed which satisfac torily represents the experimental results at all except very low air speeds. The results on the rate of sublima tion ot carbon dioxide ]))'ovide the necessary informa tion for the completion of the analysis- of the experi mental data on the production of ice crystals in super cooled fogs by solid carbon dioxide. 9. Cloud and Eain Physics. (Division of Eadiophysics.) This work is aimed at obtaining a thorough under standing of the physical processes which are involved in the_ formation of cloud and rain, and has the final objective of discovering whether it is practicable toinfluence the incidence and distribution of rainfall by artificial means. A wide range of investigations is being carried out, including work on the nature and origin of the microscopic nuclei on which water vapour condenses to form fog or cloud droplets, the air currents on which the nuclei rise and grow, the magnitude and distribution of the water droplets throughout the cloud, and the initiation of the freezing process at higher levels in the atmosphere. In addition, controlled experiments are made of the efficiency of various methods of producing artificial rain. Much of this work is performed in aircraft specially equipjied for the purpose and flown by a Detachment of the Royal Australian Air Force Aircraft Research and Development Unit. An accident, so far unex plained, which occurred during one of these research flights resulted in the complete loss of the aircraft to gether with its crew and two members of the staff of the Division._ The loss of these two officers, together with the special equipment on the aircraft, resulted in a considerable setback to the work of the Division. (a) Condensation i\\ uclei.\u2014^It is well known that condensation does not occur when perfectly pure air is cooled to the dew point temperature. Cloud and fog droplets must have some kind of condensation nuclei upon which to form. The free atmosphere contains these in relatively large numbers. The concentration of such nuclei may vary from a few hundred per cubic centimetre over the ocean to several hundred thousand per cubic centimetre in indu-^trial areas. Little is known about the constitution of these particles, but they can be divided broadly into two classes\u2014 (a) A number of comparatively large nuclei which consist of sea salt and have formed by the evaporation of spray dro])lets froni the ocean. (h) A comparatively numerous class of minute hygroscopic particles which liave their origin over the land masses from dust and from the burning of fuels such as wood, coal and oil. The smaller particles are important in the formationof the innumerable small droplets that make up fog and cloud, while the larger, sea salt nuclei appear to144 be of major importance in determining whether cloudsproduce rain. Attention is therefore concentrated on the study of the large hygroscopic nuclei. These may be collected by exposing small prepared slides to the air through which an aircraft is flown. Fine spider webs also make suitable surfaces on which to catch the nuclei. The behaviour of the nuclei on the slide when exposed to moist air positively identifies them as being of sea salt. They are found in great numbers in maritime air and an effort is being made to discover how this number falls off as the air goes further and further inland. In this w^ay it is hoped to explain why inland regions of the earth are, in general, more arid than those near the sea coast. (h) Freezing Nuclei.\u2014When water is cooled below 0\u00b0 C. it normally docs not freeze but becomes super cooled. Thus water droplets in the super-cooled state are commonly found in clouds and are responsible for the serious hazard of aircraft icing. At temperatures below about 15\u00b0 C. the droplets will freeze spon taneously. However, there are materials which when brought into contact with super-cooled droplets will cause them to freeze at warmer temperatures. Once ice particles are present in a cloud of super-cooled droplets an unstable situation exists and rain follows. Silver iodide is an example of a substance that will cause freezing at the relatively warm temperature of \u2014 4\u00b0 C. There are other materials occurring naturally in the atmosphere which also cause freezing earlier than usual. These freezing nuclei can be detected by bringing them into contact with a fog of super-cooled water droplets formed in a cold chamber resembling a deep freeze box. The water droplets turn to ice which has a very distinctive appearance when suitably illuminated. A cold chamber is being used on an aircraft to make a survey of the distribution of those freezing nuclei and to determine, if possible, their source. (c) Clouds.\u2014Once the cloud droplets have formed by condensation on nuclei the parameters that are of importance in a study of the rain process are the motion of the air which carries the drojis upwards and enables them to grow, the air temperature which is responsible for the upward motion, the cloud droplet size distribution, and amount of liquid wmter present at the different levels throughout a cloud. Measure ments are being made of all these quantities. (i) Air Movement and Velocity.\u2014-The upward air velocity in a cloud is a major factor in determining its development, as also is the degree to which the environmental air is enti-ained into the updraught. Both these quantities are susceptible of measurement by a radar technique now in use. Bundles of light metal foil strips, which fall slowly and reflect radar signals, are dropped from an aircraft in the neighbour hood of the region in which the air movement is to be studied and their paths accurately followed by means of a ground radar equipment. The air movements both in clear air and around clouds are being studied by means of this technique. (ii) Cloud Ternperature.\u2014Isolated cumulus clouds form in a rising current of air that is initially warmer than its environment. The growth of the cloud itself is a function of the temperature difference between the cloud and the surrounding air and the humidity struc ture of the environment. A study is being made of these temperature variations. For measurement of temperature inside the cloud special precautions are necessary to prev^ent the thermometer element becom ing wet and the cloud droplets are centrifuged out from the centre of a vortex tube through which the air- stream is made to pass.(iii) Cloud Droplet Spectra.\u2014The distribution of droplet sizes in a cloud that does not contain ice appears to be of critical importance in determining whether or not rain will fall from the cloud. A proportion oflarger than normal droplets is necessary, which grow by collision with the others. Measurements are made from airci-aft of the droplet spectrum in typical clouds. Magnesium oxide coated glass slides are exposed to the droplets for a fraction of a second from an aircraft flying through the cloud. The droplets impinge on the coating and leave holes proportional to their size. This technique has been applied successfully, in conjunction with simultaneous observations of the distribution of hygi'oscopic nuclei, to a study of clouds formed in mari time air. It appears that simultaneous observations of this type will yield valuable information about the mechanism of cloud formation and growth. (iv) Cloud Water Content.\u2014Measurements are being made of the liquid water content of conveetive clouds. The instrument used is mounted in an aircraft^ and gives a continuous record of the amount of liquid water present, which can be compared with that predicted from theory. (d) Bain.\u2014^Study of nuclei and cloud droplets is an essential preliminary to investigations of the physics of natural rain formation. Studies are made of general rain processes, primarily with the aid of radar both on the ground and in aircraft. Labora tory investigations are also made of the way in which water droplets collide and coalesce. (i) Radar Studies of Bain.\u2014Eadar has the unique property of simultaneously enabling an examination to be made of the precipitation elements throughout any cloud within its range. It has been used exten sively to carry out a survey of different types of rain storms occurring naturally and to make detailed studies of particular storms. By a careful examination of the way in which the echo intensity varies from ground level to the top of a storm and a simultaneous observa tion of raindrop size distribution at the ground, know ledge can be gained of the way in which the raindrops grow in falling through cloud. To deduce the nature of the particles causing the radar echoes use is also made of the fact that the reflection from a non- spherical ice particle differs from that from a raindrop ill liaving a marked cross-polarized component. (ii) Laboratory Investigations of Coalescence.\u2014 Theoretical information has been available for some time of the way droplets in relative motion towards each other either collide or pass around each other, depending on their size and the air flow. This theory has been confirmed experimentally only in a very limited range of droplet sizes, and one that is not of particular importance in the rain process. By setting up a low velocity vertical wind tunnel and injecting into it a stream of small droplets of known size it is proposed to study the coalescence process experimen tally for a range of droplet sizes. In principle, this teehuique is to adjust the air velocity so that it just supports the droplets; any collisions result in the pro duction of larger drops which then fall out. By investi gating the number of such falling drops relative to those just supported in the airstream deductions are made about the collision process. (e) Artificial Bain Formation.\u2014Investigation is continuing of methods of treating clouds to produce artificial rain. The dry ice process of rain-making is now comparatively well understood and no further work on this kind is being done at present. An alternative method using silver iodide, which is burnt to produce a smoke of fine particles, is known to be capable of producing large numbers of ice crystals if injected into a .super-cooled cloud at a suitable temperature level. Spectacular claims have146 been made in the tJnited States of America about the cfFectiveness of this material when burnt in smoke gene rators on the ground, reliance being placed on natural comection to carry it up into the clouds. It is known, liowever, that sunlight is capable of destroying the (''fcctiveness of silver iodide under certain conditions and the material is very susceptible to chemical con tamination. The Division is investigating the way in whicli silver iodide, releasell from a generator on the ground, diffuses down wind and whether it still main tains its effectiveness at a distance. The technique is the same as that described earlier for the investigation of natural freezing nuclei; that is, to catch the material in a sample of air and inject it into a box con taining a fog of super-cooled droplets and observe tho.sc that turn to ice. The equipment is carried in an aircraft and the investigation made at different alti tudes and distances from the smoke generators. A further method of artificially producing rain is to spray small water droplets or place hygroscopic nuclei into the air at the base of a growing cloud. These par ticles arc carried up by the air currents and grow by col lision with the small cloud droplets in their path. They fall out as rain when they have grown so large that the updraught can no longer support them. This method has been tried with water sprays and is now under investigation with hygroscopic materials. Clouds have been modified by the use of this technique, but not enough is yet known to judge of its economic possibilities. 10. Wind Measukements at Great Heights. (Division of Kadiophysics.) In Augu.st, 1951, a systematic series of observations of wind velocity at altitudes from ground level to heights up to 100,000 feet was commenced. Observa tions were made by using radar to track reflecting balloons released from the laboratory. Balloon llights were usually made five days a week and at times additional flights were made every six hours and every half hour. A total of 320 flig'hts were made before the work was discontinued in September, 1952. The observations are now being analysed. It is expected that the data will be of use in obtaining a better knowledge of the conditions prevailing at alti tudes at which modern aircraft now operate and also to give additional information about the general cir culation of the atmosphere. 11. Analysis or Baineall Kecoeds. (Section of Mathematical Statistics.) (a) Secular Changes in Rainfall in South Australia. \u2014Current work has confirmed the results of a previous analysis at Adelaide and established the existence of another long-term trend in the rainfall, the principal manifestation of which is the advancement of the spring rains by as much at three weeks. To date, this climatic change has been found 200 miles to the west and to the north of Adelaide. (h) Correlation of Monthly Rainfall.-\u2014The develop ment of climatology in Australia during recent years has made it increasingly important to interpolate for meteorological_ observations and, in particular, for rainfall. To investigate this problem, we must deter mine the extent to ndiieh different parts of the country experience, in any given period, similar deviations from their average weather sequence, that is, we must deter mine the correlation of such weather deviations. A knowledge of these correlations is essential to flnd the accuracy with whicli rainfall, or any other variate, may ])e estimated, at any given point, from knowiiobsen-ations at neighbouring points. The accuracy ..estimates:.inust..evide'utly .deijend \"Upoii the density with which observing stations are scattered.in F.5189.~10the region considered, and with a knowledge of the correlations it would be possible to state how densely located the stations should be to yield estimates with any assigned degree of accuracy. The same considera tions apply when we wish to estimate the total pre cipitation in a catchment area to put on an experi mental and quantitative basis such questions in meteorological physics as refer to localization of meteorological effects. Two research projects were therefore undertaken on monthly rainfall. In the first (Annual Eeports 1950-51, 1951-52), the correlation of rainfall of stations over an extensive area (400 miles north-south by 200 miles east-west) has been related to inter-station distance, and the axes of maximum and minimum correlation determined. In the second project (Eeport 1950-51), an attempt was made to predict rainfall in terms of the position and altitude of the observing stations. On the whole, the technique led to accurate prediction, but under some circumstances, probably depending on local topography and aspect of the observing stations, there were large discrepancies. Predicted values are now being found from the product of factors depending on station and year. (r) Expectation of Monthly Rainfall.\u2014In preceding investigations on the expectation of monthly rainfall in South Australia the original data (monthly rainfall) were such as to allow general conclusions to be drawn from the results, but not the fine detail now being demanded in engineering, soil conservation, agriculture, and the pastoral industry. In the winter and summer rainfall zones, the . climatic changes which take jjlace ivith the advancement of the rainy season are too rapid for monthly data to provide an accurate descriiition of the changes in progress, so that a_ finer subdivision of the year is required. The sub- divisional_ unit chosen was six days, and a complete investigation has been made of the seasonal rainfall sequence at four observing stations\u2014Adelaide, Darwin, Melbourne, and _ Forbes, Hew South Wales\u2014which represent respectively, winter, summer, and two types of rainfall season in the transitional zone. This analysis gives a complete characterization of the season, since for any time of the year, the probability is known that a rainless sjiell of specified length will begin at that time, or alternatively, that a period of given length, in which the rainfall exceeds certain specified amounts, will also begin at that time. The technique that has been developed is applicable to any type of rainfall season, and will have wide applications in a number of fields. XXIX. EXTEATEEEESTEIAL PHYSICS. 1. General. Until recently our knowledge of the universe has been derived almost entirely from the use of visual telescopes and from the optical methods of observation developed by astronomers. A new branch of science, called \" radio astronomy\" has now developed in which radio instru ments are utilized for the study of astronomical objects, and it is now possible to obtain much information about tlic Sun and the stars from the radio waves which they emit. In most cases these radio waves are generated spontaneously either as thermal radiation\u2014which is analogous to the light given out from incandescent bodies\u2014or as a consequence of electrical disturbances, in' a manner similar to the production of atmospherics by lightning flashes. Eadio waves are generated and propagated in a different manner from light waves, so that they provide new information which is often notobtainable iii. any other way. Eadio astronomy has lori|ied a major jiart of the of the'Division of Eadiophysics (see Section-3 below). Work146 on solar radiation is carried out by the Division of Physics in Sydney (see Section 2 below). Studies of the ionosphere are carried out by the Radio Research Board (see Chapter XXVII., Section 7). 2. SoLAE Physics. (Division of Physics.) (a) Emission of Radiation from Hot Atmospheres.\u2014 Studies on the emission of radiation from hot hydrogen atmospheres have been published and results applied to the interpretation of physical conditions in solar prominences, as revealed by their Ha contours and brightnesses. Recent computations at the Lyman Laboratory, Harvard, have given unexpectedly high values for the collision cross sections for transitions between the 2S and 2P substates of hydrogen. The effect of such large cross sections on the hydrogen emission is under investi gation here, particularly to see whether there are crucial tests as to the magnitude of the 2S-2P cross section. Calculations of the emission of hot atmospheres con taining other elements, in particular helium and calcium, have been commenced. For the latter element, it has been necessary to calculate electron excitation cross sections. Results of all these computations are required in the interpretation of observations of solar phenomena such as prominences, a coelostat, horizontal telescope, birefringent filter, and cine camera, originally commenced operation with a 6 A wavelength band centered on the Ha hydrogen line. As such, it was suitable for observations of prominences extending beyond the Sun's limb, but the large amount of sky light scattered by the city sky made such observations of limited value. A narrow band (0.5 A) filter has now been put into operation, and with it spectroheliograms have been obtained on 35-mm. film at -J-min. intervals. The wave length band is narrow enough to eliminate unwanted sky light so that prominences are clearly observed at the limb; but there is danger that fast moving promi nences may not be recorded because of Doppler shifts. Furthermore, this filter introduces a considerable amount of scattered light, but by using an obscuring disk to produce an artificial eclipse of the Sun good photographs of prominences can be obtained. Techniques have been developed for securing exposures in sequence on the chromosphere and on prominences at the limb, so tbat a complete composite picture may be obtained on cine-projection. Some attention has been given to photographing the whole disk of the Sun at a lower magnification on 35-mm. film without loss of resolution, and considerable improvement has been effected by the use of spcc-ial type film. The major factor limiting resolution is, how ever, always liable to be the large amount of atmos pheric scintillation experienced in Sydney. (c) High Altitude Observations.\u2014-Because of un satisfactory atmospheric conditions in Sydney, con sideration has been given to the advisability of establish ing a field station in the Snowy Mountains area, where the clarity of the skies would be suitable for extensive solar observations. To gain preliminary data on sky transparency and freedom from scattered light, photometers were con structed last year for measuring the sky .brightness near the Sun, and these were used on several occasions for comparative tests on variation with altitude up to 3,000 feet .on the ,Blue Mountains. In Depembev, 19.52, Kosciusko, where at a height of 5,700 feet photographs were secured of coronal condensations using light of the coronal green line. Simultaneous sky brightness measurements showed the skies to be considerably purer than in the Blue Moun tains area even in midwinter. 3. Radio Asteonomy. (Division of Radio physics.) During August, 1952, many of the world's best-known radio scientists were in Sydney for the Tenth General Assembly of the Union Radio Scientifique Inter nationale. This was the first occasion on which one of the International Scientific Unions had met outside Europe or the United States, and the choice of Sydney as the meeting place was a tribute to the achievements of Australian radio science. To radio astronomers the. Conference had a further significance in providing one of the early milestones in the path of the new science of radio astronomy. Radio astronomy, the study of the Sun and Galaxy by means of radio waves, has reached the end of its first explor atory stage in which existing tools were employed, and is about to start on a new stage for which new tools will be needed. One of tbese new tools will be the huge radio telescope now being constructed near Manchester in England. This will be used to study the detailed struc ture of the radio emission from the Galaxy. Although Australia had as yet no plans for compar able equipment to show the overseas visitors, several new and specialized types of equipment were seen in opera tion, which are in advance of any in use elsewhere. One of these is a radio-spectrometer which analyses the radio emission from the Sun into its various components in the range of wavelengths from 1.4 to 8 m. Another new piece of equipment in use is a 32-aerial interfero meter, which is probably the most highly directional aerial system ever constructed. This aerial is used for studying details of the emitting surface of the Sun. A third new type of equipment, constructed shortly after the Conference, is an experimental model of a radically new type of directional aerial system which will be used, at a wavelength of 4 m., for a detailed study of the Galaxy. The development of new tools is not the only sign, however, of the beginning of a new stage in the progress of radio astronomy. There appeared at the Assembly the first results of close collaboration between Australian and English radio astronomers and optical astronomers working with the largest telescope in the world at Mount Palomar. (a) Radio Waves from Outside the Solar System.\u2014 (i) Discrete Sources.\u2014In 1947, members of the Radio- physics Laboratory discovered and located the position of a discrete source of radio emission in the direction of tie constellation of Cygnus. Since that time many more such discrete sources have been discovered, both here and in England. These sources are popularly known as radio stars. In most eases the identification of the radio sources with visible celestial objects has not I'cen found possible, and the nature of the discrete radio sources has remained a mystery. Recently, the 200-in. telescope at Mount Palomar has been used to scan the l>osition of the radio source in C.ygnus and the discovery has been made that in this position are two galaxies or \" island universes \" in collision. These galaxies are so far away that it has required the use of the largest telescope in the world -to resolve them; yet they form one of the stro.nges-t sources of radio emission. Unlike our own Galaxy, they radiate roughly as much radio energy as light energy. If similar conditions occurred in our Galaxy, most radio cominunication would become is so intense at radio fre quencies, yet optically is near the lower limit of observa tion because of its great distance, suggests that some ofthe weaker sources may be so far away that they are beyond the reach of our largest telescopes. Kadio astronomy may already be giving information about previously unknown parts of the universe. During the past year the sizes and approximate shapes of several of the stronger sources have been determined and found to conform, usually, with the shapes and approximate sizes of certain visible nebulae. Similar work with different techniques was conducted simultaneously in England and similar conclusions were reached. (ii) Line Emission from Galactic Hydrogen.\u2014The discovery at Harvard in 1951 of an emission line from atomic hydrogen in interstellar space was an event of the greatest importance in astronomy. As well as proving the existence of hydrogen in interstellar space, the discovery provided the first \" line-emission \" type of radiation for use by radio astronomers. This type of emission can give very much more information about its source than can the \" continuous \" type of radiation; by its means it may be possible to delineate the structure of our Galaxy. Early work here showed the general shape of the source of radiation and also gave evidence that our Galaxy has a spiral structure. More accurate and elaborate equipment has now been designed and con structed to continue this study. First results have demonstrated the presence of hydrogen in both the Clouds of Magellan. The possible existence of bridges\" connecting the two Clouds and our ownGalaxy^ is now being investigated. This will help to throw light on the origin and structure of the Galaxy. (h) Eadio Waves from the Sun.\u2014Since life on Earth is completely dependent on the Sun, the interest of astronomers in the structure of the Sun and in the changes that occur on it is understandable. The changesin the emission from the Sun, fortunately, are small, otherwise life on the Earth would be destroyed. The small changes that do occur, however, may cause a cessation in long-distance radio communication on the Earth and may produce aurorae and other disturbances of the Earth's upper atmosphere. A large 32-element interferometer has been constructed to produce an aerial-beam so narrow that the emitting surface of the Sun may be studied in detail. Particular attention hasbeen paid to localized \" bright \" areas on the solar disk,appearing near sunspots._ It is in these areas that disturbances arise, producing effects on the Earth. A study has been made also of the \" background \" solar radiation, which is the radiation from the Sun in theabsence of localized bright regions. This investigation IS pioducing information on the physical conditions in the Sun's atmosphere. The^ new radio-spectroscope has been employed in analysing \" bursts \" of radio emission from the Sun. A new phenomenon, the production of \" harmonics\" ofbursts, has been discovered. This gives a most signifi cant ^clue to the mechanism of production of bursts andprovides also a new means of measuring the velocity ofparticles which are shot off from the Sun during a ladio bursty and, in part, eventually reach the earthcausing radio fade-outs, magnetic storms, and aurorae. ^ Routine observations of solar radiation, on sevendifferent wavelengths, are continuing. The results, with those obtained in the rest of the world, are edited herefor publication in the Bulletin of the Internatiorial Astronomical Union.XXX. Atomic Physics. 1. General. The Organization has co-operated with the Univer sity of Melbourne in a programme of research on nuclear physics and cosmic rays, under the direction of Professor L. H. Martin. Both activities have a common aim, namely, the study of the forces within the nucleus of the atom, but while the former uses high speed particles artificially produced in the laboratory, the latter analyses the disintegration produced in the upper atmosphere by high-speed particles reaching the Earth from^ outer space. Work on these projectsis described in Sections 2 and 3 (a) of this Chapter. Co-operative investigations on cosmic rays are alsobeing undertaken at the University of Tasmania under the direction of Professor A. L. McAulay, and are rejiorted in Section 3 (b) of this Chapter. In collaboration with the Commonwealth Depart ment of Health, arrangements have continued for procuring supjilies of radioactive isotopes from over seas and for their handling and distribution to research workers in Australia. This work on tracer elements investigations is described in Section 4 of this Chapter. 2. Hucleae Physics. (University of Melbourne.) (a) Equijment.\u2014Much of the work of the Section during the past year has been concerned with angulai' correlations between particles participating in nuclearreactions, with nuclear ener^ level determinations,and with scattering investigations. Two major itemsof equipment have been added to the laboratory lesources during the past year. A 200 kV. electronic multiplier machine has been completed. It is intended that this machine will primarily fulfil the role of aneutron generator. Also the new ten-channel pulseheight analyser has been used successfully in several investigations. Apart from these additions to laboratory equipment, some further minor changes have been made in existing installations to improve performance,notably with the 1 MeV positive particle accelerator^and the redesign of the electron synchrotron is proceed-iiig. Form^ly the upper energy limit of this machine was 14 MeV.; it is believed that the rebuilt machinewiJl give electrons of 25 MeV. energy. (b) Nuclear Reactions and Energy Level Experi- wents.\u2014Investigations are continuing with the 1 MeV.electrostatic generator. Huclear data suggest thatseven charged particle reactions are energetically p^sible when deuterons and protons are incident oiis-iid O targets. These possible reactions, onlyone of which_ has been reported as observed [i\u00ae0 (P)\")L ^re being investigated using the nuclear platetechnique. Evidence has accumulated suggesting the existence of several expected particle groups, but the somewhat confused owing to the effects of G, G, and contaminations. Present efforts arc concentrated on reduction of these persistent contaminations. Another investigation with this machine has been concerned with neutrons emitted in the deuteron bom bardment of beryllium and carbon. Examination of the neutron spectra resulting from the reactionBe (d,n) B by the nuclear plate technique ha.\"^ given a Q value for this reaction of 4.35 MeV in agreement with the value 4.36 MeV. given by the nuclear masses. Foiir energy levels of lOR were confirmed with energies 0.73, 1.75, 2.20, and 3.64 MeV. Two other neutron groups were observed, one of which could beattributed to D-D neutrons. The other group was indisagreement with neutron energies obtained frompossible target contaminants and could bpst be148 explained by an energy level in at 2.85 Furtlier measurements relating to the {d, n) _ ^ reaction have been made in order to ascertain the origin of this group. This will also give information on the energy levels of the nucleus. (c) Angular Correlation Experiments.\u2014In order toprovide information on the low excited state of ^Li theangular correlation hetiveen the a- particles and y- radiation from the reaction \"Be(d!,a)''Li*(7)''Li has been measured with the 750 keV. electrostatic generator. The results show no significant departure from iso-tropy. The most plausible explanation is that the lowest excited state of 'Li has spin I, but isotropy could also arise through fortuitous channel _ spindegeneracy or through an anomalous magnetic dipole- electric quadrupole y-radiation admixture. Theangular distribution of the y-radiation is now being investigated, because tor this excited state the channelspin degeneracy leading to an isotropic correlation cannot also lead to an isotropic distribution. Investigation of the relevant theory shows that the condition for isotroi^y of the correlation due to thedipole-quadrui^olc admixture depends only ^ on the admixture, thus being independent of the reaction lead ing to the excited .state of 'Li. By means of tlic electron synchrotron a study ha.s been made of the spatial distribution of the photopro- tons from deuterium produced by the synchrotron X-ray beam in a \"Wilson cloud chamber. It showed that the protons are not emitted with equal prohability at all azimuthal angles, as is expected from theory. In order to obtain better statistics, this problem^ is being pursued using nuclear emulsions soaked in heavy water. The immediate aim of the work has been to examine the y-radiatioii from the 14 MeV. synchrotron, with respect to jjossiblc polarization of the radiation. Results have been inconsistent to date. Early results suggested appreciable anisotrojiy in the spatial orienta tion of the photoprotons and it has not been decided whether this is real or of instrumental origin. _ An independent approach is planned, using proportional counters operating on deuterium gas. Erom this study is also being obtained the spectral distribution of the target radiation. Eurther work with the cloud chamber has been suspended owing to the relative paucity of X-ray output from the synchrotron under pulsed operation. Using a reaction camera which was designed and built during the year, the photoprotons emitted in the photodisintegration of nitrogen are being studied. The proton energy distribution indicates that the i-*X(y,p)^-^C cross section must rise to a maximum at about 10 MeV. and then fall to almost zero at about 124 MeV. The observed angular distribution is con sistent with a curve of the form xV -j- B sin-0 eos-d, which indicates that in nature the disintegration pro cess is a mixture of magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transitions. (d) Scattering Experinients.\u2014-Work with the mag netic lens spectrometer on the investigation ofscattering of eicctrons and positrons by gold has now been completed. The results obtained accord well with theory, and confirm the magnitude of the ratio of the intensities of the scattered electrons and positrons and the variations of this ratio with scattering angle. Another scattering investigation in progress using the 1 MeV. electrostatic generator concerns the nml- tiple scattering, of protons in nuclear emulsions. Pro tons from the deuteron bombardment of \u00aeLi, ^^C', and -'Mg recorded on Ilford 02 emulsions have been used to give tracks of known range corresponding to various energies between 0 and 5 MeV. The lateral displacement of the end of each track from its initialdirection is measured as projected on the plane of the emulsion. The standard deviation of the observed dis tribution can be compared with the theoretical calcula tions. Preliminary results indicate that the Williamstheory is in reasonable agreement with experiments whereas the Moliere theory tends to give results which are too high. Further work is being done to confirm these results. 3. Cosmic Rays. (tt) University of Melbourne.\u2014The cosmic ray spec trometer determination of the variation of the specific ionization of co.smic ray mesons as a function of their momentum has been completed and the results pub lished. The final results, comprising measurements on G,400 meson tracks, showed an increase of specific ionization with increasing momentum of the primary particle in good agreement with that predicted by theory. The measurements are of additional interest in the region above 10'\u00ae eV/c., since they show quite ]jlainly the flattening off of this rise of ionization due to the polarization of the medium. In the course of . this experiment it was found that l-hc distribution of energy losses for mono-energetic particles traversing an absorber in which the energy loss is very small compared with the total energy of the particle is appreciably broader than that predicted by existing theories. An investigation of this discrepancy i.s being made at the present time. The measurements of the meson momentum distribu tion and +/~ ratio at zenith angles of 30 and 60\u00b0 are now complete. Preliminary analysis shows that the shift to higher momenta of the peak of the distri bution, expected from the longer atmospheric path, is verified. xV considerable area of the nuclear emulsion plates exposed in the Himalayas during 1951 has been scanned. Data have been accumulated for heights up to approximately 18,000 feet on the slow and fast com ponents of the neutron flux in cosmic radiation, and on star production as a function of altitude. These data are now being correlated along three lines; (a) to check the existing data on altitude variation of the neutron flux; (b) to correlate the neutron flux with star production in the atmosphere; (c) to derive a \\ alue for the rate of production of radio-carbon ('^0) in the atmosphere. More recently this work has been extended to greater heights in conjunction with the balloon team nf the Melbourne University Physics Department, and to different latitudes in conjunction with research institutions in other parts of the world. (b) University of T-asmania.\u2014^Directional measure ments of the cosmic ray intensity at Hobart have been continued. Data from these measurements as well as data from previous years are being examined in relation to the variation of cosmic ray intensity asso ciated with meteorological fronts, and the diurnal variation of the east-west asymmetry. 4. Radioactive Tkacees. (Tracer Elements Investigations.) This Unit has continued to assist other laboratories and establishments in problems associated with the use of isotopes in non-medical research. Work has con tinued on the synthesis of isotopically-labelled com pounds, and independent, research has continued using .\"C in organic molecules. In July, a member of the staff commenced a year's study-leave in the United Kingdom, at the Radioehemical Centre, at Amershani, and the Xational Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, where he is obtaining experience in the techniques applied in these establishments. In October, Dr. T. H.149 Oddie was awarded a Tulbriglit Travel Graut and left for the United States of America, having been granted two years' leave of absence for work with radioisotopes in the University of Arkansas. (a) Procurement and DistribiUion of Isotopes.\u2014 The volume of requests for labelled compounds handled by this Unit for other Divisions and Sections has continued to grow, and increased supplies of isotopes available from England have allowed greater dependence on this source with the consequence that American supplies are now rarely used. Isotopes obtained have covered a wide range and include both organic and inorganic molecules for workers in many diverse fields of research and develop ment. (b) Advisory Worh.\u2014Inquiries from various sources regarding techniques applicable to work with radio active compounds have been received and some assis tance rendered regarding equipment useful in this field. Two workers from universities have visited the Unit, studying such practices of synthesis, assay, and measurement as are used in this laboratory. Several research organizations converting or erecting labora tories expressly for the purpose of isolating work with radioactive compounds have been advised on design and equipment. Preliminary tests were made in collaboration with the Department of Supply on the possibility of the detection of buried shells by radioactive marker methods. It has been found practicable to locate sources of moderate activity in up to eighteen inches of soil, using portable Geiger counters. Eurther assis tance has also been afforded the Irrigation Research Station at Griffith in studies of the diffusion of ^-Ra through soils, and some work on the use of isotopes in the elucidation of part of the life cycle of certain cattle ticks has been initiated in conjunction with the Division of Entomology, Rockhampton. (c) Equipment.\u2014Apparatus for the development of more precise counting methods is being assembled, with the intention of assaying gas samples by proportional counting techniques, thxis facilitating work with lower activities than is possible with more conventional tech niques of assay, particularly with ^^G-labelled eom- pounds. The properties and characteristics of certain halogen- quenched liquid counter tubes have been studied inten sively in conjunction with the Central Experimental Workshop in an attempt to find the optimum conditions for the operation of these tubes. This work is con tinuing. (d) Synthesis and Applications of Labelled Com pounds to Certain Studies.\u2014The synthesis of certain I'^O-labelled and ^\u00aeS-labelled acids not available over seas have been performed. Routes for preparation of a range of aryl- and alkyl-substituted a-glycols(\"0-labelled) have been explored and synthetic work begun, while certain kctones, aldehydes, o-diketones, and acyloins are being prepared. These compounds are required for studies of reaction mechanisms and isotope effects, which are being pursued. Certain plant hormones are also in stages of preparation, labelled with ^''C or \u00ae\u00aeC1. Radioactive sources of various types have been arranged for workers as required. XXXI. MATHEMATICS. 1. Gbnebal. Mathematical work plays an important part in all phases of the Organization's research programmes. Aseparate Section of Mathematical Statistics hp_ been maintained to provide workers in the various Divisions and Sections with special help in planning their researches and analysing their experimental results.Work on mathematical instruments and mechanical and electrical methods of computation is undertaken in the Section of Mathematical Instruments. Work oncomputing equipment is also undertaken in the Division of Electrotechnology (see Section 4 of this Chapter) and in the Division of Radiophysics (see Section 3 of this Chapter). Section of Mathematical Statistics.\u2014The main func tion of this Section is to provide mathematical assis tance to officers of the Organization in the planning of experiments and the interpretation of results. Much of the Section's work is described in other chapters, and a number of officers of the Section are attached to certain Divisions of the Organization or at appro priate centres\u2014Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth. .\\. large number of requests for assistance are re ceived from outside bodies such as universities. State and Commonwealth Departments and commercial enterprises. In addition a good deal of time has been spent on lecturing both to junior staff and to university classes. The Section has greatly benefited from the visit of Sir Ronald Fisher, F.R.S., who came to Australia in March at the invitation of the Organization and spent his seven weeks' sojourn in the laboratories of the Organization discussing mathematical statistics and its applications with Sectional staff and other interested officers. The Section has also vigorously pursued its_ own research programmes. Work on analysis of rainfall records is described in Chapter XXVIII., Section 11, and that on statistical studies of sheep breeding, done in collaboration with the Division of Animal Health and Production, is recorded in Chapter VII., Section 13 (d). Apart from this and other work described elsewhere, research projects undertaken by the Section are described in Section 2 of this Chapter. Section of Mathematical Instruments.\u2014This Section is located in tlie Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Sydney, under the direction of Prc^ fessor D. V. Myers. It is concerned with the investi gation of analogue and digital computing devices, and with the operation of the differential analyser. This work is recorded in Section 5 of this Chapter. 2. Analysis. (Section of Mathematical Statistics.) (a) Transformations of Discrete Variates.\u2014^Func tional transformations of a random variable are used to render the variances of experimental data homogeneous, that is, independent of their means. In particular, data in the form of frequencies generally require transformation before analysis. For many discrete distributions, one or more values of the popu lation mean lead to a degenerate distribution _ con centrated at one value and, consequently, there is, in general, no functional transformation which will result in constant variance. To meet this difficulty, a different type of transformation has been developed in which one or more of the original values are replaced by a random variate, rather than by a single new value. For many distributions of unlimited range, only one original value need be thus transformed, the other values undergoing a single-valued transformation. General recurrence relationships, for determining the transformed values successively, are derived. For the Poisson distribution, the transformed values are given explicitly, the larger values being obtained from an asymptotic formula. (b) Tests of Significance for Concurrent Regression Lines.\u2014The fitting of a straight regression line to a set of observations on two variates is a straightforward160 application of the method of least squares. \"Where there are several sets of such data, it is of interest to lit regression lines for each set, and to determine whether or not the slopes of the lines differ more than Avould be expected from chance variations. Where the slopes of a set of lines do not differ significantly the interpretation of the data is particularly straightfor ward, since the comparison of the sets may be made simply by comparing the constants of the regression equations. In fact, if these constants also do not differ significantly when a single slope is used for all lines, then the regression may be regarded as completely liomogeneous and a single equation used to represent the relationship for all the data. The case of parallel regression lines is particularly important in many applications; for example, the com parison of two materials by means of biological assay can be carried out satisfactorily only when the regres sion of response (suitably measured) on dosage is linear and has the same slope for each material. The relative potency is then measured as the distance between the parallel lines, measured in a direction parallel to the dosage axis. When the regression lines are not parallel, the interpretation is difficult or impossible. Another case which appears to be important but has not received so much attention is that in which the regression lines, instead of being parallel, are con current. This type of effect is likely to occur when different materials produce a different rate of response, while all give the same response at some fixed level. This level in practice is often not zero, and often not exactly known. When three or more regression lines are concurrent, it is possible to measure the difference between the effects of different materials or treatments by means of the ratios of the distances between the lines measured along an ordinate. It will be seen that parallel regression lines are simply a special ease of concurrent lines; in fact, the ratio of the effectiveness of different materials may be measured in precisely the same way as for concurrent lines, that is, by the distances between the intercepts on a transversal. (c) A MpJhcd of Analysis for Double Classifica- lions.\u2014Surveys or experiments Avhich are designed to throw light on the effects of two or more factors on some characteristic often provide data which are classified by the classes of each factor in two or more different ways. For the assessment of the effects of each factor, it is necessary to derive estimates of these effects, freed from any possible influence of the effects of other factors. Provided that the number of results in each subclass of the multiple classification is the same or propor tional, the analysis and interpretation of the data are straightforward, and the methods to be used are well Icnown. When the subclass numbers do not satisfy these requirements, the methods of analysis, both to arrive at unbiased estimates of the effects of each factor and to determine valid estimates of the experimental error, are more complicated. Various exact methods for treating data of this type are known, but for some purposes approximate methods are sufficiently accurate. Such a method, which has proved useful for double classifications, has now been devised. It is valid when the factors are independent so that their effects are additive, a condition that is often approximately satis fied in practice. (d) Analysis of Rainfall Records.\u2014The research projects in this field of investigation have continued and are reported in Chapter XXVIII., Section 11. (e) Statistical Studies on Sheep Breeding.\u2014These collaborative investigations between the Section of klathematical Statistics and the Division of Animal Health have continued and are described in Chapter \"711., Section 13 {d).3. High-speed Computation. (Division of Eadiophysies.) Effort has been concentrated upon the final develop ment and use of the electronic computer. On the engi neering side the high-speed store has been extended in capacity and is approaching the limit of 1,024 numbers. The use of punched cards has been discon tinued, imnched paper tape being now the medium for providing data to the machine. This allows more rapid and reliable insertion of information. Develop ment of editing and rapid recording equipm^ent is pro ceeding. Punched cards will be used only as an auxi liary to the tape used in the machine and the editing equipment ivill include devices for automatic transfer of data between cards and tape. In the field of pro gramme design, there has been considerable extension of the library of standard routines, which now includes routines for performing the more complicated functions, such as the arithmetic of complex numbers in floating index form and of multiple length numbers. The use of these routines greatly reduces the amount of work needed to programme the more complicated types of calculation. The machine has been used in the solution of linear equations, partial differential equa tions, the evaluation of determinants, compilation of table-s, and statistical analysis of experim^ental data. Other work has included the evaluation of tables for use in radio astronomy and in optics. In the latter case an extensive six-decimal table of the Fresnel integral has been compiled and is being used in a study men tioned below. Evaluation of the hydrodynamical flow at low Reynolds numbers around spheres has proceeded and the final stages of the calculations are being completed, using jmnched card methods and the relay multiplier which has recently been completed and placed into ser vice. This device is an all-relay type of decimal multi plier, and is coupled to a standard \" Hollerith \"-type reproducing punch. These calculations are expected to shoAV at what range of Reynolds numbers the transition from viscous to streamline flow takes place. A study of the nature of an optical focus in the presence of aberrations has continued and has required the solutions of partial differential equations, which were evaluated by use of the differential analyser in the Section of Mathematical Instruments. 4. Electeonic Computation. (Division of Electrotechnology.) A group of four of the direct-reading scale-of-ten counter tubes previously developed has been demon- strated_ in England and Europe. Further technical in formation and sample tubes have been supplied to manufacturers in England and the United States of America interested in producing these counter tubes. Mathematical work on the effect of space charge in disturbing the focus of circular electron beams has resulted in the derivation of a simplified formula for the calculation of this effect. Ill collaboration with the Electrical Engineering Department of Sydney University, a new method of solving _ potential distribution and other problems similar in form has been originated. The electron trajectory computer built previously is being redesigned to extend the range of problems towhich it is applicable. When complete it is proposed to make the services of this equipment available to electron-tube and other manufacturers. 5. Computing Insteuments. . (Mathematical Instruments Section.) (a) Differential Analyser. \u2014 The differential analyser has operated continuously throughout the year, apart from a short period set aside for additions151 and maintenance. A number of problems has been solved for the Organization and for outside bodies. These include several successful investigations of par tial differential equations and some lengthy problems ^ connected with the electron density in the ionsphere and with the response of an aircraft to graded gusts. Improved speed control and safety circuits have been incorporated in the machine, together with further re transmission units and plotting tables. Other new units commenced include an extended control cabinet, genera tor power supply, eight simplified integrators, and a teleprinter output. In conjunction with the staff of the New South Wales University of Technology, in vestigations have been carried out on continuous M- type transmission, and the operating principle estab lished of an improved type of curve follower. (h) Digital Machines.\u2014Work has continued in the development and application of beam deflection valves for digital computing and is now almost complete. valve has been developed and tested which is capable of binary addition, subtraction, or control of a gate by a bistable, monostable, or counting element. The per formance is comparable with that achieved in conven tional circuits, but the saving in valves and components is considerable. The work has established desirable pro perties for a universal computing element. Publication is awaiting a provisional patent. Essential develop ment work on a cathode-ray tube storage system 'has been completed and tests made of alternative methods of charge .storage. Peliability tests have been run with test patterns over a period of several months. These have provided useful data on components and operating methods. The average time between faults has been improved to fifteen hours, the main source of trouble now being valve failures. XXXII. PUBLICATIONS AND INFOKMATION. 1. General. The Organization's research results are made avail able through various channels. Formal scientific publication is supplemented in several ways: by the preparation of films (Section 4 of this Chapter) which may, for example, give a farmer or extension officer more help in diagnosis of animal disea.so3 than wmuld a list of clinical data; by the continuous and close contact with industry of officers of the Divisions and Sections, through whom much information\u2014derived from the literature, accumulated knowledge and experience, and current research\u2014is disseminated; by the provision of facili ties for gue.st in laboratories; by the publica tion of trade circulars, newsletters, and articles for trade journals; by press releases; by lectures and short courses of specialized training; and by the organization of specialist conferences. The application of research in the primary indus tries is being assisted by the work of the A,giucultural Eesearch Liaison Section established in 1951 (Section 3). Other sections of this Chapter describe the work of the Organization's Librarie.3 (Section 5); the Translation Section (Section 6); the Information and Documentation Sections (Section 7) ; and the Overseas Liaison Offices (Section 8). 2. Publications. In collaboration with the Australian National Eesearch Council the Organization has in the past published the Australian Journal of Scientific Eesearch, Series A dealing with the physical sciences and Series B dealing with the biological sciences. These two journals have now been replaced by three new publications: the Australian Journal of Physics(published in collaboration with the Australian National Eesearch Council and the Institute of Physics) ; the Australian Journal of Chemistry (pub lished in collaboration with the Australian National Eesearch Council and the Eoyal Australian Chemical Institute) ; and the Australian Journal of Biological Sciences (published in collaboration with the Aus tralian National Eesearch Council). In addition, two ::e'.7 periodicals have been started, also published in collaboration with the Australian National Eesearch Council, under the titles of; Australian Journal of Botany, and Australian Journal of Zoology, to cater for the more descriptive phases of the biological sciences. The various scientific periodicals published by the Organization are, therefore\u2014 Australian Journal of Agricultural Research\u2014 Issued quarterly. Australian Jotirnal of Aj^plied Science\u2014-Issued quarterly. Australian Journal of Biological Sciences\u2014Issued quarterly. Australian Journal of Botany\u2014Not issued at regu lar intervals. Australian Journal of Chemistry\u2014Issued quar terly. _ Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research\u2014Not issued at regular intervals. Australian Journal of Physics\u2014Issued quarterly. Australian Journal of Zoology\u2014Not issued at regular intervals. The Organization's research results are published in the above journals, in its Bulletins and other special series of publications, and in papers contributed to specialized scientific journals both in Australia and overseas. The above journals are also open to workers not attached to the Organization for the publication of papers of substantial merit. A complete list of scientific papers published during the year by officers of the Organization will be found in Chapter XXXV. Other publications issued by the Organization during the year include\u2014 (1) Volume I. of a monograph: \"The Grass hoppers and Locusts (Acridoidea) of Australia\", by Dr. James A. G. Eehn, dealing with the families Tetrigidae and Fumastacidae. Dr. Eehn is Curator of Insects at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and was asked to under take this compilation. (2) \"Australian Termites\", by F. W. Eatcliffe, F. J. Gay, and T. Greaves. This book has been prepared to provide the non-specialist reader with accurate information on the biology, recognition, and economic import ance of the common species of Australian termites. (3) \"A Manual of x\\ustralian Soils\", by C. G. Stephens. This provides a brief account of the system of soil classification in use in Australia before 1925, an outline of the modern system of classifying soils on the basis of their morphology, and a classi fication of Australian soils, with colour photographs and morphological descrip tions of the profiles.(4) A new series of \" Soil Publications \" reporting issearch in the field of soil science, including soil surveys and related investi gations of interest to specialists in thisfield. No. 1 of the series entitled \" Pedologyof Deniboota Irrigation District, N.S.W.\" has now been issued. Earlier work of this sort was reported in the Bulletin series.152 (5) A new series of publications, \" Land Research Series These report the work of the Land Research and Regional Survey Section in the systematic surveys of natural re sources it is undertaking in undeveloped areas in northern Australia. Two publi cations have now been issued in the series: \" Survey of the Katherine-Darwin Region, 1946\" and \" Survey of the Towns\\ulle- Roweii Region, 1950 \". (6) The first draft of a \"Directory of Australian Scientific and Technical Re.^earch Centres\" containing information on groups in Aus tralia currently engaged in research in pure science, technology, agriculture, veterinary science, and medicine. 3. Liaison Between Ageicultubal Research and Extension Work. The Agricultural Research Liaison Section was formed to ensure that the Organization's research results are made available to State Departments of Agriculture for use in their extension work with farmers. Increased interest in agricultural extension work has followed the Commonwealth extension grant to State Departments for the general piirpo.se of increas ing agricultural iiroduction. The work of the Section is concerned mainly with marshalling important research material and presenting it in suitable form through publications and at con ferences with State extension authorities. During the year there were three issues of the liaison periodical Rural Research in C.S.I.R.O., and it has now been established as a quarterly. Two more of the serie.s of publications describing research financed from wool funds have been produced : \" Towards More Wool\" and \" Better Pastures for the R.S.W. Tablelands \". Conferences between research and extension officers are held to deal with recent research results requiring more detailed explanation and discussion. The Section, in conjunction with the jSTew South Wales Water Con servation and Irrigation Commission, assisted the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in the organi zation of an irrigation conference held in October and November, 1952, at Yanco, New South Wales. It aimed to provide an interchange of knoAvledge and ideas between research and extension workers, engineers, and administrators associated with various aspects of irrigation, and in particular the irrigation of orchards and row crops. The 60 delegates from all n.aiiiland States recommended that a similar coursedealing with the application of water to pastures should be held during the 1953-54 season at centres in Yictoria and the Riverina. The Section co-operated with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in a conference-tour of the Southern Tablelands region, organized by the Depart ment and concerned primarily with the practical application of recent research in establishing' improved pastures in this area. This on-the-spot \"co-operationbetween research officers of the Organization and extension officers of Departments of Agriculture is expected to be the forerunner of a series of similar conference-tours in specific regions. There is ofton considerable scope for improved meansof presenting more difficult research findings at con ferences or courses. In connexion with the Yanco irri gation course the Section dev-ised an analogue method of presenting the principles of applying water to .soils using earth models and selected small flows. The method is being extended to border irrigation and shows promise as an auxiliary to field I'e.seareh.The Section works with the Eilm Unit in the pro duction of films on rural topics, and in art work asso ciated with the Unit's general activities. Three irri gation film.s are being produced in co-operation with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture. The first\u2014\" Salting and Reclamation \"\u2014^was issued in December, and has had a wide distribution. The two other film.=\u2014\" Irrigation and Earm Design\" and \" Supply and Drainage Ditches\"\u2014are nearing completion. Inquiries involving direct extension advice are referred to State extension authorities for reply; about tlirce-quarters of the 500 inquiries received during the year were referred to State Departments and others. 4. Eilm Unit. During the year the following films were completed and released:\u2014 \" Soils and Eoundations \"\u201416 mm., colour, sound, screening time 21 minutes, released July, 1952. Made at the request of the Division of Soils, this film deals with problems arising from the building of brick and masonry houses on cer tain troublesome tyjios of clay soil. The imiiortance of recognizing the soil type on each building block is stressed, since this is the key to the physical properties of the soil and .=0 to the appropriate foundation design. \" Salting and Soil Reclamation \"\u201416 mm., colour, sound, .screening time 22 minutes, released Augu.st, 1952. This film was made in colla boration with the Murrunibidgee Irrigation -ireas New South Wale.s Department of iVgriculture and is intended primarily for farmer extension pur poses. It describes how salt gets into the soil in the first place; how, in arid areas, there is a deiicate balance between the salt distribu tion in the soil and rainfall and vegetation; how this balance can easily be upset by irriga tion and particularly over-irrigation; how salting kills trees and crops; how salting often can^ be prevented by careful and correct irri gation practice; how land already salted can often be converted to pasture; and finally the various tile drainage methods which are the only sure preventives of salting and its only effective cure. The Argentine Ant\"\u201416 mm., colour, sound, screening time ten minutes, special release March, 1953. Made for the Division of Entomology in collaboration with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and local health authorities, a special copy of this film was released for use by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture at theSydiiey Royal Easter Show. It is now being modified so as to be more suitable for use bylocal health authorities in instructing spray gangs in the proper method of using chlordane spray in campaigns aimed at the eradication of the ant. When so modified the film will ho available for general release. A short, 16-mm., silent, colour film entitled \" Queens-an New Guinea Fibre Experiments\" was^ssem ^ed and edited ^ for the Officer-in-charge, Plant himself made the cine records onan otfacial visit to those areas in 1952. of productfon^!-^\"^'\"^'''^\u00ae subjects are in the course The Mutton Birds of Ba.\u00ab,s Strait\"\u2014awaiting a seasonal mass migration shots.e.mgn or Irrigation\"\u2014due for release in October, 1953.163 \" Supply and Drainage Ditches \"\u2014to be completed by June, 1954. \" Bovine Contagious Plcuropneumonia \"\u2014due for release December, 1953. \" Chain Saw Sharpening Techniques \"\u2014due for release October, 1953. The demand for the Organization's films has con tinued, and prints of most recent productions are held by the Australian Uational Tilm Library and an appro priate State authority in each State, also by the Aus tralian Scientific Liaison Offices in London and Washington. Prints have been purchased by U.iSr.E.S.C.O., P.A.O., and certain British Common wealth countries. During the year some 280 film bookings were made of prints held in the film library. Screenings bave been arranged on research subjects to interested groups of officers from the Organization, State Departments, Universities, and industry. An earlier production \" Radiophysics 1949 \" was selected and exlnbited at the 6th International Edinburgh Eilm Festival lield 17th August to 7th September,^ 1952. A certificate to this effect has now been received from the Festival. 5. Libbaeies. It was found possible during the past year to carry out a comprehensive revision of both the text-book and periodical collection at the Central Library. Libraries in the various Divisions and Sections of the Organiza tion have continued to function and expand their services. Co-operative reference work in .\\ustralian libraries is gaining momentum and increasing numbers of inquiries are being received for scientific and tech nical publications from libraries in all States. A Supplement to the second edition of the Union C'ltalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals is in press and will be available shortly. The Supplement contains only titles of periodicals which have com menced jHiblication since January, 1946. Work will commence shortly on a more comprehensive Supplement covering alterations which have taken place in library holdings since the publication of the second edition. Administrative changes during the past year brought wliat was previously known as the Documentation Sec tion of the Information Service under control of the library. This Section has been responsible for a publi cation under the title of Ahstracts of Published Papers and List of Translations which is being issued in duplicated form in limited numbers and distributed to libraries both in Australia and overseas. The Abstracts cover papers published by the research staff of the Organization in its own publications and in other scientific journals. A small duplicated edition of a first draft of a Director}! of Australian Scientific and Technical L'esearch Centres has also been issued. Making use of the experience that has been gained in the compila tion, it is hoped later to ])uhlish a revised edition in printed form. 6. Teanslatiobt. The Section has performed translation, written and oral, for the Organization's Divisions and Sections. Some assLtance, mainly in oral translation, has been given to other governmental bodies and scientific workers. Some work has been sent to outside transla tors, mainly in Japanese, which is not covered by the Section, but also in other languages, owing to tem porary shortage of staff. Translated contents lists have been prepared from Russian scientific and technical periodicals, both for the pssistance of research staff and for inclusion in theTranslaled Contents Lists of Russian Periodicals issued by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Re search of Great Britain. Copies of the D.S.I.R. Lists are .sold by FI.M. Stationery Office. The Section has acted as Australian agent for the Index of Translations of the British Commonwealth Scientific Office. A reference card index of available ti'auRlations has been kept and its existence advertised. The use made of it has not been extensive. The languages handled by the Translation Section are German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, ITcbrew, Russian, Polish, Ukranian, and Lettish. For other languages, use i.s made of a panel of outside translators. 7. Infobmation and Documentation. The policy of decentralizing information work in the Organization has been continued and during the year under review the Information Section has been discontinued as a separate staff. Its former staff, which is now attached to the Secretariat, is responsible for dealing with inquiries which cannot be handled by Divisions and Sections or other specialist bodies, and for providing information and intelligence for the Executive. The Documentation Section is now attached lo (he Library. S. OvEKSEAs Liaison Offices. The Organization maintains Scientific Liaison Offices in London and Washington as constituent units of the British Commonwealth Scientific Office (London) and the British Commonwealth Scientific Office (ISTorth America). These offices maintain close contact with overseas scientific developments and also act as bases for C.S.I.R.O. visitors and research students and other visiting scientists. XXXIII.
