Method: Using data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, we ran multiple logistic regression models to estimate the odds of each perceived benefit among adults ages 50 and older. Results: More than 38% of midlife and older adults used CAM in the past year. For six of seven perceived benefits examined, we found significant differences by race/ethnicity, with each group having higher odds of two or more perceived benefits compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Discussion: Although racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely to use CAM compared with non-Hispanic Whites, those who use CAM perceive great benefit. Future research should examine the potential contribution of evidence-based CAM to promoting health and well-being in a diverse authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota (P2C HD041023) funded through a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
