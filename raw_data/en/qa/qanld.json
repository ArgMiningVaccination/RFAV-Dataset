[Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine?module=inline_auto&pgtype=article), New Zealand's [Covid-19 Vaccine](https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine?module=inline_auto&pgtype=article)Independent Safety Monitoring Board said in an emailed statement on Monday. \"With the current available information, the Board has considered that the myocarditis was probably due to vaccination in this individual,\" it said. \"The Board noted that Covid-19 infection can itself be a cause of myocarditis as well as other serious illnesses and it remains safer to be vaccinated than to be infected with the virus.\" It is New Zealand's second reported death linked to the vaccine after the board said in late August that a woman's myocarditis was probably due to vaccination. [How the world is getting tough on unvaccinated people](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/explained/article/3156282/how-world-getting-tough-unvaccinated-people-singapore-gives?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) It said today that another two people had died with a potential myocarditis following vaccination. Further information was needed in the case of a 13-year-old child, while the death of a man in his 60s was unlikely related to the vaccine, it said. \"The Board considers that the circumstances of these cases do not impact or change the known information on myocarditis, and the benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 continue to greatly outweigh the risk of such rare side effects,\" it said. \"The Board has recommended actions to be taken by the Covid-19 vaccine and immunisation programme to continue to highlight myocarditis as a very rare side effect of the Pfizer vaccine.\" Thailand mulls reimposing quarantine [Thailand](https://www.scmp.com/topics/thailand?module=inline&pgtype=article)is considering reinstating mandatory quarantine for foreign visitors due to concerns over the spread of Omicron, as the health ministry reported on Monday the country's first case of local transmission of the coronavirus variant. The public health ministry will propose scrapping a quarantine waiver for vaccinated visitors and revert to hotel quarantine and the \"sandbox\" programme, which allows free movement within a specific location, minister Anutin Charnvirakul said. The proposal was driven by worries over the spread of Omicron, Anutin told the Inside Thailand television show, adding it will be made to the government's Covid-19 task force \"soon\". The minister's remarks come weeks after Thailand reopened to foreign visitors in November, ending nearly 18 months of strict entry policies that contributed to a collapse in tourism, a key industry and economic driver that drew 40 million guests in 2019. Thailand had detected 63 people infected with the Omicron variant so far, Anutin said, with one case of local transmission and the rest imported cases. The first locally transmitted case was found in a Thai woman who tested positive to Omicron after contracting the virus from her husband, a Colombian who returned to Thailand from Nigeria in late November, a health ministry official told a daily briefing. \"She is potentially the first in Thailand to get Omicron from an overseas traveller, her husband, and the first locally transmitted case,\" said Chakrarat Pittayawonganon, an official from the Disease Control Department. Both the husband and the wife had been fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said. The couple had one high-risk contact, a taxi driver, who was being quarantined and pending a second coronavius test due on Wednesday, Chakrarat added. Also on Monday, Thailand's Food and Drug Administration said it has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for children between the age of five and 11. Sydney resists calls to restore curbs Australian authorities urged a \"move away from fear\" of the coronavirus on Monday, resisting calls to make masks mandatory indoors and limit the numbers of patrons at Sydney venues, even as new Covid-19 infections lingered near records. Despite the threat from the more transmissible Omicron variant, life returned to near normal in Sydney last week, with almost all tough curbs lifted ahead of Christmas, as vaccination rates rank among the world's highest. \"There will always be new variants of this virus,\" said Dominic Perrottet, premier of the most populous state of New South Wales. \"The pandemic is not going away and we need to learn to live alongside it,\" he told reporters in Sydney. \"We need to also move away from fear and move to hope and confidence.\" While Omicron's rapid spread across Europe forced a lockdown in the Netherlands and could bring tighter measures elsewhere, Australia is pushing to ease curbs despite a predicted surge in infections, hoping inoculations will help keep people out of hospital. More than 90 per cent of those older than 16 have been immunised in Australia. Perrottet hoped the higher vaccination levels would limit the numbers admitted to hospitals, a figure he urged everyone to focus on. Although experts have called for tough curbs to be reinstated, Perrottet said he was \"taking a balanced and proportionate response\". No new deaths were recorded on Monday, despite the surge in infections, with hospitalisation rates far lower than at the peak of the Delta wave. New South Wales reported 2,501 cases, down from the pandemic high of 2,566 on Sunday. The neighbouring state of Victoria had 1,302 new infections, up from 1,240. Australia's tally of 255,000 infections and 2,146 deaths since the pandemic began is far lower than that of many nations. Virus cluster at US military base in Japan [Japan](https://www.scmp.com/topics/japan?module=inline&pgtype=article)is fueling concern about the Omicron variant, months after the nation saw a record delta wave of infections ebb. More than 180 people are part of the cluster at the US military Camp Hansen on the island prefecture of Okinawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters on Monday. While it's unclear if any of these have Omicron, concern is growing that the new variant is spreading as two people connected to the base have been confirmed to have it. They are an American woman in her 50s who works at Camp Hansen and her Japanese husband, who is in his 60s, The Okinawa Times reported on Sunday. The couple lives outside the military facility. About 60 people have been identified as their close contacts. [Why it's too early to panic about Omicron's ability to evade vaccines](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/explained/article/3158267/why-its-too-early-panic-about-omicron-and-vaccines-may-protect?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) While infection control measures such as wearing masks are in place, Japanese officials requested further restrictions on activities inside and outside the base to alleviate the anxiety of the local residents, Matsuno said. People who violate the rules should be punished for the infractions, he said. Those who are diagnosed with the virus are strictly isolated on the base and their close contacts are being traced jointly with the local government, Matsuno said. The number of cases in Japan plunged to less than 100 a day, a 17-month low, in November from a daily peak of 25,000 during the summer, despite reopening the economy in October. Well over 77 per cent of the population of 126 million is completely vaccinated, making Japan one of the most immunised developed countries in the world. Reporting by Bloomberg, Reuters "}
