Ayurveda is an intricate system of healing that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is a science of life. We are all part and parcel of nature and just as other creatures live in harmony with nature, so we too can follow the Laws of Nature to create heath, balance within our beings and to bring the individual back into equilibrium with their true selves. 'Ayu' means life and 'Veda' means knowledge. Ayurveda explains that everything in the Universe, including our bodies, radiates a unique energy pattern or aura. Imbalances in our energy bodies get manifested into our visible physical bodies. It is through the removal of blockages in the energy body, reduction of stress, spiritual healing, increasing the right nutrients, spices/herbs, and harmonizing the energy vibrations within one's body that a healthy state can be re-established. Let the synergy between the ancient and modern, the fusion between Ayurveda and western nutritional principles, the interaction between East and West, the balance between the mind, body, soul and most importantly, the intrinsic connection between the Individual (You) and the Universe (Parmatma) pervade, in order to facilitate a transformation to an exceptional You! Our services offerings use the wisdom of the ancients (Ayurveda and Spirituality) to help you find the right lifestyle based on your specific Dosha (constitution). We offer an initial 20 minute phone consultation to understand your needs which allows us to suggest the appropriate package for you or create a customized package to fit your unique requirements for complete mind-body-spirit healing. In addition to personal coaching services, we also present Corporate Workshops [both in-person and virtual] for team empowerment and productivity. Our mission is to use Ayurveda and Spiritual healing techniques to facilitate a complete mind-body-transformation and support you on the most important journey of your life - to finding your Highest Self or \"I AM\". This results in a total revitalization of your life to one which is full of joy and in sync with your higher life purpose (Dharma).

It is by living in this manner that we may force issues, fall into survival mode, and tend to struggle against the Universal flow. This intensifies exhaustion, anger, loneliness, restlessness, weight gain, and ill-health. How can the above situation be changed? The answer is Sensual Living.

I saw her for about three months, after which I felt more balanced in my life. Our first session began with an evaluation of my dosha so she could better understand how to treat me. She also spent time interviewing me and understanding what issues I was bringing to the table. Through the sessions, she has greatly helped my meditation practice, as well as provided information on health and nutrition. Vishnupriya is a fountain of information. I learned so much from our sessions, and she helps me integrate the knowledge into my life in a kind way. She has helped me with both phsyical health and spiritual issues. I would recommend her to anyone looking for healing through Ayurveda and ready to make a real change in their lives. ------------ Hannah P., NY "}
