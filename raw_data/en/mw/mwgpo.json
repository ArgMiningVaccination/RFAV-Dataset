In 2004, respondent Daniel Bierbach suffered a work-related ankle injury while working for his employer, relator Digger's Polaris. Eventually, Bierbach was diagnosed with intractable pain and enrolled in Minnesota's medical cannabis research program. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 152.21-.37 (2020). He then filed a claim petition, seeking reimbursement from his former employer for the cost of the medical cannabis. The compensation judge granted the peti- tion. The Workers' Compensation Court of v. Digger's Polaris , No. WC19-6314, slip op. at 2 (Minn. WCCA Nov. 10, 2020). 2a On appeal to our court, relators Digger's Polaris and State Auto/United Fire & Casualty Group raise four issues. First, did the WCCA correctly conclude that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide arguments that require interpreting federal law, including a question of preemption? Second, does the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971, preempt the requirement in Minnesota law for an employer to reim burse an injured employee for the cost of medical treatment, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (2020), when the treatment for which payment is sought is medical cannabis? Third, does the expert opinion relied on by the workers' compensation judge lack foundation? Fourth, is medical cannabis reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's pain? We addressed the same questions of jurisdiction and preemption in a companion case, Musta v. Mendota Heights Dental Center , A20-1551, 965 N.W.2d 312 (Minn. Oct. 13, 2021). For the reasons stated in that opinion, we hold that the WCCA lacks jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempts Minnesota law that requires an employer to furnish medical treatment when th e treatment for which reimbursement is sought is medical cannabis. We also hold that the CSA preempts the compensation court's order mandating relators to pay for Bierbach's medical cannabis. Because these holdings resolve this dispute, we do not reach the remaining issues. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals. Reversed. 3a CONCURRENCE & DISSENT CHUTICH, Justice (concurring in part, dissenting in part). For the reasons set forth in my concurrence and dissent in Musta v. Mendota Heights Dental Center , No. A20-1551, slip op. at C/D-1, 965 N.W.2d 312, 328 (Minn. Oct. 13, 2021) (Chutich, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part), I join in the court's decision that the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals (WCCA) lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempts state workers' compen- sation law, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (2020), to the extent that the state law requires an employer to reimburse an employee for the purchase of medical cannabis. But I respectfully dissent from the court's holding that the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971, preempts section 176.135 to the extent that this Minnesota law requires an employer to reimburse an employee for the purchase of medical cannabis. Because I would hold that section 176.135 is not preempted by federal law, I would reach the remain- ing issues, which were not present in Musta . 1 I conclude that the opinion of respondent Daniel Bier- bach's treating physician, Dr. Coetzee, has adequate foundation, and that substantial evidence supports the findings of the compensation judge\u2014both that medical cannabis can be a reasonable and necessary treatment for intractable pa in and that it was rea- sonable and necessary in Bierbach's case. Because 1 In Musta , the parties stipulated that medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary to treat the employee's pain. Musta , 965 N.W.2d at 316. Consequently, only the preliminary ques- tion of WCCA jurisdiction and the issue of preemption were before us in that case. 4a the court's decision overextends the preemptive scope of the Controlled Substances Act and denies Bierbach treatment that is reasonable, necessary, and crucial to keeping him meaningfully employed, I respectfully dissent. I. I begin with an overview of the state's medical cannabis program and then explain the facts giving rise to this dispute. A. The Legislature has established a research pro- gram to study the benefits of medical cannabis for people with certain painful conditions. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.21, subd. 1 (2020) (\"The intent of this section is to establish an extens ive research program to investigate and report on the therapeutic effects of THC under strictly controlled circumstances . . . .\"). The statutes governing the program, Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 152.21-.37 (2020), are calle d the THC Therapeutic Research Act (THC Act). Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.21, subd. 7. Patients who are enrolled in the state's program are permitted to obtain and use medical cannabis without criminal liability under state law. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.32. But medica l cannabis possession and use remains prohibited under federal law. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812. To enroll in the state's medical cannabis program, a patient must submit an application, signed disclo- sure, and application fee. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.27, subd. 6(a). The application must include a certification from the patient's health care provider that the patient is diagnosed with a qualifying medical condition. Id., subd. 3(a)(4). Effective in 2016, the Commissioner of Health approved \"intractable pain\" as a qualifying condition. 45 Minn. Reg. 1299 (June 5a 14, 2021); see also Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152. 22, subd. 14(10) (permitting the commissioner to approve new quali-fying conditions). To remain enrolled in the program, a patient must submit a doctor's certific ation annually, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.27, subd. 3(b), and pay the annual fee. The patient may only obtain medical cannabis from one of two registered manufacturers, see Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.25, subd. 1(a) (requiring the commissioner to register two in-state manufacturers). B. With that overview, I turn to the facts of the case. On April 7, 2004, respondent Daniel Bierbach suffered a work-related ankle injury when the ATV he was driving rolled over. At the time of the acci- dent, he was 25 years old and employed by Digger's Polaris. 2 Bierbach underwent surgery on his left ankle, performed by Dr. J. Chris Co etzee. After the surgery, he engaged in physical therapy. He also took opioids for a short time but weaned himself off them. Over the next 15 years, under the guidance of Dr. Coetzee and other health care professionals, Bierbach used various techniques to manage the pain as his ankle slowly deteriorated. Those treatments included an ankle brace, compression icing, cortisone ankle injections, an ankle boot, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication s. Dr. Coetzee has also stated that Bierbach would likely need an ankle replacement in the future, but that he is currently too young for such a procedure. 2 The insurer for Digger's Pola ris is United Auto/United Fire & Casualty Group, which is also a party to this appeal. Collectively, I refer to Digger' s Polaris and United Auto as \"Digger's Polaris.\" 6a In April 2018, Dr. Coetz ee certified Bierbach as having intractable pain.3 He was approved to partic- ipate in the state's medical cannabis program, and he began purchasing medical cannabis from one of the registered cannabis manufacturers. The manu- facturer's records show that, between April 2018 and February 2019, Bierbach's dosage more than doubled. The dosage was in creased to \"reflect [his] current use,\" and to help him manage the pain from increased activity, including Bierbach's return to full- time work. According to those records, he was not able to afford as much medical cannabis as he needed and on at least one occasion, he had to wait several weeks after running out before purchasing a refill. Bierbach reported getting good daytime relief, completing more yardwork at home, and sleeping better. The total cost of his current dosage plan is about $1,860 per month. The opinions of two experts were admitted as evidence. In his June 2018 letter, Dr. Coetzee stated that Bierbach continued to develop progressive degenerative changes in his ankle following his work injury; he was doing reasonably well, but not great, with the ankle injections. Dr. Coetzee observed that Bierbach's ankle continued to be very sore and swol- len with or without activity, that he walked with a limp, and that he was limit ed in his daily activity and continued to gain weight because he could not 3 Under the workers' compensation rules, \"intractable pain\" means \"a pain state in which the cause of the pain cannot be removed or otherwise treated with the consent of the patient and in which, in the generally accepted course of medical prac-tice, no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible, or none has been found after reasonable efforts.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.125, subd. 1; see Minn. R. subp. 8a (2019) (incorporating the definition from section 152.125, subdivision 1). 7a exercise without pain. Consequently, Dr. Coetzee opined that Bierbach would be a great candidate for medical cannabis \"to help with his intractable pain and wean off of narcotic pain medication.\" In February 2019, Dr. Christopher Meyer issued an independent medical examination report. Dr. Meyer documented substantial swelling of Bierbach's left ankle and agreed that he had chronic left ankle pain related to his degenerative joint disease resulting from his work-related inju ry. In assessing whether medical cannabis was an appropriate treatment for Bierbach's pain, Dr. Meyer stated that the treatment of chronic pain is \"under significant debate.\" He explained that classic treatments include \"bracing, ice, as well as medications such as anti-inflammatories and has involved the use of narcotics.\" But he noted that the use of narcotics ha s come under \"significant scrutiny.\" While acknowledging that medical canna- bis is recognized as a safer alternative to opioid use, Dr. Meyer opined that the \"medical objective data supporting\" its use for chronic pain \"continues to be controversial.\" Consequently , he stated that he was \"not a believer in the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain,\" and Dr. Meyer recommended that Bierbach be evaluated for a chronic pain program. In March 2019, Dr. Coetzee responded to Dr. Meyer's report. He stated that Bierbach suffered increased ongoing pain th at was aggravated by physical activity, and he noted that Bierbach had already tried various treatments, including cortisone injections, a brace, and op ioids. He acknowledged that Bierbach had already weaned himself off opioids, but Dr. Coetzee opined that Bierbach would need something more than anti-inflammatory medica- tions to alleviate his intractable pain and concluded that Dr. Meyer's advice would result in ongoing 8a opioid use. Dr. Coetzee opined that medical cannabis is significantly better for chronic pain than opioids, and he noted that Bierbach had tried, and responded well to, medical cannabis. Accordingly, Dr. Coetzee reiterated his opinion that \"medical marijuana is an appropriate medication for Mr. Bierbach's condition.\" At a hearing held by the compensation judge, Bierbach testified that he works as a sales associate at a large outfitter store ov er 60 hours a week and is on his feet for 90 percent of the day. He stated that he gets enormous swelling and discoloration when he is on his feet for extended periods of time. And despite trying various treatments, such as icing, medications, and ankle inject ions, his pain has slowly increased over the past 15 years since his work injury. He further explained that medical cannabis has provided him substantial relief by taking away the pain during the day and helping him sleep at night. Bierbach also testified that medical cannabis has helped him maintain employment and has improved his relationships wi th his family. He noted, however, that he sometime s runs out of his supply and cannot afford to refill it immediately and that he would use medical cannabis \"a lot more\" if he could afford it. Bierbach admitted that he has misused drugs and alcohol in the past. He acknowledged to using recre- ational cannabis \"[t]hroughout [his] life\" but denied using it in recent years. Bierbach also admitted receiving two DWI's, including one in 2017 that was followed by chemical dependency treatment. He stated that he never informed Dr. Coetzee or the cannabis manufacturer of his DWI convictions because he was never asked. Bierbach also acknowl- edged that Dr. Coetzee has no control over the frequency or amount of medical cannabis that he 9a receives under the program and that no one monitors his use. In his Findings and Order, the compensation judge determined that the Worker s' Compensation Act, Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 176.001-.862 (2020), requires reimbursement for medical cannabis use, but he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to decide questions involving the federal Controlled Substanc es Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801- 971. Under state law, the compensation judge found that medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary because Bierbach faced chronic pain without an effective alternative treatment. The judge found that the opinion of Dr. Coetzee was more persuasive than the opinion of Dr. Meyer, and the judge credited Bierbach's testimony about his pain, the decreasing efficacy of cortisone injections, and the benefits of using medical cannabis. Th e compensation judge also determined that Bierbach's use of medical cannabis was sufficiently regulated under a general treatment parameter, Minn. R. 5221. 6050, subp. 1 (2019), and under the Department of Health's regulation of the medical cannabis program. Accordingly, the compensation judge ordered Digger's Polaris to pay for Bierbach's prior medical cannabis costs. 4 The Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals (WCCA) affirmed, holding that the compensation judge did not abuse his discretion by crediting the opinion of Dr. Coetzee over the opinion of Dr. Meyer. Bierbach v. Digger's Polaris , No. WC19-6314, slip op. at 5 (Minn. WCCA Nov. 10, 2020). The WCCA also upheld the compensation judge's finding that medical cannabis is compensable und er state law and that 4 Bierbach's counsel acknowledged at oral argument that the compensation judge's order for reimbursement applied only to the specific past expenses submitted to the court. 10a medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's pain. Id. at 6-7. Finally, the WCCA held that it did not have jurisdiction to decide whether the federal Controlled Substances Act preempts state law. Id. at 7. Digger's Polaris sought review by certiorari on four issues: 1) whether the WCCA correctly determined that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide questions that involve federal law, including a question of preemption, 2) whether the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971, preempts state law to the extent that Minnesota Statutes section 176.135, subdivision 1(a), re quires an employer to reimburse an employee for reasonably necessary medical treatment, which in this case includes the purchase of medical cannabis, 3) whether the compensation judge abused his discretion by relying on the medical opinion of Dr. Coetzee instead of the opinion of Dr. Meyer, and 4) whether substantial evidence supports the compensation judge's finding that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's intractable pain. I agree with the court that WCCA lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide the preemption ques- tion, but I disagree with the court that federal law preempts the reimbursement order made under section 176.135. Because my reasoning on these two issues is set forth in my concurrence and dissent in Musta , 965 N.W.2d at 328, I focus here on the issues that are unique to this case. These issues are whether Dr. Coetzee's opinion has adequate founda- tion and whether substantial evidence supports the finding that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's intractable pain. 11a II. Digger's Polaris challenges Dr. Coetzee's expertise and the factual basis for his op inion. It contends that Dr. Coetzee lacked the relevant expertise to opine that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary because he is not a pain specialist, has never pre- scribed medical cannabis, and generally lacks educa- tion and experience in treating pain with medical cannabis. Bierbach counters that these objections go only to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of Dr. Coetzee's opinion, and therefore we should defer to the credibility determination by the compensation judge. We apply \"a very deferential standard . . . when reviewing a determination as to expert qualification, reversing only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\" Teffeteller v. Univ. of Minnesota , 645 N.W.2d 420, 427 (Minn. 2002) (citation omitted) (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). \"The qualifications of an expert do not usually go to the admissibility of the expert's opinion but merely to its weight.\" Ruether v. State , 455 N.W.2d 475, 477 (Minn. 1990); see also Burke v. Precision Eng'g , 1997 WL at *5 (Minn. WCCA Aug. 21, 1997) (\"Once [an] expert medical opinion has been admitted into evidence without objection, that evidence may no longer be entirely disregarded by the compensation judge, and the evidentiary issue becomes one of weight rather than of competence.\"). Because Digger's Polaris did not object to the admission of Dr. Coetzee's written opinions into evidence\u2014in fact, Digger's Polaris offered the letters into evidence\u2014their challenge to his expertise goes 12a to evidentiary weight, not admissibility. Burke , 1997 WL at *5.5 Digger's Polaris also claims that Dr. Coetzee lacked a sufficient factual foundation to opine because he relied on two pieces of medi cal literature that are not in the record, his first opinion incorrectly assumed that Bierbach was still using opioids, and he may have been unaware of Bierbach's prior alcohol and drug misuse. Accordingly, Digger's Polaris asserts that the compensation judge erred by relying on the opinion of Dr. Coetzee rather than the opinion of Dr. Meyer. Bierbach responds that, as his treating provider, Dr. Coetzee had an adequate factual foun- dation for the opinions provided and that the com- pensation judge permissibly weighed the conflicting expert opinions and found the opinion of Dr. Coetzee to be more persuasive than that of Dr. Meyer. \"It is well established that a compensation judge's choice among conflicting expert opinions must be upheld unless the opinion lacked adequate factual foundation.\" Mattick v. Hy-Vee Foods Stores , 898 5 Even if the question of admissi bility were properly preserved, I would conclude that Dr. Coetzee is adequately qualified because he has extensive training and experience in treating ankle injuries. See Marquardt v. Schaffhausen , 941 N.W.2d 715, 719 (Minn. 2020) (requiring an expert to have \"the necessary schooling and training\" plus \"practical or occupational experience\" with the subject matter to testify). Dr. Coetzee is an orthopedic surgeon sub-specializing in foot and ankle surgery who performed Bier- bach's surgery and has directed hi s course of pa in management treatment for over 15 years. Although the full extent of Dr. Coetzee's training or experience with medical cannabis is unclear, Dr. Coetzee has observed Bierbach's response to the use of medical cannabis and has knowledge of medical litera- ture relating to medical cannabis use. Consequently, the com-pensation judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting Dr. Coetzee's letters. 13a N.W.2d 616, 621 (Minn. 2017) . An expert opinion lacks adequate foundation wh en it \"does not include the facts and/or data upon which the expert relied in forming [the] opinion,\" Steffen v. Target Stores , 517 N.W.2d 579, 581 (Minn. 1994), does not \"explain the basis for [the] opinion,\" Welton v. Fireside Foster Inn , 426 N.W.2d 883, 887 (Minn. 1988), or when the expert assumes facts that \"are not supported by the evidence,\" Schuette v. City of Hutchinson , 843 N.W.2d 233, 237 (Minn. 2014). See Hudson v. lium Staffing , 896 N.W.2d 536, 540 (Minn. 2017) (concluding that an expert opinion lacked foundation on each of these grounds). \"An expert need not be provided with every possible fact, but must have enough facts to form a reasonable opinion that is not based on speculation or conjecture.\" Gianotti v. Indep. Sch. Dist. 152 , 889 N.W.2d 796, 802 (Minn. 2017). Whether an expert's opinion has adequate foundation is a determination for the compensation judge, subject to review fo r an abuse of discretion. Mattick , 898 N.W.2d at 621. Based on my review of the record, I conclude that Dr. Coetzee had an adequate factual basis for opining that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's pain. The record amply supports Dr. Coetzee's opinion that traditional pain management treatments are not adequate for Bierbach's pain. The record establishes that Bierbach tried physical therapy, an ankle brace, an ankle boot, compression icing, cortisone injections, and anti-inflammatory drugs with decreasing effectiveness over 15 years. And because of Bierbach's relatively young age, ankle-replacement surgery is not advisable at this time. Dr. Coetzee's opinion that medical cannabis is substantially better for chronic pain than opioids is 14a also amply supported. Dr. Coetzee cited two articles indicating that medical cannabis is currently being used to replace opioids for pain management,6 and even Dr. Meyer agreed that medical cannabis is safer than opioids. Mor eover, Dr. Coetzee observed Bierbach's positive response to the use of medical cannabis between April 2018 and February 2019. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.28, subd. 1(a)(5) (requiring a certifying provider to \"agree to continue treatment of the patient's qualifying medical condition and report medical findings to the commissioner [of health]\"). The attempts by Digger's Polaris to opinion are not pe rsuasive. Digger's Polaris is correct that Dr. Coetzee mistakenly that medical cannabis would help Bierbach wean off opioids, when in fact he had not used opioids for years. But Dr. Coetzee gave additional reasons why medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary, which are independently sufficient to sustain his opinion. Specifically, he explained that Bierbach needs more than anti-inflammatory medications and that, while helpful, cortisone injections do not provide adequate relief. He further explained that apart from medical cannabis, Bierbach would have to resort to long-term use of opioids, which Dr. Meyer agreed is more dangerous than use of medical cannabis. Consequently, Dr. Coetzee's opinion is adequately supported. In addition, although the evidence does not show that Dr. Coetzee knew of Bierbach's history of chemi- 6 Although the medical articles cited by Dr. Coetzee are not in the record, workers' compensation proceedings are not bound by the usual rules of evidence, pleading, or procedure. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.411, subd. 1 (2020). Even if they were, Minnesota Rule of Evidence 703(a) permits an expert to rely on inadmissible facts or data if commonly relied on by experts in the field. 15a cal substance use, an expert \"need not be provided with every possible fact,\" but need only \"have enough facts to form a reasonable opinion that is not based on speculation or conjecture.\" Gianotti , 889 N.W.2d at 802. I conclude that this standard is met here, particularly given that the record does not show any current or recent chemical substance misuse. Because Dr. Coetzee's opinion was admitted with- out objection and had an adequate factual basis, the compensation judge acted with in his discretion when he weighed the conflicting opinions of Dr. Coetzee and Dr. Meyer and found that Dr. Coetzee's opinion was \"more persuasive and in line\" with the medical evidence in the case. See Ruether , 455 N.W.2d at 478 (\"[I]t is axiomatic that a conflict in the opinions of expert medical witnesses is to be resolved by the trier of fact.\"). I therefore conclude that the compensation judge did not abuse his discretion in relying on the opinion of Dr. Coetzee instead of the opinion of Dr. Meyer. III. Having addressed the dispute over Dr. Coetzee's opinion, I now consider whether substantial evidence supports the compensation judge's finding that medi- cal cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's intractable pain. Although the primary question is an evidentiary one, the parties also raise questions about the interpretation of various statutes and administrative rules. Digger's Polaris makes many arguments why medical cannabis cannot be reasonable and neces- sary to treat Bierbach's pain. Because possession of medical cannabis is illegal under federal law, Digger's Polaris contends that medical cannabis is per se unreasonable and unnecessary under the 16a workers' compensation laws. Even if it is not per se unreasonable and unnecessary, Digger's Polaris maintains, medical cannabis is not \"medically neces- sary treatment\" under the administrative rules because there is no prescribing \"provider\" and because medical cannabis is not \"consistent with the current accepted standards of practice.\" See Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 10 (2019) , Minn. R. 5221.6050, subp. 1(A) (2019). It further argues that the compen- sation judge and WCCA relied on a mistaken under-standing of the definition of \"illegal substance\" in the workers' compensation administrative rules. See Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 7a (2019). Finally, Digger's Polaris asserts that the record does not sup-port a finding that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary for Bierbach's pain. Bierbach responds that substantial evidence supports the compensation judge's finding. He points to his treatment history, his own testimony, and the opinion of Dr. Coetzee. Bi erbach further argues that the accepted standards of practice for using medical cannabis are the requirements established by the Legislature for a patient to participate in the state's medical cannabis research program. I address each of the parties' arguments in turn. Construing a statute or a dministrative rule is a question of law subject to de novo review. Ross v. N. States Power Co. , 442 N.W.2d 296, 297 (Minn. Fabrication, Inc. , 926 N.W.2d 414, 419 (Minn. 2019) (administrative rule). We first determine whether the language of the statute or rule is ambiguous. Johnson , 926 N.W.2d at 419. If the language is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, the statute or rule is ambiguous. Id. But if the language is unambiguous, 17a we construe it according to its plain meaning in light of the statute or rule as a whole. Id. We \"will not disturb findings affirmed by the WCCA unless the findings are manifestly contrary to the evidence or unless the evidence clearly requires reasonable minds to adopt a contrary conclusion.\" Pelowski v. K-Mart Corp. , 627 N.W.2d 89, 92 (Minn. 2001). Rather, when a compensation judge's findings are supported by substantia l evidence, we affirm a decision of the WCCA upholding those findings. See Oseland by Oseland v. Crow Wing Cnty. , 928 N.W.2d 744, 756 (Minn. 2019). A. I turn first to the argument by Digger's Polaris that medical cannabis is per se unreasonable and unnecessary.7 The Workers' Compensation Act 7 As a preliminary matter, Bierbach argues that the compen- sation judge and the WCCA did not have jurisdiction to deter- mine whether medical cannabis is per se unreasonable based on its status as a Schedule I drug, because determining whether cannabis is illegal under federal law requires interpreting federal law. The compensation judge held that he did not have jurisdiction, but the WCCA disagr eed. The court does not reach this question because it resolved the case on other grounds. The WCCA is correct. The determination of the compensabil- ity of a particular medical treatment for a work-related injury is squarely within the jurisdiction of the WCCA. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 175A.01, subd. 5 (2020) (conferring jurisdiction over \"all ques-tions of law and fact arising under the workers' compensation laws of the state\"). Although the WCCA may not interpret and apply foreign law, see, e.g., Martin v. Morrison Trucking, Inc. , 803 N.W.2d 365, 369 (Minn. 2011), it may determine certain questions ancillary to a compensation claim, see, e.g., Seehus v. Bor-Son Constr., Inc. , 783 N.W.2d 144, 152 (Minn. 2010), or look to foreign law for instruction in limited circumstances, see, e.g., Sundby v. City of St. Peter , 693 N.W.2d 206, 215-16 (Minn. 2005). I conclude that the compensation judge and the WCCA 18a requires employers to . . . relieve Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (emphasis added). Under federal law, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), and therefore its possession is illegal, Accord- ingly, the question is wh ether medical cannabis can be a reasonable and necessary treatment within the scope of section 176.135, subdivision 1, when its possession is illegal under federal law. This question of statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo. Ross , 442 N.W.2d at 297. Digger's Polaris asserts that se unreasonable because Bierbach cannot know- ingly possess cannabis without committing a federal crime and because it cannot reimburse him for his purchase without aiding, abetting, and conspiring to further that crime. This argument is incorrect. For the reasons explained in my concurring and dissent- ing opinion in Musta , 965 N.W.2d at 328, Digger's Polaris cannot be liable for aiding and abetting. Moreover, it cannot be liable for conspiring to further a possession offense because it shared no goal of helping Bierbach possess cannabis. See Hager v. M&K Constr. , 246 N.J. 1, 247 A. 3d 864, 889 (2021) (holding that an employer would not be liable for conspiracy by reimbursing an employee for the pur- chase of medical cannabis under court order because there would be no \"unity of purpose\"). Next, Digger's Polaris contends that medical cannabis is per se unnecessary because Congress has were permitted to look to fede ral law to determine the narrow question of the legality of posse ssing medical cannabis to resolve a claim of compensability raised by Bierbach. 19a found that Schedule I high potentia l for abuse,\" have \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" and lack \"accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervi- sion.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). This argument is flawed because Minnesota work- ers' compensation law does not entrust the finding of medical necessity to Congress. To the contrary, state law entrusts a state offici al, the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, with establishing guidelines for determining whether a treatment is reasonable and necessary. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83, subd. 5(a) (2020) (requiring the commissioner to adopt rules for deter-mining when treatment is \"excessive, unnecessary, or inappropriate under section 176.135, subdivision 1\"). Those determinations, in turn, must be \"based upon accepted medical standards.\" Id. Generally, whether a treatment is medically neces- sary depends on its consistency with an applicable treatment parameter. See Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 10 (defining \"[m]edically necessary treatment\" as those health services that are \"consistent with any applicable treatment parameter\"). The treatment parameters are rules that establish criteria for determining when a treatment is advisable for a particular condition, consistent with accepted medical standards. See Johnson , 926 N.W.2d at 418 (explain- ing that the treatment parameters are standards that set out reasonable medical treatment based on certain accepted medical and rehabilitation standards that are intended to contro l the costs for compensable medical treatment). For example, parameters govern the use of medications, see Minn. R. 5221.6105 (2019), long-term opioid use, Minn. R. 5221.6110 (2019), and chronic pain management, Minn. R. 5221.6600 20a (2019). The parameters also establish various limi- tations, such as how long a treatment may continue, see, e.g., Minn. R. 5221.6600, su bp. 2(B)(3) (permit- ting use of a health club for 13 weeks), or in what order treatment must progress, see, e.g., Minn. R. 5221.6105, subp. 2(B) (requiring a generic ibuprofen or naproxen to be used before other drugs of the same type). When a spec ific treatment parameter does not apply, as is the case here, a treatment may be medically necessary if it is \"consistent with the current accepted standards of practice within the scope of the provider's licensure or certification.\" Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 10. Certainly, the congressional finding that there is \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States\" is relevant evidence of the absence of an accepted medical standard. But it need not be determinative of the \"current standards of practice\" if other evidence suggests otherwise. Accordingly, I conclude that medical cannabis is not per se unreasonable or unnecessary medical treatment, and instead requires a case-by-case determination. 8 8 Because I resolve this question under a plain-language analysis, I need not address additional arguments by Digger's Polaris that are based on the absurdity and constitutional- avoidance canons. As it admits , those canons generally apply only to ambiguous statutes. See Schatz v. Interfaith Care Ctr. , 811 N.W.2d 643, 651 canon); State v. Altepeter , 946 N.W.2d 871, 877 (Minn. 2020) (constitutional- avoidance canon). Similarly, I need not address an argument of Digger's Polaris based on amendments to the THC Act because the argument is premised on the canon of in pari materia , which applies only to ambiguous statutes. State v. Thonesavanh , 904 N.W.2d 432, 437 (Minn. 2017) (explaining that, under the canon of in pari materia , two statutes with common purposes and subject matter may be construed together to resolve an ambiguity). 21a B. Next, I turn to the argument by Digger's Polaris that medical cannabis is not medically necessary treatment under the workers' compensation administra- tive rules because there is no prescribing \"provider\" and because the use of medical cannabis to treat a work-related injury is not consistent with accepted standards of practice. 1. Because no specific treatment parameter governs the use of medical cannabis, see Minn. R. 5221.6050- .6600 (2019), medical cannabis is medically neces-sary, and therefore compensable, if it is \"for the diagnosis or cure and significant relief of a condition consistent with the current accepted standards of practice within the scope of the provider's license or certification.\" Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 10 (empha- sis added). The question here is what role the \"provider\" must play in relation to the \"treatment.\" According to Digger's Polaris, the prov ider must \"order\" the I agree with Digger's Polaris that the compensation judge and the WCCA improperly relied on the definition of \"illegal substance\" in the administrative rules to determine that medical cannabis is compensable. See Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 7a (defining \"illegal substance\" by excluding the use of medical cannabis by patients in the medical cannabis research program). As acknowledged by the Department of Labor & Industry, which promulgated the administrati ve rules that govern medical services for workers' compensation claimants, the definition of illegal substance and the related rules \"do not address whether treatment with medical cannabis is compensable under workers' compensation law.\" Compact , Minn. Dep't Lab. & Ind., Aug. 2015, at 2. Nevertheless, I reject the arguments by Digger's Polaris that medical cannabis is per se unreasonable and un- necessary for the reasons already explained. 22a treatment. Because Dr. Coetzee did not order or prescribe medical cannabis for Bierbach\u2014he merely certified that Bierbach has a qualifying condition and opined that Bierbach was a good candidate for the state's medical cannabis program\u2014Digger's Polaris maintains that the provider requirement is not met. I disagree. Although it is apparent that a provider must have some role to play in the employee's acquir-ing of the treatment, limiting a provider's role to \"ordering\" a treatment is not reasonable in light of the meanings of \"treatment\" and \"provider.\" \"Treatment\" is defined in th e rules as \"any procedure, operation, consultation, su pply, product, or other thing performed or provided for the purpose of curing or relieving an injured work er from the effects of a compensable injury under [section 176.135, subdivi- sion means \"a physician . . . or any other person who furnishes a medical or health service to an employee under this chapter.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.011, subd. 12a (emphasis added); see (incorporating the definition of \"provider\" fr om section 176.011). These definitions show that, at a minimum, a provider may \"furnish,\" \"perform,\" or \"provide\" a treatment. Moreover, other rules use an even greater variety of words to describe the relationship between a provider and treatments. See, e.g., Minn. R. 5221.6050, subps. 1(B) (\"provide\"). Given the variety of ways that the rules describe the relationship between a provider and the treat-ment at issue, the role of a provider in rule 5221.6040, subpart 10, cannot be read narrowly. See Johnson , 926 N.W.2d at 420 (adopting an interpreta- 23a tion that made sense \"in lig ht of the other language\" in the rule). At the very least, a provider must include one who \"provides\" a treatment, which means \"to supply or make [that treatment] available.\" Provide , ed. 1996). Unquestion ably, Dr. Coetzee is a healthcare provider because he is an experienced surgeon. Although Dr. Coetzee did not prescribe Bierbach's medical cannabis, he certified that Bier- bach has a qualifying condition, which is a prerequi- site to participating in the state's medical cannabis program. Accordingly, Dr. Coetzee's certification made medical cannabis available to Bierbach. And similar to a prescription that may be valid for only a fixed period of time, Bierbach is required to seek re-certification from a do ctor Minn. Stat. \u00a7 3(b). I ther efore conclude that the requirement of the definition is satisfied. 2. Digger's Polaris next argues that medical cannabis is not a medically necessary treatment because no amount of medical cannabis is \"consistent with the current accepted standards of practice.\" It argues that because doctors cannot lawfully prescribe medical cannabis, no accepted standards of practice could have developed. For the same reason, Digger's Polaris insists that any amount of medical cannabis is excessive. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.136, subd. 2 (permitting an employer or insurer to refuse to pay an \"excessive\" fee, including a charge for a service that is \"provided at a level, duration, or frequency that is excessive, based upon accepted medical standards\"). Bierbach responds that the accepted standards of practice are the requirements for participating in the state's medical cannabis program. By finding that 24a medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary for him, the compensation judge impliedly found that using medical cannabis to manage intractable pain is consistent with accepted standards of practice. Accordingly, I must determine whether this implied finding is \"manifestly contrary to the evidence.\" Pelowski , 627 N.W.2d at 92. The requirements for participating in the state's medical cannabis program do not reveal the accepted standards of medical practice because the Legislature, not medical professionals, established a research program. Nevertheless, other evidence in the record adequately supports the co mpensation judge's implied finding that treating intractable pain with medical cannabis is consistent with accepted medical standards. The compensation judge's finding is supported by various parts of each expert's opinion. Dr. Coetzee and Dr. Meyer agreed that medical professionals are reasonably certain that medical cannabis is safer than opioids for long-term use to treat chronic pain. Although Dr. Meyer opined that the objective medi- cal data in support of medi cal cannabis is \"controver- sial\" and does not himself support the use of medical cannabis for pain management, he acknowledged the significant anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of medical cannabis for that purpose. In addition, Dr. Coetzee opined with \"a reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that medical cannabis is an \"appropriate medication\" for Bierbach's intractable pain, relying on two articles that he in terprets as showing that medical cannabis is currently replacing opioids as a safer treatment alternative. Dr. Coetzee's position is seemingly corroborated by the author of one of those articles, who, according to Dr. Coetzee, strongly encouraged patients to talk with their doctors about 25a using medical cannabis instead of opioids for manag- ing long-term pain. Digger's Polaris and amici curiae cite to publicly available studies or report s concerning the use of medical cannabis to treat pain.9 For example, Digger's Polaris points to findings by Congress and the Drug Enforcement Agency that use of cannabis to treat medical conditions lacks acceptance in the United States. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1)(B); Denial of Petition to Initiate Proceedings to Reschedule Mari-juana, 81 Fed. Reg. 53767 (A ug. 12, 2016). Digger's Polaris also cites to reports that conclude the clinical evidence supporting the use of medical cannabis to treat pain is weak. See, e.g., Mary Butler, Ph.D., M.B.A., et al. Office of Medical Cannabis, Minn. Dep't of Health, Medical Cannabis for Non-Cancer Pain: A Systematic Review 24 (undated) (concluding that the medical literature studying the use of medical cannabis to treat chronic non-cancer pain \"is sparse, patchy, of low quality, and leads to generally insufficient evidence for most patient populations and treatments\"). On the other hand, amicus curiae Minnesota Association for Justice cites to a 2018 study stating that medical cannabis has been an effective alternative to opioids for pain relief for 9 W e m a y t a k e j u d i c i a l n o t i c e o f g o v e r n m e n t w e b s i t e s a n d commissioned studies even though not part of the record below. See State v. Jobe , 486 N.W.2d 407, 420 n.3 (Minn. 1992) (taking judicial notice of a report issued by the Committee on DNA Technology in Forensic Science of the National Research Council); Missourians for Fiscal Ac countability v. Klahr , 830 F.3d 789, 793 (8th Cir. 2016) (recognizing that a court may take judicial notice of government websites). Because Bierbach did not object to the request of Digger's Polaris for judicial notice, I consider the government source s cited by Digger's Polaris and amici curiae. 26a patients in the state's medical cannabis research program. Press Release, Minn. Dep't of Health, Medical Cannabis Study Shows Significant Number of Patients Saw Pain Reduction of 30 Percent or More (Mar. 1, 2018). Notably, Dr. Coetzee's opinion and the study cited by amicus curiae Minnesota Association for Justice in support of the use of medical cannabis to treat pain are more recent than the report cited by Digger's Polaris to assert that the data is sparse and of low quality. Although the evidence is mixed, I conclude that substantial evidence supports a finding that using medical cannabis for intractable pain relief as an alternative to opioids is consistent with accepted standards of practice. Accordingly, the compensation judge's finding is not manifestly contrary to the evidence and deserves deference. Oseland , 928 N.W.2d at 755. C. I turn now to the question of whether medical can- nabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's pain under the facts of this case. Digger's Polaris challenges the evidentiary basis for the compensation judge's finding that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Bierbach's intractable pain. Bierbach responds that the record contains ample evidence to support the compensation judge's finding, including Bierbach's treatmen t records, his testimony, and Dr. Coetzee's opinion. Again, I must defer to the findings of the compensati on judge unless they are manifestly contrary to the evidence. Pelowski , 627 N.W.2d at 92. The record contains substantial evidence that medical cannabis is appropriate to treat Bierbach's pain. Digger's Polaris does not dispute that he has 27a intractable pain and that traditional treatments, including icing, ankle injections, and over-the- counter anti-inflammatories are no longer adequate for managing the pain from his degenerative ankle condition. Digger's Polaris also does not deny that an ankle-replacement surgery is inappropriate for Bierbach at this time because of his age. In addition, Dr. Coetzee opined with a reasonable degree of cer-tainty that medical cannabis is appropriate to treat Bierbach's pain, and Dr. Meyer agreed that cannabis is safer than opioids for lo ng-term use. Further, not only does the record contain evidence that medical cannabis is necessary, it also shows that medical cannabis is helping Bierbac h live a full life. Dr. Coetzee opined that he responded well to medical cannabis, and the compensation judge was persuaded by Bierbach's testimony that using medical cannabis reduces his pain and allows him to continue in a full-time job that requires him to be on his feet for many hours. This evidence is adequate to support the finding of the compensation judge. Digger's Polaris contends th at Bierbach's use is not reasonable because it is not limited by any external constraint. It points out that his cannabis dosage more than doubled in his first year of use and that he testified he would buy even more if he could afford it. This concern is understandable but overstated. That Bierbach's use double d during the first year sounds extreme, but it likely reflects that he eased into the new treatment and increased his dosage when he found it effective and could afford more. In addition, the requirement that a doctor must recertify his participation in the program every year places constraints on his usage. In any event, I need not speculate about Bierbach's future use. The compensation judge's order does not 28a require Digger's Polaris to give him a blank check. The order requires only that it reimburse him for purchases that he had already made. Whether Dig- ger's Polaris has a statutory obligation to reimburse Bierbach for purchases made after the date of the order will depend on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of those purchases, which may change as his condition changes and as research develops. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.25, subd. 2 (requiring the commissioner of health to \"review and publicly report the existing medical and scientific literature regarding the range of recommended dosages for each qualifying condition\" and to update the infor- mation annually). At any time, Digger's Polaris is free to withhold payment for treatment that becomes unreasonable, unnecessary, or excessive. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.136, subd. 2. For present purposes, the compensation judge determined that Bierbach's use was reasonable and necessary and should be reimbursed, and I see no clear error in the judge's finding. IV. In sum, I would hold that the order of the compensation judge for Digger's Polaris to reimburse Bierbach for his purchases of medical cannabis is supported by substantial evidence and is not preempted. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals upholding that order. Be cause the court's decision overextends the preemptive reach of federal law and denies Bierbach reimbursement for the best means of managing his pain ful, work-related injury while staying meaningfully employed, I respectfully dissent. 29a STATE OF MINNESOTA IN SUPREME COURT _______________ A20-1551 SUSAN K. MUSTA , Respondent , v. MENDOTA Relators . _______________ Filed: October 13, 2021 _______________ OPINION ANDERSON, Justice. The question presented here is whether the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801- 971, which makes the possession of cannabis a fed- eral crime, preempts provisions of the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act that make an employer liable for an injured employee's cost of treating a work-related injury. More specifically, does the stat- utory requirement for an employer to \"furnish any medical . . . treatment,\" reasonably necessary a work-related injury, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1 (2020), conflict with federa l law that prohibits the possession of cannabis when the employer would be required to pay for the expense of treatment using medical cannabis? If federal law preempts state law 30a in this specific instance, then an employer cannot be ordered to reimburse an injured employee for the cost of medical cannabis used to treat the effects of a work-related injury. Respondent Susan Musta was injured while work- ing for her employer, relator Mendota Heights Den- tal Center (Mendota Height s). After multiple rounds of medical intervention were unsuccessful, Musta's doctor certified her for participation in Minnesota's medical cannabis program. Musta then sought reimbursement for the cost of the medical cannabis from Mendota Heights, which agrees that medical cannabis is a reasonable an d necessary treatment for Musta's chronic pain. Mendota Heights asserted, however, that the federal prohibition in the CSA on the possession of cannabis preempts the requirement under Minnesota's workers' compensation laws for an employer to pay for an injured employee's medical treatment when that treatment is medical cannabis. The Workers Compensation Court of Appeals (WCCA) declined to address the preemption argument, concluding that it did not have the subject matter jurisdiction to do so, and then upheld the compensa- tion judge's order requiring Mendota Heights to reimburse Musta for medical cannabis. We conclude that the WCCA lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine the preemption issue presented in this case beca use it requires the inter- pretation and application of federal law. We further conclude that the CSA preempts an order made under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1, that obligates an employer to reimburse an employee for the cost of medical cannabis because compliance with that order would expose the employer to criminal liability under federal law for aiding and abetting Musta's unlawful possession of cannabis. We therefore reverse the 31a decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals. FACTS Musta was employed by Mendota Heights1 as a dental hygienist when she suffered a work-related neck injury in February 2003. Musta received conservative care, including chiropractic treatment, medication management, physical therapy, and injection therapy. She th en underwent surgery in November 2003 and August 2006, which provided some temporary relief. She was ultimately prescribed medication to manage the continuing pain, including Vicodin and fentanyl. In late 2009, Musta discontin- ued using narcotics to trea t her pain because of the side effects. At this po int, Musta was permanently and totally disabled. In April 2019, after she was certified as eligible to participate in the state's medical cannabis program, Musta began using medical cannabis, in compliance with the THC Therapeutic Research Act (THC Act), Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 152.21-.37 (2020), to treat her work- related injury. She then requested reimbursement for the cost of that treatment from Mendota Heights under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1 (2020). In the proceedings before the compensation judge, the parties stipulated that Musta's use of medical cannabis complies with the THC Act and is reason- able, medically necessary, and causally related to her work injury. Mendota Heights opposed Musta's request for reimbursement, however, asserting before the compensation judge that paying for someone to possess cannabis is prohibited by federal law, 1 The insurer for Mendota Heights is relator Hartford Insur- ance Group, and to collectively as \"Mendota Heights.\" 32a specifically the CSA. Thus, the sole issue before the workers' compensation judge was whether the CSA preempts the employer reimbursement requirement in Minnesota's workers' compensation laws when that reimbursement is for medical cannabis. Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance\u2014 the most restrictive leve l\u2014and therefore cannot be lawfully prescribed. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c)(c)(10). Federal law provides that a Schedule I controlled substance has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and lacks accepted safety for use of the substance under medical supervision. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1). The CSA makes it a federal crime to possess a controlled substance knowingly or inten-tionally without a valid prescription. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). 2 Anyone guilty of such an offense may be sentenced up to one year in prison and fined at least $1,000. Id. And anyone who aids and abets a federal crime is liable to the same extent as the principal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). The compensation judge declined to resolve the issue of preemption, recommending instead to the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the question be certified to us. The Chief ALJ did so, but we declined to accept the certified question, stating that \"the legal issue presented by this workers' compensation matter is best addressed through the decision process 2 Under Minnesota's THC Act, a physician does not prescribe medical cannabis for a patient's medical condition; rather, the physician determines whether the patient \"suffers from a quali-fying medical condition,\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.28, subd. 1(a)(1), which if found allows the patient to apply for enrollment in the medical cannabis program, see Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 Dental Ctr. , No. A19-1365, Order at 2 (Minn. filed Oct. 16, 2019). On remand, the compensation judge then analyzed the preemption issue. The judge observed that use of medical cannabis is legal under Minnesota law, and nothing in the workers' compensation laws prohibits reimbursement for medical cannabis when used to treat a work-related injury. Further, the judge noted that ongoing congressional appropriations riders prohibit the United States Department of Justice from criminally prosecuting an act that is compliant with a state's medical cannabis laws. The compensa- tion judge stated that a federal prosecution would \"prevent Minnesota from implementing its own laws\" regarding medical cannabis use. Thus, the compen- sation judge concluded, there was no risk that Mendota Heights would be criminally prosecuted under federal law, and th erefore no preemptive conflict between federal law and Minnesota law existed. Mendota Heights was accordingly required to reimburse Musta for her medical cannabis expenses. The Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals affirmed. Musta v. Mendota Heights Dental Ctr., No. WC19-6330, 2020 WL (Minn. WCCA Nov. 10, 2020). The WCCA co ncluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the preemption issue because it \"would need to interpret and apply laws beyond the Workers' Compensation Act and beyond [its] limited jurisdiction.\" Id. at *3. Instead, the WCCA believed that the preemption issue was \"best addressed by a court of broader jurisdiction.\" Id. Thus, the court rejected the compensation judge's analysis on that issue and struck certain findings made regarding federal law. But, concluding that the legal question\u2014the employer's reimbursement 34a liability\u2014could be resolved based on the stipulated facts and the remaining findings, the WCCA affirmed the award of reimbursement. Mendota Heights appealed to us by writ of certiorari. ANALYSIS This case presents two issues. First, we must determine whether the WCCA correctly concluded that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether federal law\u2014the CSA\u2014preempts Minnesota law that requires an employer to reimburse an employee for treatment of a work-related injury. Second, we must determine whether the CSA preempts the requirement in Minnesota law for an employer to reimburse an injured employee for the cost of medical treatment when the treatment for which payment is sought is medical cannabis. I. We begin with jurisdiction. \"The subject matter jurisdiction of the workers' compensation courts is a question of law,\" which we review de novo. Giersdorf v. A & M Constr., Inc. , 820 N.W.2d 16, 20 (Minn. 2012). \"Subject matter jurisd iction is the court's authority to hear the type of dispute at issue and to grant the type of relief sought.\" Seehus v. Bor-Son Constr., Inc. (Minn. 2010). The WCCA \"is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, restricted by statute to the construction and application of the Workers' Compensation Act.\" 3 Hagen v. Venem , 366 N.W.2d 280, 283 (Minn. 1985); see also Minn. Stat. 3 A compensation judge decides questions of fact and law to make \"an award or disallowance of compensation\" based on the pleadings. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.371 (2020); see also Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.291(a) (2020) (allowing a party to initiate a proceeding by filing a petition when \"there is a dispute as to a question of law or fact in connection with a claim for compensation\"). 35a \u00a7 175A.01, subd. 5 (stating that the WCCA has juris- diction over \"questions of law and fact arising under the workers' compensation laws of the state\"). The WCCA's \"powers are plenary\" in cases arising under the Workers' Compensation Act, allowing that court to hear and determine the legal and factual questions presented by a case appealed to that court. Hagen , 366 N.W.2d at 283. The WCCA may decide certain questions ancillary to the employee's compensation claim, such as deter- mining insurance coverage, Giersdorf , 820 N.W.2d at 20-21; awarding certain fees and Botler v. Wagner Greenhouses , 754 N.W.2d 665, 668-70 (Minn. 2008); and determining a guaranty association, Seehus , 783 N.W.2d at 151-52. The WCCA may also look to the laws of other states and federal law \"for instruction\" in narrow circumstances. See Sundby v. City of St. Peter , 693 N.W.2d 206, 215- 16 (Minn. 2005) (holding that the WCCA could look to the Social Security Act for instruction because the workers' compensation provision at issue was a means for coordinating workers' compensation bene- fits with the social security system, and the WCCA \"neither construed nor applied federal law\"). The WCCA is not authorized, however, \"to consider questions of law arising under the workers' compen- sation statutes of other states.\" Martin v. Morrison Trucking, Inc. , 803 N.W.2d 365, 369 (Minn. 2011). The WCCA similarly may not \"construe Minnesota statutes other than the Minnesota Act.\" Id. And its jurisdiction \"does not extend to interpreting or apply-ing legislation designed specially for the handling of claims outside the workers' compensation system.\" Sundby , 369-70 (disting uishing between the WCCA's statutory authority to order reimbursement to a no- 36a fault insurance carrier and the WCCA's lack of juris- diction to construe statutes other than those govern- ing workers' compensation claims). Mendota Heights asserts that this is a case \"arising under\" Minnesota's workers' compensation laws, and because the WCCA may hear and determine \"all questions of law and fact\" in such cases, the court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue. Mendota Heights emphasizes that requiring the preemption issue to be decided by a district court, while the merits of the workers' compensation action are decided by the compensation courts, would result in case-splitting and squander judicial resources with parallel proceedings. It cites to our decision in In re McCannel , 301 N.W.2d 910, 920 (Minn. 1980), in which we held that the tax court may decide constitutional claims in some instances. Mendota Heights asserts that the tax court's juris- dictional statute and that of the WCCA use \"sub- stantively identical language,\" while noting that McCannel was decided one year before the statute establishing the WCCA's jurisdiction was enacted. 4 Musta responds that deciding the preemption issue would require the WCCA to interpret federal civil and criminal law as well as the statutes that govern Minnesota's THC Act, all of which are outside the scope of Minnesota's workers' compensation laws. Thus, she maintains, the WCCA did not have the necessary jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue 4 Mendota Heights also suggests that the WCCA's refusal to decide the jurisdictional question was a denial of due process. We need not decide this issue because we have resolved the preemption issue in favor of Mendota Heights. See, e.g., State v. N. Star Rsch. & Dev. Inst. , 294 Minn. 56, 200 N.W.2d 410, 425 (1972) (stating that we do not \"decide important constitutional questions unless it is necessary to do so\"). 37a in this case given our consistent conclusion that the WCCA does not have the authority to interpret the laws of other jurisdictions or other Minnesota statutes. We agree with Musta. Although Musta's claim certainly arises under Minnesota's workers' compen- sation law\u2014she seeks only reimbursement for the medical treatment she now uses, see Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (r including medicines\")\u2014the precise the WCCA falls squarely outside of workers' compensa-tion laws: does federal la w, properly interpreted, preempt the broad requirement in section 176.135 for employers to reimburse injured employees for \"any\" medical treatment, including when the treatment at issue is medical cannabis. The Legislature has described the WCCA's jurisdiction over legal ques- tions as specific to those \" arising under the workers' compensation laws \" of Minnesota. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 175A.01, subd. 5 (emphasis added). By requiring an interpretation and analysis of federal law, the preemption issue presented in this case does not arise under Minnesota's workers' compensation laws; it arises under federal law and legal principles that govern statutory interpretati on when resolving claims of alleged conflicts between state and federal laws. See, e.g., In re Est. of Barg , 752 N.W.2d 52, 63 (Minn. 2008) (explaining the importance of congressional intent and purpose in a preemption inquiry based on federal law). Indeed, we have consistently held that when resolution of an issue would require the WCCA to interpret and apply, not merely look to, the laws of another sovereign, the WCCA is without jurisdiction to do so. See Martin , 803 N.W.2d at 371; Hale v. 38a Viking Trucking Co. , 654 N.W.2d 119, 124 (Minn. 2002). For example, in Sundby , the WCCA held that children's benefits under Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) should be included in reducing an employer's payment of workers' compensation bene- fits. 693 N.W.2d at 213. We affirmed that decision, observing that the Workers' Compensation Act expressly permits \"any government disability benefits\" in the offset. Id. at 211 (citing Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.101, subd. 4 (2004)). Although we noted that \"[t]he WCCA's jurisdiction does not extend to interpreting or applying legislation designed specially for the handling of claims outside the workers' compensation system,\" we concluded that the WCCA had merely looked to federal law to ultimately \"ascertain[] the appropriate inclusion of SSDI benefits in the work- ers' compensation benefits offset calculation\" under Minnesota's workers' compensation laws. Id. at 215. Here, the WCCA correctly recognized that, consistent with our statement in Sundby , deciding the preemp- tion issue would impermissibly require Mendota Heights contends that our order denying certification, which cited the decision process provid- ed for in Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.322 (2020) (authorizing a decision based on stipulated facts), reflected our expectation that the compensation judge or the WCCA would decide the preemption issue on the merits. We disagree. In denying certification, we relied primarily on the principle that certification is not a substitute for the normal appellate process, even for important and doubtful questions. See Musta v. Mendota He ights Dental Ctr. , No. A19-1365, Order at 1-2 (Minn. filed Oc t. 16, 2019) (stating that \"'not every vexing question is important and doubt- 39a ful' and questions of first impression are not alone sufficient 'to justify certification as doubtful.'\" (quot- ing Emme v. C.O.M.B., Inc. , 418 N.W.2d 176, 179-80 (Minn. 1988))). Finally, our decision in McCannel does not support the conclusion that the WCCA has subject matter jurisdiction over the preemption issue presented here. In McCannel , we noted that \"[a]s a general rule, administrative agencies lack the power to declare legislation unconstitutional\" and that \"[i]nstead, these issues must be raised in a court of the judiciary.\" 301 N.W.2d at 919. Nevert heless, we recognized the importance of allowing the tax court to operate \"effectively and expeditiously\" by deciding all issues presented by the case. Id. at 920. Thus, when a constitutional issue is presented in a tax dispute, we noted, the tax court could \"acquire jurisdiction in the first instance through transfers of cases from the district court, which does have the jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of legislative acts.\" Id. at 919 (emphasis added); see Guilliams v. Comm'r of Revenue , 299 N.W.2d 138, 139 n.1 (Minn. 1980) (noting that the tax court has jurisdiction over a constitutional claim when the claim is raised \"in the first instance . . . in the district court before the case is transferred to the tax court\"); see also Erie Mining Co. v. Comm'r of Revenue , 343 N.W.2d 261, 264 (Minn. 1984) (explaining that because the tax court does not have \"original jurisdiction to decide consti- tutional issues,\" it must \"refer the constitutional question to the district court,\" which can choose to \"refer the matter back to th e tax court which will then have subject matter jurisdiction\" over that issue). No one contends that a district court conferred its origi-nal jurisdiction over the preemption issue presented here on the compensation judge or the WCCA. Thus, 40a the general rule stated in McCannel \u2014constitutional issues must be decided by \"a court of the judiciary\" rather than an executive branch agency\u2014controls here, rather than the process used in tax cases to secure a district court's jurisdiction over a constitu-tional claim. See Irwin v. Surdyk's Liquor , 599 N.W.2d 132, 139-40 (Minn. 1999) (acknowledging that the WCCA does not have subject matter jurisdiction over constitutional claims). We have reiterated that the statutory jurisdiction of the compensation courts does not extend to inter- pretation of laws outside of legal questions and facts arising under the workers' compensation law. 5 See Martin , 803 N.W.2d at 371 (holding that WCCA lacked jurisdiction to declare insurance contract invalid under Wisconsin law); see also Freeman v. Armour Food Co. , 380 N.W.2d 816, 820 (Minn. 1986); Taft v. Advance United Expressways , 464 N.W.2d 725, 727 (Minn. 1991). Consequently, we hold that the WCCA lacks jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempts Minnesota law that requires an employer to \"furnish\" medical treatment when the treatment for which reimbursement is sought is medical cannabis. II. Having concluded that the WCCA correctly deter- mined that it lacks jurisdiction over the preemption issue in this case, we no w turn to that issue. See Gist 5 When a case requires \"judicial construction\" of a statute outside of workers' compensation laws, the remedy is to bring \"a declaratory judgment action in district court.\" Taft v. Advance United Expressways , 464 N.W.2d 725, 727 (Minn. 1991). Although Mendota Heights is correct that requiring a district court to determine a preemption issue may be an inefficient use of judicial resources, efficiency does not permit the WCCA to exceed the carefully defined limits of its specialized jurisdiction. 41a v. Atlas Staffing, Inc. , 910 N.W.2d 24, 31-33 (Minn. 2018) (deciding a preemption issue under federal Medicaid and Medicare law that was not addressed by the WCCA, which concluded that it lacked juris- diction over that issue); see also In re Lauritsen , 99 Minn. 313, 109 N.W. 404, 407- 08 (1906) (recognizing that \"a court of final reso rt\" can provide \"peremptory and prompt relief\"). Preemption of a state law by federal law is based on the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. See Gist , 910 N.W.2d at 33; see also Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U.S. 1, 29, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (stating th at when \"there is any conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall prevail\"). \"Preemption is primarily an issue of statutory interpretation, which is subject to de novo review.\" DSCC v. Simon , 950 N.W.2d 280, 287 (Minn. 2020) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"In all preemption cases, and partic- ularly those in which Congress has legislated in a field that the states have traditionally occupied\"\u2014like workers' compensation\u2014we begin \"with the as- sumption that the historic police powers of the states were not superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" Gretsch v. Vantium Cap., Inc. , 846 N.W.2d 424, 433 (Minn. 2014). Accordingly, \"preemption is generally disfavored.\" Id. At issue here is conflict preemption, which may occur when it is impossible to comply with both state law and federal law (impossibility preemption) or when the state law stands as an impermissible obstacle to a ccomplishing the objectives of the federal law (obstacle preemption). DSCC , 950 N.W.2d at 288. \"Congressional purpose is the ultimate touchstone\" of our inquiry into preemption by federal law. Barg , 42a 752 N.W.2d (citation omitted) (internal tion marks omitted). \"The main objectives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and control the legiti- mate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.\" Raich , 545 U.S. at 12, 125 S.Ct. 2195. And \"Congress was particularly concerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit chan-nels.\" Id. at 12-13, 125 S.Ct. 21 95. The CSA explicitly defines the scope of its pr eemptive reach. A state law is preempted by the CS A only when \"there is a positive conflict between\" a provision of the CSA and that state law \"so that the two cannot consistently stand together.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 903. This provision \"is an express invocation of conflict preemption.\" Or. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enf't Admin. , 860 F.3d 1228, 1236 (9th Cir. 2017). Mendota Heights contends that it is not possible to comply with both state and federal law because if it complies with the order made under the Minnesota workers' compensation law to reimburse Musta for the medical cannabis expens e, then Mendota Heights cannot comply with the federal prohibition against aiding and abetting the possession of cannabis. See Rosemond v. United States , 572 U.S. 65, 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014) (\"[A] person aids and abets a crime when (in addition to taking the requisite act) he intends to facilitate that offense's commission.\"). Stated anot her way, Mendota Heights asserts that compelling it, by judicial order, to reimburse Musta for medical cannabis \"require[d it] to commit a federal crime.\" Mendota Heights relies on the decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court case Bourgoin v. Twin Rivers Paper Co., LLC , which held that the CSA preempts an order to reimburse an employee for medical cannabis under the Maine workers' compensation laws because that order 43a required the employer to \"engage in conduct that would violate the CSA.\" 187 A.3d 10, 20 (Me. 2018). Mendota Heights also argues that the likelihood of prosecution for violating the CSA\u2014minimal or other- wise\u2014is a legally irrelevant factor in the preemption analysis. In response, Musta contends that Congress has demonstrated an intent to not obstruct state medical cannabis programs by annually prohibiting the Unit-ed States Department of Ju stice from spending funds to prosecute persons who use medical cannabis consistent with their state's laws. She relies on decisions from state courts that have found no conflict between the federal law an d state law requirements to reimburse for medical cannabis, including the dis- senting opinion in Bourgoin , 187 A.3d at 23 (Jabar, J., dissenting). Finally, Musta asserts that Mendota Heights cannot be deemed to aid and abet her possession of cannabis because the crime of posses-sion has already occurred, a completed crime cannot be aided and abetted, and Mendota Heights does not possess the specific intent required for aiding and abetting. We acknowledge that this issue represents a unique and challenging intersection between the law of preemption, federal aiding and abetting jurispru-dence, the ongoing tension between the states and the federal government regarding cannabis regula- tion, and the objectives of the Minnesota workers' compensation system. But we are not the first state court of last resort to decide this specific issue. Thus, we begin with the decisions that have already addressed the preemptive effect of the CSA on orders for reimbursement of medical cannabis made under state workers' compensation laws. 44a In Bourgoin , the Maine Supreme Judicial Court was the first state supreme court to decide a preemp-tion challenge in the context of employer reimburse- ment for workers' co mpensation benefits. Id. at 19- 20. As here, an employee sought reimbursement from the employer for medical cannabis, which was used to treat a work-r elated injury. Id. at 13. The employer opposed the reimbursement request, asserting that, even if the employee's medical cannabis use is permitted by state law, requiring the employer to pay for it is barred by federal law. Id. The Bourgoin court concluded that a right provided by state law to use medical cannabis \"cannot be converted into a sword that would require\" an employer \"to engage in conduct that would violate the CSA.\" Id. at 20. The court recognized that an employer would be liable under federal law on an aiding and abetting theory because the employer\u2014required to reimburse the employee for his use of medical cannabis\u2014would be \"acting with knowledge that it was subsidizing Bourgoin's purchase of marijuana.\" Id. at 19. On the other hand, the employer would violate state law if it refused to reimburse the employee. Id. The Bourgoin court therefore concluded that \"[c]ompliance with [state and federal law] is an impossibility.\" Id.; see also Wright's Case , 486 Mass. 98, 156 N.E.3d 161, 166 (2020) (stating that a state may \"authorize those who want to use medical marijuana . . . to do so and assume the potential risk of Federal prosecution,\" but it is \"quite another\" thing for the state \"to require unwilling third parties to pay for such use and risk such prosecution\"). 6 6 The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded in this case that an employer is not required to reimburse an employee for medical cannabis us ed to treat a work-related 45a Two state supreme courts have reached a different conclusion. In Appeal of Panaggio , 174 N.H. 89, --- A.3d --- (2021), the New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected the conclusion reached by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in Bourgoin \u2014that the employer would be criminally liable under federal law, 187 A.3d at 19\u2014stating that federal law \"does not criminalize the act of insurance reimbursement for an employee's purchase of medical marijuan a.\" 174 N.H. at ---, --- A.3d ---. The Panaggio court concluded instead that the employer lacked the requisite mens rea for an aiding and abetting offense under federal law because the employer's reimbursement is compelled by state law, rather than voluntary participation in an offense. Id. at ---, --- A.3d ---. Thus, the court concluded, it was not impossible to comply with both state and federal law. Id. 7 The New Jersey Supreme Court reached the same conclusion, though on different reasoning, in Hager v. M&K Construction , 246 N.J. 1, 247 A. 3d 864 (2021). Looking to \"appropriations acts as expressions of legislative intent,\" id. at 885, the Hager court observed that \"Congress has, for seven consecutive fiscal years, injury, based on language in that state's medical cannabis law that relieves \"any health in surance provider\" from a reim- bursement obligation. 156 N.E.3d at 172, 175. 7 The Panaggio court also analyzed, then rejected, obstacle preemption, stating that \"the CSA does not make it illegal for an insurer to reimburse an em ployee\" for medical cannabis, \"does [not] purport to regulate insurance practices in any manner,\" and the reimbursement order \"does not interfere with the federal government's ability to enforce the CSA\" by prose- cuting the employee for possession. Id. at ---, --- A.3d ---. Because we conclude that the CSA preempts the order for reimbursement under the impossibility theory of conflict preemption, we need not\u2014and decline to\u2014analyze the obstacle theory of conflict preemption. 46a prohibited the [Department of Justice] from using funds to interfere with state medical marijuana laws through appropriations riders.\" Id. at 886. The court concluded that this \"clear, volitional act in the form of appropriations law takes precedence over\" the CSA. Id. at 887. Thus, there was no conflict between federal and state law, and state law did not stand as \"an obstacle\" to congressional objectives. Id. Apart from the workers' compensation context, courts have found preemption by the CSA in some situations, and no conflict or preemption in others. Compare Garcia v. Tractor Supply Co. , 154 F. Supp.3d 1225, 1229-30 (D.N .M. 2016) (concluding that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee's use of medical cannabis as a matter of state law), and Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor & Indus. , 348 Or. 159, 230 P.3d 518, 536 (2010) (concluding that portion of Oregon law governing use of medical cannabis is preempted by CSA), with White Mountain Health Ctr., Inc. v. Maricopa Cnty. , 241 Ariz. 230, 386 P.3d 416, 432-33 (Ct. App. 2016) (concluding that requiring county to process application for medical cannabis provider as directed by state zoning law is not preempted by CSA), and Ter Beek v. City of Wyoming , 495 Mich. 1, 846 N.W.2d 531, 537-41 (2014) (holding that immu- nity provision in Michigan medical cannabis law is not preempted by CSA). We ultimately agree with the reasoning set forth by the Maine Supreme Judi-cial Court in Bourgoin : the CSA preempts mandated reimbursement of an employee's medical cannabis purchases under an impossibility theory of conflict preemption. Specifically, we agree that a right pro- vided to an individual under Minnesota's workers' compensation law to secure reimbursement for the use of medical cannabis to treat a diagnosed medical 47a condition cannot be \"converted into a sword that\" requires an employer to pay for those purchases and thus \"engage in conduct that would violate the CSA.\" 187 A.3d at 20. We recognize that the fede ral government's position on criminal prosecution of cannabis offenses has been in a state of flux for over a decade. At one point, the United States Department of Justice announced that it would not prosecute cannabis offenses under the CSA when a cannabis user complies with state law; but the Department later rescinded those directions. See Hager , 247 A.3d at 882-83. Further, Congress has prohibited the Department of Justice from using allocated funds to prevent states from implementing medical cannabis laws. Id. at 883-84. We disagree with the Hager court that these actions\u2014and the congressional appropriation riders in particular\u2014suspend the illegality of cannabis under the CSA or take precedence over that law. See id. at 887. Repeal by implication is heavily disfavored, especially when \"the subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure.\" Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill , 437 U.S. 153, 190, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed .2d 117 (1978) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Ninth Circuit observed in United States v. McIntosh , the appropriation riders \"do[] not provide immunity from 833 F.3d 1163, 1179 n.5 (9th Cir. 2016). The riders are merely temporary measures that can be rescinded at any time, thus allowing the government to \"prose-cute individuals who committed offenses while the government lacked funding .\" Id. (emphasis added); see also Bourgoin , 187 A.3d at (reject- ing reliance on the Department's nonenforcement memorandum because it was a \"transitory\" policy, as evidenced by its later revocation by Attorney General Sessions). 48a Nor can we agree that, as a practical matter, Mendota Heights is unlikel y to be prosecuted. Impossibility preemption does not turn on speculation about future prosecutorial decisions, but on whether compliance with both state and federal law is impos-sible. See DSCC , 950 N.W.2d at 288 . The conflict here is real, not speculative. See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Md. , 437 U.S. 117, 131, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978) (stating that a \"hypothetical conflict\" does not warrant preemption). Despite action in multiple states relating to medical cannabis and other cannabis-related issues, Congress has never chosen to de-schedule or re-schedule cannabis; it has instead used fundin g mechanisms to institute temporary, short-term stays of enforcement. Posses- sion of cannabis remains prohibited by the CSA, and we cannot read these riders as implicit suspensions of a legislative determination of illegality. Even setting aside the pr osecution risk, the heart of Musta's argument\u2014an order made under state law that compels reimbursement negates mens rea and the specific intent necessary to satisfy federal aiding and abetting\u2014is misplaced. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that compelling a person to act does not necessarily negate the actor's mens rea. See Dixon v. United States , 548 U.S. 1, 6-7, 126 S.Ct. 2437, 165 L.Ed.2d 299 (2006). Instead, necessity (like duress and self-defense) is an affirmative defense that goes to motive, not intent. Rosemond , 572 U.S. at 89, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (Alito, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (\"[O]ur cases have recognized that a lawful motive (such as necessity, du ress, or self-defense) is consistent with the mens rea necessary to satisfy a requirement of intent.\"). As the Rosemond Court put it, \"The law does not, nor should it, care whether [the 49a aider and abettor] participates with a happy heart or a sense of foreboding. Eith er way, he has the same culpability . .\" Id. at 79-80, 134 S.Ct. 1240.8 The intent requirement of federal aiding and abet- ting is satisfied \"when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense.\"9 Id. at 77, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Here, Mendota Heights is fully knowledgeable about the circumstances advanced by its compelled reimbursement: Musta's possession of cannabis that is unlawfu l under the CSA. This 8 The dissent brushes aside the distinction between intent and motive, claiming that the Rosemond Court rejected a simi- lar criticism when it held that a defendant must have \"advance knowledge\" of the presence of a firearm for the defendant to be guilty of aiding and abetting a crime involving the use of a firearm. 572 U.S. at 78, 134 S.Ct. 1240. The Rosemond Court reasoned that the \"distinctive intent standard for aiding and abetting\" cannot be satisfied when a defendant learns of the presence of the firearm \"only af ter he can realistically walk away.\" Id. at 81, 134 S.Ct. 1240 n.10. But this reasoning lends no support to the dissent's position because Mendota Heights unquestionably has advance knowledge of the underlying conduct that it would be aiding. 9 The Rosemond Court differentiated the knowledge and active participation that it found satisfied specific intent by describing the hypothetical case of a gun store owner \"who sells a firearm to a criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used.\" 572 U.S. at 77 n.8, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Several courts, including the Panaggio court, 174 N.H. at --- n. 1, --- A.3d ---, have read this footnote as descri bing a situation in which specific intent is lacking. But the very next sentence in the footnote explains: \"We express no view about what sort of facts, if any, would suffice to show that such a third party has the intent necessary to be convicted of aiding and abetting.\" Rosemond , 572 U.S. at 77 n.8, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Rather than explaining that this situation was not aiding and abetting, the Court merely described one situation in which it has not yet decided whether aiding and abetting was satisfied. 50a reimbursement, which Mend ota Heights must comply with as it is embedded in a judicial order, finances Musta's possession and effectively facilitates future possession. Thus, the order compels Mendota Heights' active participation in the possession that is criminalized by the CSA.10 Our conclusion finds support in federal case law. In Garcia , an employee was fired after testing posi- tive for cannabis despite informing his employer that he consumed medical cannabis to alleviate symptoms of HIV/AIDS. 154 F. Supp. 3d at 1226-27. The employee sued, alleging discrimination based on a medical condition under the New Mexico equivalent 10 The dissent offers several hypotheticals to challenge our application of the Rosemond framework. The first is an employee who informs her employer that her paycheck will be used to purchase cannabis. But this hypothetical fails to appre-ciate the close connection between the aid provided and the crime committed. In the case at issue here, the reimbursement ordered is explicitly and exclusively for cannabis. In the dis- sent's hypothetical, the paycheck can be, and indeed ordinarily is, used for any number of purchases wholly outside the control of the employer. The same is true with the bus driver hypothetical. The route driven is not solely for the benefit of a passenger to obtain cannabis, and the nexus between the transportation provided and results obtained is far weaker than the case here. The taxi driver hypothetical is a closer call. For a taxi driver to knowingly transport a passenger to a location to commit a crime may implicate aiding and abetting. Consider the counter- hypothetical where a passenger informs the taxi driver, \"I am going to rob a bank, wait for me outside so we can drive away afterwards.\" Setting aside affirmative defenses like duress, the taxi driver may be acting with full knowledge of the crime of robbery to be committed, an d the taxi driver knowingly transporting a person to a dispensary for the sole purpose of purchasing cannabis in violation of federal law may in fact be doing the same. 51a of the Minnesota Human Rights Act. Id. at 1227. The federal district court held that the employer was not required to accommodate the employee's use of medical cannabis. Id. at 1230. It concluded that, \"[t]o affirmatively require Tractor Supply to accom-modate Mr. Garcia's illegal drug use would mandate Tractor Supply to permit the very conduct the CSA proscribes.\" Id.; see also Emerald Steel Fabricators , 230 P.3d at 536 (concluding that the CSA preempted state law such that an employer was not prohibited from firing an employee for using medical cannabis). Although the district court in Garcia did not explic- itly find that the employer would be aiding and abet-ting the employee's possession of medical cannabis, the logic is the same: the state cannot force an em- ployer to facilitate an employee's unlawful possession of cannabis, either through work accommodations or reimbursement for its purchase. 11 We also reject Musta's argument and the dissent's conclusion that Mendota He ights cannot aid and abet her possession because that possession has already occurred by the time Mendota Heights reimburses her. Generally, \"a person cannot be found guilty of aiding and abetting a crime that has already been 11 The dissent criticizes our citation to Garcia because the implicit basis for that decision was obstacle preemption; and the case on which Garcia relies, Emerald Steel Fabricators , was decided explicitly under obstacle preemption. Garcia , 154 F.Supp.3d at 1230; Emerald Steel Fabricators , 230 P.3d at 536. But that fact alone does not undermine the persuasive nature of the analysis in those cases. And the case for preemption is i n d e e d s t r o n g e r h e r e b e c a u s e a n a c t u a l c o n f l i c t e x i s t s t h a t makes it impossible for Mendota Heights to comply with both federal and state law, as opposed to Garcia and Emerald Steel Fabricators , where compliance with state accommodations law was simply an obstacle to congressional purpose in enacting the federal prohibition on cannabis possession under the CSA. 52a committed.\" United States v. Hamilton , 334 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir. 2003). But \"aiding and abetting a drug offense may encompass activities, intended to ensure the success of the underlying crime, that take place after . . . the principa l no longer possesses States v. Ledezma , 26 F.3d 636, 643 (6th Cir. 1994). The same is true with money laundering, which o ccurs after the distribu- tion of illegal substances, but may nevertheless aid and abet the underlying crime because it is \" integral to the success of a drug venture.\" 12 United States v. Orozco-Prada , 732 F.2d 1076, 1080 (2d Cir. 1984). Although the compensation court's order does not require Mendota Heights to reimburse Musta on an ongoing basis, neither does that order limit Mendota Heights's reimbursement obligation to a one-time purchase. Musta obtained and possessed medical cannabis, and will continue to do so in the future, 13 based on the expectation that Mendota Heights's reimbursement obligation is established by state law. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a). 14 Indeed, the 12 Although Orozco-Prada was technically about conspiracy to aid and abet, in finding probable cause to support the conspiracy charge, the court implicitly recognized that aiding and abetting was also satisfied by the postdistribution act. See United States v. Perez , 922 F.2d 782, 786 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing Orozco-Prada in upholding a conviction of aiding and abetting illegal narcotics possession and distribution when the conduct at issue occurred after th e underlying possession). 13 Musta's qualifying condition under the THC act is chronic pain, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that she will purchase and possess medica l cannabis on only a single occasion. Quite the opposite, Musta had undergone extensive, unsuccessful medical intervention before she began using medi- cal cannabis, which appears to pr ovide her at least some relief. 14 It also strikes us as odd to suppose that Musta's first reimbursement of medical cannabi s would not be preempted by 53a entire purpose of reimbursement under our workers' compensation scheme is to fu lfill the legislative policy to provide injured employees with \"quick and efficient delivery of . . . medical benefits\" that are reasonable and necessary to treat the work-related injury. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.001 (2020). And as as medical cannabis remains \"reasonably . . . required\" to treat and cure the effects of Musta's injury, the Workers' Compensation Act requires Mendota Heights to fund Musta's ongoing use and possession that is illegal under federal law. Thus, we conclude that mandating Mendota Heights to pay for Musta's medical cannabis, by way of a court order, makes Mendota Heights criminally liable for aiding and abetting the possession of cannabis under federal law. 15 Finally, we note the argument by the dissent that preemption here frustrates the intention of the Legislature to make medical cannabis available to patients suffering from intractable pain. We agree th at if the result here is not beneficial to the employee, the remedy is for the CSA, but each subsequent request would be. Or similarly, that Musta's reimbursement would not be preempted because she can afford her medical canna bis while another employee's reimbursement would be preempte d if that employee could not afford the medical cannabis withou t reimbursement. It is far sounder, based on the expectations and obligations designed into our workers' compensation laws, to conclude that all of these reimbursements are preempted. 15 We note the constitutional danger lurking in Musta's argument that a state court order can negate the mens rea for a federal crime. Were we to adopt her reasoning, then a state could nullify any federal specific intent crime by simply passing legislation that mandates a person to perform the criminal act. Under our constitutional order, th at cannot be. To do so would undermine the entire purpose of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. 54a Congress to pass, and the President to sign, legisla- tion that addresses the preemption issues created by the conflict between federal and state law. As it is impossible to comply with both state and federal law, the compensation court's order is preempted by the CSA.16 Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals. 16 Because we conclude that the CSA preempts the order for reimbursement under impossibility preemption, we need not\u2014 and decline to\u2014analyze obstacle preemption. We note that there may be other legal theories under which the CSA preempts such an order, but we confine our analysis to the theories raised and argu ed by the parties. See State v. Caldwell , 803 N.W.2d 373, 382 n.3 (Minn. 2011). Although the dissent finds our interpretation of the intent standard for aiding and abetting liability to be \"expansive[]\" and \"troubling,\" our decision is based on the authoritative statements by the Rosemond Court, which itself reflects the uncertainty and breadth of accomplice liability in the law as it stands. See Stephen P. Garvey, Reading Rosemond , 12 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 233, 241 (2014) (stating that the Supreme Court's guidance on the mental state required for aiding and abetting liability \"is no model of clarity\" and offering three frameworks for interpreting Rosemond ); Lauren A. Newell, Hitting the Trip Wire: When Does a Company Become a \"Marijuana Business\"? , 101 B.U. L. Rev. 1105, 1131-32 (2 021) (explaining that the CSA \"casts a wide net of potential li ability\" and that the \"most diffi- cult cases\" involve potential liability under conspiracy or aiding and abetting theories). Consequently, we emphasize that our decision here finding preemption by the CSA is limited to the unique facts and setting of this dispute: a claim for reimbursement of medical expenses, incurred to treat a work-related injury, where the treatment for which the expense is incurred is the purchase and use of medical cannabis, wi th the reimbursement liability determined in a legal proceeding. We express no opinion on whether the CSA preempts any component of Minnesota's medical cannabis program, nor does our preemption decision here extend to any other form of medical treatment. 55a CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the workers' compensa tion court of appeals. Reversed. CONCURRENCE & DISSENT CHUTICH, Justice (concurring in part, dissenting in part). I agree with Part I of th e court's decision, which holds that the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether federal law preempts a provision of Minne- sota's workers' compensati on law that requires an employer to reimburse an employee who purchases medical cannabis. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (2020) . . treatment . . may reasonably be required\" to treat a work-r elated injury). I write separately because I disagree with the court's hold- ing in Part II that the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971, preempts an employer's obligation Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a), to reimburse an employee who buys medical cannabis that is reason- ably required to treat the employee's work-related injury. Because the court's conclusion that a conflict of law exists rests on an unduly expansive view of aiding and abetting liability, with the result of deny- ing injured employees reasonable and necessary medical treatment, 1 I respectfully dissent. 1 The parties stipulated that medical cannabis is reasonable and necessary to treat Must a's work-related injury. 56a Federal law establishes that a person who \"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\" the commission of a federal offense \"is punishable as a principal.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. As explained in Rosemond v. United States , 572 U.S. 65, 71, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), aiding and abetting has two elements. A person must carry out an \"affirmative act in furtherance of\" the crime with \"the intent of facilitating the offense's commission.\" Id. Reimburs- ing Musta for her prior purchase of cannabis pursu- ant to the order of the compensation judge satisfies neither element. Nor is Minnesota's workers' compensation law, Minn. St at. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a), an impermissible \"obstacle\" to the purposes of the Controlled Substances Act. I. I begin with the element of an affirmative act in furtherance of the crime. A defendant can be convicted of aiding and abetting without proof of participating in every aspect of the crime, but the defendant must have aided in some aspect of the crime. Rosemond , 572 U.S. not advance each element of the offense; all that matters is that they facilitated one component.\") . Accordingly, a person cannot aid and abet a crime after it is complete, as is well established. See United States v. Centeno , 793 F.3d 378, 390 (3d Cir. 2015); United States v. Figueroa-Cartagena , 612 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v. Hamilton , 334 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir. Delpit , 94 F.3d 1134, 1150-51 (8th Cir. 1996). Here, the compensation judge ordered relators Mendota Heights Dental Center and Hartford Insurance Group (collectivel y, Mendota Heights) to reimburse Musta for her prior purchase of medical 57a cannabis. Because that purchase and the related possession are already complete, reimbursing Musta now would not further any element of an offense of possession. See United States v. Ledezma , 26 F.3d 636, 642-43 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding that the evidence did not support an aiding and abetting conviction when the defendant entered the conspiracy after the illegal possession was complete). Consequently, Mendota Heights can comply with the reimburse- ment order without violating federal law. The court tries to circumvent the completed-crime rule in two ways. First, the court concludes that an exception to the rule applies, citing Ledezma . Under that exception, aiding and abetting drug offenses \"may encompass activities, intended to ensure the success of the underlying crime, that take place after . . . the principal no longer possesses the [illegal sub- stance].\" Id. at 643. But Ledezma recognized that exception in only two contexts. First, after-the-fact actions may be aiding and abetting when the crime is still on-going , such as when the drugs have changed hands but the money has not. Id. (citing United States v. Coady , 809 F.2d 119, 124 (1st Cir. 1987)). Second, after-the-fact measures may aid and abet when the defendant's action is a \"recurring contri-bution to a continuing crime,\" such as laundering money proceeds of a drug sale. Id. (citing United States v. Orozco-Prada , 732 F.2d 1076, 1080 (2d Cir. 1984)). Neither circumstance is present in this case. Unlike the transaction in Coady , Musta's purchase is already complete. So too is the related possession, o r a t l e a s t , i f o n g o i n g , i t w o u l d n o t b e a f f e c t e d b y any reimbursement now. And unlike Orozco-Prada , reimbursement after the fact is not \" integral to the success\" of unlawful possession in the same way that money-laundering is integral to a drug distribution 58a scheme. Orozco-Prada , 732 F.2d at 1080. After all, selling drugs is useless if the proceeds are unusable, but a person may find any number of ways to fund a purchase of medical cannabis. Here, Musta purchased the medical cannabis on her own without knowing whether she would ultimately be reimbursed. Second, the court relies heavily on Musta's expecta- tion of reimbursement and assumes that Musta will continue to buy medical cannabis with the expecta-tion of being reimbursed. But Musta's unilateral expectation does not extend the duration of a crime of possession after it is complete, at least when Men-dota Heights does not agree in advance to reimburse her. Mendota Heights has not stated that it will reimburse any future purchase, and whatever statu- tory obligation it may have to reimburse Musta in the future will depend on the facts and circumstances existing at that time. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a) (requiring an employer to furnish treat- ment that is reasonably requ ired \"at the time of the injury and any time thereafter \" (emphasis added)); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.136, subd . 2(2) (2020) (permitting an employer to refuse to pay for treatment that is excessive). Musta's personal expectation of future reimburse- ment is therefore far diffe rent from the recurring contribution of a defendant who, by agreeing to laun- der proceeds of illegal sales on a recurring basis, has offered encouragement and aid for the completed sale\u2014and potentially fo r future sales too. See Orozco- Prada , 732 F.2d at 1080. Accordingly, Mendota Heights can comply with the reimbursement order without violating federal law because reimbursement would not contribute to any element of a crime \"before or at the time the crime was committed.\" Delpit , 94 F.3d at 1151. 59a II. Even assuming that the affirmative-act require- ment would be met, Mend ota Heights could not be liable under an aiding and abetting theory because it lacks the required inte nt. Under the \"canonical formulation\" of intent for aiding and abetting, \"a defendant must not just 'in some sort associate him- self with the venture,' but al so 'participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about' and 'seek by his action to make it succeed.'\" Rosemond , 572 U.S. at 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United States , 336 U.S. 613, 619, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949)). In other words, the defendant must act with the purpose of furthering the crime. Undoubtedly, Mendota Heights has no desire to help Musta possess cannabis. This lawsuit and ap-peal are ample evidence of that fact. See Hager v. M&K Constr. , 246 N.J. 1, 247 A. 3d 864, 889 (2021) (observing that, \"[b]y the very nature of its appeals,\" the employer \"has made it clear that it does not wish\" to aid in an employee's possession of medical cannabis). Accordingly, the court turns to a different formulation of the intent standard in Rosemond , namely, that the intent requirement may be satisfied \"when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged of fense.\" 572 U.S. at 77, 134 S.Ct. 1240. The court reasons that because reim- bursement would finance Musta's possession and ef- fectively facilitate her future possession, Mendota Heights would actively participate in Musta's posses- sion of medical cannabis if it reimburses her. And be-cause Mendota Heights is \"fully knowledgeable about the circumstances advanced\" by its compelled reim- bursement, the knowledg e requirement is met. 60a I agree with the court that active participation with full knowledge of the criminal scheme can satisfy the intent requirement for aiding and abetting, as is clearly stated in Rosemond . 572 U.S. at 77, 134 S.Ct. 1240. But I disagree that reimbursing an employee to fulfill a statutory duty that is determined by a court order is \"active participation\" in a crime that the employee chooses to commit. Rosemond does not suggest that knowingly active participation represents a lesser mens rea than act- ing with the specific purpose of furthering the crime. Instead, active participation operates as a means of demonstrating that a person intends to facilitate a crime, as both the majority and dissent in Rosemond recognized. See id. (\"[A] person who actively partici- pates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and character intends that scheme's commission.\" (emphasis added)); id. at 85, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (Alito, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he difference between acting pur- posefully (when that concep t is properly understood) and acting knowingly is slight.\"). The cases cited by the Rosemond Court as exam- ples of knowingly active participation are instructive. See 572 U.S. at 77, 134 S.Ct. 1240. In Pereira v. United States , 347 U.S. 1, 12, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954), the Court found that the defendant had the requisite intent for aiding and abetting mail fraud when he deceptively obtained a check from the victim knowing that a confederate would do the actual mailing to collect on the check. And in Bozza v. United States , 330 U.S. 160, 165, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947), the Court up held a conviction for aiding and abetting the evasion of liquor taxes because the defendant \"helped operate a clandestine 61a distillery\" while he was aware of the illegal nature of the business. In each case, the defendant's purpose of furthering the illegal scheme is inferable from his active partic- ipation in, with full knowledge of, the underlying crime. In Pereira , the defendant's desire that the check be mailed was clear fr om his part in deceiving the victim and obtaining the check, knowing that the check would later be mailed. 347 U.S. at 12, 74 S.Ct. 358 (\"[I]t is also clear that an intent to collect on the check would include an intent to use the mails or to transport the check in interstate commerce.\"). And in Bozza , assisting with a secret distillery operation implied an intent to help the owner evade taxes. 330 U.S. at 165, 67 S.Ct. 645 (\" [A] person who actively helps to operate a secret distillery knows that he is helping to violate Government revenue laws. That is a well known object of an illicit distillery.\"). In short, each defendant's actions showed that he had chosen \"to align himself with the illegal scheme in its entire- ty.\" Rosemond , 572 U.S. at 78, 134 S.Ct. 1240. But the conduct that satisfied active participation in Pereira or Bozza was far more involved in the underlying scheme than the conduct here. Unlike Bozza, Mendota Heights is not directly involved in carrying out the illegal scheme: Mendota Heights is not participating in the transaction between Musta and the cannabis dispensary nor in Musta's related possession of the cannabis. Any reimbursement would be paid after the purchase and possession are already complete, and any ongoing possession of that cannabis would be unaffected by the reimbursement. Unlike Pereira, Mendota Heights is not seeking to facilitate a criminal act by a confederate. Mendota Heights is not encouraging Musta to buy or possess cannabis; neither is it payi ng her for future purchases 62a ahead of time. Musta's past decision to purchase cannabis, and any decision to purchase cannabis in the future, is her own. Further, Mendota Heights is doing everything it can to distance itself from Musta's purchase and possession of medical cannabis. Consequently, there simply is no sign that Mendota Heights has \"align[ed]\" itself with Musta's choice to possess cannabis or desires in any way to \"make [any plan of Musta's] succeed.\" Rosemond 78, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Accordingly, Mendota Heights lacks the required intent to aid and abet. The court cites to Garcia v. Tractor Supply Co. , 154 F. Supp. 3d 1225, 1226 (D.N .M. 2016), to support its conclusion that Mendota Heights would have the required intent to aid and abet. This reliance on Garcia is misplaced. Garcia held that an employer was not required to accommodate an employee's use of medical cannabis because the New Mexico Human Rights Act was preempted by federal law to the extent that the act required the employer to accom- modate the employee's illegal drug use. Id. at 1230. But Garcia did not rely on impossibility preemption based on a theory of aiding and abetting liability. It relied on obstacle preemption, see id. , the form of preemption applied in Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Lab. & Indus. , 348 Or. 159, 230 P.3d 518, 536 (2010), which is a theory that the court does not reach and that I will address later. Therefore, Garcia offers no support for the court's conclusion that federal law preempts section 176.135, subdivision 1(a), based on impossibility preemption. The court also stakes its analysis on the difference between intent and motive. The court implicitly acknowledges that the compensation judge's order may be relevant to a defense of necessity but insists that the order has no relevance to the question of 63a intent. Notably, a simila r criticism was leveled at, and rejected by, the Court in Rosemond . The Court held that, to be liable for aiding and abetting, a defendant must have \"advance knowledge\" of the facts constituting the entire crime such that the defendant can \"do something with\" that knowledge. Rosemond , 572 U.S. at 78, 134 S.Ct. 1240. For example, if an accomplice to a drug transaction knows nothing of a gun until it appears on the scene, that accomplice may not be liable for aiding and abetting a gun crime if there was no realistic opportunity for him or her to leave the scene. Id. Justice Alito, dissenting in part, accused the Court of confusing intent to commit an act with the motive for committing an act, id. at 88, 134 S.Ct. 1240 (Alito, J., conc urring in part, dissent- ing in part), but the Court explained that aiding and abetting has a \"distinctive intent standard\" that requires a defendant to participate in the venture as something to be brought about and not just \"in some sort associate himself with the venture.\" Id. at 81, 134 S.Ct. 1240 n.10 (internal quotation marks omit-ted). Here, the record clearly shows that Mendota Heights has no desire to help Musta possess canna- bis. Neither has Mendota Heights chosen to \"align [itself] with the illegal scheme in its entirety.\" Id. at 78, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Although Mendota Heights has advance knowledge that Musta seeks reimbursement for medical cannabis, it reimburses her for this medi- cal treatment only under the obligation of state law and at the order of a court. I therefore conclude that the \"distinctive intent standard\" for aiding and abet- ting is not met. The expansiveness of the court's interpretation of the intent standard for aiding and abetting is 64a troubling.2 Mendota Heights would reimburse Musta only after the fact and only to fulfill a statutory duty as determined by a court. If that counts as active participation in Musta's possession solely because Mendota Heights would be knowingly \"financing\" or \"facilitating\" that possession, then other actions thought to be innocent could likewise trigger crimi- nal liability. For example, if an employee tells her employer, \"I'm going to use my next three paychecks to buy medical cannabis,\" and the employer pays the employee those three paychecks, has the employer then knowingly \"financed\" that employee's unlawful possession? It would be absurd to suppose that, in such a situation, state fair labor laws requiring an employer to pay an employee a minimum hourly wage are partially preempted. Or, if a bus route passes a cannabis dispensary, and the bus driver knows that a passenger is on his way to purchase medical cannabis, has the bus driver knowingly \"facilitated\" a future possess ion of cannabis? Is the same true of a taxi driver who knows the purpose of the trip? Surely those fact s alone are not enough to convict the bus or taxi driver of aiding and abetting the possession of cannabis. If intent is inferable from those circumstances\u2014which are nothing more than incidental participation in the crime 3\u2014then the 2 The court tries to shield resp onsibility for its expansive interpretation behind the \"authoritative statements\" by the Supreme Court in Rosemond . But as I have explained and other courts of last resort have found, Rosemond by no means compels the interpretation or result that the court reaches today. 3 The Court in Rosemond distinguished between incidental and active participants, stating that the owner of a gun store, who sells a gun to a criminal while knowing but not caring how the gun will be used, would be only an incidental participant in 65a government's burden of prov ing intent is effectively eliminated.4 The law of aiding and abetting does not allow for such expansive liability. Rosemond dictates that the government prove \"inten[t] to facilitate that offense's commission.\" 572 U.S. at 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240. It is not enough that a person is \"in some sort associate[d]\" with the offense; a person must \"'participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about.'\" Id. (quoting Nye & Nissen , 336 U.S. at 619, 69 S.Ct. 766). Consistent with the ho ldings of the New Jersey and New Hampshire Supreme Courts, I conclude the subsequent crime. See 572 U.S. at 77 n.8, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Although the Court declined to decide whether incidental par- ticipants are guilty of aiding and abetting an offense, the logical answer is no. The whole point of specific intent is that the defendant is aligned with the venture as something the defen- dant wishes to bring about. Id. at 76, 134 S.Ct. 1240. Incidental participants lack this alignment and are more like those who are merely associated \"'in some sort'\" with a venture than those who actively participate in bringing the venture about. Id. (citation omitted). Notably, Mendota Heights is even less involved than the Court's hypothetical gun store owner who willingly sells the gun. Mendota Heights would be like a gun store owner who staunchly refuses to sell the gun to a customer until ordered to do so by a court. 4 The court tries to distinguish the employer hypothetical by stating that a paycheck is ordi narily used \"for any number of purchases\" other than cannabis. That distinction is irrelevant. Under my hypothetical, the paycheck is used to purchase cannabis and, following the court's reasoning, the employer is aiding and abetting the purchase by knowingly financing it. The court tries to distinguish the bus driver hypothetical by stating that the route is driven \"not solely for the benefit of the passenger to obtain cannabis.\" But that distinction resorts to the motive of the driver, an argument which the court itself rejects. 66a that Mendota Heights does no t have a specific intent to aid Musta in unlawfully possessing cannabis merely by reimbursing her after the fact based on a court order applying state law. See Hager , 247 A.3d at 889; Appeal of Panaggio , 174 N.H. 89, ---, --- A.3d --- (2021). 5 III. Because it is not impossible for Mendota Heights to comply with the compensation judge's order and federal law, I next address the question of obstacle preemption. Obstacle preemption exists when \"state law is an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes of the federal scheme.\" Martin ex rel. Hoff v. City of Rochester , 642 N.W.2d 1, 11 (Minn. 2002). Under Minnesota's workers' compensation laws, an employer must \"furnish any . treatment\" as \"may reasonably be required\" to and relieve from the effects of the inju ry.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1(a). The question, then, is whether section 176.135, subdivision 1(a), stan ds as an obstacle to the purpose of the Controlled Substances Act if section 176.135 requires an employer to reimburse an employee for the purchase of medical cannabis. 5 The court claims that, following my reasoning, a state could nullify any federal specific intent cri me by simply passing legis- lation that commands a person to perform the criminal act. Not so. A person could still be liable for aiding and abetting an offense if there were facts demonstrating that the person had aligned themselves with the crimi nal scheme. Furt her, even if impossibility preemption did not apply, there would still be a serious question of obstacle preemption, which is triggered when a state law thwarts Congress's intent. As I will explain, obstacle preemption does not exist under the specific facts of this case, but it may apply if a state attempted what the court describes. 67a \"Congressional purpose is the ultimate touchstone of the v. Vantium Cap., 846 (Minn. 2014). But preemption is usually disfavored. Martin , 642 N.W.2d at 11. Because workers' compensation is traditionally a matter of st ate law, I start with the assumption that section 176.135 is not preempted \"'unless that [is] the clea r and manifest purpose of Congress.'\" Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc. , 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. , 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947)) (alter- ation in original). The case for preemption is also particularly weak when Congress knew that state law operated in an area of federal interest, but \"nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there was between them.\" Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp. , 464 U.S. 238, 256, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984). \"The main objectives of the [Controlled Substances Act] were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances.\" Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U.S. 1, 12, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). \"Congress was particularly concerned with the need to prevent the diversion of drugs from legitimate to illicit channels.\" Id. at 12-13, 125 S.Ct. 2195. \"To effectuate these goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except in a manner authorized by the [Act].\" Id. at 13, 125 S.Ct. 2195. Consistent with the decisions of courts of last resort in other states, I conclude that the reimburse-ment of medical cannabis that is purchased and used within the strictures of the state's medical cannabis 68a research program does not stand as an impermissible obstacle to the purposes of the Act. As observed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the Act does not make it illegal for an insurer to reimburse an employee for a purchase of medical cannabis or pur- port to regulate insurance practices in any manner. Appeal of Panaggio , 174 N.H. at ---, --- A.3d ---. In addition, the compensation judge's order in no way prevents the federal government from using its own resources to enforce the Act. Id.; see Erwin Chemer- insky et al., Cooperative Federalism & Marijuana Regulation , 62 UCLA L. Rev. 74, 111-12 (2015) (argu- ing that, because the federal government cannot commandeer state legislatures and require them to prohibit cannabis altogether, a state's regulation of medical cannabis does not stand as an obstacle to the objectives of the Controlled Substances Act). Furthermore, as explained by the New Jersey Supreme Court, since 2015, Congress has prohibited the Department of Justice from using its funds to prevent states from implementing their medical can-nabis laws. Hager , 247 A.3d at 886. These appropri- ation riders at the very least show that Congress has chosen to \"tolerate\" the tension between state medi- cal cannabis laws and the Controlled Substances Act, see Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc. , 489 U.S. 141, 166-67, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989), and may even have eliminated liability under federal law for the possession of medical cannabis that was permitted under state law during those years, see Hager , 247 A.3d at 887. For these reasons, I conclude that the high bar for obstacle preemption is not met. IV. In sum, because it is not impossible for Mendota Heights to comply with state and federal law, and 69a because reimbursing Musta does not stand as an impermissible obstacle to federal law, I would hold that the section 176.135, su bdivision 1(a), is not preempted by federal law. Consequently, I would affirm the decision of the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals. The court has chosen to do otherwise, and the effect of today's decision is to prevent Musta and other injured workers who suffer intractable pain from receiving the relief that medical cannabis can bring. In doing so, the co urt frustrates the Legisla- ture's goal of providing \"q uick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured workers at a reasonable cost to th e employers.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.001 (2020). Because today's decision miscon-strues the scope of the spec ific intent underlying an aiding and abetting offense\u2014with the effect of deny- ing reimbursement for reasonable and necessary treatment for injured worker s\u2014I respectfully dissent. 70a DANIEL BIERBACH, Employee/Respondent, v.

SUNDQUIST, Judge The employer and insurer appeal the compensation judge's award of reimbursement for costs incurred by the employee for medical cannabis used to treat his work-related injury. We affirm. BACKGROUND In 2004, Daniel Bierbach, the employee, was at work for his employer, Digger's Polaris, when an ATV he was operating rolled, landing on his ankle. The employer and its insurer admitted liability. The employee sought care with J. Chris Coetzee, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon with a sub-specialty in foot and ankle surgery, who diagnosed fractures of the distal tibial pilon and fibula. A few weeks afte r the injury, the employee underwent surgery. A year post surgery, the employee continued to walk with a limp and had significant swelling of his ankle. Physical therapy was prescribed, and the employee incorporated its recommended exercises in his regu- lar gym routine and wore an ankle brace. By 2007, he reported a return to his normal activity level but continued to experience intermittent pain and swell- ing. Three years later, his symptoms worsened, and he again saw Dr. Coetzee, who noted the need for 72a an ankle fusion. Due to the employee's young age, however, Dr. Coetzee wanted to postpone ankle fusion surgery for as long as possible. In April 2013, the employee filed a claim petition alleging a consequential neck and back injury. In 2014, the parties settled th e employee's claims for workers' compensation benefits and closed out some medical expenses, which included opioids/narcotic therapy, psychiatric and psychological treatment, mental health, health clubs, implantable stimulators, and future chronic pain management. (Ex. 33.) The employee underwent a series of injections in 2017, but by 2018, he had developed progressive de- generative changes in the left ankle and was limited in his activities of daily liv ing. He continued to gain weight due to his inability to exercise. On June 13, 2018, Dr. Coetzee opined that the employee was a candidate for medical cannabis to help with his intractable pain and to wean him off narcotic pain medication. The employee's application for the Minnesota medical cannabis registry [1] was submitted to and accepted by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). The employee was referred to Leafline, a manufacturer of medical cannabis, for evaluation and distribution of medical cannabis. A registered pharmacist with Leafline recommended two types of medical cannabis oil, \"tangerine\" for nighttime use due to the employee's pain at night and \"cobalt\" for day to day activity. The employee placed the oil in a device allowing him to inhale the oil as a vapor. The employee met with a Leafline professional to discuss his mental and physical response and to refill his 1 See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.27. 73a medical cannabis. Dr. Coetzee reported that the treatment appeared to be effective in reducing the employee's complaints of intractable pain. He opined that, within a reasonable de gree of medical certainty, medical cannabis was an appropriate treatment for the employee's condition. Chris Meyer, M.D., examined the employee on behalf of the employer and insurer. He reviewed medical records, took a hi story from the employee, and conducted a physical examination. In his narra- tive report of December 10, 2018, Dr. Meyer opined that the work injury was a substantial contributing factor to the employee's ch ronic pain. Based on the medical literature, Dr. Meyer stated that he was \"not a believer in the use of medical cannabis for chronic pain,\" but noted that \"there is a reasonable degree of certainty that medical marijuana is a safer alterna- tive to opioid use.\" (Ex. 1.) Because the employee had not undergone a pain clinic program in the past, Dr. Meyer recommended a pain clinic for the employ- ee's chronic pain. In 2018, the employee was hired by a new employer as a professional sales associate. The job required him to be on his feet 90 percent of the day. He generally worked over 60 ho urs a week. He testified that, due to the medical cannabis, his quality of life improved and he was able to continue working at his job. The employee had a prior hist ory of drug use. He admitted that he had used recreational marijuana for years. He had also taken narcotic medication after the work injury, but he di d not like the effects of narcotics and weaned off them in 2004. Since admit- ted into the medical cannabis program in 2018, the employee's medical cannabis dosage has doubled. At 74a the time of hearing, the monthly cost for his medical cannabis was $1,863.71. On June 29, 2018, the employee filed a claim petition seeking reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs incurred for medical cannabis used to treat his work-related injury. The matter was heard before a compensation judge on May 14, 2019. The issues presented included whether the compensation judge had jurisdiction under Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 152.22-.37 (2018) to order re- imbursement of costs incurred for medical cannabis and whether the employee's medical cannabis was reasonable, necessary and causally related to the work injury. The compensation judge awarded re- imbursement, concluding that he had authority to order reimbursement of such costs, and that the employee's use of medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary medical treatment and causally related to the work injury. The em ployer and insurer appeal. STANDARD OF REVIEW On appeal, the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals must determine whether \"the findings of fact and order [are] clearly erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.421, subd. 1(3). Substantial evidence supports the findings if, in the context of the entire record, \"they are supported by evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\" Hengemuhle v. Long Prairie Jaycees , 358 N.W.2d 54, 59, 37 W.C.D. 235, 239 (Minn. 1984). Where evidence conflicts or more than one inference may reasonably be drawn from the evidence, the findings are to be affirmed. Id. at 60, 37 W.C.D. at 240. Similarly, findings of fact should not be disturbed, even though the reviewing court might 75a disagree with them, \"unless they are clearly errone- ous in the sense that they are manifestly contrary to the weight of evidence or not reasonably supported by the evidence as a whole.\" Northern States Power Co. v. Lyon Food Prods., Inc. , 304 Minn. 196, 201, 229 N.W.2d 521, 524 (1975). A decision which rests upon the application of a statute or rule to essentially undisputed facts gener- ally involves a question of law which the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeal s may consider de novo. Krovchuk v. Ko ch Oil Refinery , 48 W.C.D. 607, 608 (W.C.C.A. 1993), summarily aff 'd (Minn. June 3, 1993). DECISION On appeal, the employer and insurer ask this court to reverse the compensation judge's award of reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs related to the employee's use of medical cannabis. The appellants raise four issues on appeal: whether the compensa- tion judge improperly relied upon medical opinions which lacked foundation, whether the judge erred in finding that the use of medical cannabis was reason-able and necessary to cure or relieve the effects of the employee's injury, whether the compensation judge had jurisdiction to order the employer and insurer to finance the employee's medical cannabis use, and whether the federal law making it illegal to possess, distribute or manufacture cannabis preempts the state's medical cannabis la w, making it a crime for the employer and insurer to reimburse out-of-pocket costs of the employee for state-authorized use of medical cannabis. Foundation and Medical Expertise The employer and insure r argue that the judge erred in adopting the medical opinion of Dr. Coetzee because that opinion lacked foundation. Specifically, 76a they argue that Dr. Coetzee's opinion that the employee was a good candid ate for medical cannabis is based on faulty inform ation that the employee was taking narcotic medication and that he had no history of substance abuse. They argue that Dr. Coetzee was not an expert in pain medicine and cited no meaningful literature, and therefore lacked the necessary expertise to render an opinion on the employee's use of medical cannabis. Moreover, they argue that Dr. Meyer's opinion was more persuasive because he questioned the use of cannabis as medi- cally controversial and questioned its effectiveness. We are not persuaded that Dr. Coetzee lacked either the necessary foundation or expertise. In weighing the evidence, a compensation judge has discretion as the trier of fact to choose between competing and conflicting medical opinions. Gianotti v. Indep. Sch. Dist. 152 , 889 N.W.2d 796, 803, 77 W.C.D. 117, 126 (Minn. 2017). This assessment of the weight to be given to conflicting opinions is upheld on appeal, absent an abuse of discretion. Mattick v. HyVee Food Stores , 898 N.W.2d 616, 77 W.C.D. 617 (Minn. 2017). The opinion need only be based on enough facts to form a reasonable opinion that is not based on speculation or conjecture. Gianotti , 889 N.W.2d at 802, 77 W.C.D. at 124. As the employee's physician since 2004, Dr. Coetzee was familiar with the employee's history and treatment. He had recommended medications, injections, surgery and physical therapy, but all failed to relieve the employee's pain. Dr. Coetzee did not prescribe [2] medical cannabis, but instead 2 In Finding 17, the compensation judge indicates that \"The preponderance of the evidence shows that this Compensation Judge has authority to order reimbursement of the employee's 77a diagnosed the employee with intractable pain which is a qualifying condition for medical cannabis regis- tration and certification. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.27, subd. 2(b); Medical Cannabis and Intractable Pain, Op. Off. of Medical Cannabis, Minn. Dep't of Health (Dec. 2, 2015). Dr. Coetzee did no t set the cannabis dose, which was regulated through Leafline, one of only two Minnesota medical cannabis dispensaries regis-tered under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.25. Having years of a doctor-patient relationship with the employee, Dr. Coetzee observed the employee's condition both before and during the employee's use of medical can- nabis and opined that the employee had responded well to that treatment. The employee testified that the medical cannabis improved his pain and func-tioning so he could continue full-time work in sales while spending much of the workday on his feet. Even Dr. Meyer agreed that medical cannabis was a safer alternative to opioid use. While there is a discrepancy between Dr. Coetzee's 2018 statement that the employee needed to wean off narcotics and the employee's testimony that he had not used narcotics since 2004, we co nclude the compensation judge could reasonably reconcile this discrepancy as the trier of fact. Th e compensation judge did not err by accepting Dr. Coetzee's adequately founded opinion that the treatment was an appropriate modality to address the employee's intractable pain and a better option than chronic use of opioid medi-cation. payments and costs associated with his medical cannabis prescription.\" Although the term \"prescription\" is used here, there is no evidence in the record that Dr. Coetzee \"prescribed\" or wrote a script for medical cannabis. 78a Reasonable and Necessary Medical Treatment The employer and insurer argue that medical cannabis is not reasonable and necessary treatment because it is not currently accepted for medical treatment use, the employee is a poor candidate due to his history of substance abuse, Dr. Coetzee did not manage the employee's medical cannabis treatment, the treatment parameters do not support the use of medical cannabis as a reasonable treatment, and as cannabis is an illegal substance, medical cannabis cannot be considered a reas onable treatment. This issue raises questions of fact and law, and we begin with an analysis of the legal issue, which we review de novo. In 2014, the Minnesota legislature passed the Medical Cannabis Therapeuti c Research Act (MCTRA), which established a patient registry and allowed qualifying Minnesotans to possess and use cannabis to treat significant medical conditions. Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 152.22-.37. Regulated by MDH, the law provides rules for the registration, certification, dispensation and use of medical cannabis. The statute presumes that a patient enrolled in the registry program is engaged in the state-authorized use of medical cannabis. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.32, subd. 1. Noticeably absent in MCTRA is language requiring payment by health insurers or workers' compensa-tion insurers. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.23 provides that \"nothing in sections 152.22 to 152.37 require the medical assistance and MinnesotaCare programs to reimburse an enrollee or a provider for costs associ- ated with the medical use of cannabis,\" but does not include the same language for health insurers or workers' compensation insurers. The Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act re quires an employer to provide \"any\" medical treatment as may reasonably 79a be required at the time of the injury and any time thereafter to cure and relieve the effects of the injury. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.13 5, subd. 1. That the Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry has not promulgated rules under the treatment parameters for guided use of medical cannabis does not render ineffective the plain language of section 176.135. Moreover, the treatment parameters unequivocally state that medical cannabis permitted under the medical cannabis program is not an illegal substance. Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 7a. Dr. Coetzee diagnosed the employee with intract- able pain, which is a qualifying condition for regis-tration. The employee sent an application to MDH, which issued a registry veri fication to the employee, to Dr. Coetzee, and to Leafline. The employee obtained medical cannabis from Leafline, and Dr. Coetzee continued to see employee for visits related to intractable pain. Under the MCTRA, both Dr. Coetzee and Leafline would then report to MDH, which then submits research findings to the legisla- ture. Given the facts of this case and the require- ments under the MCTRA, we see nothing unreason- able about the employee's use of medical cannabis to treat his intractable pain caused by his work injury. The compensation judge's determination that the employee's use of medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary treatment is supported by substantial evidence. Over the course of 15 years, the employee underwent numerous treatment s for his work injury. He tried narcotic medication, physical therapy and cortisone injections, but continued to have intract- able pain. Surgery was pe rformed within weeks of the injury, but the employee will need fusion surgery in the future. Because fusion surgery is not presently indicated due to the employee's young age, the 80a employee has been left with chronic pain and limited means of relieving it. The 2014 settlement closed out pain management and opioid/narcotic therapy. In determining that medical cannabis was reasonable and necessary, the compensat ion judge was persuaded by the employee's testimony that the use of medical cannabis decreased his pain and increased his func- tional ability. The judge adopted the opinion of Dr. Coetzee, and not the opinion of Dr. Meyer. In weigh- ing the evidence, a compensation judge has discretion as the trier of fact to choose between competing and conflicting medical opinions. The judge's assessment of the weight to be given to the conflicting opinions is upheld on appeal, absent an abuse of discretion. Mattick , 898 N.W.2d at 621, evidence supports the compensation judge's award of reimbursement to the employee and we affirm. Subject Matter Jurisdiction The employer and insurer argue that the compen- sation judge lacked subjec t matter jurisdiction to award reimbursement of the employee's out-of-pocket expenses for medical cannabi s. They argue that because medical cannabis is an illegal substance under federal law, a compensation judge does not have jurisdiction to address the use of medical cannabis. We agree that a compensation judge does not have jurisdiction to decide issues of federal crim- inal law. However, a compe nsation judge does have jurisdiction to adjudicate issues which fall under the Workers' Compensation Act. Hale v. Viking Trucking Co., 654 N.W.2d 119, 62 W.C.D. 701 (Minn. 366 N.W.2d 280, 37 W.C.D. 674 (Minn. 1985). The determination of the compensabil-ity of a particular medical treatment for a work-related injury is squarely within a compensation 81a judge's jurisdiction. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135. This includes the use of medical cannabis under the MCTRA. Federal Preemption Finally, the employer and insurer argue that a \"positive conflict\" exists between the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801, et seq., a federal law which makes any use of cannabis a criminal act, and the MCTRA, which allows cannabis to be restricted to use in a medical setting. Due to federal preemp- tion, they argue that they cannot be ordered to violate federal law by reimbursing out-of-pocket costs incurred by the employee for state-authorized use of medical cannabis. The WCCA has statewide jurisdiction and, except for matters appealed to the supreme court, has the sole, exclusive, and final authority to hear and determine all questions of law and fact arising under the workers' compensation laws of this state in those cases that have been appealed to our court. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 175A.01, subd. 5. We have no jurisdiction in \"any case that does not arise under the workers' compensation laws\" or \"in any criminal case.\" Id. As such, we decline to address the employer and insurer's argument that the Controlled Substances Act preempts our state medical cannabis law. 82a STATE OF MINNESOTA OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS WID: 9349796 OAH Case No. 9349796-CP-6107 DOI: 04-07-2004 Wo rkers' Compensation Judge William J.

The record in this matter closed on June 28, 2019. STATEMENT OF ISSUES 1. Does this Compensation Judge have jurisdic- tion under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.22 - .37 (2018) to order reimbursement for medical marijuana? 83a 2. If so, is the employee's prescription for medical marijuana reasonable, necessary, and causally related to the work injury of April 7, 2004? Based upon all of the files, records, and proceed- ings in this matter, the undersigned Workers' Com- pensation Judge issues the following: FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. On April 7, 2004, the employee was responsi- ble for driving all terrain vehicles (ATVs) from the employer's buildings to a designated spot along the highway. While the employee was driving an ATV, it rolled over and the employee landed on his feet, injuring his left ankle. 2. At the time of the accident, the employee was 25 years old. 3. On April 12, 2004, Dr. David Gesensway eval- uated the employee and diagno sed a left ankle type C pilon fracture with transverse distal fibular fracture. Dr. Gesensway noted there was significant potential for future problems includin g stiffness, chronic pain, early posttraumatic arthritis, and a potential ankle fusion. 4. On April 20, 2004, the employee underwent a left distal tibia and fibula open reduction and inter- nal fixation performed by Dr. J. Chris Coetzee. 5. On April 18, 2005, the employee was seen by Dr. Coetzee for a follow-up appointment. The employee reported he had a minimal limp and at the end of each day he had si gnificant swelling of his ankle. Dr. Coetzee again opined that the employee would likely develop degenerative changes in the future. 84a 6. On August 15, 2005, the employee had a screw in his left ankle removed. 7. On February 15, 2007, the employee was seen for a follow-up by PA-C La rry Nilsson. The employee reported returning to his normal activity level, but he was still bothered by in termittent pain and swell- ing. The employee reported that he had not gone to physical therapy for some time, but he did use many of the principles he learne d in physical therapy in his regular gym routine. PA-C Nilsson provided the employee with an ankle brace. 8. The employee returned to see PA-C Nilsson on April 29, 2010. PA-C Nilsson noted the employee had gained weight recently and his ankle had been more symptomatic. The employee reported he was still experiencing the same type of pain with an increase in frequency. PA-C Nilsson opined that the employee might have to undergo more surgery at some point in the future. 9. On August 30, 2012, Dr. Coetzee evaluated the employee for ongoing left ankle pain. The employee reported an inability to sleep through the night. Dr. Coetzee opined the em ployee would need an ankle fusion but, should postpone undergoing this surgery as long as possible. A left ankle injection was administered. 10. The employee continued to receive periodic left ankle injections through September 21, 2017. 11. The employee was again seen by Dr. Coetzee on June 13, 2018. Dr. Coetzee noted the employee continued to develop progressive degenerative changes in his left ankle. The employee reported he was limited in his activities of daily living and continued to gain weight due to his inability to workout. Dr. Coetzee op ined the employee was a 85a candidate for medical cannabis for his intractable pain and should wean off of narcotic pain medica- tions. 12. On December 10, 2018, Dr. Christopher Meyer issued an Independent Medical Examination (IME) report. Dr. Meyer documented a large amount of swelling on the employee's left ankle. Dr. Meyer agreed the employee had chronic left ankle pain related to his post-traumatic degenerative joint disease noting that the classic treatment for chronic pain in- volves bracing, ice, medications, anti-inflammatories, and the use of narcotic pa in medication. Dr. Meyer stated he did not believe in the use of medical canna- bis for chronic pain. Dr. Meyer recommended that the employee undergo treatment with a pain clinic. 13. On March 28, 2019, Dr . Coetzee issued his opinion via a narrative report . Dr. Coetzee reiterated that the employee had progressive degenerative changes in his ankle and would likely need an ankle fusion or replacement in the future. However, due to his young age, Dr. Coetzee wanted the employee to avoid surgery at that time. Dr. Coetzee also noted the employee had weaned hi mself off of narcotic medications, but his sympto ms were severe enough to warrant more than just anti-inflammatories. Dr. Coetzee concluded that medical cannabis was an appropriate treatment modality to treat the employ- ee's intractable pain and was a much better option than chronic narcotic use. 14. The employee currently works as a sales associate for Camping World and Gander Outdoors. During the day, the employee is on his feet for most of the day showing custom ers motor homes, travel trailers, and other recreational vehicles. 86a 15. The employee's hearin g testimony was credible in that when he is on his feet for extended periods of time, he experiences swelling, discoloration, and pain in his ankle. Prior to being certified for medical cannabis, the employee treated his pain with periodic cortisone injections, which had decreasing efficacy, and by icing. The employee persuasively testified that the medical cannabis helps with sleeping and the pain that comes from being on his feet for work. 16. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.22 - .37 (2018) specifically states that medical assistance and MinnesotaCare are not required to reimburse an enrollee or a provider for medical cannabis. 17. The preponderance of the evidence shows that this Compensation Judge has authority to order reimbursement of the employee's payments and costs associated with his medical cannabis prescription. Based upon these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and for the reasons set forth in the incor- porated memorandum, the undersigned Workers' Compensation Judge makes the following: ORDER 1. NOW THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the employee's request for reimbursement of pay- ments made for medical cannabis is granted and the employer and insurer sha ll reimburse the employee for payments and costs associated with his medical cannabis prescription. 2. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending pleadings are dismissed. 87a Dated: August 23, 2019 /s/ William J. Marshall William J. Marshall Interim Chief Administrative Law Judge Digitally Recorded NOTICE Notice is hereby given that any party aggrieved by this Order may appeal it, or any portion thereof, to the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals. An appeal must be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge no later than 30 days following service of this Order. An appeal must contain the information required by Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.421 (2018), including the required $25.00 filing fee. MEMORANDUM Legality of Medical Cannabis under Federal Law The Compensation Judge only has jurisdiction to address questions of law and fact arising under Minnesota's workers' compensation laws. Hale v. Viking Trucking Co. , 654 N.W.2d 119, 123 (Minn. 2002); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 175A.01, subd. 5 (2018). Whether payment of medical cannabis is a violation of federal law is outside the scope of the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act. Therefor e, that argument is reserved for a court of competent jurisdiction. 88a Constitutional Arguments Raised by the Employer and Insurer The employer and insurer contend that the Medical Cannabis Program contains provisions which exempt Medicare and Medicare, federal programs, and Workers Compensation insurers are not included in those provisions. The employer and the insurer contend that this exclusion is disparate treatment and violates the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Additionally, the employer and the insurer argue that requiring them to pay for medical cannabis would violate the dormant commerce clause. As stated above, the Compensation Judge only has jurisdiction to address questions of law and fact aris-ing under Minnesota's work ers' compensation laws, and questions regarding equal protection violations and dormant commerce clause are outside the scope of the Minnesota Worker's Compensation Act. Therefore, that argument is reserved for a court of competent jurisdiction. Minnesota The Compensation Judge does have authority under the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act to award medical treatment that is reasonable and necessary to cure and relieve the effects of injury. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1 (2018). The Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.21 - 52.37 (2018) states that Minnesota residents who have been diagnosed with a qualifying medical condi- tion by a health care practitioner can be enrolled in a patient registry maintained by the Minnesota Department of Health. Once a person is enrolled in the program, they are then able to obtain medical cannabis from a dispensary . On December 2, 2015, 89a the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health designated intractable pain as a qualifying medical condition for medical cannabis. Intractable pain is defined by the Department of Health as, \"pain whose cause cannot be removed and, according to generally accepted medical practice, the full range of pain management modalities appropriate for this patient has been used without adequate result or with intolerable side effects.\" 1 Additionally, the treatment parameters state that medical cannabis permitted under the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program is not an illegal substance. Minn. R. 5221.6040, subp. 7a (2017). In this case, Dr. Coetz ee diagnosed the employee with intractable pain and provided the employee with a certification of the diagnosis. The employee was then enrolled in the Medical Cannabis Registry and began receiving medical cannabis from a dispen- sary. Therefore, the employ ee is not in violation of Minnesota law when he received medical cannabis. Reasonable and Necessary Medical Treatment The employer and the insurer raise several argu- ments as to why medical cannabis is not reasonable or necessary medical treatment. The employer and insurer first argue that Dr. Coetzee's opinion was based on inadequate foundation. The employer and the insurer then argue that medical marijuana is per se unreasonable because it is illegal under federal law. The employer and insurer's concerns about Dr. Coetzee are unpersuasive. Although, Dr. Coetzee 1 Minn. Dept. of Health, Medical Cannabis, Intractable Pain , https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/cannabis/intractable/ definition.html (Last visited on July 25, 2019). 90a mentions long-term opioid use as a justification in his March 28, 2019, narrative report, in his June 13, 2018, medical cannabis certification he notes the fact that cortisone injections do not provide adequate relief as justification for the certification. Therefore, Dr. Coetzee's statement about opioid medication is not the only justification for recommending medical cannabis for the employee. The Compensation Judge does not find the opinions of Dr. Meyer to be persuasive. Dr. Meyer recommended that the employee undergo treatment with a pain clinic but did not note what treatment the pain clinic could provide for the employee that could help. In the employee's 15-year treatment history, he has tried medication, physical therapy, and cortisone injections which have all failed to relieve the employee's chronic pain. In addition, Dr. Meyer's concerns about medical cannabis are un- persuasive. Dr. Meyer states that medical cannabis is an evolving area and mo re research is required. Dr. Coetzee points to pers uasive studies to support his opinion that medical cannabis is a reasonable treatment for the employee. Therefore, the Compen- sation Judge adopts Dr. Coetzee's opinions as more persuasive and in line with the weight of medical evidence in the case. The Compensation Judge lacks jurisdiction to determine the employer and insurer's argument that medical cannabis is per se unreasonable because it is illegal under federal law. As previously stated, the Compensation Judge can only address questions of law arising under Minnesota's workers' compensa- tion laws, and the question of legality of medical cannabis under federal law is outside the scope of workers' compensation laws. Under the Minnesota 91a Medical Cannabis program, medical cannabis is legal and therefore is not per se unreasonable under Minnesota law. The employer and the insurer raise additional concerns regarding the lack of treatment parameters regarding medical cannabis. The employer and insurer point to the lack of treatment parameters and guidelines as proof that that treatment could end up continuing indefinitely and become expensive. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.83, subd. 5 (2018) places the burden of developing rules regarding treatment parameters on the Department of Labor and Industry. Since Minnesota signed medical cannabis into law in 2014 and the first registered patients began receiving medical cannabis in 2015, the Department of Labor and Industry has not promulgated any rules regard- ing medical cannabis billing or treatment parame- ters. In addition, the employer and insurer's concern about the treatment parameters is unfounded given that Minn. R. 5221.6050, subp. 1 (2017) applies to all treatment. The employer and insurer's general concern that medical cannabi s is an unregulated land- scape is unpersuasive given the Minnesota Depart- ment of Health's regulation of the medical cannabis program. The employer and insurer's argument that the employee should have undergone a chemical dependency evaluation outlined in Minn. R. 5221.6110, subp. 6 (2017), is unpersuasive. That rule applies to opioid medication and does not apply to medical cannabis. Therefore, the Compensation Judge does not find any of the employer and insurer's arguments that medical cannabis is not reasonable and necessary persuasive. Under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.135, subd. 1, the employer is required to furnish medical care and treatment 92a that is reasonable and necessary to cure and relieve from the effects of the in jury. The reasonableness and necessity of medical treatment is a question of fact for the compensation judge. Hopp v. Grist Mill 499 N.W.2d 812 (Minn. 1993). In this case, the employee's testimony about his increased functional status was persuasive. The employee credibly testi- fied about his decreased pain and increased function as a result of medical ca nnabis. Since 2010, medical providers have opined that the employee will need surgery in the future, but it was not appropriate at the present time because of his young age and the possibility that the ankle surgery would wear out. These circumstances left the employee with chronic pain and without the primary means of relieving that pain. In the 15 years sinc e the work injury, the employee has tried various medical treatments that have been ineffective in re ducing his chronic pain to acceptable levels. Dr. Coet zee's testimony about the reasonableness and effectiveness of medical cannabis is persuasive. W. J. M. [Proof of Service Omitted] 93a STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED 1.

Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 176.001 provides: 176.001 INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. It is the intent of the legislature that chapter 176 be interpreted so as to assure the quick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured workers at a reasonable cost to the employers who are subject to the provisions of this chapter. It is the specific intent of the legislature that workers' 117a compensation cases shall be decided on their merits and that the common law rule of \"liberal construction\" based on the supposed \"remed ial\" basis of workers' compensation legislation shall not apply in such cases. The workers' compensation system in Minne- sota is based on a mutual renunciation of common law rights and defenses by employers and employees alike. Employees' rights to sue for damages over and above medical and health care benefits and wage loss benefits are to a certain degree limited by the provisions of this chapter, and employers' rights to raise common law defenses such as lack of negligence, contributory negligence on the part of the employee, and others, are curtailed as well. Accordingly, the legislature hereby declares that the workers' compen-sation laws are not remedial in any sense and are not to be given a broad liberal construction in favor of the claimant or employee on the one hand, nor are the rights and interests of the employer to be favored over those of the employee on the other hand. 7. Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 176.135 provides: 176.135 chiro- practic, podiatric, surgical, hospital. (a) The employer shall furnish any medical, psychological, chiropractic, podiatric, surgical and hospital treatment, including nursing, medicines, medical, chiropractic, podiatric, and surgical supplies, crutches and appa- ratus, including artificial members, or, at the option of the employee, if the employer has not filed notice as hereinafter provided, Christian Science treatment in lieu of medical treatment, chiropractic medicine and medical supplies, as may reasonably be required at the time of the injury and any time thereafter to 118a cure and relieve from the effects of the injury. This treatment shall include treatments necessary to physical rehabilitation. (b) The employer shall pay for the reasonable value of nursing services provided by a member of the em- ployee's family in cases of permanent total disability. (c) Exposure to rabies is an injury and an employer shall furnish preventative treatment to employees exposed to rabies. (d) The employer shall furnish replacement or repair for artificial member s, glasses or spectacles, artificial eyes, podiatric orthotics, dental bridge work, dentures or artificial t eeth, hearing aids, canes, crutches, or wheel chairs damaged by reason of an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. For the purpose of this paragraph, \"injury\" includes damage wholly or in part to an artificial member. In case of the employer's inability or refusal seasonably to prov ide the items required to be provided under this paragraph, the employer is liable for the reasonable expense incurred by or on behalf of the employee in providing the same, includ-ing costs of copies of any medical records or medical reports that are in existenc e, obtained from health care providers, and that di rectly relate to the items for which payment is sought under this chapter, limited to the charges allowed by subdivision 7, and attorney fees incurre d by the employee. (e) Both the commissioner and the compensation judges have authority to make determinations under this section in accordance with sections 176.106 and 176.305. (f) An employer may require that the treatment and supplies required to be provided by an employer by this section be received in whole or in part from a 119a managed care plan certified under section 176.1351 except as otherwise provided by that section. (g) An employer may designate a pharmacy or network of pharmacies that employees must use to obtain outpatient prescription and nonprescription medications. An employee is not required to obtain outpatient medications at a designated pharmacy unless the pharmacy is locate d within 15 miles of the employee's place of residence. (h) Notwithstanding any fees established by rule adopted under section 176.136, an employer may contract for the cost of medication provided to employees. All requests for reimbursement from the special compensation fund formerly codified under section 176.131 for medication provided to an employee must be accompanied by the dispensing pharmacy's invoice showing its usual and customary charge for the medication at the time it was dis- pensed to the employee. The special compensation fund shall not reimburse any amount that exceeds the maximum amount payable for the medication under Minnesota Rules, pa rt 5221.4070, subparts 3 and 4, notwithstanding any contract under Minnesota Rules, part 5221.4070, subpart 5, that provides for a different reimbursement amount. Subd. 1a. Nonemergency surgery; second sur- gical opinion. The employer is required to furnish surgical treatment pursuant to subdivision 1 when the surgery is reasonably required to cure and relieve the effects of the personal injury or occupational disease. An employee may not be compelled to undergo surgery. If an employee desires a second opinion on the necessity of the surgery, the employer shall pay the costs of obtain ing the second opinion. Except in cases of emergency surgery, the employer or insurer may require the employee to obtain a 120a second opinion on the necessity of the surgery, at the expense of the employer, before the employee under- goes surgery. Failure to obtain a second surgical opinion shall not be reason for nonpayment of the charges for the surgery. Th e employer is required to pay the reasonable value of the surgery unless the commissioner or compensation judge determines that the surgery is not reasonably required. Subd. 1b . Complementary and alternative health care providers. Any service, article, or supply provided by an unlicensed complementary and alternative health care practitioner as defined in section 146A.01, subdivision 6, is not compensable under this chapter. Subd. 2. Change of physicians, podiatrists, or chiropractors. The commissioner shall adopt rules establishing standards and criteria to be used when a dispute arises over a change of physicians, podiatrists, or chiropractor s in the case that either the employee or the employer desire a change. If a change is agreed upon or ordered, the medical expenses shall be borne by the employer upon the same terms and conditions as provided in subdivision 1. Subd. 2a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the word \"physicians\" shall include persons holding the degree M. D. (Doctor of Medicine) and persons holding the degree D. O.

D. or the degree D. O. Subd. 3. [Repealed, 1992 c 510 art 4 s 26] Subd. 4. Christian Science treatment. Any employee electing to receive Christian Science treat-ment as provided in subdivision 1 shall notify the 121a employer in writing of the election within 30 days after July 1, 1953, and any person hereafter accept- ing employment shall give such notice at the time of accepting employment. Any employer may elect not to be subject to the provis ions for Christian Science treatment provided for in this section by filing a written notice of such election with the commissioner of the Department of Labor and Industry, in which event the election of the e mployee shall have no force or effect whatsoever. Subd. 5. Occupational disease medical eligi- bility. Notwithstanding section 176.66, an employee who has contracted an occupational disease is eligi- ble to receive compensation under this section even if the employee is not disabled from earning full wages at the work at which the employee was last employed. Payment of compensation under this section shall be made by the employer and insurer on the date of the employee's last exposure to the hazard of the occupational disease. Reimbursement for medical benefits paid under this su bdivision or subdivision 1a is allowed from the employer and insurer liable under section 176.66, subdivision 10, only in the case of disablement. Subd. 6. Commencement of payment. As soon as reasonably possible, and no later than 30 calendar days after receiving the bill, the employer or insurer shall pay the charge or any portion of the charge which is not denied, or deny all or a part of the charge with written notification to the employee and the provider explaining the basis for denial, except that the employer or insurer is not required to notify the employee of payment of charges that have been reduced in accordan ce with section 176.136, 122a subdivision 1, 1a, or 1b. A ll or part of a charge must be denied if any of the following conditions exists: (1) the injury or condition is not compensable under this chapter; (2) the charge or service is excessive under this section or section 176.136; (3) the charges are not submitted on the prescribed billing form; or (4) additional medical records or reports are required under subdivision 7 to substantiate the nature of the charge and its relationship to the work injury. If payment is denied under clause (3) or (4), the employer or insurer shall reconsider the charges in accordance with this subdiv ision within 30 calendar days after receiving additional medical data, a pre- scribed billing form, or documentation of enrollment or certification as a provider. Subd. 7. Medical bills and records. (a) Health care providers shall submit to the insurer an item- ized statement of charges in the standard electronic transaction format when re quired by section 62J.536 or, if there is no prescribed standard electronic transaction format, on a billing form prescribed by the commissioner. Health ca re providers shall also submit copies of medical records or reports that sub- stantiate the nature of the charge and its relation- ship to the work injury. Health care providers may charge for copies of any records or reports that are in existence and directly rela te to the items for which payment is sought under this chapter. The commis-sioner shall adopt a schedule of reasonable charges by rule. A health care provider shall not collect, attempt to collect, refer a bill for collection, or commence an 123a action for collection against the employee, employer, or any other party until the information required by this section has been furnished. A United States government facility rendering health care services to veterans is not subject to the uniform billing form requirements of this subdivi- sion. (b) For medical services prov ided under this section, the codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, Clinical Modification/ Procedure Coding System ( ICD-10), must be used to report medical diagnose s and hospital inpatient procedures when required by the United States De- partment of Health and Human Services for federal programs. The commissioner must replace the codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification/Procedure Cod- ing System (ICD-9), with equivalent ICD-10 codes wherever the ICD-9 codes appear in rules adopted under this chapter. The commissioner must use the General Equivalence Mappings established by the Centers for Medicare an d Medicaid Services to replace the ICD-9 diagnostic codes with ICD-10 codes in the rules. (c) The commissioner shall amend rules adopted under this chapter as necessary to implement the ICD-10 coding system in paragraph (b). The amendments shall be adopted by giving notice in the State Register according to the procedures in section 14.386, paragraph (a).
