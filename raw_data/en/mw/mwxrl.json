It helps you do everything from eating delicious foods and driving to work to walking around town and laughing with your friends. In the midst of all these activities, your body is exposed to [hundreds of thousands](https://globalhealing.com/downloadable/download/link/id/MC42ODQ2NTYwMCAxNDQ5NTA4ODE3MzgwNTM1NDk3MjMxNzM,/) of toxic chemicals a day. After years of housing harmful toxins, you might start to notice some mild side effects like foggy thinking or skin problems. If these toxins aren't eventually cleared from your body, they could damage your internal organs or lead to disease. [Selah Med Spa](https://www.selahmedispa.com/) in Katy, Texas, helps patients remove detrimental toxins with IonCleanse detox\u00ae to live a healthier life. In one relaxing 30-minute session, IonCleanse uses osmosis to remove unhealthy substances safely through your feet. There are endless benefits a detox session provides, but here are just five of them. 1. Reduce inflammation Inflammation occurs when your body is exposed to injury or foreign substances. During this process, your body uses white blood cells as a barrier to protect itself from bacteria, viruses, and infection \u2014 often caused by exposure to toxins. In one IonCleanse, your body removes these impurities, leaving you with fewer aches, swelling, and stiffness. 2. Purify your blood That cheeseburger and french fries from the drive-through may have sounded like a good idea, but they're clouding your blood with harmful components. Eating fast food means ingesting chemicals that may stay in your body [forever](https://web.uri.edu/steep/fast-food-increases-exposure-to-a-forever-chemical-called-pfas/). When you get an IonCleanse with us, these chemicals are released in the foot bath's water, turning it a murky, dark color. While this may be alarming at first, it just shows the process is working as your body and blood are getting purified by the minute. 3. Lose weight You can diet and exercise all you want, but if your body's holding onto toxins, you may not be effectively losing weight. These harmful chemicals can slow your metabolism or even bring it to a stop. Using your body's natural energy, the IonCleanse infuses the foot bath water with negative ions to create a positive cellular aura. This encourages your body to push out more fat, giving you better weight loss results. 4. Sleep better Do you feel like you never get good, quality sleep? It could be your body's way of telling you it needs a detox. Sleep deprivation can lead to poor performance in your career and, even worse, a lifetime of chronic disease. IonCleanse is a cost-efficient way to help you sleep better and feel your best. Say goodbye to those pesky toxins for good and get the sound shut-eye you deserve. 5. Boost your circulation If your feet are always cold, you might have poor circulation. IonCleanse not only will rejuvenate your feet with its warm, soothing water, but it also will jumpstart the circulation in your feet. Your feet carry you around all day and hold up your weight, so it's important to give them the attention they deserve. You only get one body in this lifetime. Freeing it from harmful toxins and chemicals can give you many health benefits while offering you a little R&R time.
