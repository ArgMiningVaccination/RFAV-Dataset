Several research projects and studies within the state had shown the great need for these schools. Industry was moving into the state while agricultural jobs were decreasing at an accelerated rate. Georgia was rapidly changing from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. This necessitated a rapid transition from the previous general education to the training of technicians, craftsmen, skilled and semi-skilled workers. Georgia now has twenty-three technical colleges, located strategically throughout the state. In 1964 planning began for the funding and construction of the Gainesville-Hall County Area Vocational Trade School. The school would be under the governance of the Hall County Area Board of Education. The Georgia State Board of Education adopted the charter of the institution in December 1964 and became a partner in the governance of the new vocational school which was renamed ten months later as Lanier Area Vocational-Technical School. Lanier Technical College began its first classes in the Fall of 1966. The first classes were conducted in local schools, churches, and civic buildings. In January 1967 the classes were moved into a new administrative and classroom building. During the mid-1970s, Lanier Technical College's facilities were expanded to include a modern industrial training facility with classroom, shop, and administrative space. Six additional buildings were constructed on the Oakwood campus over the next three decades adding classrooms, laboratories and office space needed as the enrollment grew and new programs were added. The College expanded into Forsyth County in 1997. Two buildings were constructed on this new site providing instructional and administrative spaces. In partnership with the Forsyth County government, a third building was completed in 2010 housing additional instructional space as well as a conference center. Three other College expansions occurred. First, in 2002 the College's service delivery area expanded to include Barrow County. A location openedin the City of Winder with the assistance of the City of Winder, Barrow County government, Barrow County Board of Education and Barrow County Industrial Authority. Enrollment expanded beyond the capacity of this building so a new facility was opened in January 2015. Second, in 2003, a site was opened in Commerce in an existing storefront with the help of the Jackson County government. Finally, in 2005 a facility was opened in Dawsonville through a partnership with the Dawson County School System and Dawson County Economic Development Authority. The College soon outgrew the facility and so the building was razed and replaced with a new facility in 2012. Lanier Technical College provides Adult Education classes in a seven county area. Many classes are taught on our Forsyth and Jackson campuses; however, GED and ESL classes are also held in specialized facilities in Banks, Barrow, Hall, and Lumpkin Counties. In 2003, we opened a new facility in Lumpkin County. In 2007 an additional Adult Education Center opened in Banks County, and in 2008 another Center opened in Dawson County. In 2014, the Hall County facility divided to house ESL instruction at the Stallworth Street location in Gainesville and GED instruction at Wood's Mill Adult Education Center in Gainesville. When the College opened the new Barrow Campus in 2015, the old facility converted to the Winder-Barrow Adult Education Center.In 2006 The Governor's Center for Innovation in Manufacturing Excellence opened at the college's Oakwood campus. This center provides research, training, and support services in advanced manufacturing techniques. Also, in 2006 The Manufacturing Development Center opened in the Featherbone Communiversity campus in Gainesville. The Manufacturing Development Center is attached operationally to the Center of Innovation and is an incubator devoted to assisting and renting space to small start-up companies specializing in manufacturing. In 2006 the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center opened at the college's Oakwood campus in Building 500. This center provides research, training, and support services in advanced manufacturing techniques. Also, in 2006 The Manufacturing Development Center opened in the Featherbone Communiversity in Gainesville.

The principles of academic freedom guarantee the right to teach or learn without unreasonable interference from authority and are essential to the mission of the College. Academic freedom is subject to the norms and standards of scholarly inquiry and College policies and procedures on gifts, honoraria, and stipends. As a community of scholars dedicated to the premise of life-long learning, Lanier Technical College encourages faculty and students to examine and discuss questions and issues of interest to them. In the development of knowledge, research endeavors, and creative activities, faculty and students must be free to cultivate a spirit of inquiry and scholarly criticism. Fundamental to an opportunity for free inquiry and expression is the right to assemble in accordance with College and Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) policies. Faculty members and students are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject. Caution must be used not to introduce material that has no relation to the instructional field. Faculty and students must be able to examine ideas in an atmosphere of freedom and confidence and to participate as responsible citizens in community affairs. As per the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) policy, Lanier Technical College faculty members must carry out their responsibilities in a professional and ethical manner and must not bring discredit upon the College or the State of Georgia by engaging in conduct reflecting discredit to the technical college. Faculty members must fulfill their responsibilities to society and to their profession by manifesting competence, professional discretion, and good citizenship. They will be free from institutional censorship or discipline when they speak or write as good citizens. As professional educators, faculty members must be accurate, exercise appropriate restraint, show respect for the opinions of others, and make every effort to indicate they are not speaking for the institution. The principles of academic freedom shall not prevent the College from making proper efforts to ensure the best possible instruction for all students in accordance with the objectives of the institution and the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG). Any instructor or student who believes that he/she has been denied academic freedom should follow Lanier Technical College's complaint and grievance procedures.

Each student who fails to make adequate academic progress toward his/her academic goal will be notified by the Registrar's Office at the end of the semester. Grades Grades on the transcript will be recorded in letter grades. An overall 2.0 GPA (Grade Point Average) is required for graduation. A minimum grade of C may be required for progress from specified courses to more advanced courses. The following grading scale is used for all Lanier Technical College students: 90 - 100 = A (4.0)80 - 89 = B (3.0) 70 - 79 = C (2.0) 60 - 69 = D (1.0)59 or below = F (0)WF WP W I AU EX AC TR TRA TRB TRCWithdrawn Failing = F (0) after mid-termWithdrawn Passing after mid-term Withdrawn prior to mid-term IncompleteAudit (Non-Credit)ExemptionArticulated CreditTransfer CreditTransfer Credit A - not calculated in GPATransfer Credit B - not calculated in GPATransfer Credit C - not calculated in GPA A student may be issued a grade of Incomplete (I) at the discretion of the instructor and only in the case where a student is unable to complete the coursework on time due to circumstances beyond his/her control. An Incomplete must be converted to a grade before midterm of the following semester from the date the Incomplete was recorded or it will be converted to a punitive failing grade (F). A grade of W may be issued during the first half of the term. This grade does not affect the student's GPA but may affect financial aid eligibility. A grade of WP or WF may be issued to a student who withdrew after mid-term depending upon his/her actual grades. The grade of WF will be calculated as an F in the GPA. These grades may affect financial aid eligibility. Calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) For calculating GPA, each letter grade has a point value. Listed below are the values: A = 4B = 3C = 2D = 1F = 0WF = 0 The grade points are determined by multiplying the number of points a grade is worth times the credit hours a course carries. Thus a grade of an A (4 points) in a 5 credit hour course (4 x 5) equals 20 points. The same grade A in a 3 credit hour course (4 x 3) equals 12 points. Example: A student's grades may appear as follows: Course Credit Hours Grade Points ENGL 1010 Fundamentals of English 3 B (3) 9 MATH 1012 Foundations of Mathematics 3 A (4) 12 CIST 1001 Computer Concepts 4 D (1) 4 Total Points 25 Individual course points are added together to determine total points. To determine the GPA, divide total points by total credit hours: 25 / 10 = 2.5 GPA.Catalog - Academic Standing Policy http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/Academic%20Standing.aspx[11/20/2017 3:21:44 PM] Academic Probation A student who fails to maintain a 2.0 GPA in any semester will be placed on academic probation. The purpose of academic probation is to alert the student that his/her academic performance is not acceptable and to point out the possible consequences if improvements are not made during the next semester of enrollment. A student placed on academic probation (or admitted on probation) must attain a minimum 2.0 GPA during the next semester in attendance to remove himself/herself from probationary status. A student who fails to do so is subject to academic dismissal. Academic Dismissal A student who fails to attain a minimum 2.0 GPA the next semester in attendance after being placed on probation is subject to academic dismissal. A student who is academically dismissed must stay out of college one full semester before petitioning the Office of Admissions for readmission. A second academic dismissal could constitute a final dismissal from the student's current program of study. Academic Dismissal Waiver Request Procedure Any student placed on academic dismissal may request a waiver (of the one semester absence from the college) by petitioning the Vice President of Academic Affairs or the Vice President of IE and Operations. The waiver request should be in writing and should include the reason for the decline in GPA and the plan to correct the problem or situation including steps taken to prevent future grade problems. The Vice President will consider prior academic history, work responsibilities, time constraints, etc. in determining whether to grant the waiver request. If the Vice President decides to grant the waiver request, he/she will notify the student, program instructor, and the Registrar's Office in writing or via E-Mail.

It is recalculated after each semester to include the current semester's grade(s). The CGPA is not affected by program of study, changes in program of study, or student classification. The cumulative grade point average is that grade point average calculated on all attempts at all credit courses taken at the Technical College. The Graduation Grade Point Average calculation includes only those courses required for graduation. When a course is taken more than once, the final or highest grade will be used in calculating the grade point average for graduation. A.2.0 grade point average is needed for graduation. The Semester Grade Point Average is that average calculated based on all credit courses taken each semester at the Technical College.If a student completely withdraws from courses after being called to military duty, the course registration status is recorded as 'WM' for 'Withdraw Military'.

Procedure Questions and concerns about grades are often the result of misunderstandings about grading practices and expected standards. Direct communication between the instructor and the student, including review of the course syllabus, usually resolves these misunderstandings. If a student receives a course grade which he/she believes is incorrect, the student should contact the instructor no later than the end of the first week of the following semester to discuss the concern. If conversation with the instructor does not resolve the matter, the student will follow the grade appeal procedure: 1. The student will contact the appropriate Academic Dean to file the \"Grade Appeal Form\" and to request a meeting to discuss the issue. The Academic Dean will conduct an investigation in an effort to resolve the appeal and will give the student an interpretation of the grade. 2. If no solution is found after meeting with the Academic Dean, the student may file an appeal with the Vice President of Academic Affairs before the mid-term of the semester following the semester in which the grade was received, or the student will lose his/her right to appeal. 3. Upon receiving the completed appeal form, the Vice President of Academic Affairs will review the appeal, notify the instructor that an appeal has been made, and activate the Grade Appeals Committee to hear the student's appeal. Membership of this committee includes: An Academic Dean, other than the one consulted in Step 2 A faculty member from a department not involved in the appeal appointed by the Vice President A faculty member selected by the student making the appeal A faculty member selected by the instructor whose grade is being appealed 4. Since the hearing conducted by the Grade Appeals Committee is an in-house procedure and not a court of law, no legal counsel or any other person may be present except the student, the instructor, and appointed members of the committee. Exceptions to this would be granted by the Vice President only in the case of a disabled student requiring some highly specialized extraordinary assistance that could not be routinely provided by the chair or another member of the committee. 5. A meeting of the Grade Appeals Committee is scheduled by the Committee Chair within two weeks of receiving the appeal. 6. On the date of the hearing, the Grade Appeals Committee convenes at the appointed place with the aggrieved student and involved faculty member. The chair of the committee presides at the meeting. The committee examines the evidence, calls witnesses as necessary, and keeps informal minutes of the proceedings that shall be available to the Vice President and President. 7. The faculty member involved in the appeal presents his/her case to the committee (no longer than 15 minutes) and calls witnesses and/or presents documentation for the committee to read later. The aggrieved student is not present during this presentation. The committee may question the faculty member concerning his/her testimony. Following completion of the testimony, the faculty member is dismissed. 8. The student involved in the appeal presents his/her case to the committee (no longer than 15 minutes) and calls witnesses and/or presents documentation for the committee to read later.

Learning Support students must earn a grade of C or higher on the coursework and pass this test with a grade of 70% or higher in order to advance to the next level of Learning Support or to credit courses. Example ENG 097 student Joe has an average of 78 for all course work and a grade of 62 on the college proficiency test. Since a score of 70 or higher is required to pass the course, the instructor turns in a grade of D for the course. The student registration system (BANNER) blocks Joe's ability to register for ENG 098. Thus Joe must repeat ENG 097.

Programs The following programs are authorized to perform live work: Automotive Collision Repair Automotive Technology Cosmetic Esthetician Cosmetology Dental Assisting Dental Hygiene Environmental Horticulture Medical Skin Care Printing and Graphics Technology Welding and Joining Technology Any additional program that wants to perform live work must obtain the approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs or Vice President of Campus Operations, Vice President of Administrative Services, and the President. Definitions Live work is defined as student work which is conducted as an integral part of a credit program which enhances a student's knowledge and skills by providing the student with the opportunity to work under real-world working conditions. Type and Scope of Work Live work must always involve student participation and cannot be performed solely by the instructor. Instructors should participate in live work activities only for demonstration purposes. Live work will only be accepted as an integral part of the Lanier Technical College curriculum that provides student training in skill development and customer service. Prior to acceptance, all live work requests will be evaluated by the instructor for suitability to the curriculum. All live work must be done on a noncommercial basis with the exception of Lanier Technical College and the Technical College System of Georgia property. Since live work is done on a modest \"cost plus\" basis by a nonprofit institution, the local after-market businesses would be at a considerable disadvantage in competing with the college's live work programs. This situation could damage the college's image within the local community. Under no circumstances may a student or instructor receive money, rewards, or benefits or in any way personally profit from live work. The customer must be informed that he/she assumes the risk of the work being performed. All work must comply with the Governor's Executive Order on Ethics. Prioritized List of Persons Live work will be performed for the following groups in priority order: Lanier Technical College Technical College System of Georgia Students Instructors and staff members Local, state, and federal entities General public Hours of OperationAll live work projects must be conducted only during normal operating hours of Lanier Technical College.Catalog - Live Work Procedures http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/Live Work Procedures.aspx[11/20/2017 3:27:30 PM] All exceptions must be approved in advance by the Vice President of Academic Affairs or the Vice President of Campus Operations. Customer Costs Materials, parts, and supplies used in live work must be paid for by the customer. All programs will charge a laboratory fee that has been preapproved by the Vice President of Academic Affairs or the Vice President of Campus Operations. As appropriate, programs will charge a hazardous materials disposal fee. All purchases for items used in live work must be processed using the college's purchasing guidelines and recorded in the college's accounting system. Payment received through live work must be receipted using work orders, cash registers, or other receipts approved through Administrative Services, reconciled, and submitted at least weekly to the cashier for deposit in the college's bank account. Work Scheduling and Customer Payment Procedures When a customer requests a live work project, the instructor must insure that the project is within the scope of the college's live work procedures. The instructor will complete a written work order and determine if the customer will supply parts and materials or if the customer expects the program to supply them. The instructor must inform the customer that the work will be performed by students and that he/she assumes the risk for the work being performed. Customers must sign the declarations of assumption of risk and waivers of liability. Except for programs that have published prices for services (i.e., Cosmetology, Dental Hygiene), the instructor will inform the customer that the project will include a laboratory fee, parts, materials, and hazardous material disposal fee (if applicable) and that the college is not responsible for accident or theft of customer's property. No work is to be done gratis. The instructor will not provide a formal estimate of cost nor completion date. As work is completed, the instructor will list supplies and materials used and services performed on the work order along with costs. Once the work is completed, the instructor will complete the work order and add applicable taxes. The instructor will notify the customer that the work is completed. The customer will sign the work order to indicate that he/she is satisfied that the work has been completed. The customer must pay the cashier, instructor, or student in full (using the approved receipt/collection procedures) before the project can be released. After the customer has paid, the cashier, instructor, or student will provide him/her with a copy of the paid work order or receipt, keep a copy for the program's records, and submit a copy to Administrative Services with the reconcilement. If the customer pays the cashier, a copy of the work order should be given to him/her to leave with the cashier. The cashier will give the customer a receipt to show to the instructor who will mark the work order as paid. If the customer pays the instructor, the instructor should mark paid on all copies of the work order. Security will pick up live work monies at least weekly along with copies of the work orders or receipts and the reconcilement completed by the instructor/student and return them to the cashier. Use of Live Work FundsExcess funds accumulated in program live work accounts after all expenses have been paid may be used to enhance the program.

This act can range from not citing an author for ideas and/or published material (including work from the Internet) to copying and pasting information from websites or any other publications, as well as paying for a paper written by someone else. Using someone else's words or ideas in an oral presentation without giving credit is yet another form of plagiarism. The temptation to commit plagiarism is greater than ever with all the information from the Internet. In addition, it is now easier to identify plagiarized material than ever before. Some instructors have access to the program Turnitin.com , a good resource for flagging plagiarism. Everyone has access to the Internet, and a copied and pasted sentence or section into Google will reveal if the information has been published elsewhere. In other words, detection of plagiarism is easy for instructors. If a student is not sure what is correct and acceptable, guidance from your instructor should be sought. There are also many websites available giving specific examples of how to avoid plagiarizing. Procedure This is the procedure Lanier Technical College will follow in regards to plagiarized work received from a student. When an instructor identifies plagiarized material, he or she will assign a grade of zero to the submission. The zero may be considered a consequence of not meeting the stated criteria for the task as well as of plagiarizing. In the event that the plagiarized material is part of the course exit examination, the zero will also result in failure of the course. A copy of the assignment in which the plagiarism took place with documentation of the source of the original material will be given to the student and sent to the dean of academic affairs or campus director to be filed. If there is a second infraction by the student in any class during his/her remaining tenure at Lanier Technical College, the dean/director will contact the individual and counsel the student regarding academic repercussions. Penalties for the second act of plagiarism will be the same as the first, plus the instructor's option of giving the student an F in the course. See Code of Conduct from Student Handbook for the full scope of expected student conduct and penalties for infractions.

The official FERPA statement is availablefor student view on the College's website, in the Catalog/Student Handbook, and on the ANGEL LearningManagement System (LMS) main page. LTC issues a unique username and password to each student upon enrollment and each College employee upon date of employment who is required to access the ANGEL Learning Management System, the platform the College uses for distance education. ANGEL is a secure environment where faculty memberspost course materials, assignments and exams, provide chat and discussion forums for their courses, andwhere students participate in forum discussions, chat sessions, upload assignments, and take quizzes andexams. The privacy of individual students' assessments and grades is maintained within the learningmanagement system. Anyone using ANGEL is required to have a unique username and password to access any learning management resources. Faculty are restricted to accessing information associated with the specificcourses they teach. Students are automatically enrolled in courses through a batch process run by theANGEL Administrator each semester and identified by their unique username and password. Students arerestricted to information allowed by faculty members in courses for which they have enrolled andstudent-group related activities in a given course. Course and user profile information is not visible to anyone without an account. Authorized ANGEL users cannot view the profile information of other users unless those users give permission. Secure Login and Password: Each distance learning faculty and student enters his/her username and password into ANGEL to gain access to authorized ANGEL learning environment resources. Thiscombination of username and password identifies faculty and students to the system on each course visit.Upon initial login, students and faculty are given the opportunity to change their password. LTC keeps norecord of the student's password once it has been changed. A lost password link can be emailed to thefaculty's or student's email address if requested by the student or faculty member. Students areresponsible for keeping their password confidential. LMS Password Resets are submitted through email toour helpdesk. To protect the privacy of students, those working the helpdesk are trained to reset thepassword to match the original login. This login is automatically sent to the student's secure LTC emailaccount. If the request is received over the phone, the passwords are reset following the sameprocedure. In addition, LTC uses an online account host (Banner Web) to enable students to view their personal information, class schedules, final course grades, and transcripts. Upon admission to the College, students are assigned a unique username and password to access this information. Upon log in to theirBanner Web account, students are given the opportunity to change their passwords for security purposes. Each student is assigned a unique student email address by the College. This student email system is maintained by the College and provides students with a secure login environment.

However, some programs' attendance policies are more stringent because they are based on licensing requirements.Three incidents of being tardy for class equates to an absence. When a student has only two more absences before violating the attendance policy, the instructor will provide a written (hand delivered, mailed, or electronic mail) warning that dismissal from the course for excessive absences is near, with a copy to the academic supervisor.Attendance Regulations Violations Procedures 1. When a student's program allows only two more absences before violation of the program's attendance policy, the instructor will provide a written warning. This warning should be via the Attendance Regulations Violation Form and may be transmitted by E-mail or hard copy. 2. The instructor will meet with the student to discuss the reasons for absences and/or incidents of tardiness. This meeting should include development of a plan to prevent additional absences and/or tardiness. This plan may include referral to the Coordinator of Disability Services or periodic follow- up meetings with an academic administrator. 3. If the student is absent two more times, the instructor will refer the student to the academic supervisor for approval of dismissal action. Under exceptional circumstances, the academic supervisor may decide not to dismiss the student but may impose other sanctions. 4. As a part of the dismissal meeting with the student, the instructor or academic supervisor should discuss re-enrollment options for the following quarter. Code of Conduct Violations Procedures 1. The instructor will refer any student who violates any of the academically-related code of conduct actions to the academic supervisor. The instructor will refer any student who violates any of the other code of conduct actions to the Vice President for Student Affairs. 2.

Transfer Credit from Non-Regionally Accredited Institutions For coursework taken at non-regionally accredited institutions, the Office of the Registrar and the Academic Affairs division determine the transferability of courses taken at other postsecondary institutions by considering the educational quality of the learning experience for which students seek transfer credit. The Office of the Registrar mails a Faculty Credential Verification Form to the previous institution. The VPAA validates the credentials of the faculty who taught the course(s). The Office of the Registrar, the VPAA, and - when appropriate - faculty credentialed in the field evaluate the comparability of the nature, content, and level of the learning experiences to the courses offered at Lanier Technical College; the appropriateness and applicability of the learning experiences to the programs offered at Lanier Technical College; and the length of time that has passed since the course was taken. In cases where course equivalency is questioned, credit must be validated by examination. Articulated Credit Students who graduated from a Georgia high school within the previous 24 months may be eligible to earn credit for high school coursework. Students wishing to receive articulated credit must complete a Request for Articulated Credit Form in the Office of Student Affairs, and complete a validation exam for each course selected.

The Net Price Calculator is a tool for students and parents to obtain an estimate of what it may cost to attend Lanier Technical College. The information you receive from thecalculator is a broad estimate for first-time, full-time students and may vary from studentto student depending on personal factors. It is an estimate based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in a previous year. The estimates are not binding on Lanier Technical College or the state. How does it work? To estimate your net cost of attending Lanier Technical College, the Net Price Calculator first considers the colleges' cost of attendance, which includes tuition, fees, books and supplies, as well as those costs related to normal living expenses such as room and board and other personal expenses. Next, using financial data you enter into the calculator, the calculator estimates the amount that you/your family could reasonably expect tocontribute to pay for college expenses. Finally, the calculator evaluates your eligibility forfinancial aid (need-based and non-need based) by matching your financial aid personalcharacteristics to the criteria the college uses to determine financial aid awards. How can the Net Price Calculator help me? Net price is the key to understanding what a specific college is likely to cost and allows you to better compare your out-of-pocket expense for one college to another. Pleasenote that in estimating costs for a technical college, the calculator assumes the student isattending year-round, including a summer term. Other colleges may only assumeattendance for fall and spring terms, but not summer. Getting Started Completing the calculator should take just a few minutes of your time. You will need to answer some basic questions about you/your family's financial situation so it might behelpful to have recent tax forms or pay stubs on hand before you begin. This is not anofficial application for financial aid. To be considered for financial aid, please complete theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov .

Determine a student's withdrawal date. 2. Determine the amount of aid disbursed for the payment period. 3. Determine the amount of Title IV aid disbursed plus the Title IV aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period. 4. Determine the percentage of Title IV aid the student earned by dividing the number of calendar days attended during the semester by the total number of calendar days in the semester. 5. Calculate amount of Title IV aid earned by the student by multiplying the above percentage by the total of Title IV aid disbursed plus the Title IV aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period. 6. Determine if student is due a Post-withdrawal Disbursement or if Title IV aid must be returned. If the amount of Title IV aid earned is greater than the total of Title IV aid disbursed then subtract the Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period from the amount of Title IV aid earned. This is the amount of the post-withdrawal disbursement due. If the amount of Total Title IV aid disbursed is greater than the amount of Title IV Aid earned by the student, then subtract the amount of Title IV aid earned from Title IV aid disbursed for the payment period. This is the amount of Title IV aid that must be returned. 7. Calculate amount of unearned Title IV aid due from the college. Multiply institutional charges for the payment period times the percentage of Title IV aid unearned. Compare this amount to the amount of Title IV aid to be returned and enter the lesser amount. 8. Determine return of funds by college. The college must return the unearned aid for which the college is responsible by repaying funds to the appropriate sources. 9. Calculate initial amount of unearned Title IV aid due from student. Subtract the amount of Title IV aid due from the college from the amount of Title IV aid to be returned. 10.

(Note: the first instructional day of a term is the day classes begin, which is not necessarily the first day of an individual student's schedule.) Students who withdraw from a course after the third instructional day of the term shall receive no refund. Refunds are processed when a student withdraws from a course or the college, or is withdrawn from the college. The student is not required to request a refund.

Students are responsible for maintaining an acceptable level of progress regarding quality and quantity of work. Financial aid regulations require that we monitor course completion rate as well as cumulative GPA. To maintain eligibility for financial aid at Lanier Technical College, students must earn a cumulative GPA (grade point average) of 2.0 or better, and satisfactorily complete at least two-thirds (66.6%) of all course work (credit hours) attempted. Effective Summer Quarter 2008, Lanier Technical College will provide a three day \"NO HARM-NO FOUL\" drop period for all students. Students who withdraw from a course by the end of the third instructional day of the term will not receive a grade for the course and these courses will NOT appear on the student's academic transcript. Note: An instructional day is based on the academic calendar, not an individual student's schedule. Classes dropped after the end of the third instructional day of the term will appear on each student's academic transcript and will receive a grade of W (withdraw), WP (withdrawn passing), and/or WF (withdrawn failing). Grades of I, W, WP, and IP are not used in calculating a student's GPA, but are counted as course work attempted. Courses receiving grades of W, WP, WF, I, IP, and F are not considered satisfactorily completed hours and will affect a student's future financial aid eligibility. The Offices of Student Affairs and Financial Aid have developed the following standards of satisfactory progress which a student must achieve in order to maintain federal/state aid eligibility: General Provisions & Eligibility Requirements 1. Students must be enrolled in an eligible program to be approved for federal or state financial aid. Students accepted into the Special Admission status are not eligible for Title IV aid. Regular or provisionally admitted students may receive Title IV benefits if eligible. Technical certificate programs are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if they meet the minimum training requirements for Title IV benefits. 2. Effective with the 2012-2013 award year, a student must have: a high school diploma, or a GED certificate, or completed homeschooling at the secondary level as defined by state law to receive Title IV funds. However, students who were enrolled in an eligible educational program of study before July 1, 2012 may continue to be considered Title IV eligible under the Ability to Benefit (ATB) test standards or by completing at least six credit hours of college work that is applicable to a degree or certificate. 3. Exempted and audited courses may not be counted in the calculation of a student's total credit hours for determination of Title IV financial aid benefits. 4. Title IV aid can be awarded to students enrolled in diploma, degree and approved certificate programs who are taking online/internet courses. 5. Transfer students will be assumed to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress for the first semester enrolled. After the first semester, the student will be responsible for meeting all Lanier Technical College academic progress requirements. 6. \"I\" (incomplete) is used to indicate that the student is doing satisfactory work but has not completed all requirements for the course by the end of the semester. Any course receiving an \"I\" designation must be completed by the midterm of the following semester or the \"I\" will convert to a grade of F. 7. Learning Support courses are included in hours attempted (qualitative assessment). Students are allowed to receive financial aid for no more than 30 semester hours of Learning Support courses and must show academic progress in the remedial coursework. Successful completion of learning support classes requires a C* or better. 8. Transfer credits that count toward the student's current program must count as both attempted and completed hours. 9. Academic progress determinations will be made each semester after grades have been posted. 10. To maintain eligibility for financial aid at Lanier Technical College, students must successfully complete 66.6% of all cumulative credit hours attempted and maintain a cumulative GPA (grade point average) of 2.0. Any course for which a student registers will be counted in the maximum time frame and percentage calculations. Quantitative and qualitative standards must be cumulativeCatalog - Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for Students Receiving Federal or State Financial Aid http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.aspx[11/20/2017 3:41:24 PM] and must include all periods of the student's enrollment; even periods in which the student did not receive SFA funds must be counted. A student will be notified in writing by the Office of Financial Aid if he/she is in violation of the standards of satisfactory progress. 11. Courses receiving grades of I, IP, W, W*, WP, WP*, WF, WF*,D*, F, and F* are not considered completed hours. A student who fails to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or to complete 66.6% of all credit hours attempted will be placed on financial aid warning for one semester. The purpose of financial aid warning is to alert the student that his or her academic performance is not acceptable. A student placed on financial aid warning must attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 and achieve the required completion rate by the end of the next semester in attendance to remove him/her from the warning status. A student on financial aid warning is eligible for Title IV aid. 12. Students who do not meet SAP standards under the Warning status at the end of the subsequent semester will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. Students on financial aid suspension are not eligible to receive financial aid. 13. Students have the right to appeal the denial of financial aid if they feel there are extenuating circumstances, which prevented them from meeting the specified requirements. Appeals must be written and must specifically address the extenuating circumstances. All documentation and/or letters of appeal must be received by the Office of Financial Aid at least one day prior to the committee's scheduled meeting at the beginning of each semester, specified in the suspension letter. Late appeals may be considered on a case by case basis. The committee will provide a written decision to the student within four (4) calendar days of the committee's meeting. 14. Students who file an appeal and who should be able to meet the SAP standards by the end of the subsequent payment period will be placed on probation without an academic plan. If the student, based on the appeal, requires more than one payment period to meet progress standards, the student must provide an Academic Plan completed and signed by the student and his/her advisor to the Office of Financial Aid. The student is eligible to receive Title IV aid as long as the student continues to meet the academic plan requirements. A 100% pass rate for the term is required. Any withdrawals or failing grades will result in suspension of the academic plan. 15. Reinstatement of financial aid after a student's aid has been terminated for lack of satisfactory academic progress can be achieved once a student has attained the required cumulative GPA of 2.0 and has successfully completed 66.6% of all credit hours attempted. 16. Students must complete their educational objective within a maximum time frame based on enrollment status and program length not to exceed 150% of the published length of the program. For example, for a four semester program, the maximum time frame to receive financial aid is six semesters. Enrollment of less than full-time will be pro-rated accordingly. Students who change their program of study will be allowed the maximum time frame for the new program of study. No financial aid will be available after the specified limits. However, factors beyond the student's control, such as conflicts in scheduling classes, will be considered. 17. Beginning July 1, 2011 students may receive federal financial aid for one repeat of a previously passed course. For this purpose, passed means any grade higher than an 'F', regardless of any school or program policy requiring a higher qualitative grade. A student may be repeatedly paid for repeatedly failing the same course (SAP policy still applies), and if a student withdraws before completing the course that they are being paid TIV funds for retaking, then that is not counted as their one allowed retake for that course. However, if a student passed a class once and then is repaid for retaking it and fails the second time, that failure counts as their paid retake and the student may not be paid for retaking the class a third time.

If you have lost federal student aid eligibility due to a drug conviction, you can regain eligibility if you pass two unannounced drug tests conducted by a drug rehabilitation program that complies with criteria established by the U.S. Department of Education. Civil Commitment for Sexual Offenses - A student subject to an involuntary civil commitment after completing a period of incarceration for a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense is ineligible to receive a Federal Pell grant.Even if you are ineligible for federal aid, you should complete the FAFSA because you may be eligible for nonfederal aid from state institutions. If you regain eligibility during the award year, notify your financial aid administrator immediately. If you are convicted of a drug-related offense after you submit the FAFSA, you might lose eligibility for federal student aid, and you might be liable for returning any financial aid you received during a period of ineligibility. If you have a question about your citizenship status, contact the financial aid office at the college or career school you plan to attend.How will I know what I'm eligible for? The information you reported on your FAFSA is used to determine your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), which is calculated by a formula established by law. You may think of the EFC as an index that colleges use to determine how much financial aid (grants, loans or work-study) you would receive if you were to attend their school. If your EFC is below a certain number, you'll be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant assuming you meet all other eligibility requirements. The amount of your Pell Grant depends on your EFC, your cost of attendance (which the financial aid administrator at your college or career school will determine), and your enrollment status (full time,Catalog - Federal Grant Eligibility Requirements http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/General%20Provisions%20and%20Eligibility%20Requirements.aspx[11/20/2017 3:44:43 PM] three-quarter time, half time, or less than half time). For our other aid programs, the financial aid administrator at your college or career school takes your cost of attendance and then subtracts your EFC, the amount of a Federal Pell Grant you are eligible for, and aid you will get from other sources. The result is your remaining financial need: Cost of Attendance - EFC - Federal Pell Grant Eligibility - Aid From Other Sources = Remaining Financial Need A financial aid administrator can consider special or unusual circumstances such as unusual medical expenses, unemployment, etc. and can adjust your cost of attendance or some of the information used to calculate your EFC. You'll have to provide your college or career school with documentation to justify any change.

Students who demonstrate financial need, who are enrolled in a Pell eligible program and have not received a bachelor's degree may qualify for this grant. Most short-term certificate programs do not meet the program length requirements as established by the U.S. Department of Education and therefore do not meet the definition of a Pell eligible program. Most diploma and all associate degree programs are Pell eligible programs. Pell awards are payable in three equal installments to be disbursed at the beginning of the 5th week of the term. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form in order to determine eligibility. This aid does not have to be repaid provided the recipient meets all federal requirements . Special Admissions students are not eligible for federal financial aid benefits. Pell Grant awards are based on a student's enrollment status, cost of attendance, program of study and degree of financial need. Student's registered for classes during Part of Term 3 which begins during the second half of the semester will receive those Pell funds after the drop/add period for Part of Term 3 as required by the U.S. Department of Education. Every year, Federal regulations require all post-secondary institutions to complete verifications on a select number of their Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA ) applicants. The students are selected by either the U.S. Department of Education or Lanier Technical College. Students who withdraw from the college before the end of the 6th week of the semester will have their Pell award pro-rated. Students who have their award recalculated may owe back a significant portion of their Pell Grant disbursement. Holds may be placed on student accounts for any unpaid balances owed to the college. Holds may prevent registration, receipt of transcripts, and graduation. Pell funds are available for use at the bookstore approximately one week prior to the beginning of the term. Selective Service registration is required for financial aid eligibility. Males who failed to register who can demonstrate extenuating circumstances that resulted in their failure to register may file an appeal with the College. Appeals will be reviewed by the Financial Aid Review Committee once each term. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for the Selective Service Appeal form and the deadline date for filing the appeal. The Financial Aid Review Committee's decision is final and cannot be appealed with U.S. Department of Education.

These organizations contribute to the development of a spirit of community participation and involvement on campus. In addition, students learn appropriate workforce skills in their leadership and campus service and training, which aid them in being productive and responsible citizens in their communities. Procedure for Establishing a Student Organization Establishing a student organization is rewarding and gives students the opportunity to take their educational experience to the next level. They learn valuable skills that they normally wouldn't get in the classroom. It also gives them opportunities to meet people from industry, fellow classmates, staff and faculty and often inspires them to do even better as a student. There are certain procedures that must be adhered to when starting a new club. Listed below is a guide to get you started and support you in your endeavors: 1. Establish the name of the club. 2. Identify a faculty or staff member that will serve as the advisor for the student organization. 3. Write a brief statement of purpose for the organization.

Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of this academic community, students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for knowledge. Freedom to teach and freedom to learn are inseparable facets of academic conditions in the classroom, on the campus, other college sites, and in the community. Students are expected to exercise their freedom with responsibility. As members of the academic community, students are subject to the obligations which accrue to them by virtue of this membership. As members of the larger community of which the college is a part, students are entitled to all rights and protection accorded them by the laws of the community. By the same token, students are also subject to all laws, the enforcement of which is the responsibility of duly constituted authorities. When students violate laws, they may incur penalties prescribed by legal authorities. In such instances, college discipline will be initiated if the presence of the student on campus is considered a possible threat to persons or property, or if that person's presence may disrupt the educational process of the college. However, when a student's violation of the law also adversely affects the college's recognized educational objectives, or violates the college's Student Code of Conduct, the college will enforce its own regulations. When students violate college regulations, they are subject to disciplinary action by the college whether or not their conduct violates the law.It is the policy of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) to provide technical and adult education programs for the people of Georgia. Technical Colleges must provide opportunities for intellectual, emotional, social, and physical growth. Technical College students assume an obligation to act in a manner compatible with the fulfillment of the mission. The Technical College community recognizes its responsibility to provide an atmosphere conducive to growth. With these principles in mind, the Technical College System of Georgia establishes this Student Code of Conduct. Generally, Technical college jurisdiction and discipline shall be limited to conduct which occurs on Technical College Premises, off-campus classes, activities, or functions sponsored by the Technical College, an examination or any other written or oral work submitted for evaluation and/or grade, or which otherwise adversely affects members of the Technical College Community and/or pursuit of the Technical College's objectives.

Lanier Technical College expects faculty, staff, and students to meet appropriate standards of performance, to observe basic rules for good conduct, and to comply with college Student and Personnel Policies and Procedures. In the discharge of its responsibilities as an employer, Lanier Technical College aggressively promotes and requires a drug-free campus among its students, faculty, and staff. Institutional standards of conduct clearly prohibit the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol on campus or as part of any institutional-sponsored activities. Sanctions up to and including dismissal and referral for prosecution will be imposed for the violation of these standards. The Office of Student Affairs provides assistance to students with drug or alcohol-related problems. Criminal Sanctions: Federal law prohibits the possession, manufacture, or distribution of various controlled substances. Penalties for these offenses vary depending upon the severity of the convictions but may include imprisonment of up to 40 years with large fines. Penalties double when the offenses occur within 1,000 feet of a postsecondary educational institution. Title 20-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated states that any student of a public educational institution who is convicted under the laws of the state, the United States, or any other state of any felony offense involving the manufacture, distribution, sale, possession, or use of marijuana, a controlled substance, or a dangerous drug shall as of the date of conviction be suspended from the public educational institution in which such person is enrolled. Except for cases in which the college has previously taken disciplinary action against a student for the same offense, such suspension shall be effective as of the date of conviction even though the educational institution may not complete all administrative actions necessary to implement such suspension until a later date. Except for cases in which the institution has already imposed the term, quarter, semester, or other similar period for which the student was enrolled as of the date of conviction, the student shall forfeit any right to any academic credit otherwise earned or earnable for such term, quarter, semester, or other similar period; and the educational institution shall subsequently revoke any such academic credit which is granted prior to the completion of administrative actions necessary to implement such suspension. Title 20-3-2 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated specifies that any student organization functioning in conjunction with, incidental to the college which through its officers, agents or responsible members knowingly permits or authorizes the sale, distribution, serving, possession, consumption or use of marijuana, a controlled substance or dangerous drug at any affair, function or activity of that student organization, social or otherwise, which such sales, distribution, serving, possession, consumption or use is not in compliance with the laws of this state, shall be expelled from campus for a minimum of one calendar year from the year of determination of guilt, which it is affiliated or at which it operates, with any and all leasing, possession or use agreements respecting the student organization's use of institutional property to be terminated by operation of law for any such knowing, permission or authorization of the unlawful actions defined in the Code section, subject to the administrative review and hearing procedures set for in this Code section. Failure to comply with any part of this program will result in serious adverse personnel action, including dismissal or the requirement that the offender satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse assistance program which has been approved for such purposes by a federal, state or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency. Drug use puts the individual at risk of addiction, violence, unplanned and unsafe sex, and suicide in addition to often permanent damage to the user's body. Damage to the brain, liver and overall body systems often occurs. Malnutrition, loss of teeth and hair, and sores on the skin are also side effects of certain drugs. Drug users are often irritable, argumentative, tired, and have many absences due to loss of interest in school and a negative attitude.Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the Human Resources Office if it is in regard to employees and to Special Populations if it is in regard to students.Catalog - Drug Free Campus Act http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/Drug%20Free%20Campus%20Act.aspx[11/20/2017 3:58:37 PM] Sources of Help for Alcohol/Drug Dependency AVITA PARTNERS Behavioral Health Services (Low income/sliding scale fees) Locations: Hall County Forsyth County Banks County Dawson County 678-207-2900 678-341-3840706-894-3700706-864-6822 Laurelwood (Mental Health Services at Northeast Georgia Medical Center)770-219-3800 HALT Club (Twelve Step Program)770-534-3777 National Clearinghouse for Drug and Alcohol Information 1-800-729-6686 United Way 2.1.1 Helpline 770-534-0617 Select Language Catalog - E-mail Communication http://www.laniertech.edu/coc/E-mail%20Communication.aspx[11/20/2017 3:58:56 PM] Lanier Technical College 2017 - 2018 Catalog and Student Handbook Telephone Directory Location Maps Calendar Menu Catalog Home General Information Academic Regulations Admissions Campus Facilities Course Descriptions Financial Information General Code of Behavior Program Descriptions Registration Student Affairs << return to Catalog Home Page E-mail Communication E-mail is the official medium for communication with students at Lanier Technical College.

It is sometimes referred to as the Chapter 31 program. The VetSuccess program assists Veterans with service-connected disabilities to prepare for, find, and keep suitable jobs. For Veterans with service-connected disabilities so severe that they cannot immediately consider work, VetSuccess offers services to improve their ability to live as independently as possible. A VA Veteran who is eligible for an evaluation under Chapter 31 must first apply for services and receive an appointment with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). The VRC will work with the Veteran to determine if an employment handicap exists as a result of his or her service connected disability. If an employment handicap is established and the Veteran is found entitled to services. The VRC and the Veteran will continue counseling to select a track of services and jointly develop a plan to address the Veteran's rehabilitation and employment needs. The rehabilitation plan will specify an employment or independent living goal, identify intermediate goals, and outline services and resources that VA will provide to assist the Veteran to achieve his / her goals. The VRC and the Veteran will work together to implement the plan to assist the Veteran to achieve his or her employment and / or independent living goals. If A Veteran is found not to be entitled to CH 31 services, the VRC will help him or her locate other resources to address any rehabilitation and employment needs identified during the evaluation. Referral to other resources may include state vocational rehabilitation programs; Department of Labor employment programs for disabled veterans; state, federal or local agencies providing services for employment or small business development; internet-based resources for rehabilitation and employment; and information about applying for financial aid.For more information about this benefit click here: http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/vre/ For more information regarding VA Benefits, the processes for verification, or any other VA/Lanier Tech related questions, please contact Lanier Technical College's VA School Certifying Official.

Intro courses are basic, they must be in order to be relative to the entire audience. No two people come into the program at the same level of understanding. Therefore, we start with a basic foundation and delve deeper into more complicated issues as the course progresses. Do I have to purchase tools while in the program? Students are strongly encouraged to do so during their stay here at LanierTech for two reasons. One, you must have tools in order to work in the automotive field and to be marketable to an employer seeking to hire you. Two, students are eligible for a hefty discount, sometimes up to 50%, from all the top tool manufacturers while in attendance. Can I become a certified technician after I complete the program? This program will serve as a preparation to certification testing. Certificationtests are administered independently and you must have two years of fieldrelated work experience before you can become eligible for certification. Ourgoal is to equip you with the knowledge necessary to successfully completethese tests when you are ready to take them. While attending class can I work on my own vehicle? Yes, if the job you intend to perform is relative to the subject area beingstudied, you can fill out the necessary form(s) to use your vehicle as a live project. It is however at the instructor's discretion. What is the average income of an Automotive Technician? After certification has been achieved, an annual income of 40 to 60 thousanddollars per year can be achieved. Most automotive techs are paid oncommission so your income greatly depends on your ability. It is imperativethat you get proper technical training, that's where we come in!

Not at this time. Only the core classes can be taken online. At present there is not any drafting classes online, but the drafting classes are web enhanced. Which semesters do you accept students into this program? The drafting program accepts new students every term. The beginning drafting course, DFTG 1101 CAD Fundamentals, is offered twice a year, for both day and evening classes, during the fall and spring semesters.If a student begins his/her drafting program other than fall or spring semester,they will be limited to core courses such as Math 1013, Math 1015, Engl 1010, Comp 1000, and Empl 1000. Is it possible for a student to take all his/her class work in the evening? Yes, students can complete the drafting program by taking all course work in the day or evening or mixing day and evening classes. In some situations, a student may have to take a day class or an evening class because some core courses are offered only once a year. Is it possible for students in the drafting program to take program courses and remedial courses at the same time?Yes, students may take remedial courses and program courses during thesame term. It is recommended to have most of the remedial courses completed before starting the program courses. If more than one remedial course is required, a student may elect to complete all his/her remedial workand core classes before starting the drafting program of study. Students need to consider how much time they can allow for their course work and what will be their best schedule. Is there a selection process for this program? No, there is no selection process. Classes are filled on a first come basis. What are your office hours?Office hours are Monday through Thursday 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Can a student start their occupational courses before completing their core courses?Yes, students can take their program courses and core courses during the same term. Approximately how long will it take to complete the program if enrolled: Full-time? 4 Terms; Part-time? 7 Terms Is the drafting program offered at different locations? No, the drafting program offers both evening and day classes at the Oakwoodcampus only. Please contact David Roberson at 770-533-6979 ordroberson@laniertech.edu for more information. What are the different options under the drafting program?Students have 3 options under the drafting program. A student can enroll inthe certificate, diploma, or degree program. The certificate program is a series of courses taken from the diploma program. The certificates aresequential and a student can complete up to 5 different certificates. The diploma program is a series of courses divided into core, fundamental, and specialization courses. In the diploma program a student completes the core,fundamental courses and then chooses a specialization, either mechanical orarchitectural specialization. The mechanical covers machine shop and generalmechanical applications. The architectural covers residential drafting andarchitectural related areas. A student is not limited to one specialization andmay complete both mechanical and architectural specializations. The degree has the same drafting classes as the diploma but the core courses are differentand the elective hours increased. Some students elect to complete the diplomaprogram and then add the degree. What is the difference between the HOPE grant and the HOPE scholarship?This is confusing to most people. The HOPE grant is for diploma and certificate seeking students and the HOPE scholarship is for the degree seeking students.Sometimes a student will qualify for the HOPE grant and not the HOPE Drafting Technology Programs at Lanier Technical College http://www.laniertech.edu/AcademicPrograms/LTCPrograms.aspx?id=14[11/20/2017 4:29:35 PM]scholarship. The requirements for each are different and a student should talk to a financial aid specialist to discuss their options. If a degree seeking student does not qualify for the HOPE scholarship, what is their best option?Many students who do not qualify for the HOPE scholarship may qualify for theHOPE grant and elect to enroll in the diploma program. The drafting courses are the same for the degree and diploma. Later, a student can change their major to the degree program without any penalty from financial aid. At this point, the student may qualify for the HOPE scholarship and should contact a financial aid specialist for an evaluation of their transcript. Are there other scholarships available? Yes, there are other scholarships available. The PELL grant is a federal grant for students and there are other scholarships that may be available. A student needs to discuss their needs with a financial aid specialist. What is the cost to attend Lanier Technical College? As of spring semester 2012, Tuition cost is $85.00 per credit hour up to 15credit hours. HOPE will pay $60.75 per credit hour. How much can I expect to pay for any fees not covered by FinancialAid (supplies, uniforms, insurance, and any other fees associated with the program)? There are no program fees but there are fees which total $188.00 for regular students per term. What types of jobs are available to those who complete the program? Most of the jobs are in the machine or mechanical area, such as Harris, RoperPump, Patterson Pump, Stork, Cantrell Machine and other manufacturingcompanies. We do place some people in the architectural related areas such as cabinet drawings, roof and floor joist layouts, and other architectural relatedbuilding products. What is the job market outlook for graduates of this program? The job market is reflective of our economy. If home construction is down, so are the architectural jobs. At present the economy is having an effect on job placement, but we are still placing students in jobs. We are having better success in the mechanical area. Where are the majority of jobs located? The jobs are located over northeast Georgia with a concentration around themajor road arteries of I-85, I-985, and Ga. 400. The range of student placement has been from Toccoa to Alpharetta, from Jefferson to Dawsonville,and from Norcross to Dahlonega. What is the expected salary range? The average starting salary is $12.50 to $15.00 per hour. We have had several drafting students starting in the 19 and 20 dollar range. What software is used in the drafting program? From Autodesk we have AutoCAD, Inventor, and Revit. We also have SolidWorks. Can students receive a student version of the software? Student can receive a discounted student version of SolidWorks.

Radiologic Technology - Test Information Sheet Program Requirements Degree Level Radiologic Technology Degree Sample Graduation Plans Frequently Asked Questions Degree Level Radiologic Technology Degree Apply Now Frequently Asked Questions What are the hours for the clinical rotations? Clinical rotations run in eight hour increments per day. The times for clinicalrotations vary, they start as early as 7am and can go into the late evening.Clinical rotations vary from 2-5 days per week. There are no weekendrotations. Note: some of the clinical sites will be very close to where a student lives and others will require a longer drive. Student's clinical assignments are based on a rotation system. All of our clinical sites are located in NortheastGeorgia. What is shadowing? Shadowing is simply the observation of a radiology department during normalbusiness hours. Applicants are encouraged to find a hospital, imaging center,orthopedic office, urgent care or clinic to shadow (any place with x-ray and/orfluoroscopic equipment and registered radiologic technologist). Shadowing willhelp the applicant determine if this career path is the right one for him/her. When do I apply for the criminal background check? Background checks are not performed until after the applicant has beenaccepted into the program and before the first day of class. This is a requirement for clinical rotations. Some clinical sites may not accept students with criminal records. If an applicant has a criminal background they may notbe allowed to take the national registry exam given by the American Registryof Radiologic Technologist (ARRT). A pre-application process can be followed by Radiologic Technology Programs at Lanier Technical College http://www.laniertech.edu/AcademicPrograms/LTCPrograms.aspx?id=62[11/20/2017 4:35:15 PM] contacting the ARRT at http://www.arrt.org to ascertain if the applicant will be allowed to take the registry exam. What are my chances of getting into the program? A competitive selection process is used to choose students for each upcomingclass. The top 20 applicants will be selected based on GPA of the 8 pre- requisite classes and the ATI TEAS VI Test Scores. How long does it take to complete the program? Program duration - 6 semesters. The first two semesters are strictly core/pre- requisite classes. The last 4 semesters are for the radiologic technology classes(student must be accepted into degree program through competitive selectionto take radiologic technology classes). Note: The program is very intense andvery much like a full time job. How physical is the job? The duties of a radiologic technologist require a lot of pushing, pulling andlifting. A radiologic technologist is on their feet over 90% of the time. Students must be cleared by a physician to attend clinical and have all immunizations up to date.

Electrical Utility Technology What is the difference between electrical engineering and electronic engineering? Electrical Engineering is the study and application of charge movement (electrons) in a metal such as copper, aluminum, gold, silver, etc. Electronic Engineering is the study and application of charge movement (electrons and/or holes) in a gas, vacuum, or semiconductor (silicone, carbon, germanium, etc.) A gold diamond ring demonstrates both. Gold is to electrical engineering as a diamond is to electronic engineering. What is an electron in electrical and electronic engineering? A negative charge carrier What is a hole in electronics (solid state physics)?A positive charge carrier Can you show me an EUT SuperStar Technician? The EUT program prepares students for entry level and internship employment in the electrical transmission and distribution of power industry. Once employed, the graduate will first experience many hours of company safetytraining followed by a career of apparatus and safety training. All of our graduates will work on apparatus near the ground, never make direct contact with uninsulated engergized conductors, and not as close to the power station and/or at distribution voltages as show in the Web video link below. Decades of EUT education, experience, safety training, and more safety training are required for what you are about to see.

Welding certification is something that is outside the curriculim of the Welding and Joining Technology program. All welding classes follow very closely the standards set by the nationally recognized American Welding Society. Most of the welding processes and procedures follow the AWS D1.1 structuralsteel code book.However, your instructor will have access to a Certified Welding Inspector whocan administer a Welder Performance Qualification Test to become a QualifiedWelder.There is a charge for the test that is paid to the Inspector.This fee is NOT covered by any financial aid and is non- refundable, if you do not pass the test. Your instructor will let you know if he or she feels you are ready to attempt the test. Some of these tests are very costly. What will I need to buy for the class? Other than the required text books, there is some equipment that is needed forthe welding classes.Certain equipment is not supplied by the school and must be obtained by thestudent before any work can be done in the lab area.These items are mainly personal protective gear and small hand tools.All items needed for the class will be discussed by your instructor the first dayof class.
