Given the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( coVid19) and the development and imple mentation of mass vaccination, data are being obtained by analyzing vaccination campaigns. i n the present study, 69 healthcare workers who were exposed to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 were moni tored for specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgA levels at different time periods. Prior to vaccination, after the first round of vaccination at 21 days (when the second dose of vaccine was administrated) and 24 days after the second round of vaccina tion, with an m rna based vaccine. The basal i gG and i ga levels in previously infected subjects and noninfected subjects notably differed. Vaccination increased the igG and i ga levels after the first dose in most subjects from both groups, the levels of which further increased following the second round of vaccination. The associations between igG and i ga levels following the first and second rounds of vaccination demon strated that in the entire vaccination group, regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent, the increment and levels of igG and i ga were similar. Thus, the levels upon vaccination were statistically similar irrespective of the starting base line prior to vaccination. i n the present study, seroconversion was achieved in all subjects following the second round of vaccina tion, with similar antibodies levels. Introductioncoronavirus disease 2019 ( coVid19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (S arScoV2) has caused the current global pandemic. i n the quest for combat ting this pandemic, novel drugs and therapeutic approaches for difficult cases, as well as new outlines for clinical management have come forth at an accelerated pace. Various therapies have been tested (1); however, among the tools that could halt this pandemic is the achievement of herd immunity. Herd immu nity, also known as community immunity, is reached when a large amount of the population within a community becomes immune to a specific disease and the infectious agent subse quently stops spreading. Thus, the immunized population as a total group would provide protection; not every single individual is immune to the infection as there are also nonimmunized individuals alongside naturally or artificially immunized indi viduals (2). a mong the means used to obtain herd immunity, the development of effective and safe vaccines is the most operative. a cknowledging that vaccination should commence as quickly as possible, in July 2020, the S arScoV2 panel of vaccines included 158 vaccine candidates, out of which approximately 20 were in the advanced stages of development namely, m rna based vaccines, adenovirusesbased vaccines and pathogenspecific vaccines (3). The vaccines which, during the summer of 2020, were in the advanced stages of clinical testing were based upon inactivated or live attenuated viruses, protein subunits, viruslike particles, viral vectors (either replicating or nonreplicating), dna , rna , nanopar ticles, each of these types exhibiting unique advantages (4). of all the vaccines that were in line for approval during the summer of 2020, only a few of these obtained F da and subse quent EU approval. Therefore, the first mRNAbased vaccine COVID19 vaccination and IgG and IgA antibody dynamics in healthcare workers SaBina Zurac1,2*, of Pathology, Faculty of dental Medicine, 'carol davila' university of Medicine and Pharmacy, 020021 of Pathology, 050096 Bucharest; 6doctoral School of Biology, Faculty of Biology, university of Bucharest, 050095 Bucharest, romania received a pril 1, 2021; a ccepted May 27, 2021 epartment of Pathology, Faculty of d ental Medicine, ' carol d avila' u niversity of Medicine and Pharmacy, omania email: severe acute respiratory antibodies, vaccinationZurac et al : SarScoV2 V accina Tion in H eal THcare W orKerS 2 (PfizerBioNTech) was approved by the FDA and EMA (5,6). The approval of the Moderna vaccine on d ecember 18, 2020 contributed to the list of approved vaccines for coVid19 (7). Therefore, by February 18, 2021, almost a dozen vaccines were authorized worldwide and up to the date of the publication of the present study, even more may be approved and many more will be in the pipeline of development (8). The encounter of an organisms with the actual S arScoV2 virus triggers the appearance of specific antibodies, but the dynamics of seroconvention is still under intense studies. it was shown that immunoglobulin ( ig)M antibodies are detectable around the fourth day of infection, increasing until the 20th day when peaks, and then fads away while i gG appears around the first week of infection and peaks around the first month (9). n evertheless, it was shown that upon infection seroconversion ( igG or i gM antibodies) takes place simultaneously and the concentrations of the two types of antibodies reach a peak value that does not vary anymore (10). Moreover, in patients with mild and severe forms it was reported that over time the i gM titer gradually increases (11). in oligosymptomatic patients, lower antibodies titers were detected compared to symptomatic individuals in a high proportion, 40.0% compared to only 12.9% in symptomatic patients (12). i n respiratory infection, i gM and i gG isotypes were the main immune molecules that characterize humoral immunity, while mucosal and systemic igabased immune responses received much less attention (13). Therefore the vaccination race that begun with an unprecedent speed still has to gather data regarding the specific immune response raised, both from the humoral and cellular immune arms. Acquiring specific immunity upon vaccination is the key goal of an efficient vaccine. Although over the past year, a vast number of studies have been published on humoral and cellular immunity in co Vid19 patients, data regarding immunity raised by a specific vaccine are limited. Therefore, analyzing the specific response of antibodies upon specific vaccination, the present study aimed to investigate the humoral immune response in a homogenous group of healthcare providers with permanent contact with infected patients and samples with S arScoV2 that were subjected to vaccination in the first line of defense in the Romanian population. Materials and methodsSubjects. a total of 103 subjects were followedup between May 2020 to February 2021. The group represents healthcare workers in contact with S arScov2infected patients during the present pandemic. o ut of the entire group, 69 subjects received the full vaccination protocol and were followedup for all three determination 1 day prior to vaccination, 1 day before the second dose and 24 days after the second dose. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Vaccination with both doses on the 6th and 27th January 2021 with PfizerBioNTech vaccine, no positive tests for S arScoV2 infection docu mented by r TqP cr test, all three blood tests (1 day prior to vaccination, 1 day before the second dose and 24 days after the second dose), no other disease or pregnancy during testing. The exclusion criteria of the tested group were as follows: lack of vaccination in the 6 January 2021 group, lack of one of the vaccination shots, lack of one of the blood sampling from the threemandatory determinations, presence of active infection documented by standard r TqP cr in the week prior to first blood sampling, pregnancy, any other condition (flu, inflammatory conditions and so on). The characteristics of the enrolled subjects, such as age and gender are presented in Table i . associated comorbidities of the subjects are presented in Table S i (supplementary material). The group of 69 subjects were vaccinated in January 2021 and they were followedup before and after vaccination for measurement of the levels of serum i gG and i ga. during this year of followup, the entire group was subjected to regular testing from nasopharyngeal swabs of S arScoV2 virus using standard r TqP cr testing approved by e Ma and F da. Subjects were tested regularly and/or when suspicions to be infected with a llplexTM 2019n coV a ssay, (Seegene i nc.). a t vaccination moment, the subjects that comprised the presented group had the most recent disease 8 weeks prior to vaccination, while the latest documented disease was 8 months prior to the first sampling. Prior to vaccination, out of the entire group, 23.18% of the subjects had gone through documented co Vid19 (proved SarScoV2 infection by r TPcr testing). Vaccination. All the subjects received the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at the specified interval according to the supplier instructions. As all the subjects were in the first line of defense in the current pandemic, they received their first vaccine shot on the January 6, 2021 and the second dose on January 27, 2021. Dynamics of sampling. a ll the subjects were tested for the presence of IgA and IgGspecific antibodies recognizing the S1 domain of the S arScov2 spike protein beginning from May 2020 in order to follow their immunity upon accidental infection. Following PfizerBioNTech vaccination approval, all the subjects received the vaccine. a ll subjects were tested 1 day prior to vaccination, 1 day before the second dose and 24 days after the second dose. Blood sampling. Peripheral blood samples from subjects comprising the tested group were collected by venipunc ture during the morning hours in blood clot activator tubes (Vacutest Kima). Blood collection was carried out at the colentina u niversity Hospital. Serum samples, separated by centrifugation (1,500 x g, 10 min at room temperature) within 4 h of blood collection, were used for eli Sa. Serum samples were stored at 80C for concomitant testing. ELISA. antiS arScoV2 eli Sa (igG and i ga) kits was used to determine the serum levels of specific i gG and iga l abordiagnostika a G; i ga kit, code ei 26069601G for igG kit). The kits are commercially available, e Ma and Fda approved for i Vd testing in S arScoV2 infection. The protocol used was as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the kits are provided with eli Sa plates that are coated with the recombinant S1 domain of the spike protein of SarScoV2 expressed in the human cell line, H eK 293. all the reagents for developing the eli Sa are provided within the kit such as: c alibrator (human i gG, i ga, respectively), Molecular Medicine re PorTS 24: 578, 2021 3 Positive control (human igG, i ga, respectively), negative control (human i gG, i ga respectively), enzyme conjugate peroxidaselabeled antihuman /substrate solution TMB /H2o2, stop solution 0.5 M sulphuric acid, quality control certificate. according to the manufacturer's recommendations, the photometric measurement was performed at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 620 and 650 nm, using a multireader platform (Varioskan Flash; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Results were calculated as indicated, namely the r atio between the extinction of the patient sample and the e xtinction of the calibrator. The manufacturer recommends the following cutoff values: ratio <0.8; borderline ratio 0.8 to <1.1; positive ratio 1.1. The results are presented as indexes, as recom mended by the i gG and i ga kit supplier. When appropriate, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (S d) of individual data. Statistical analysis. We have performed repeated measures ano Va for all the tested groups. We applied Bonferroni post hoc test to calculate Pvalues according to Bonferroniadjusted . GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, i nc.) was used for data analysis. Results Dynamics of IgG and IgA antibodies prior to vaccina - tion. Between May to September 2020 the study group was followedup for the serum levels of specific igG and iga antibodies. i n Fig. 1, we present the registered dynamics for the months MayJuly, this snapshot example indicates that most of the subjects had negative levels of circulating i gG and that during the registered period, the subjects that were infected exhibited a marked increase in the levels of specific antibodies. The levels in convalescent healthcare workers decreased during this time period. Serum i gG levels analyzed between the period of MaySeptember revealed the values of infected healthcare workers during this followup. The mean value of the i gG index in noninfected and infected subjects was constant during this followup period and remained unaltered during these months (Fig. 2). Vaccination parameters Antibodies' levels prior to vaccination. out of the entire study group, >23% of the subjects were previously documented to have contracted the S arScoV2 infection during this pandemic and prior to the time of vaccination. The values of both specific IgG and IgA were significantly higher compared with the noninfected subjects prior to vacci nation (Table ii ). in the noninfected subjects, the S d of the mean was low, while it was higher in the infected subjects. The higher S d of value registered for the antibody levels in previously infected subjects prove a higher variability of the antibody's responses to infection due to a specific /individual immune response and correspondingly due to variable time from the disease onset. Owing to these statistically significant Table i. demographic characteristics of the enrolled subjects. demographic Previously infected subjects, n (%) noninfected subjects, n (%) Total sample, n Subjects 16 (23) 53 (77) 69 Female 14 (23) 48 (77) 62 Male 2 (29) 5 (71) 7 average age of total, years 37.81 41.00 40.26 average age of women, years 39.14 average age of men, years 28.50 36.40 34.14 Figure 1. i gG index dynamics between MayJuly 2020 in the investigated group. d otted line depicts the positive i gG index.

The level of i gG was elevated 7fold in previously infected compared with noninfected subjects, while the i ga the level was elevated 5fold in previously infected compared with noninfected subjects (Table ii ). Adverse effects upon vaccination. The presence of any adverse effects was determined upon the first and second round of vaccination for each subject. The adverse effects and the percentage of these recorded adverse effects within both groups is presented in Fig. 3 for the first shot and in Fig. 4 for the second one (see also Table S ii). Moreover, no association between the presence of adverse effects with age and gender was observed.of all the adverse effects, pain at the inoculation site was present in the majority of patients in the first round (58.49% in noninfected subjects, 81.25% of infected subjects) and in the second round of vaccination (39.62% in noninfected subjects, 68.75% of infected subjects). The second most common adverse effects were flulike symptoms reported in the first (22.64% in noninfected subjects, 18.75% of infected subjects) and second round of vaccination (60.38% in noninfected subjects, 62.50% of infected subjects). The rarest adverse effects recorded were local bruising, erythema and paresthesia (one case), anosmia and ageusia, lipothymia, cough, nausea, vomiting (one case each after first shot), and axillary adenopathy and local bruising (one case each after second shot). Yet, the vaccination imposed mild adverse effects in the entire study group, with a slight increase in the percentage of adverse effects in previously infected subjects. The assertion was verified in both the first and second round of vaccina tion.

Specific IgG levels upon vaccination. The basal level of i gG was differed significantly between the two analyzed groups (Table ii ) and the levels were elevated >7fold in previously infected subjects compared with noninfected ones. This clear positive level detected in previously infected subjects (mean index >3) indicated that upon vaccination, this group developed i gG antibodies through disease and that vaccination led to increased levels (Fig. 5). a fter the first vaccination dose, the i gG levels in noninfected subjects exhibited an increase of almost 12fold increase in males and almost 11fold increase in females. a fter the second round of vaccination, the i gG levels increased 1.33fold in males and 2.11fold in females, when compared to the first dose. although in males it seemed that the igG response at 21 days was higher compared with that in females, after the second round of vaccination, the i gG serum seemed to homogenize in both groups, proving that the generated immune response has a plateau that is reached by all subjects. The increase registered upon vaccination in the i gG level is statistically different when assessed prevaccination versus 21 days and data after 21 days compared to registered levels after 45 days (Tables iii and i V). a pplying repeated measures ano Va in the group of na\u00efve subjects has emphasized the results showing that the vaccine led to statistically significant differences in igG level [F(2,104)=570.6139, P<0.05]. We applied Bonferroni post hoc test and the results showed that all pvalues are less than the Bonferroniadjusted alpha level (Table i V). in previously infected subjects subjected to vaccination (Fig. 6) we have registered after the first vaccination dose, an increase of 2.47fold in males and 2.25fold in females. a fter the second dose, an increase of 1.82fold was observed in males and one of 1.33fold in females. The overall vaccination procedure seemed to increase the levels of igG in both males Table iii.

The increase registered upon vaccination in the prior infected subjects in the i gG level is statistically different when assessed prevaccination versus levels after 21 days and igG levels after 21 days compared to the 45 days registered levels (Fig. 6). The data of the groups come from the same individuals followed as indicated above and the disper sion of individual i gG indexes for each subject at moments of prevaccination, after 21 days and 45 days is presented in Fig. 7. i n infected group, applying repeated measures ano Va has shown that the vaccine induced statistically significant differences in i gG level [F(1,15)=29.91563, P<0.05] and Bonferroni post hoc test emphasized all pvalues as less than the Bonferroniadjusted alpha level (Table i V). Specific IgA levels upon vaccination. Similar to the serum levels registered for i gG, the levels registered for i ga differed between the two groups. These levels were elevated >5fold in previously infected subjects compared with na\u00efve ones (Table ii ). in the noninfected (na\u00efve) subjects, upon the first vaccination dose, the level of IgA (Fig. 8) seemed to be lower compared with the level of i gG in the same subjects. When applying statistics in na\u00efve subjects for iga levels, similar differences were found in comparison to i gG levels. Therefore, repeated measures ano Va has shown that the vaccine induced statistically significant differences in IgA level [F(2,104)=172.5605, P<0.05] and Bonferroni post hoc test emphasized all pvalues as less than the Bonferroniadjusted alpha level (Tables iii and i V). In the previously infected group, the first vaccination dose induced a higher level of i ga compared with the level of i gG in the same subjects. i n the noninfected group, after the second vaccination dose, the iga levels increased compared with the igG levels. While in noninfected subjects' females and males seem to have a similar increase of i ga, after the second round of vaccination, the mean value obtained in male subjects is increased compared to females. i n the prior infected group, the first dose increases the IgA level similar in females and males Figure 7. d ispersion of individual i gG indexes at three different periods (prevaccination, after 21 days and after 45 days) in na\u00efve and previously infected subjects. r ed line depicts the mean value.

The second dose induces the highest registered levels in both males and females at similar levels (Fig. 9). Similar to the i gG levels, in the i ga case the dispersion of individual distribution of iga indexes for each subject at moments of prevaccination, after 21 days and 45 days is presented in Fig. 10. i n previously infected subjects repeated measures ano Va has shown that the vaccine induced statistically significant differences in IgA level [F(1,15)=21.91483, P<0.05] and Bonferroni post hoc test emphasized all Pvalues as less than the Bonferroniadjusted alpha level (Tables iii and i V). The associations between the i gG and i ga levels upon the first and second dose of vaccination indicated that in the entire vaccination group, regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent, the increment and levels of i gG and i ga were similar (Fig. 11). Therefore, the levels upon vaccination were statistically similar regardless of the starting baseline prior to vaccination (Tables iii and i V). When analyzing all possible associations, the most signifi cant one was the IgG index after the first dose that induced an antibody response in na\u00efve (noninfected) subjects <28% in females compared with males (Fig. 12). a possible explanation for this difference, as previously demonstrated by us (14) and other groups (15), is the hormonedependent immune response that induces different antibody dynamics. Moreover, even the clinical outcome of co Vid19 was recently reported as correlated with gender (16). in the present study, seroconversion was achieved in 98.5% of subjects after the first dose for IgG and 81% for IgA, and in 100% of the entire group after the second dose with highly similar antibody levels. Discussionup to date there are several approved vaccines that are already applied into the vaccination protocols along with the one that was analyzed herein. a nother m rna based vaccine developed by Moderna has shown in the nc T04470427 trial tests that is capable to develop specific antibodies (17,18). another type of vaccine that is as well applied on a large Figure 9.

This vaccine was shown to induce antibodies in vaccinated subjects (19). Therefore, the coVid19 vaccines that are on large scale application around the world seem to induce the intended specific immune response. Questions still remain to be answered regarding how long this immunity will offer protection and if the new variants that are appearing would be neutralized by the antibodies raised to these vaccina tion platforms. i t seems that, at least for the time being, data indicate that these vaccines induce a significant increase in binding antibodies to spike protein of S arScoV1, M erS, and to the four common coronaviruses, currently circulating in the UK. Therefore, there are good news in terms of the specific immune response that can fight also other viral variants and possibly the newly emergent ones (20). over the past year, almost 300 studies have become avail able in the PubMed database focusing on humoral and cellular immunity in co Vid19 patients; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are a handful of reports focusing on the realcase scenario upon vaccination. We have learned some lessons from investigating the immunity of infected patients. Therefore, upon disease high titers of specific IgG levels with serumneutralizing viral potency in a pseudotype entry assay were reported (21). Moreover, a strong correlation was found between antibody titers and the percentage of virusspecific T cells (22). r esearch on seroprevalence has revealed that seropositive samples were found as early as midFebruary, and our results obtained during the summer of 2020 have shown that seroprevalence is stable, suggesting lasting antibody serum levels in subjects as obtained by another group (23). We have chosen eli Sa testing because most serological studies embrace the quantitative eli Sa platform (24). The eli Sa test that we have used ( euroi MMun a ntiS arScoV2 eli Sa assay) was evaluated, validated and it is comprised in the F da recom mended lists of immunoassays to be used in current pandemia. This type of analysis has proven to have good sensitivity for the detection of i ga and excellent sensitivity for the detection of IgG, as early as 4 days after the diagnosis of COVID19 by rTPcr, with no crossreactivity to common human corona viruses infection, types nl 63 and oc43 (25). i n the present study, seroconversion was achieved in 98.5% of subjects after the first dose for IgG and 81% for IgA, and in 100% of the group after the second dose, with highly similar antibody levels; these results were similar to those of a recent report on a small, vaccinated group of oncological patients (26). The fact that the specific IgG level followed the level of IgA is proof that the generated immune response upon vaccination stimulates multiple B lymphocyte clones. Moreover, previously infected subjects exhibited both i gG and i ga levels, detectable even after 8 months postinfection, as we evidenced in the present study group with one case exhibiting positive antibody levels after 8 months. o ur results are in accordance with the reported humoral immune response to S arScoV2 infection that shows an early response of i ga, instead of i gM (27). Gender association with the postvaccination level revealed no association, as no associations were observed with the degree of adverse effects and prior encounters with the viral agent. e ven though the presence of adverse effects seemed a bit higher in the subjects that experienced the disease in comparison to na\u00efve subjects. We do not rule out that a larger group of subjects would have unveiled statistical differences associated with age and gender. Similar results showed that in a cohort of the same vaccine recipients postvaccine symptoms Figure 11. Mean index levels and standard deviation registered for IgG and IgA compared with the entire study group before and after the first round (21 days), and after the second round (45 days) of vaccination.

For subjects that still had positive levels of i gG and i ga occurring after infection, the levels at the first dose and second dose were slightly increased compared with the ones registered in uninfected subjects. r esults reported in a pril 2021 have shown that specific IgG antibody levels elicited by a single vaccine dose in prior S arScoV2 infected subjects were similar to those seen after two doses of vaccine in individuals without prior infection (28). i n a nested casecontrol analysis within COVIDsortium (51 participants), a study performed in healthcare workers showed that after the first dose of the PfizerBio nTech vaccine, the prior infected subjects vaccination increased total antibodies more than 140fold in comparison to their prevaccine levels (29). although the most tested antibodies panel in co Vid19 disease is represented by the i gG and i gM pair, assessing circu lating i ga levels could provide useful insight into the humoral immunity course developed in both patients who were previ ously infected and those who were vaccinated. i ga represents the most abundant antibody class produced in humans, being critical in the first line of antimicrobial defense, by neutral izing pathogens targeting the mucosal boundary (30). i ga ( iga1/iga2) and /or isoforms (monomeric, dimeric /secretory). While ga circulating form is predominantly monomeric i ga1 (85%) and considered as an antiinflammatory isotype, the dimeric /secretory i ga exhibits both pro and antiinflammatory actions (31). Both circulating and secretory iga levels present certain distinct features; thus, i ga from serum /plasma originates mainly from bone marrowderived plasma cells and typically includes the monomeric form, namely i ga1. By contrast, i ga located in mucosa comprises both isoforms, i ga1 and i ga2 being produced by plasma cells located in the lamina propria of mucosal surfaces (32). Even though IgA delineates the humoral immunity profile at the mucosal level, it is insufficiently exploited to wholly outline the immune response in the co Vid19 disease context and is almost ignored in postvaccination studies. Testing serum IgAspecific antibodies in both infected and therefore, in vaccinated subjects is of particular interest since the role and function of i ga in S arScov2 infection remains uncertain. in addition, both serum and salivary iga antibody responses have been registered to S arScoV2 spike antigens (33). The assessment of circulating i ga antibodies in co Vid19 is of equal importance as i gG testing, in order to clarify mostly the asymptomatic and mild cases that typically represent coVid19 infections (32). To date, to the best of our knowledge, no data are avail able regarding i ga circulating levels in vaccinated subjects, and very few in different co Vid19 forms (27). e xperience obtained from one year of the coVid19 pandemic has revealed that S arScoV2blood i ga occurrence requires an average seroconversion period of 25 days following symptom onset (34), and it is attributed to an early action in SarScoV2 infection, being even more potent than i gG in neutralizing S arScoV2 (35). regarding the remanence of iga in blood, a recent study suggested that the durability of the circulating antispike i ga was even up to 8 months following SarScoV2 infection (36). The authors also observed, in the oldest infected subject, that the levels of i gG and circulatory iga maintained their positivity. The potency of serum iga versus igG in S arScov2 infection was recently reported to be associated with the monomeric /dimeric state of i ga. namely, the serum mono meric iga is typically twofold less effective than i gG, while the dimeric IgA from the mucosal level is significantly more potent than monomer i ga in neutralizing S arScoV2 (37). When analyzing the data of i gG indexes in subjects with a previous S arScov2 infection versus subjects without coVid, several hypotheses have emerged. Vaccination induces higher levels of IgG after the first dose of vaccination in not infected subjects ( igG mean index, 4.03) in comparison to the basic levels obtained by subjects through natural immunization (igG mean index, 3.02). The vaccination of individuals with coVid19 prior to immunization must be recommended, since the increase in i gG levels is 33% higher in 'non coVid' subjects compared to the i gG levels obtained by natural immu nization. The vaccination of previously infected subjects with the first dose induces antibody responses slightly lower (IgG mean index, 6.86) than those recorded after the second dose of vaccine in 'non coVid' subjects ( igG mean index, 8.13). noninfected subjects have i gG indexes with 21.13% higher after the second shot compared to previously infected subjects after the first shot. The vaccination of subjects that have experienced the disease with the second dose further increases their i gG levels ( igG mean index, 9.56) by up to 40% (39.35% compared with the IgG levels after first dose) and by 17.58% compared with the i gG levels after the second dose in na\u00efve subjects. Based on this finding, the need for a second shot of the vaccine can be debated in subjects infected with co Vid19 prior to vaccination. The humoral immune response with the capacity to protect against disease obtained after the first vaccination shot in these subjects is excellent, however, a second shot has the capacity to augment it. Perhaps, considering these find ings, in the context of the lack of a sufficient vaccine doses worldwide, one might consider an extension of the time period between the first and second dose of the vaccine for subjects with previously S arScoV2 infection. Similarly, as in the case of the discussions regarding the i gG levels, the findings for the IgA levels can have some original points that should be outlined. Since i ga is involved mainly in local protection, its levels may be associated with capacity of transmission. Vaccination also induced higher levels of i ga after the first dose in na\u00efve subjects (IgA mean index, 3.05) than basal levels obtained in previously infected subjects ( iga mean index 2.29). To be pointed out that the i ga basal levels of previously infected subjects is high, although, as mentioned, in this subgroup of subjects we have individuals that recovered from the disease even as old as 8 months ago. The increase in the i ga levels in noninfected subjects was 33.18% higher than the levels obtained by natural immunization. Vaccination with the first dose in previously infected subjects induced an iga response slightly lower ( iga mean index, 7.31) than those recorded after the second dose of vaccination in na\u00efve subjects for igG (igG mean index, 8.41). However, the increase in i ga levels in noninfected subjects after the second shot versus subjects with previous infection after first shot was lower than that of i gG (with 15.04%). The vaccination of previously Zurac et al : SarScoV2 V accina Tion in H eal THcare W orKerS 12 infected subjects with the second dose markedly increased the iga levels ( iga mean index, 10.95) by almost half (increase with 49.79%) compared with the i ga levels after the first dose and by 30.20% compared with the i ga levels in na\u00efve subjects after the second dose. considering the risk of devel oping co Vid19 after complete vaccination with two shots and implicitly the risk of further dissemination of infection, the second vaccination shot in previously infected subjects induced a potent i ga response that may provide supplemen tary protection against transmission. We are pointing out that serology testing is important prior to vaccination to analyze quickly the humoral immune status of the subject, so that the following vaccination protocol could be adapted. The same conclusion was published in March 2021 by Manisty et al , stating that this testing can induce a priori tization use of the Pfizer booster doses for individuals that did not experience the disease. This approach could accel erate vaccination and, facing new virus variants ( uK, South africa, Brazil), achieving herd immunity quickly, stopping the spreading and hindering new variants emergence (38). The present study has some limitations regarding the moni tored specific response. Although antibodymediated immunity was followed, the understanding of cellular immunity upon vaccination in this group could have revealed additional aspects. Studies published at the end of 2020 have shown that in the phase i /ii trial in healthy adults receiving this type of vaccine after two doses elicited robust cd 4 + and cd8+ T cell responses in correlation with strong i gG responses, levels that were found increased in comparison to individuals post coVid19 (39). Thus, in our study, a focus on cellular immunity, namely memory B and T cells would have broadened the investigation regarding the vaccination outcome. a nother limitation of our study is that direct neutralizing antibodies would have pinpointed the actual ef ficacy of vacci nat ion. Of not e, du r i ng t he fol lowup p er iod i n t he present study, immunized subjects did not become reinfected, although in some cases, close unvaccinated family members developed the infection. i n a preliminary study published in March 2021 regarding neutralizing antibodies induced by the same vaccine has shown that neutralizing antibodies concentra tions postvaccination are superior from those observed among coVid19 human convalescent serum (40). a nother limitation of the study is the low number of participants. This limitation is surmounted by the fact that the group is thoroughly investigated and monitored throughout this pandemic regarding comorbidities, side effects of vaccination and the overall evolution of their health during a possible infection and postinfection. a ll these clinical data are somewhat difficult to be obtained from large data bases. The present study aimed to analyze the profiles and dynamics of immunization raised through vaccination between a homogenous group of healthcare workers, and thus to create a clearcut tool which may be used to assess the intensity and duration of humoral immunity comprising specific antibodies (igG and iga) to key proteins from S arScoV2 (e.g., Spike protein). The authors aim to perform further studies, analyzing antibody persistence and the presence of memory immune cell populations. i ndeed, the whole picture of antiS arScov2 immunity, and the postvaccination status in particular, should encompass both humoral and cellular immunity corroborated parameters. However, the methods through which these humoral immunity figures could be extrapolated to evaluate the infection 'mimicked' by vaccination remain to be determined. in conclusion, far from being an exhaustive study on vaccination, the present study has evaluated, in a homogenous healthcare workers group, the antibody levels prior and postvaccination. i t was demonstrated that the vaccine induced high levels of specific IgG and IgA in all the tested subjects. The vaccine induced levels of antibodies that were statistically equivalent regardless of the prior infection. i n the present study, seroconversion was achieved in 100% of the group for both tested antibodies after vaccination protocol completion with highly similar antibody levels.
