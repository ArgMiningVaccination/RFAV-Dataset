The latter has been derived from cost-bene t analysis where the value measurement of survival gain is expressed in natural units instead of money. A copy-paste function was used for moving from health economic assessment of treatment to health economic assessment of vaccine prevention. It was initially thought that this was a valid approach as vaccination was found to be considered as one of the most cost-e ective interventions in health care. However in this thesis I will expose the shortcomings of selecting this approach of incremental cost-e ectiveness analysis for vaccines. Prevention through vaccination is an activity that should preferentially be evaluated at the level of a population rather than an individual as it is the norm for doing cost-e ectiveness analysis. Additionally incremental cost-e ectiveness analysis may not be the best method to value vaccination in low-income countries where infectious diseases are most prevalent. Therefore alternatives in health economic assessment of prevention should be initiated and stimulated in order to propose an analysis that is more complete and accurate. The thesis starts with the process of using the conventional cost-e ectiveness analysis of rotavirus vaccination in a developed country. The approach investigated rst the nancial disease burden, then the QALY-impact of the disease in function of disease severity and patient age, to nally calculate the cost-e ectiveness of the new vaccine using a birth cohort followed in a Markov cohort model design. The model compares the condition of vaccination with no vaccination. A more simpli ed version, back of the envelop model, is proposed for those countries that have no access to elaborate datasets. Finally the modelling exercises were evaluated against a few vaccine impact studies to demonstrate that the initial model predictions were conservative. By making that comparison new interesting features were discovered related to the disease and the vaccination process that we were unaware about prior the program implementation. One is about the herd e ect that is present in the age-group too young to be vaccinated. Another is the presence of the natural immunity that develops as a child ages, linked to the exposure to natural infection. As a consequence the natural immunity build-up process interferes with the vaccine e cacy measurement the way it is calculated suggesting a vaccine waning process that is maybe not present. Finally, there are other sources of infection active in the child population that clearly appears as soon as the infection within the child population is under control through the vaccination program. That will happen in a short time frame of 2, 3 years depending of the vaccine uptake. One may discover that particular feature at best when the comparison is made between a cross-sectional and a cohort analysis of the at-risk population. It leads to the evidence that if the vaccine coverage rate is high but not optimal in the child population, there will be di culties to reach a disease stage of elimination in that community despite the massive impact the vaccine has on the disease burden. Much depends also on the way children are 67nurtured during their childhood period going easily to day-care centres when they are very young. All these ndings have consequences on the economic value the rotavirus vaccination will demonstrate, but there was more to be discovered. Two new features about the introduction of rotavirus vaccination in developed countries were identi ed. One is about the improvement of the quality of care because the vaccine introduction allows for a better patient infl ux in hospital care during winter periods when many other infectious diseases occur within the same age-group normally causing recurrent chaotic conditions in health care delivery every year. The vaccine was able to reduce these di cult moments and improves the quality scores of care in hospital bed and personnel management. Another interesting feature was that we were able to evaluate with real life data the reduction in absenteeism on the work fl oor among working mothers after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. The estimated reduction we normally introduce in our model design regarding indirect cost bene t has now been assessed with those objective data. The match was remarkably close. For the developing countries some other explorations were done. One was identifying when optimal bene t may occur when using a 2 dose vaccination scheme instead of a 3 dose under a xed vaccination budget when varying the price per dose, the overall vaccine e cacy, and the coverage rate of the rotavirus vaccine. The evaluation should discourage people to think that more vaccine doses are better rather to select the optimum needed to reach a certain health goal under a xed budget. Another project was to identify who else in society could be interested in having vaccination programs well implemented besides the ministry of health and the direct bene ciaries, and what type of bene t those other people are looking for, when, and under which circumstances. Extra tax payment or return in investment is what was discovered being the added new bene t from the perspective of a government instead of the ministry by reducing speci c child mortality after rotavirus vaccination that will join later the workforce in a country. This evaluation technique has been applied for Egypt but other emerging economies were investigated with the same approach as well. Finally some new areas of exploration are proposed in the recommendations about health economics of vaccination. They are based on the acquired new knowledge about priority setting and about types of investment in health care. The proposed research should help to better evaluating the full and real monetary value of vaccines in the absence of understanding well what are the right opportunity cost and the right threshold values to be selected in an incremental cost-e ectiveness analysis for low-income countries. In conclusion there is still much to explore in a domain that is not so easy to get access to because we are unfamiliar with all the di erent aspects of quality of care measurement, absenteeism, among others. But once getting the data, it proofs that vaccines are a very healthy investment for creating better quality health at the population level. 8INTRODUCTION Economics of vaccines revisited. Hum Vaccin Immunother, 2013, 9(5), 1139-41 [1] What is today the relationship between value of prevention with vaccines and its health economic evaluation worldwide? That is the question I would like to answer in this thesis based on the example of rotavirus vaccination. By specifying vaccine prevention the eld of health economic assessment is narrowed, but it still opens a window of exploration to new research. Doesn't that sound a little odd?[2] Haven't we already assessed all the issues around health economics of vaccines since a long time? Almost every economic paper on vaccination will tell that this medical intervention is very cost-e ective if not to say it is considered as one of the most cost-e ective one ever introduced into the health care market. What is meant by cost-e ective is that vaccines are good value for money [3]. But the way this should be interpreted is broader than just the result of a cost- e ectiveness analysis where extra payment for extra bene t is measured. The result often goes into the direction of cost-savings but one still prefers to say it is cost-e ective. Therefore there are reasons for improvement in what we want to disclose whether vaccination is now cost-e ective or leads to cost-saving. Until recently -less than 15 years ago- we used the copy-paste function of the economic assessment of therapeutic interventions applied in the developed world [4]. We used that technique on prevention of the new vaccines coming in the market such as the ones against hemophilus infl uenza B , pneumococcal disease, rotavirus diarrhoea, cancer. We selected the incremental cost-utility analysis (ICUA) formula for the comparison of di erent disease management options and applied it on prevention as if the speci cities of that eld were the same as in treatment. Let me highlight through 3 particularities where things get distorted in the results when using the conventional cost-e ectiveness analysis on prevention with vaccines. First, the traditional health economic assessment technique came from an area of evaluating di erent therapies against a same disease with the focus on individual bene t. There is nothing wrong in doing this, but individual bene t limits the view on total value of prevention especially in transmissible diseases. Prevention works at the individual level but it then also heavily impacts the next level of evaluation which is the population. At that level there are di erent rules of epidemiological and of economic assessment that prevail than at the individual level. But we often forget to evaluate the population in our economic assessment of vaccines. The latter disturb the transmission of the pathogen in a susceptible population generating therefore additional indirect bene t amongst those who are unvaccinated which is called herd protection. That e ect complicates the modelling of mimicking correctly the impact the vaccine has over time as the /one.lf MJ Postma and BA Standaert9bene t at the population level is bigger than the sum of the individual bene t of the vaccinated persons [5]. Second particularity is the price set for vaccines, highlighted by people unfamiliar with health economics, asking the question why vaccines don't cost so much. V accines prevent many deaths and save so many life years as they primarily act against infectious diseases in children with often high death rates. Should we then put a much higher price on those vaccines than what we are doing now [6]? Worse, if we compare vaccines with other prevention strategies used today such as statins that lower the blood cholesterol levels to prevent cardio-vascular diseases, one might be surprised to observe these speci c preventative drugs cost more and bene t less than vaccines. How come? There are reasons that explain this paradox and I will briefl y come back to that in the last chapter. A related paradox concerns the economic assessment of vaccines in low- versus high-income countries (LICs versus HICs). The absolute bene t of vaccines is much higher in LICs than in HICs, whereas the payment is much higher in HICs than in LICs. The paradox is there but how to handle that correctly? Traditional economic assessment tools may not give us the full answer here. Finally, we nicely evaluate the vaccine from within a silo-narrow perspective of the disease, focussing on the health and health care bene t but neglecting the broader perspective of all societal aspects. We almost forget to look outside the initial box to evaluate the problem into another new box-as said by Luc de Brabandere, 'it is scary to look outside the rst box as there are no references to consider when being outside the familiar box' [7]. It brings us to underestimating the total value of vaccines. How to cope with undervaluing the total potential of a vaccine? Bringing these 3 elements together - an economic assessment of the vaccine at the population or public health level we often miss to do; a price considered too low for the value the vaccine might give; a broader value impact by looking into new boxes - it should demonstrate that the economic assessment of vaccines we perform today with the traditional methods is far from being complete. Additional approaches should be sought. They could be more complex than what has conventionally been assessed within the therapeutic eld but not always necessarily. Meanwhile, the health economic assessment of a vaccination program can only be considered complete if we have the strength to think beyond the incremental analysis. Moreover incremental analysis is a technique that is confrontational as it selects between two options only: being cost-e ective or not. In practice we rarely apply this duality thinking about medical interventions because it is too restrictive to dismiss one option against the other. As a health care provider we like to maintain access to many ways of action when it comes to manage a disease. With that focus I propose to add an additional way of performing Chapter 1Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 10health economics. It promotes the refl ection about optimisation by looking for combination of di erent options and working under speci c constraints while aiming to reach a speci c health goal within a time frame [8]. It is already applied since a long time in many di erent sectorial domains of the economy that have a public demand such as handling the environment, making the world of transport e cient, shifting the energy delivery towards clean and renewable sources. We optimise what is reachable, but work under speci c constraints of budget and logistics, among others. This is something we haven't applied enough in health care where major potential exists to be more e cient. In the next chapter I will rst use the conventional health economic approach of incremental cost-e ectiveness analysis of rotavirus vaccination (see chapter 2-3). I may come to two evidences when positioning the value of vaccines worldwide. One is that in the developed world the introduction of a new vaccine is about a substitute in the existing health care system and organisation. Therefore all the values or all the bene ts must be shown to become successful with the substitute (see chapter 4). Maybe cost-bene t analysis is for vaccines a better option than cost-e ectiveness analysis in the economic value assessment of the product. In the developing world is the positioning of a new vaccine di erent. We are exposed to an add-on program instead of a substitute. The economic value positioning of the vaccine is anymore about what to replace in the health care system, but about priority setting when working under constrained budgets. Here the technique should be about budget optimisation and obtaining a good return on investment (chapter 5). In the last chapter 6 I give additional refl ections about where to go with these ndings and what type of next research steps should be considered.11THE CONVENTIONAL WAY OF PERFORMING THE HEAL TH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ROTAVIRUS VACCINE As mentioned in the introduction, the economic assessment of new vaccines has followed the same pathway as the one designed for therapeutic drugs. I applied the technique on rotavirus vaccination following this classic approach. By doing so I was able to present the basic economic value of this vaccine. It allows learning what is appropriate and what can be discovered in addition (see next chapter). /two.lf./one.lf ROT AVIRUS DISEASE BURDEN In the absence of getting access to very detailed information at country level about the disease burden caused by rotavirus diarrhoea in children which should include cost estimates, I investigated the problem using a modelling approach for 4 di erent countries in Europe: two big countries (United Kingdom (UK) and France) and two smaller ones (the Netherlands and Belgium). The comparison between the countries is interesting as France and Belgium have a more open health care system where people may have direct access to emergency rooms. This is di erent for the Netherlands and the UK where stricter control of patients moving to the next health care level is organised through gate-keeping rules set by primary health care physicians. As a result in France and Belgium the disease burden shifts to the health care delivery system in terms of a higher number of hospitalisations and emergency room services, and eventually, a higher medical cost. In the UK and the Netherlands more burden remains at the level of the parents (i.e. the non- professional care-givers) where the indirect cost is higher. It is estimated that the overall cost including direct and indirect cost does not vary that much between the countries and is estimated at around \u20ac23.00/yr per child at risk [9]. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF ROTAVIRUS DISEASE IN FOUR COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION PIDJ, 2008, 27: S20-S27 ABSTRACT BackgroundBackground : Rotavirus disease is associated with a substantial nancial burden. Rotavirus gastroenteritis in children under 5 results in considerable medical resource utilization and burden for parents and society. Methods : For this study a modelling approach was employed to assess the nancial burden of rotavirus disease in 4 European Union countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). Both direct medical costs to health authorities and indirect costs borne by society, parents and employers are calculated. Switzerland 3Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UKExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 12Results : The Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP)-adjusted direct cost expressed as a cost per exposure year, per child under ve, is highest in France (\u20ac 12.26) and Belgium (\u20ac 11.80) compared with the Netherlands (\u20ac 8.13) and the UK (\u20ac 7.67). The PPP-adjusted indirect cost is estimated to be highest in the UK (\u20ac 15.47) and the Netherlands (\u20ac 15.33) compared with France (\u20ac 11.31) and Belgium (\u20ac 10.24). The sum of the direct medical and indirect costs of rotavirus disease management is estimated to be \u20ac 23.11 \u00b1 \u20ac 0.70/yr per child under 5 years for all 4 countries. Conclusions : In countries where more emphasis is placed on rst-line intervention (UK, the Netherlands), direct costs were lower than in countries where access to second-line healthcare support was more open (Belgium, France). The data suggest that the greater burden of nancial responsibility of managing rotavirus disease in children is borne by society (higher in the UK and the Netherlands than in France and Belgium). In Europe investment in rotavirus disease management is substantial, therefore medical and economic bene ts of a vaccination strategy should be considered to reduce the medical and nancial burden associated with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. INTRODUCTION Rotavirus disease is associated with a substantial nancial burden. The virus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in infants and children under the age of 5 years worldwide [1-4]. Each year in industrialized countries, rotavirus AGE is responsible for an estimated 223,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million outpatient visits, and 7.1 million episodes of home care [2]. Thus, rotavirus AGE results in considerable medical resource utilization and substantial costs to national health care payers, families of patients and employers [5]. In Europe, these costs have only been studied in a limited way and in a few countries [6]. Total cost evaluation of a disease has a signi cant added value if positioned in the right context. This context is normally the evaluation of the total disease burden which, in addition to costs, includes the clinical consequences at population level (epidemiology) and the Quality of Life (QoL) impact. This complete set of information is essential for the economic evaluation of new treatment options emerging in the market and as such it may be requested from health care authorities as part of the assessment for their policies. The impact of new interventions on clinical outcomes and on QoL is most often measured and reported through randomized clinical trials. Total cost impact in contrast is generally more complex to assess and may be estimated using modelling techniques. This presents some speci c challenges; one such is to include the appropriate cost items in the analysis to refl ect the cost perspective under consideration such as that of the patient, the health care provider, the third party payer, or the society. Furthermore, it is impossible to report an overall cost across di erent countries because cost burden is country-speci c. For instance, a treatment resource may be used more often if it is relatively inexpensive, therefore the treatment uptake will infl uence the disease outcome and total management cost of the disease. Price di erences between countries may therefore infl uence the total cost picture.Chapter 2 13In terms of managing diarrhoea in infants and children caused by rotavirus infection, resource use and cost per case are well documented since the disease itself and the di erent treatment options are well de ned [1;3]. The remaining unknowns are the exact frequency of the disease per year, its distribution across various age groups and the proportion of the population following the di erent treatment patterns available. There are several methods for capturing epidemiological and nancial information relating to a disease. The most accurate is the application of prospective, observational cohort studies with duration of at least one year. An alternative method is the modelling approach that mimics the country-speci c disease distribution per year plus the country-speci c treatment options. Modelling allows the prediction of values missing in real life, such as the total number of diarrhoea events and associated emergency visits [7;8]. In the present study, we used the modelling approach to assess the nancial burden of rotavirus disease in four countries of the EU: Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the UK. We compared the cost of rotavirus disease in terms of direct medical and indirect costs and explored new ways of reporting the results. METHODS Country SelectionCountry Selection A decision tree model has been selected to investigate the nancial burden caused by rotavirus disease in EU countries. We selected countries for which su cient reliable back-ground data are available or easily accessible: Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the UK. This selection enabled us to make a comparison between two relatively small and two larger EU countries. Model selection We constructed a Markov cohort model [9] developed in TreeAge software (http:// www.treeage.com/) (Figure 1). This model refl ects the change in disease occurrence adjusted by subject age. The model also includes the di erent treatment patterns for rotavirus disease, and can be adjusted to the pattern speci c to each country. For example, the Netherlands and the UK have an organized medical telephone service where the caller can obtain treatment advice; this is a form of paid support which is not available in other countries. The model is calibrated to the overall disease frequency estimates by country per year over the di erent age groups and time periods. Model assumptionsModel assumptions Model assumptions speci c to the disease or country include the following: 1) From the underlying disease pattern for rotavirus disease [9-11], a Weibull distribution [12] of probability of infection over the rst 70 months of life was constructed with the following parameters: shape coe cient 1.5 and scale coe cient 24.2 (see Figure 2). These parameter values were con rmed by a multi-centre prospective study of the burden of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis in Europe, the REVEAL study [13].14Figure 1 General cohort model structure for rotavirus diarrhea to estimate cost of illness by country ChooseNo No Vaccine1st EventJan Vaccine VaccinepNVaccinatedL V VMChapter 2 152) Overall frequency data on rotavirus diarrhoea events in children under 5 years old are absent. Only data on children seeking medical advice are available. Unless speci ed, we assumed conservatively that overall a minimum of 40% of the subjects of one birth cohort would su er from rotavirus diarrhoea before 5 years of age and that medical advice would be sought for a maximum of one in two sick children. The values are comparative estimates based upon studies conducted in France [9]. They are submitted to sensitivity analysis (see below). 3) Full breastfeeding confers protection against viral diarrhoea events [14;15]. We assumed that at least 50% of infants are breast-fed at birth with an exponential decrease thereafter (beta-scale coe cient = 2). 4) Only severely ill children for whom medical advice is sought will be sent to hospital. The severity scale used here is based on a Vesikari score of 11 or more out of 20 points [16]. 5) Nosocomial infections occur in a maximum of one-third of young children hospitalized for causes other than community acquired rotavirus diarrhoea, and they are age-dependent [17]. Cost data Two cost perspectives are considered in this analysis. One is the authority in a country funding the medical costs; the other is the society which includes all the other costs related directly or indirectly to the management of the disease under study. Unit cost data by country for direct medical costs reimbursed or paid by the health authorities in a country are collected from national databases. However, one Figure 2 Weibull distribution simulating rotavirus disease frequency as a function 0 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 5 70Probability Age (months)X<= 3.34 5.0%X <= 50.29 95.0%Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 16 T able 1 Unit costs for di erent items in the treatment of diarrhea per country (expressed in \u20ac 2006)1 Unadjusted Netherlands France Belgium UK Medical visit 1 884\u20ac 580\u20ac 2 311\u20ac 733.52\u20ac 1 030\u20ac 1 References are indicated in parentheses PPP , Purchasing Power Parity N/A, Not applicableChapter 2 17should be aware that reimbursement costs vary slightly within short time periods in a country and one should therefore check for regular updates of those cost values. Table 1 presents the unit costs for a medical ( rst-line), emergency, and hospital visit, plus the unit costs for treatment. To perform cross-country comparisons, we adjusted the unit cost values with the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) health care exchange rates per country provided by the OECD [18]. No discount rate was applied on the cost gures as the analysis reports costs per child per year. Indirect costs were estimated by considering the loss of productivity of the parents of children with rotavirus diarrhoea using the human capital approach [19]. The data for out-of-pocket costs such as additional nappies, co-payment for drugs and medical visits, transport and parking costs are not readily available or are di cult to assess at the country level, therefore they were not included in this analysis. To obtain an accurate assessment of lost productivity at country level, we analyzed the legislation of social security regarding maternity, parental and sick child-related leave for paid jobs in each country (Table 2). The period of legislated, T able 2 Maternity, parental and sick child related leave arrangements per country Country Maternity Leave Parental Leave Sick Child-Related LeaveRef Netherlands 16 weeks or 112 days, starting 4 to 6 weeks before childbirth3 months FT or 6 months PT until the child's 8th birthday10 days a year [37-39] France 16 weeks or 112 days (6 weeks before and 10 weeks a/ft er birth) 26 weeks for the third child and subsequent births (8 weeks before and 18 weeks a/ft er birth)1 year Renewed twice per family until the child is 3 years old3 days a year 5 days a year if the child is under 12 months of age or if parent is caring for at least 3 children under the age of 16[37-40] Belgium 15 weeks 3 months FT or 6 months PT per parent per child until the child is 6 years old10 days a year [38;39;41] UK 26 weeks or 182 days, starting at the 11th week before delivery Note: as of April 1st 2007, fl at-rate allowance can be paid up to 39 weeks for eligible mothers13 weeks per parent per child before the child is 6 years old Maximum 4 weeks a year T o be arranged with the employer[37-39;42] FT , Full time PT , Part time Other sources used: 1) EURES - the European Job Mobility Portal (The European Commission): h/tt p://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.js p?acro=lw&lang=en&catId=490&parentId=0 2) The EMIRE database (European foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions): h/tt p:// www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/emire.htmlExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 18paid maternity leave is included in the analysis. This period does not allow for accounting an indirect cost during maternity leave. Due to the lack of detailed data on parental and sick child-related leave these issues are too complex to be considered and accounted for in this model. Therefore we estimate a minimum and maximum value of indirect cost due to the impact of rotavirus diarrhoea for each country in the following way: the model generates the number of days of sick child-related leave (due to the child's diarrhoea) for one year (post-maternity leave). This value was multiplied by the reported proportion of employed women in the age-range of 15 to 39 years and the average payment per working hour per women per country. Data on women in the workforce were obtained from the o cial European statistics database for each country (Table 3). These calculations are considered to yield the maximum estimate of indirect cost by country. The minimum estimate assumed that only half the women in the workforce have a paid job during the rst and subsequent years post-partum. Many mothers choose part-time work during that period or bene t from parental leave as authorized in their country. The true value of the indirect cost estimate should fall between the estimates of maximum and minimum values. Lastly, we investigated which group (authorities, employers, and/or employees) paid the most in terms of indirect costs by country. Sensitivity AnalysisSensitivity Analysis Multiple probabilistic sensitivity analysis is performed on direct medical costs with TreeAge software on two aspects of the input data using distribution estimates: proportion of children with rotavirus AGE and unit cost data (Table 4). Statistical AnalysisStatistical Analysis The overall results are reported as absolute costs in Euros (\u20ac), per child under 5/uni00A0years of age and per country. In the multiple probabilistic sensitivity analysis the model is run in second-order Monte-Carlo simulation [12] with 1,000 iterations for each country and reports a cost distribution per country per child under 5/uni00A0years of age. RESUL TS The observed values and modelled annual estimates of the total number of rotavirus-related AGE events in children <5 years of age in each country are shown in Table 5. The model accurately reproduces the known values such as the number of medical visits and the hospitalizations for each country.

Numerical values assembled in Table 5 are then used to estimate the total direct medical costs per year and the direct cost per child under the age of 5/uni00A0years (Table/uni00A06). These costs are presented unadjusted and PPP-adjusted and are tabulated as major cost items for each country per year. The unadjusted cost per child per year varied from \u20ac 7.97 to \u20ac 13.64, and the PPP-adjusted cost from \u20ac 7.67 to \u20ac 12.26. Table 7 shows the estimated PPP-adjusted indirect costs with minimum and maximum values, overall and per child per year. The range of the indirect cost per child per year is estimated at \u20ac 10.22 - \u20ac 20.44 in the \u20ac 10.31 - \u20ac 20.63 in the UK. The calculation of the grand total of direct medical and indirect costs related to rotavirus AGE is reported in Table 8. The sums of both, the direct medical and the indirect costs, reveal that the calculated cost per child of the annual birth cohort and per country is around \u20ac 23.11 \u00b1 0.70 (\u00b1 3%). In other words, all four countries spend very similar amounts per child per year for the total management of rotavirus AGE.

DISCUSSION Contrary to what one might expect, estimating the total management cost of a disease at country level is not a straightforward exercise. Although the epidemiology of rotavirus disease, its distribution as a function of age and its annual peak during the winter period may be similar across the di erent countries, its management and its related costs vary considerably. The use of available healthcare resources depends upon the speci c structure of each country's healthcare system. In the UK and the Netherlands, more emphasis is placed on rst-line intervention, limiting the use of the more costly second-line healthcare support systems such as emergency services and hospitals. By contrast, Belgium and France provide open access to second-line interventions sooner during the disease process, incurring a higher average direct cost per child for the treatment of rotavirus disease. Consequently, the average direct medical costs per child per year vary by an approximate cost di erence of \u20ac/uni00A04.6 between the most and the least expensive countries. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that healthcare systems such as those in the Netherlands and the UK may manage rotavirus disease more e ciently compared with the systems in France and Belgium as they do not seem to have comparatively more diarrhoea cases or speci c deaths, yet their average global medical management costs per child are lower. This is also refl ected in the curves of Figure 3 where France and Belgium have much larger standard deviations around average costs than the Netherlands and the UK. In all four countries, 70 to 80% of the total direct medical costs are due to hospitalization including community acquired and nosocomial infections. The indirect costs are, however, highest in the Netherlands and the UK, contrary to what is observed for the direct medical costs. The surprising result is that the total costs of AGE are very similar in all 4 countries studied, with the di erence between the most and the least expensive country being marginal (\u20ac 1.53). This result demonstrates that a direct medical cost analysis alone would only have revealed part of the total relevant costs. One can conclude that the more emphasis is placed on rst-line treatment and parental care of sick children, the higher the indirect costs are for society, as the comparison between the UK and the Netherlands on one hand and France and Belgium on the other demonstrates. The strength of our comparative analysis is that it follows a standard approach for every country and uses the same basic model with the underlying distribution of the disease as a function of age. It allows for a better comparison across countries. Another advantage is that we are able to estimate an average investment per child per year per country. It is known that for every child born in one of the four countries studied, the health authorities will invest on average between \u20ac 7.67 and \u20ac 12.26 in direct medical costs against rotavirus disease per year and between \u20ac/uni00A010.2 and \u20ac 15.5 in indirect costs per year. The total costs (direct and indirect) are very similar for all 4 countries at \u20ac 23.11 \u00b1 0.7 (\u00b1 3%). Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 24The limitations of our analysis should also be considered. The cost per unit for each service o ered and the total number of rotavirus disease events has been di cult to quantify with su cient accuracy. The use of modelling implies that assumptions and uncertainties are introduced into the evaluation. Thus, our modelling approach may be open to criticism regarding the way some data are analyzed and interpreted, particularly with respect to the missing data. Serious disease events may lead to hospitalization whereas mild and moderate events are more often treated at home or in outpatient settings. In that respect, the model introduces limits on the units it generates: the number of emergency visits and hospitalizations should always be lower than the number of serious rotavirus- related AGE events. The sum of subjects staying at home, not seeking medical advice, together with those seeking advice should be equal to the total number of children with rotavirus diarrhoea. Using sensitivity analysis, we tested these uncertainties to observe their combined importance as shown in Figure 3. Our approach is appropriate or even conservative when the results presented here are compared with recent investigations in Belgium and France [20;21]. For instance, the direct medical and grand total cost for rotavirus disease estimated by Bilcke et al. [20] for Belgium amount to \u20ac 7.4 million and \u20ac 19.6 million, respectively. Our results of \u20ac 7.7 million for direct medical and \u20ac 14.5 million (unadjusted cost gures in Tables 6 and 8, respectively) for the grand total were in line for the direct medical, but underestimated for the indirect cost as expected. For France, Huet et al. [21] report total direct costs of \u20ac 63 million to the National Healthcare Payer rising to \u20ac 177 million from the societal perspective compared with \u20ac 48.5 million and \u20ac 87.1 million, respectively, here. This can in part be explained by the inclusion of out-of-pocket costs by Huet et al. Another important di erence is that Huet reports a much higher percentage of children with rotavirus AGE seeking medical care compared with this publication. Lorgelly et al. [22] reported the total cost per child from a societal perspective in the UK as \u00a386.33. During the at risk period of 5-years this would equate to approximately \u20ac 26 per year, compared with the unadjusted total cost per child per year of \u20ac 24 presented in this analysis.T able 9 Distribution of indirect costs by country Netherlands France Belgium UK Maternity leave Compulsory health insurance Financed by contributions from employers, employees, stateCompulsory social insurance Financed by contributions from employers, employees, taxesCompulsory social insurance Financed by contributions from employers, employees, stateFinanced by contributions from employers, employees, taxes Parental leave Unpaid As above As above Unpaid Sick child - related leaveEmployer Unpaid Unpaid Employer Sources: Netherlands: Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport: Health Insurance in the Netherlands.

Our estimate for indirect costs should be substantiated with additional data to be collected through information supplied by the parents. We expect to have details on this type of data soon. In the absence of accurate data, the cost estimate for parental and sick child-related leave yielded only a range. In this analysis, it was further assumed that only mothers took sick child-related leave. In healthcare systems such as those of the Netherlands and the UK, much of the nancial responsibility of caring for children with rotavirus disease falls on the parents. Indirect costs are often not included in health economic analyses but constitute a considerable burden for families and society. Thus, in countries where rst-line management is most promoted, a vaccination policy to prevent rotavirus disease is likely to bene t individuals and employers more than the healthcare sector. Employers may see the bene t in o ering a free-of-charge vaccination program to young children of their employees (Table 9). Further data are required before this approach is more thoroughly considered. Rotavirus infection is a major cause of AGE in children under the age of 5 years [2]. Children with severe diarrheal disease are often hospitalized, contributing a signi cant cost to the healthcare expenditures in a country. In addition, rotavirus disease causes considerable burden for parents and families who must take time o work or other activities to care for their sick children. Studies in the UK and the US have shown that rotavirus vaccination is a cost-e ective intervention and can improve the QoL of children and their parents a ected Global illness and deaths caused by rotavirus disease in children.

Di erent options were explored to get that type of information collected in one or another way. One proposal was to collect the data through surrogate persons who are classi ed as most neutral to the situation but still having enough experience with the disease and its consequences to be able to evaluate correctly the situation. A number of GPs and paediatricians in the UK were interviewed and they were exposed to series of scenarios from mild to severe diseases and that for two Chapter 2 29di erent age-groups (<18 months and >=18 months). This way of working allows getting a good range of utility scores by di erent health states the disease can go through. This was reported in the following publication [10]. ESTIMATING UTILITY SCORES IN YOUNG CHILDREN WITH ACUTE ROTAVIRUS GASTROENTERITIS IN THE UK JME, 2008, 11: 471-484. ABSTRACT ObjectiveObjective : To estimate utility scores for di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged <5 years in the UK. Methods : UK general practitioners (n=25) and paediatricians (n=25) rated four di erent health state descriptions of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis using the EuroQol (EQ-5D) questionnaire for children aged <18 months and 18 months to 5 years. EQ-5D scores were modi ed to account for limited self-care and mobility, and converted into utility values using the standard algorithm using UK data. Results : General practitioners rated the mean utility for primary care cases at 0.781 (SD 0.263) and 0.688 (SD 0.345) for the younger and older age groups, respectively. For hospitalised cases the corresponding scores were 0.425 (SD 0.243) and 0.200 (SD 0.386). Paediatricians rated the mean utility for hospitalised severe cases at 0.595 (SD 0.171) and 0.634 (SD 0.217) in the younger and older groups, respectively, and for hospitalised very severe cases at 0.256 (SD 0.251) and 0.077 (SD 0.340), respectively. In all cases, the utility di erences between the health states were statistically signi cant (p<0.0001). Conclusions : Acute rotavirus gastroenteritis substantially impairs quality of life in children aged <5 years as rated by health professionals. This study provides useful quantitative utility estimates for economic evaluations. INTRODUCTION Acute rotavirus gastroenteritis is a highly contagious viral disease that is most common during the winter and mainly a ects infants and young children less than ve years old. The main symptoms of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis are vomiting, fever and profuse watery diarrhoea, which may result in serious dehydration [1] [2]. It has been estimated that almost every child will be infected with the virus before the age of ve years [3]. Over 600,000 children will die annually from rotavirus-related illness worldwide [4]. Most of the deaths (over 80%) occur in the developing world. In industrialised countries death from acute rotavirus gastroenteritis is rare, but the disease burden is substantial. For example, rotavirus is responsible for 50% of A. 3GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Wavre, BelgiumExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 30hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis in children aged <5 years in Australia [5]. In the UK, the number of children aged <5 years hospitalised for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis is estimated to be as high as 17,000 a year, or 5.2 per 1000 [6]. Other developed countries report similar rates; 7.5 per 1000 in Australia, and 3 per 1000 in the European Union [7]. Many rotavirus infections are hospital-acquired. A study in a UK paediatric hospital estimated that rotavirus was responsible for 19% of healthcare- associated acute gastroenteritis [8], and across the European Union countries 21% cases of rotavirus cases of acute rotavirus have been estimated to cost approximately 900-1800 Euros (\u20ac) per case in four European Union countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the UK) [9]. Acute rotavirus gastroenteritis is also a substantial burden on primary care, accounting for up to 29% of the visits to general practitioners (GPs) for infectious intestinal disease in children aged <5 years, or over 150,000 GP visits per year in the UK [10]. There is no speci c treatment for rotavirus infection [4;4], and the aim of clinical management in most cases is the prevention of dehydration [1]. However, oral rehydration therapy can be di cult to administer successfully in children with severe vomiting, which is common in acute rotavirus gastroenteritis [4], and rotavirus gastroenteritis occurs mainly in the winter, when health services are already under pressure. This makes vaccination an attractive option to prevent rotavirus-related illness and hospitalisations [11], with the potential to reduce considerably the associated morbidity and healthcare costs in both primary and secondary care. A recent study in infants in their rst two years of life in six European countries showed that the vaccine RIX4414 (Rotarix1) was highly e ective, reducing acute rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes of any severity by 87% [12]. RIX4414 is a monovalent vaccine derived from the most common human rotavirus strain, G1P [13]. It provides cross-protection against most other serotypes and is given in two oral doses. A second rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq2, a pentavalent vaccine based on a bovine strain (WC3), has also demonstrated e cacy and is administered in three oral doses [14]. The research presented in the current paper is applicable to both vaccines. When deciding whether to introduce and fund mass rotavirus vaccination programmes, healthcare providers will require data on the cost- e ectiveness of vaccination as well as on safety and e cacy. Cost-utility analysis, in which health bene ts are expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY s), is a widely accepted approach for assessing the cost-e ectiveness of healthcare technologies [15], and is applied by bodies such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Calculation of the potential gain in QALY s from implementing a vaccination programme requires a health-related quality of life (HRQL) weighting or utility value for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis health states, on a scale between 0 (death) and 1 (full health). 1 Rotarix is a trade mark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies 2 RotaT eq is a trade mark of Merck & CoChapter 2 31Such utility values are presently lacking, because of the di culty of obtaining those values from young children and/or their direct environment. A study in Canada presented as an abstract has estimated utility values for children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis by proxy assessment using the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), but did not distinguish between di erent severities of illness [16]. A recently published study in Germany has estimated HRQL in young children with diarrhoea by proxy assessment using a visual analogue scale [17]. To our knowledge, no previous study has estimated utility scores for di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis using a recognised HRQL instrument with a validated method for converting the scores into utility values. The objective of the present study was to estimate utility values for various severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged <5 years in the UK. Results from the study have been presented at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) 9th Annual European Congress in 2006 [18]. PATIENTS AND METHODS Utility was rated by 25 general practitioners (GPs) and 25 paediatricians as proxy respondents, as infants and young children would be unable to complete a HRQL questionnaire. Physicians were selected instead of parents as they were considered more likely to be able to distinguish between di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. All respondents were working within the UK National Health Service (NHS) and had a minimum of 5 years and maximum of 25 years of experience. They were drawn from ve geographical regions of the UK (Scotland, Wales, South-east England, Midlands and North/North-east England). Currently there is no disease-speci c HRQL questionnaire developed for diarrhoea in children and few speci c instruments are designed to assess the generic HRQL in children aged <5 years [19;20]. HRQL in young children can be assessed using parents or physicians as proxy respondents [19]. Several tools are available for measuring HRQL and utility [21;22]. For the present study we decided to use the EuroQol (EQ5D) questionnaire [23], completed by healthcare professionals acting as patient proxies with the necessary clinical experience to rate the health state of children with acute gastroenteritis. The EQ5D was chosen because it is widely used, was designed to be applicable in multiple countries, and the rating scores derived from it can be converted to utility values using a standard country-speci c algorithm [24]. The EQ5D rates quality of life in ve dimensions or domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Respondents were presented with health state descriptions, representing the clinical presentation of di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis, and asked to rate each health state for infants aged <18 months and children aged 18 months to 5 years. Two age bands were used because most children aged 18 months or over are able to walk and so the mobility domain of the EQ5D is more relevant in this age group. Health state descriptions were checked by a GlaxoSmithKline physician (Dr Norman Begg) with both clinical and public health experience.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 32GPs do not routinely test for rotavirus infection and so were presented with two health state descriptions of acute infectious gastroenteritis, one describing a case severe enough to be referred to hospital, and the other describing a case that could be managed in primary care. The GPs were not asked to decide whether they would refer each case, the criterion of referral was explicit in the health T able 1 Health state descriptions presented to respondents General practitioners Primary care only Referred to hospital Acute gastroenteritis NOT severe enough to warrant referral for hospital admission Liquid diarrhoea (loose stools, non-bloody), 1-3 episodes/day Vomiting either not present or infrequent Fever may or may not be present Dehydration may be present BUT parents/ carers are able to manage rehydration at home OR No signs of dehydration present and risk of dehydration is LOWAcute gastroenteritis severe enough to warrant referral for hospital admission Liquid diarrhoea present (more than usual loose stools, non-bloody), 4 or more episodes/day Vomiting may or may not be present Fever may or may not be present Signs of dehydration are present AND parents/carers are unable to manage rehydration at home OR There is a high risk of dehydration (>4 vomits/day; >8 liquid stools/day; child aged severe Hospitalised, very severe Acute rotavirus infection severe enough to warrant admission or at least short-term observation Vesikari score 10 Signs of 3-8% dehydration present OR high risk of dehydration Parents unable to manage rehydrationAcute rotavirus infection severe enough to warrant admission or at least short-term observation Vesikari score 10 Signs of 9% dehydration present Vesikari score described in reference [2] T able 2 Respondent characteristics GPs (n=25) Paediatricians (n=25) Number (%) England Midlands North/North-east England5 (20) 5 (20) 5 (20) 5 (20) 5 (20)4 (16) 6 (24) 6 (24) 5 (20) 4 (16) Years of experience: Mean 15.8 9.3 SEM 0.95 1.07 Median 18.0 8.0 Number of cases of acute gastroenteritis seen each month: Mean 18.1 20.6 SEM 4.00 4.60 Median 12.0 12.0 GP = general practitioner; SEM = standard error of the meanChapter 2 33state descriptions presented (Table 1). The health state descriptions were based on the major symptoms of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis described in the clinical literature, including frequency of liquid diarrhoea, presence of fever and/or vomiting, the risk of dehydration and the ability of parents to manage rehydration at home [25;26] (Table 1). All GPs were presented with the same two health state descriptions. Paediatricians were presented with two health state descriptions of acute rotavirus infection with a Vesikari score of at least 10, which indicates a clinical severity su cient to be considered for admission to hospital. The two health states were di erentiated by the severity of dehydration present (Table 1). All paediatricians were presented with the same two health state descriptions. Respondents were asked to rate the health status of a child in each of the two age bands and each of the described health states in relation to the child's normal capability in full health. If they felt a domain was not applicable for a child of the given age band, they could mark the domain \"not applicable\". Where a respondent marked a domain \"not applicable\", this was assigned a default rating of 1, meaning \"no impairment\". In the main analysis, the self-care and mobility domains were assigned a rating score of 1 for children aged <18 months, and the domain of self- care a rating score of 1 in children aged 18 months to 5 years, regardless of whether respondents rated these domains. This modi cation was applied because children aged <5 years would normally have limited capacity for self-care and children aged <18 months would normally have limited mobility, so it may not be valid to attempt to rate the impact of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis on these domains. A secondary analysis considered the raw data scores, without these modi cations, and both sets of data are presented here. The raw and modi ed EQ5D scores were converted to weighted utility values using a published algorithm [24]. This assigns each EQ5D score a utility value based on a survey of a representative sample of the UK population using the time trade-o method. Descriptive statistics were compiled, including mean, standard deviation, median and 95% con dence intervals (95% CI). Non-normality was tested using kurtosis and skewness and con rmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons between di erent age groups were performed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, as the data were not normally distributed. However, reporting focuses on mean values, as these are of more interest for economic evaluation than medians. P-values 0.05 determined statistically signi cant di erences. Descriptive summary statistics were analysed using Microsoft Excel and the comparative statistics were analysed using Stata (StataCorp, Texas, US) version 9. RESUL TS A total of 25 GPs and 25 paediatricians participated in the survey. Their distribution across the ve geographic regions of the UK is shown in Table 2.

The mean modi ed disutility score (1 - the utility score) for a child with acute gastroenteritis seen by the GP was -0.219 in the younger age group (aged <18 months), and -0.312 for children aged 18 months to 5 years, indicating substantial impairment of HRQL. In both age groups, the more clinically severe health state requiring referral to hospital was associated with a signi cantly (p<0.0001) lower utility score than less severe gastroenteritis that could be managed in primary care. The raw utility scores showed the same pattern as the modi ed scores in the main analysis. Table 4 presents the modi ed and raw utility scores from the paediatricians' EQ5D ratings of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis admitted to hospital. The mean modi ed disutility scores were -0.405 for children aged <18 months and -0.366 for children aged 18 months to 5 years with severe rotavirus gastroenteritis needing hospitalisation. In the older age group hospitalised with very severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, the lower bound of the 95% con dence interval was below zero, indicating that this health state could have a utility value lower than death. Although the EQ5D questionnaire cannot be scored at less than zero, the process used to convert the EQ5D scores into utility values can produce negative values. As with the ratings provided by GPs, the di erence in utility scores between the two severities of illness was statistically signi cant (p<0.0001). The raw data scores displayed the same pattern, with lower utility scores in the more clinically severe health states in both age groups (Table 4).

The utility score was highest (least impaired) in the health state requiring primary care only, and lowest (most impaired) in the health state representing hospitalisation for very severe rotavirus illness. The more severe of the health states rated by GPs (presenting in primary care and referred to hospital) and the less severe of the hospitalised health states rated by paediatricians both had intermediate utility scores, consistent with their intermediate clinical severity.

Consistent with the results for the younger age group, these data also show the highest utility score in the health state requiring primary care only and the lowest score in the hospitalised very severe health state. The di erences between the modi ed and raw scores were consistently larger in the younger age group (Figure 1) than in the older age group (Figure 2). This is to be expected, as two domains were modi ed in the younger age group and only one was modi ed in the older age group.

Health state D DISCUSSION This study estimated utility scores for di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged <5 years in the UK, using GPs and paediatricians as proxy respondents. Each group of health professionals rated two health states of di ering clinical severity for children in each of two age groups using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The EQ-5D scores were then converted into utility values using the standard algorithm as described by the EuroQoL group [24]. As expected, all four health states in both age groups were associated with impaired HRQL, as indicated by mean and median utility scores. This nding suggests that acute rotavirus gastroenteritis imposes a burden of decreased HRQL on patients, and consequently that prevention of infection could provide valuable gains in utility. There was some variation between respondents' scores, as would be expected (Tables 3 and 4). Exploration of the factors underlying such variations, such as potential di erences in perception between regions or between rural and urban settings, could be an interesting subject for future study, but is beyond the scope of the present paper. Both GPs and paediatricians rated the more clinically severe health states as having signi cantly (p<0.0001) lower utility scores than the less severe health states, and this result held true across both age groups. Thus, it appears that the utility score derived from the EQ5D used in this study is able to di erentiate between di erent severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis, and should therefore be able to provide useful estimates of utility for use in economic evaluations. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 38The results of the main analysis are further supported by the raw scores, which followed a similar pattern of lower utility in the more clinically severe health states. As expected, the numerical di erence between the raw and modi ed scores was greater in the younger age group (aged <18 months), refl ecting the fact that two of the ve EQ5D domains (mobility and self-care) were modi ed in this age group, while in the older age group only the self-care domain was modi ed. It should be noted that the modi cations to the score provide a conservative estimate of the utility impact, as no impairment was assumed in the modi ed domains, even if the respondents indicated that there was impairment. As a result, the raw utility scores were always lower than the modi ed scores across all age groups and all health states (Tables 3 and 4, Figures 1 and 2). Thus, this study may have underestimated the true impact of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis on HRQL. A further potential limitation of the study may be that it only considered the impact of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis on the HRQL of the patients, without attempting to capture the impact on parents or carers. This would also tend to underestimate the loss of utility attributable to rotavirus infection, as a recent cost-e ectiveness study using utility estimates from a Canadian study [16] reported that the number of QALY s lost by carers was one of the three parameters with the greatest e ect on the modelled results [27]. The EQ-5D was developed for use in adults and has not been validated in children aged <5 years. However, as reported in a recent review [28], no satisfactory generic HRQL instrument has yet been developed for use in this age group. The ability of the EQ-5D-derived utility scores to discriminate between the di erent severities of health states presented to the respondents in the present study suggests that it provides a reasonably reliable measure of utility. The study was conducted using proxy respondents because of the obvious di culties in obtaining responses in this age group. This is consistent with current theory and practice, as the lower age-limit for self-reported instruments in children is generally 5-6 years [29], and a proxy respondent is the recommended approach [20]. Healthcare professionals were chosen for this study rather than parents because it was considered that they would be more likely to be able to distinguish between di erent clinical severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. There is a clear need for more data on the e ect of rotavirus infection on utility scores for use in conducting economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccines [15]. A recent cost-e ectiveness study of rotavirus vaccination in the UK suggested that health service funding of a rotavirus vaccine programme may be considered appropriate if there were a su cient gain in quality of life for the parents and children involved, but was unable to estimate the potential gain because of the absence of utility data [30]. A separate analysis in the UK [27] estimated QALY s for both patients and parents by applying utility data derived from a Canadian study, although there was no di erentiation according to disease severity. The present study provides the rst estimate of the impact of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis on HRQL in infants and young children that distinguishes between di erent severities of illness and utilises a recognised HRQL instrument (the EQ-Chapter 2 395D) with a validated method (25) for converting to utility scores. As such, it o ers a valuable contribution to research on the potential cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus vaccination programmes in Europe. Economic modelling studies applying these estimates are underway in several European countries, including the Netherlands [31], Belgium [32], Italy [33] and the UK [34]. These should provide new information to add to previous cost-e ectiveness studies of rotavirus vaccination that have been based on the Canadian utility estimates that did not distinguish between di erent severities of rotavirus illness [27;35], or that have considered other outcome measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALY s) [36]. In conclusion, the present study provides quantitative utility estimates for young children with varying severities of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis, which should be useful in economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccines.

The model -called Roxanne (Rotarix Analysis of Economics)- allowed the comparison of a 2 versus 3 dose program that is administrated at di erent time points or months. The starting point for the model development was the model rst published by Melliez et al. showing the importance of breast feeding to reduce the rotavirus disease burden presented in 2005 before the rotavirus vaccine was available in the market. I have built on that model concept and added the many additional features [11]. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 42Interesting was the direct comparison between Melliez's model published in 2007 [12] on the cost-e ectiveness analysis of rotavirus vaccination in France with what I did in 2008 [13]. The point I wanted to highlight in the publication was to demonstrate how the change of many di erent features in a same constructed model can shift the analysis from not-being cost-e ective to become cost- e ective. The di erence was not only related to the data input but as well some structural di erences between the two models such as the risk period of 3 years for Melliez et al versus 5 years in our model. Roxanne model has been used and presented in many di erent forums and in many di erent countries. It has been part of many submissions at country level for getting reimbursement or participating in tenders. It was also part of an evaluation process organised by the WHO to compare the available rotavirus models worldwide in 2011. The model is accessible and has been made available to many health authorities worldwide [14]; [15]; [16]; [17]. One may be surprised to see that I didn't publish a cost-e ectiveness analysis with a dynamic model that includes the herd e ect of the vaccine. There are two reasons for that. One is that I developed a dynamic model in-house and came to the same results that were presented in the literature by Pitzer et al [18], Atkins et al [19;20], and Atchison et al [21]. There was nothing new to present that was already published. But I was more interested in what real life data should be able to give. Comparing those data with the results of the cohort model for which still today more people are familiar with, was a second motivation to analyse the problem that way instead of using a dynamic model. One issue I had with the dynamic compartmental model for rotavirus vaccination is how to disentangle correctly the di erent sources of infection and the di erent ways of getting the immune protection developed in function of age, forced by the vaccine on the one hand and by the exposure to the natural infection on the other hand. An important issue found is that after the age of 5 years the susceptible group became large again possibly leading to new infections but I was not sure if those new infections should lead to severe conditions that need medical attention or not. My suspicion was not because the rotavirus vaccination program was not able to eliminate the virus. So the wild type virus could still circulate in the community and may act as regular booster dose to enhance the immune response. This is further tackled with the impact studies in the next paragraph.Chapter 2 43COST/hyphen.caseEFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF VACCINATION AGAINST ROTAVIRUS WITH RIX/four.lf/four.lf/one.lf/four.lf IN FRANCE Appl Health Econ & Health Policy, 2008: 6(4): 1-18. ABSTRACT BackgroundBackground : It is estimated that annually 300,000 cases of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis (RVGE) occur in children aged up to 5 years in France. RIX4414 (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline), a two-dose vaccine against rotavirus infection, has been shown to be highly e ective against severe RVGE. ObjectiveObjective : This study evaluated the cost-e ectiveness of general vaccination against rotavirus using RIX4414 in France. Methods : A Markov model simulated RVGE events and the associated outcomes and costs in a birth cohort of children in France with a combined adjustment for age distribution with the seasonality of the infection. SettingSetting : Costs and outcomes were estimated from a limited societal perspective, including direct medical costs paid out-of-pocket or by third-party payers, as well as the proportion of direct medical costs reimbursed by the health authorities. Indirect costs were not included in the base case analysis. Patients : Children up to the age of 5 years in France. Intervention : General vaccination of infants against rotavirus infection using RIX4414 (Rotarix). Main outcome measure : The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results : V accination with RIX4414 incurred an incremental cost of \u20ac 44,583/QALY at a public price of \u20ac57 per vaccine dose. Univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the parameters with the largest infl uence on the results were: the transition probabilities of severe diarrhoea, seeking medical advice and emergency visits; utility scores of diarrhoea (mild) in children & infants; the discount rate for bene ts. Probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis con rms these results. The acceptability curve indicated that 94% of the results were under an informal threshold of \u20ac 50,000/QALY. Comparing our results with those of a recently published study using pooled data for two rotavirus vaccine products in France, the main di erences are explained by di erences in model structure and in data input values. They include: a di erent age-distribution of the infection, shorter duration of the at-risk period (3 years instead of 5 years); di erent vaccine e cacy; di erent unit France; 4Cemka-Eval, Bourg-la-Reine, FranceExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 44for the health states in the model. There is a need for agreed standards to improve comparability of results from di erent studies. Conclusions : The results demonstrate that a generalized vaccination strategy with RIX4414 would be cost-e ective in France from a limited societal perspective and depending on the base-line assumptions on disease progression and on utility scores selected. The limited societal perspective includes direct medical costs paid out-of-pocket or by third-party payers as well as the proportion of direct medical costs reimbursed by the health authorities, but does not include indirect costs. INTRODUCTION Rotavirus infection is a major cause of severe diarrhoea and gastroenteritis in children under the age of 5 years worldwide [1;2]. In the Western world the infection has a seasonal peak during the winter period [3] and the severe consequences of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) are most frequently observed under the age of 2 years, after which the number of new infections and diarrhea events decreases. Successive infections confer natural immunity [4] and severe rotavirus diarrhea events are rarely seen after the age of 5 years. Rotavirus is very contagious and its spread is di cult to control despite the application of primary hygiene measures. As a result, rotavirus epidemics are a well-known annually recurrent public health problem from November until March of each year. In France the number of diarrhoea events caused by rotavirus infection is estimated at 300,000 each year in children aged up to 5 years [5]. New vaccines against rotavirus, such as RIX4414 (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), are now available. A strategy of vaccinating children before the age of 6 months has the potential to provide protection against rotavirus infection over a period of at least two years. RIX4414 is a two- dose oral vaccine [6], and a phase III clinical trial in Europe has shown that this vaccine has a good safety pro le and is highly e ective against severe RVGE and hospitalizations caused by RVGE [7]. Health authorities need information on cost-e ectiveness of a vaccination strategy compared with the current situation in order to make reimbursement decisions. In 2005, Melliez et al. published a model of rotavirus infection in France that provided estimates of the costs and burden of illness [5]. Recently, the same group reported a cost-utility evaluation of rotavirus vaccination in France, based on the 2005 model and using pooled data on vaccine e cacy and cost for two rotavirus vaccine products [8]. We have further developed a similar model by including modi cations such as a combined age-related and seasonal variation in the infection. Using this model, we conducted a cost-utility evaluation of a rotavirus vaccination strategy using a speci c vaccine product, RIX4414. In this paper we present the results of our cost-utility analysis and discuss the issues raised from a comparison of the two models.Chapter 2 45METHODS We selected the Markov cohort model that was rst published in 2005 by Melliez et al. [5]. The model was constructed in Tree-Age Pro software to simulate rotavirus diarrhoea events and their associated outcomes in a hypothetical birth cohort of children aged up to 5 years (see Figure 1). The basic 'Melliez et al.' model structure was robust, but we re ned it by adjusting the model to enable the calibration of the epidemic spread of the disease as a function of age of the child and to account for seasonality of the infection within one model structure (see Figure 2). In one arm of the model children could be vaccinated with RIX4414, and in the other no rotavirus vaccination was allowed. The modelled costs and outcomes were compared between the two arms to estimate the cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus vaccination. To allow for the higher probability of infection during the winter period, the cohort entry was subdivided into monthly entrants with an equal number of subjects born each month from January to December. Monthly age-adjusted transition probabilities for the risk of infection and diarrhea were then applied for the cohort until the age of 5 years. Fully breast-fed children were assumed to be protected against infection. The total running period of the model was the average life-time of a subject in France, in order to capture the vaccine bene t of avoided deaths caused by rotavirus (number of cycles = 936 months or 78 years). The tree was constructed as a time-driven, dichotomized event-related process with a cycle time of one month. In each month, the starting cohort has a risk of a rst episode of rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. The diarrhoea event could lead to consultation of a medical practitioner, either rst line (general practitioner (GP), home care or paediatrician) or second line (emergency visit). A rst line medical visit could be followed by an emergency visit and/or by hospitalization. During hospitalization, death caused by the infection could occur. Once discharged from hospital or after a rst event, a subject younger than 5 years faced the risk of contracting a second episode of rotavirus infection leading again to diarrhoea. A second infection was assumed never to lead to hospitalization or a second line visit. It was assumed that no further infections would occur after the age of 5 years. Rotavirus infections can be transmitted between patients in hospital, so children who have been hospitalized for other reasons may be at risk of contracting hospital-acquired (nosocomial) rotavirus infections from rotavirus-infected children in the same paediatric unit. The model added branches to the tree in the \"no diarrhoea\" arm to allow for the possibility of nosocomial rotavirus-induced diarrhoea in children hospitalized for a non-rotavirus related event. This applied only to the winter period, refl ecting the seasonal peak of rotavirus infection. The tree was duplicated in the vaccine arm into a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated arm, which allows the model to test di erent rates of vaccine coverage for budget impact analysis.

Each of these health states was assigned a cost (Table 1a) and a utility score (Table 1b). All costs were estimated for the year 2005. Unit costs were obtained from o cial French nancial databases [9]. The cost of hospitalization was calculated by identifying cases coded as A080 (rotavirus gastroenteritis) for the main diagnosis in children aged <5 years. Using these cases and the national hospital costs database (Echelle Nationale des Co\u00fbts; ENC) [10], an average weighted cost (\u20ac 518.7 per day) and an average weighted length of stay (3.0 days) were calculated, which were combined to estimate the average cost per hospitalization. This calculation integrated structure costs, and therefore captured the full cost of hospitalization.

No additional cost for dose administration was considered as the vaccine can be given at the same time as the combined Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 48diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis-Hib-poliomyelitis vaccine. As no French utility data are currently available, the utility scores to calculate the quality-adjusted life years (QALY s) were taken from a survey conducted in the UK in which GPs and paediatricians rated the impact of RVGE on the a ected child's QoL [11]. The values were expressed as disutility scores in the model (disutility is the di erence between the utility score of the disease condition and perfect health). For cases for which no medical care was sought, to be conservative the disutility was taken as half the value assigned to the disutility of cases for which medical care was sought. The disutility scores were multiplied by the disease duration expressed in days and transformed into a monthly time scale. Transition probabilities in the model express the likelihood of getting diarrhea over time, followed by the subsequent event of seeking medical advice. The probabilities of getting diarrhoea were age- and month- dependent to allow for the seasonality of rotavirus infection (more frequent during the winter period, following a normal distribution of the epidemic spread from November until March each year) and the increase in immune protection with age that makes the child most vulnerable between 3 and 24 months of age [12;13]. Data collected from literature indicate that rotavirus infection and the associated diarrhoea events in children under 5 years old approximately follow a Weibull distribution (shape coe cient of 1.5; scale coe cient of 24.2) as illustrated in Figure 2 [5;14;15]. The transition probabilities in the model replicated this distribution and the infl uence of seasonality as closely as possible (see Figure 2). The sum of the area under the curve for any of these transition probability distributions over the time period of 5 years was equal to 1. Finally, the transition probabilities were di erent with or without breast-feeding (breast-feeding assumed to protect against infection), and for the initial and subsequent diarrhea events (much lower transition probabilities for the second event). Other age-dependent transition probabilities in the model were the natural mortality rate, the rate of hospitalization with and without diarrhea, and the rate of contracting nosocomial rotavirus diarrhoea. The e ectiveness of RIX4414 was taken from the results of a clinical trial conducted in Europe (eTrack102247/NCT140686) [7], and is listed in Table 2. The protection rate against nosocomial infection was assumed to be the same as that against hospitalization.

The true total number of diarrhoea events caused by rotavirus is often unknown as only the cases where medical support is sought appear on o cial lists or in databases. It was therefore assumed in the model that as a base case the total number of diarrhoea events was twice the number of medical visits reported [5] . The cost perspective considered was a \"limited societal\" perspective. This included direct medical costs paid out-of-pocket or by third-party payers, as well as the proportion of direct medical costs reimbursed by the health authorities (see Table 1a). We did not include in the base case analysis the costs of lost productivity (indirect costs), as there is still controversy in France over how such costs should be accurately reported [17], especially in cost-utility analyses. This is a conservative approach, as it means that a component of societal cost is not captured in the analysis, and thus the base-case perspective is not a true societal perspective. However in the discussion section we estimated the indirect cost in the current setting using a human capital measurement approach. It was further assumed that around 15% of the parents confronted with an acute diarrhoea will go for an emergency visit directly or indirectly after a medical visit (15). For the practical design of the model, it was assumed that the cost of an emergency visit was separated from the hospitalization cost. The model therefore marginally overestimates the total cost for cases where an emergency visit results in admission, as in such cases the hospitalization cost would include the cost of the emergency visit. However, the e ect should be small and this calculation method should not a ect the cost-e ectiveness conclusions.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 50Breast feeding as the sole source of nourishment confers protection against RVGE as long as the child receives only breast feeding [18;19]. Fully breast-fed babies were assumed to have 100% protection against RVGE, and the number of fully breast- fed infants was assumed to be 50% at delivery with an exponential decrease over time (- scale coe cient = 2). In the base-case analysis, the annual discount rate was 3% for costs and 1.5% for the e ect measure. However, alternative rates were used in the sensitivity analysis as currently recommended in France [17]. A vaccine coverage rate of 85% was used in the base-case. This value was subjected to sensitivity analysis using a coverage range that is normally observed with paediatric vaccines in France. For all non-rotavirus related hospitalizations, an age-speci c nosocomial rotavirus-induced diarrhoea rate was included in the model, varying from 3% to a maximum of 5% per age group and limited to events during the winter period only (maximum 6 months per year). A recent literature review reported the rate of nosocomial rotavirus infection ranging from 2.9% to as high as 19.4% of total admissions, with most results in the 2.9-6.6% range [20]. The transition probability for mortality after rotavirus hospitalization was <0.0005 risk of death per rotavirus hospitalization [5]. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure reported was the incremental cost of vaccination (IC) per incremental quality-adjusted life year (IC/QALY). We selected a threshold of less than or equal to \u20ac 50,000 per incremental QALY for cost-e ectiveness [21]. Some alternative incremental cost-e ectiveness measures are also reported, such as the incremental cost per case averted, per hospitalization averted, and per death avoided. SENSITIVITY ANAL YSIS Due to the lack of unequivocal reference values, many variables in the model were subjected to sensitivity analyses. These are shown in Table 3 with the minimum and maximum estimate for each. Probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses were also reported for several variables (Table 3). This analysis indicates the range over which variables may fl uctuate and the probability that vaccination remains cost-e ective. COMPARISON WITH THE 'MELLIEZ ET AL.' MODEL When comparing our results with the data obtained from Melliez et al. [8], we listed the variables and values that could be identi ed as di erent in the two analyses, and then applied distribution variables with uniform distribution ranges of minimum and maximum values (see Table 4) to our model. We then conducted a separate probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis to assess which of the variables had the highest impact on the IC/QALY using multiple regression Chapter 2 51T able 3 Variables tested in sensitivity analyses Variables Base Line Minimum Maximum Distribution T ype 1st line cost* 25.00 \u20ac 1st year 75% 95% uniform Hospitalization reduction 100% 80% for other reason than rotavirus-diarrhea0.01% 0.825 normal (0.69; 0.069) Probability emergency visit visit with severe diarrhea\u00b00.514 0.128 0.265 0.27 1 truncated normal (0.781; 0.263) mo\u00b0 truncated normal (0.688; (0.200; Breast feeding from decrease from 50%exponential decrease from 60%exponential (?-scale coe cient = 2) * year 2005 costing values; ** rst value the mean; second value standard deviation; truncated = maximum value of 1; minimum value of 0) \u00b0 month; minimum and maximum values are the 95% Con dence Intervals T able 4 Values & variables selected for the comparison between the Base Case Model with Melliez et al Model in a probabilistic sensitivity analysis Variable Minimum Maximum Distribution T ype Vaccine Price 57 \u20ac 75 \u20ac Uniform Duration diarrhoea mild 4 days 5.4 days Uniform Vaccine E cacy (rotavirus-diarrhoea reduction 1sty) 70% -0.156 -0.116 Uniform Cost Hospitalization 1 240 \u20ac 1 556 \u20ac Uniform Duration Severe Diarrhoea + 1.1 days +3 days Uniform Duration Hospitalisation visit + 1.1 days +3 days Uniform Duration Emergency visit 0 + 1 day Uniform Disutility Severe Diarrhoea in Infants -0.186 -0.575 Uniform Duration GP visit 0 + 1 day Uniform Disutility Emergency Visit in Infants 0 -0.575 Uniform Disutility Hospitalisation Visit in Infants 0 -0.8 Uniform Disutility Hospitalisation Visit in Children 0 -0.575 Uniform Disutility Emergency Visit in Children 0 -0.575 UniformExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 52analysis. The output of that analysis is normalized beta-regression coe cients. It allowed us to de ne a systematic process for moving step by step from our base case model to the Melliez et al. model by adjustment of the variables in the model. Because Melliez et al. used a di erent time scale to evaluate the rotavirus problem (3 years instead of 5 years), we adjusted the Weibull distribution to the relevant time scale. ST ATISTICAL ANAL YSIS The cost-e ectiveness model was run in cohort mode rst. This is the conventional approach that directly delivers cost-e ectiveness measures such as the incremental cost per QALY per subject. To create the acceptability curve, the cohort mode was run in a 2nd order Monte Carlo simulation program with the distribution curves for the variables mentioned in Table 3 & 4. The number of iterations was 1,000 runs. The statistical analysis plan was identical when running in either manner, but the end-results could di er slightly because of the Monte Carlo iteration process. RESUL TS Number and cost of rotavirus infections and events Table 5 shows the numbers of rotavirus-related events predicted by the model for a birth cohort of 750,000 with and without vaccination, together with the numbers of events derived from literature [5] as well as from our model construction. Table 5 also presents the predicted reduction in RVGE-related diarrhoea events, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths associated with the implementation of a generalized vaccination strategy with RIX4414 in France with 85% coverage rate. Without vaccination the estimated total direct medical cost of rotavirus disease management in France was around \u20ac 41 million per year, mainly related to hospitalization costs (see Table 6).

The maximally estimated, discounted QALY gain per subject in the vaccinated group reached 0.001181 over a lifetime, and the incremental cost/QALY was \u20ac 44,583. The incremental cost for other e ect measures was as follows: \u20ac 212 per RVGE- and \u20ac 5,435,097 per death prevented. Sensitivity analysesSensitivity analyses Figure 3 shows the univariate sensitivity analyses for each minimum and maximum value of the variables tested (Table 3). Four groups of variables had a large impact on the end result: the probabilities of moving from diarrhoea to severe diarrhoea, of seeking medical advice, and of going to an emergency clinic; the utility scores for diarrhoea events in children and infants; the rate of non- RV-related hospitalizations; the discount rate applied to the e ect measure; and nally the hospitalization cost. Other univariate sensitivity analyses indicated little to no change in the end-result (Figure 3). The multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in an acceptability curve showing the proportion of results meeting the threshold value as a function of the value set for the threshold (Figure 4 A & B). A total of 94% of the analysis results were under the threshold of \u20ac 50,000/QALY. However, the density graph shows a skewed distribution with a tail to the right (Figure 4 B). Analyzing which of the variables may have the largest impact in a combined analysis, indicates again that the probabilities of events and the utility score selection have the biggest impact on the IC/QALY (see Figure 5). Comparison with the Melliez et al. resultsComparison with the Melliez et al. results Table 8 presents the di erences between the analysis presented here and the analysis published by Melliez et al. [8]. The beta coe cients from the multiple regression analysis are shown in Figure 6. The vaccine price had the highest impact on the ICER results, followed by changes in the duration of diarrhoea, vaccine e cacy, the discount rate applied to the e ect measure and the rate of nosocomial infection. Figure 7 and Table 9 show the impact on the ICER of changing the variables in the model in a stepwise fashion, in order of the importance of each variable. Starting from the base case of the present model in a 5 year timescale, Figure 3 Univariate sensitivity 55each variable was changed to its corresponding value in the Melliez et al. model and the resulting ICER calculated. By the time all the values had been set to those used by Melliez, the ICER reported by our model was \u20ac147,192/QALY. Similarly, starting from a 3-year timescale with all the values set to those used by Melliez, each variable was changed to the value used in the base case of the present model Figure 4a Acceptability curve by function of the threshold value of 50,000\u20ac per QALY 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Accumulated Probability IC/QALY(x 1000 \u20ac)1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 024.8 94.0% First line: 50% probability Second line: threshold Figure 4b Acceptability curve expressed as a density curve by function of the threshold value of 50,000\u20ac per QALY 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80Probability Density (x 10*-5) IC/QALY(x 1000 \u20ac)7.0 58,04 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 095% First line: 50% probability Second line: thresholdFigure 5 Standardized coe cients of input variables on the output variable (ICER) using multiple regression analysis (probabilistic multivariate the ICER calculated. When all the variables had been set to the values used in the present model, the ICER reported by the 3-year model was \u20ac38,366/QALY (Table 8).

A similar e ect is seen when working in the opposite direction. Starting from our base case and moving progressively towards the values used in the Melliez analysis, the nal ICER of \u20ac147,192/QALY was less favourable than the result reported by Melliez et al. [8]. The price and e ect di erences were smaller when starting with the 3-year timescale and the Melliez values, because of the shorter evaluation period and the lower vaccine coverage rate of 75%. DISCUSSION This paper presents the results of a probabilistic model estimating the burden of rotavirus disease and the potential cost-e ectiveness of generalized vaccination of infants with RIX4414 in France, compared with the current policy of no rotavirus vaccination. Our model builds on a model previously published by Melliez et al. in 2005 [5]. We have further developed the robust structure of this original model to take account of features of the combined age-adjusted and seasonal variation in rotavirus infection rates. Current epidemiological data on rotavirus disease in France have been used to calibrate the model. Cost gures used come from the limited societal perspective and the utility scores were obtained from research with UK health professionals [11]. The results of the present model indicate that implementing a generalized vaccination strategy with RIX4414 in France would be cost-e ective at the indicated public price of \u20ac 57 per vaccine dose, with an incremental cost per QALY of \u20ac 44 583/QALY (Table 7). The probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analysis shows a more favorable ICER result than the base- line analysis because some of the cost ranges selected such as the cost for 1st Line visit, and emergency visit could only be estimated to a higher end range which will of course positively infl uence the end result. Meanwhile the importance of this type of sensitivity analysis is mainly to indicate how heavily some of the basic model assumptions on transition probabilities and on utility scores impact the ICER as can be seen from Figures 3 and 5. Melliez et al. have recently published an estimate of the cost-utility of rotavirus vaccination in France [8]. At rst sight, their results appear to produce a less favourable estimate of the cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus vaccination than our results, with a base-case cost-e ectiveness ratio for vaccination of \u20ac 138,000 per QALY gained [8]. However, detailed comparison of the models suggests that the di erent results are explained by di erences in model structure and data input values between the two studies. The main di erences we have identi ed are summarized in Table 8. Table 9 and Figure 6 show the impact of each of these di erences on the model results. It can be seen that applying the opposite set of input parameters to each model can reverse the results; indeed, when our model was run with all the input variables set to the values used by Melliez, it produced a cost-e ectiveness ratio that was even less favourable to vaccination than Melliez' own result [8]. Clearly, the values used for the input parameters are crucial in determining the model outputs.Chapter 2 59T able 7 Cost-e C/RVGE case avoided No Vaccine 958 \u20ac 299 78/uni00A0634 989 829 -186 128 Cost Incr.

Discount Visit; mo.: months The parameters with the greatest impact on the result, as assessed by the multivariate regression analysis, were the vaccine price, duration of diarrhoea, vaccine e cacy, discount rate applied to health bene ts, prevalence of nosocomial infection, and the disutility score for rotavirus diarrhoea (Figure 5). Two of these parameters, vaccine price and vaccine e cacy, refl ect the fact that in the present paper we investigated a speci c rotavirus vaccine, RIX4414, whereas Melliez et al. [8] investigated rotavirus vaccination in general using pooled cost and e cacy Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 60data for two di erent products. Pooling data from di erent products to arrive at a single input value raises important questions of validity, as the products may di er in e ectiveness or cost or both. As the pooled e cacy value used by Melliez et al. was lower than the RIX4414 e cacy, and the average cost was higher than the RIX4414 price, the cost-e ectiveness ratio estimated by Melliez et al. for the pooled products would be expected to be less favourable than the RIX4414 cost- e ectiveness ratio estimated in the present paper. Melliez et al. used a higher discount rate for health bene ts (3%) than our model. Higher discount rates reduce the value of bene ts obtained in the future, and preventive strategies such as vaccination incur immediate expenditure (cost of vaccination) in order to produce future bene ts (prevention of infections). Thus, the 3% discount rate used by Melliez et al. would automatically produce a less favourable estimate of the cost-e ectiveness of vaccination than the 1.5% rate used in the present model. The optimum discount rate for health e ects is still a subject of debate [22-24]. Discounting makes current costs and bene ts worth more than those occurring in the future, because there is an opportunity cost associated with receiving money in the future rather than now (money received now can be invested for future gains), and people generally desire to enjoy bene ts now rather than in the future. The main argument against discounting health bene ts is that health cannot be invested to produce future gains [25]. Many other arguments have been published, and some authors recommend that health bene ts should not be discounted [26], while other advice suggests future health bene ts should be discounted but at a very low rate of 1.5%-2% [27]. The most conservative approach is to discount bene ts at the same rate as costs, but T able 9 Sensitivity analysis on the Melliez data in the present model (incremental cost/QALY) 5-year model, moving from present base-case values to Melliez values3-year model, moving from Melliez values to present base-case values Variables Value ICER Value ICER Base Case Melliez Base Case Start 44,583 62,559 +1.1 days + cacy Chapter 2 61this tends to discriminate against preventive treatment strategies whose bene ts accrue mainly in the future. In the absence of consensus, we felt that a discount rate of 1.5% for bene ts refl ected a reasonable compromise. Melliez et al. used higher utility scores for RVGE than our model, which would produce a lower estimate of the number of QALY s gained by vaccination. The utility values used in our model are derived from a study in which health professionals rated QoL for children with di erent severities of RVGE using a recognized instrument (the Euro-QoL questionnaire). The values used by Melliez et al. were derived from ratings provided by adult caregivers and the source publication did not di erentiate between di erent severities of illness. In both cases, the utility values used were extracted from non-French studies due to the lack of published utility scores for rotavirus gastroenteritis in France. We may question whether selecting physicians is a good alternative for estimating QALY-scores in diseased children instead of parents. It has been reported that medical care-givers overestimate the patient burden but on the other hand they may be best placed to evaluate the total disease impact being confronted on a regular basis with speci c health and health care problems [28]. Melliez et al. included only RVGE cases in children <3 years of age, whereas our model covers the larger at-risk population of children <5 years of age. This di erence will a ect the estimate of the total number of cases of RVGE expected to occur in the population in the absence of vaccination. The number of RVGE cases in children aged <5 years in France was estimated at 300,000 per year by Melliez et al. in an earlier publication [5], and we have applied this estimate in the present study. In their recent model, however, Melliez et al. estimated the number of RVGE cases in children aged <3 years at 182,000 per year [8]. This is di cult to reconcile with the earlier estimate. It is approximately 60% of the earlier estimate for the number of cases in children aged <5 years, which would be plausible if the incidence of RVGE remains stable as a function of age. However, the incidence of RVGE approximately follows a Weibull distribution (Figure 2), and so the number of cases expected in children aged <3 years would be nearer to 90% of the number of cases expected in children aged <5 years. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy between the recent Melliez publication and the earlier paper are not clear, and may indicate an underestimate of RVGE cases in the recent model for the age group up to 3 years. The fact that two modeling studies evaluating similar vaccination strategies in the same country can produce results that at rst sight appear to be contradictory illustrates the di culties faced in conducting health economic evaluations. A more standardized approach to constructing and populating health economic models would help to make results more easily comparable between di erent studies [29]. This would help to reduce the confusion caused by publication of apparently confl icting results, which in turn would help to support a rational assessment of the economic value of potential new therapies. The present analysis may not have captured some potentially important bene ts of rotavirus vaccination. For example, peaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis that result in Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 62medical consultations and hospitalization occur during the same period as other commonly occurring childhood diseases that also result in emergency visits, such as infl uenza and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis [30-32]. It is therefore possible that a reduction in rotavirus-associated emergency consultations and admissions due to vaccination could reduce seasonal pressure on overburdened pediatric emergency wards and physicians' o ces, with consequent improvements to patient care. The model also takes no account of any health bene t obtained from herd protection e ects in scenarios when vaccine coverage is <100%. When a parent takes time o work to care for a child with RVGE, the value of the parent's work is lost. These indirect costs were not included in the base-case analysis as there is still a debate in France about the exact method to apply for estimating such costs [17]. However, the model can estimate the number of days of paid work lost due to caring for a child with rotavirus gastroenteritis after the o cial period of maternity leave (conservatively assumed here to be one year) at 538 303 days per year, based on the proportion of women who are in full-time paid employment (49% in France [33]). In the developed world with a high proportion of working adults, reduction of indirect costs is likely to be an important bene t associated with vaccination against paediatric infections [34]. Our results are conservative compared with some other published studies. For example, Huet et al. [35] reported total direct costs for the burden of rotavirus infection in France of \u20ac 63 million to the National Healthcare Payer, compared with \u20ac 41 million in this analysis. Huet et al. reported a higher hospitalization rate, consistent with data from the REVEAL study [34-36], whereas our approach conservatively assumes the hospitalization rate considered by Melliez in 2005 [5]. There are no clear guidelines in France on valuing hospital costs. The method used (based on the national hospital costs database) is conservatively the same than the one used by Melliez. The approach is likely to underestimate the true hospitalization costs as DRG costs in France are no full hospital costs. Finally, the utility values applied in the model estimated the QoL impact of rotavirus gastroenteritis only for the a ected child [11], and thus did not capture the QoL impact on other family members. Parents and carers may be adversely a ected by the child's illness, resulting in anxiety, stress, and feelings of exhaustion, as others have suggested [37]. Recent cost-e ectiveness analyses of the new rotavirus vaccines have been reported in addition to France, for the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and the US [38-41]. The results indicate how di cult it is to pool data of two vaccines seemingly equivalent into one economic analysis. In addition the selected cost perspective and the underlying disease epidemiology will highly a ect the end result of cost-e ectiveness evaluation by country. But all the analyses su er from underreporting the disease when not seeking medical advice, unable to de ne how rotavirus infection a ects family functioning, and the imprecise evaluation of the individual patient burden. Meanwhile one interesting study recently highlighted about the estimation of nancial rotavirus disease burden in Chapter 2 634 countries in the EU. It appears that in open health care systems such as France and Belgium where there is no limit to consult directly 1st or 2nd line health care levels, the estimated direct medical cost of rotavirus diarrhea is higher compared to the more closed systems in the UK and the Netherlands. However the total estimated societal disease burden including direct and indirect costs per child per year for the 4 countries is more or less the same (23.11 \u20ac) [42]. It should therefore be recommended that economic assessment of the vaccine should encompass the total disease burden and not the health care impact only. In conclusion, the present analysis indicates that universal vaccination of infants against rotavirus infection could be cost e ective in France from a limited societal perspective and based on the assumptions introduced in the model regarding disease development and utility scores selected (94% of modelling scenarios generated an incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio < \u20ac 50,000/QALY).

There are some statistics about the disease burden collected by care-givers amongst children <5 years of age, but many researchers are hesitant to assess the economic value of the new vaccine. I developed a type of back-of-the envelop calculation method for rotavirus vaccine and made the comparison with the more complex cohort model for Turkey. The rst model required only 20 variables and one spread sheet in MS Excel\u00ae. The second model has more than 120 variables and has 26 spread sheets in MS Excel\u00ae. With the rst model called Roxannette decision makers were able to assess with a number of key variables in which direction the economic value of the vaccine should move, given the price they had foreseen in their budget. It is a helpful tool for a rst estimate that may drive as well the research program for collecting additional data missing for running the more advanced model [22]. ESTIMATING AND COMPARING THE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PAEDIATRIC ROTAVIRUS VACCINATION IN TURKEY USING A SIMPLE VERSUS AN ADVANCED MODEL Vaccine, 2013, 31: 979-986 ABSTRACT BackgroundBackground : The burden of rotavirus disease is high in Turkey, refl ecting the large birth cohort (>1.2 million) and the risk of disease. Modelling can help to assess the potential economic impact of vaccination. We compared the output of an advanced model with a simple model requiring fewer data inputs. If the results are similar, this could be helpful for countries that have few data available. Methods : The advanced model was a previously published static Markov cohort model comparing costs and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) outcomes of vaccination versus no vaccination. In contrast, the simple model used only a decision tree. Both models included data on demography, epidemiology, vaccine e cacy, resource use, unit costs, and utility scores from national databases and published papers. Only the perspective of the health care payer was considered in the analysis. The simple model had 23 variables, compared with 103 in the advanced model to allow additional comparisons of di erent vaccine types, dose schemes and vaccine waning. Results : With the same input data, both models showed that rotavirus vaccination in Turkey would improve health outcomes (fewer QALY s lost to rotavirus Belgium. cKanuni Sultan Suleyman T raining and Research Hospital, Istanbul, T urkey. dGlaxoSmithKline, T urkey, Istanbul, T urkey. eDepartment of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.Chapter 2 67The projected annual cost o sets were $29.9 million in the simple and $29.4 million in the advanced model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that in both models the main cost driver was disease incidence followed by cost for hospital care and medical visits. V accine e cacy had a smaller e ect. Conclusions: Both models reached similar conclusions. Both projected that rotavirus vaccination in Turkey would improve health outcomes and may result in savings in direct healthcare costs to o set the cost of vaccination. The analysis indicated that the simple model can produce meaningful economic results in conditions where few data are available. Keywords: rotavirus; vaccination; economic evaluation; model; Turkey; a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children worldwide, with an estimated 453,000 deaths annually in children aged <5 years, mainly in the developing world [1]. Almost every child will be infected with rotavirus before 5 years of age, with peak incidence at age 6-24 months [2;3]. Countries such as Turkey with a large annual birth cohort (>1.2 million) could experience a high rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) burden, with consequences for health outcomes (mortality and morbidity), healthcare spending (medical visits and hospitalisations), and impaired quality of life (e.g. stress for parents) [3-8]. In the absence of detailed information on rotavirus disease in a country, models are helpful tools to explore the potential impact of new interventions such as vaccination [9]. Many models of rotavirus disease and the projected impact of vaccination have been reported, from simple to advanced [10-13]. Advanced models may include speci c aspects of the clinical impact and cost of rotavirus disease over time and various potential vaccine e ects, and can compare di erent vaccine types or estimate indirect vaccine e ects. Decision-makers need to choose an appropriate model for economic assessment of interventions in their country [14]. Model selection depends on three issues: the economic question to be answered; the data available to answer that question; and the audience to whom it is addressed. Simple questions should be answered by simple models that are straightforward to understand and accessible by a range of users. Advanced models can answer more complex questions, but require more data, more assumptions, and more skills to construct, understand and interpret the results. However, an advanced model should also be able to answer simple questions, and its results should not di er greatly from those of the simple model. In the present paper, we have tested this hypothesis by comparing the results of a simple and an advanced model for estimating cost o sets and gain in quality- adjusted life-years (QALY) for rotavirus vaccination versus no vaccination. We selected Turkey for this study. It is a good example of a country with basic epidemiological data on ambulatory care and hospitalisation that needs to make decisions on healthcare investment. A complete economic assessment, addressing Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 68questions about optimal vaccine type, dose regimen and schedule, and the likely size of the vaccine e ect over time, will require an advanced model. However, a simple model can evaluate the economic impact of rotavirus vaccination in the rst instance. If a simple model is shown to produce results similar to those of an advanced model, this should help to raise con dence that meaningful assessments can be performed in countries with few data available. MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed two models, an advanced model and a simple model deduced from it [13;15;16]. The simple model was designed to address three economic questions: the cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in infants versus no vaccination; one- way sensitivity analysis to identify the main results drivers; and the budget impact of introducing vaccination. The advanced model can also perform probabilistic sensitivity analysis and address more complex questions, such as the e ect of a two- versus three-dose vaccine, di erent dosing schedules (e.g. 2-3 month dosing versus 3-5 month dosing), waning of vaccine e ect over time and indirect protection. Because the objective of the present study was to compare the two model types, we present only results for outcomes common to both. The advanced model has been described elsewhere [13]. Its main features are summarised here. MODEL STRUCTURE AND DESIGN Advanced This static, deterministic, Markov cohort model compared the costs and QALY outcomes of vaccination versus no vaccination of a birth cohort of 1,257,583 infants followed for 5 years in Turkey. The initial model was developed by Melliez and colleagues [17]. We adapted it to address more complex questions, such as dose scheduling, vaccine waning and seasonality [13]. It can include 103 di erent variables and is presented in 25 Microsoft Excel\u00ae worksheets. SimpleSimple The simple model was a static, deterministic, decision-tree model comparing the costs and QALY outcomes of vaccination versus no vaccination of 5 one- year age groups (0-1 year; children per age-group assessed together over a period of one year [18]. Four health states were included: mild (seeking no medical advice), moderate (visiting a general practitioner [GP] at least) or severe (hospitalised) disease, or rotavirus- related death. It has a maximum of 23 di erent variables and is presented on a single worksheet (A copy of the simple model is provided as a Microsoft Excel\u00ae worksheet in Supplementary Material 1). As well as the smaller number of variables in the simple model, the models di ered in construction. In the simple model, a population up to age 5 years was modelled over one year, whereas in the advanced model a birth cohort aged with time in cycles of 1 month over 5 years. The advanced model allowed more precision about the timing of events. This increased detail allowed the advanced model to identify more clearly the time and age at which projected vaccine bene ts occur, which could have consequences for dose scheduling.Chapter 2 69DAT A INPUT Demographic dataDemographic data Both models required the annual number of births or the total birth cohort and birth rate, and average life expectancy at birth, estimated for Turkey at 73.3 years [19]. Epidemiological dataEpidemiological data Advanced Since the distribution of RVGE cases is age-dependent, the disease age distribution simulated in the model followed a Weibull distribution (parametric characteristics alpha=1.5, beta=24.2) over 60 months. Data on medical visits were proportional to that distribution and have the same basic curve shape. However, hospitalisations may have an earlier age distribution than the baseline curve, so age-speci c hospitalisation rates for RVGE were included (Table 1). Non-age-dependent epidemiological variables included the probability of seeking medical advice (probability of a GP visit or a direct emergency room visit, probability of emergency room referral after a GP visit), and the probability of dying after hospitalisation for RVGE (Table 1). Simple The simple model did not use any prespeci ed parametric distribution for age- dependent variables. It estimated age-speci c data using a xed multiplication value for age-speci c probabilities for each health state. The initial probability in the rst age-group (0-1 year) de ned the total number of cases in each health state and probabilities in the subsequent age-groups. The simple model did not account for breastfeeding or distinguish between nosocomial and community-acquired RVGE (both included in severe cases), and included no non-age-dependent epidemiological variables. Utility data Utility scores were obtained from a published study [20]. In both models, utility scores were adjusted to the appropriate time period (months for the advanced model, annual for the simple model) combined with the event duration and expressed as disutility scores: disutility score = (utility score-1)*d/unit time (d: days) (Table 1). As disutilities involve otherwise healthy children, assuming a baseline utility value of 1 seems reasonable. Resource use and cost Direct medical costs were estimated in each model by multiplying the number of resource units by the unit cost. V accine costs were not included in this comparison, because vaccine cost does not di er between the model types and therefore cannot help to explain any di erences in model outputs. Rotavirus vaccination was assumed to be administered as part of existing primary vaccination schedules. Table 1 summarises the data used for direct medical costs in Turkey [21;22]. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 70Vaccine e ect Advanced The model incorporated both direct and indirect vaccine e ects, with indirect e ects considered only in sensitivity analysis. The advanced model required the following vaccine e cacy data [23;24]: Dose schedule and coverage per dose. V accine e cacy per dose for mild, moderate, and severe disease assessed over time (Table 2). V accine e cacy for mild disease is an estimate, as no precise data are yet available.T able 1 Input data for variables in the model Parameter Advanced Simple Starting value aStarting value Age-dependent Probability of ~ 0.087 b0.10 Non-age-dependent Probability of seeking medical advice 1 Probability of rst-line (GP) visit 0.179 Probability of second-line visit 0.821 Probability dying RVGE Disutility scores [20] d -225 d Direct medical cost Cost Assumptions Cost GP consultation $ 20 17% go to GP rst $ 20 Emergency room visit $ 35 83% go to emergency rst $ 35 Hospitalisation RVGE $ 400 26% pass through emergency $ 400 Vaccine dose coverage and completion 1st dose 2 months 95% 95% 2nd dose 3 months 100% a Starting values are country-speci c and part of the calibration process b Approximate because the values are age-related c Probability values di er because the advanced model has a time frame in months and the simple model has a time frame in years, and because of the way probabilities are handled in each model. In the advanced model, probabilities over a 60-month period (5 years) follow a Weibull distribution, infl uenced in the rst six months by breastfeeding, and sum to a cumulative probability of 1 over the period. In the simple model, the starting value is derived from the total number of cases up to the age of 5 years and the proportion of these cases that occur in the rst age group (0-1 year). d Discounted at 5% per year. The disutility scores di er between the advanced and simple model because the way the discount rate is included di ers between the two models.

It did not include indirect e ects. Model assumptions Table 3 shows the key assumptions in both models, the rationale for each assumption and its impact. Outcomes were discounted at 5% and costs at 0% in the simple model and the advanced model base case. DAT A OUTPUT Although the advanced model had many more outputs than the simple one, we report here only the outputs common to both: Rotavirus diarrhoea events within a birth cohort aged 5 all events; seeking medical advice; hospitalisations; Rotavirus-speci c deaths; Total direct costs excluding vaccine costs (Cost o set = total rotavirus-related direct cost without vaccination minus total rotavirus-related direct cost with vaccination); Total QALY loss. Both models considered the payer-only perspective (Ministry of Health). No cost- e ectiveness result was reported as the analysis did not include vaccine cost.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 72SENSITIVITY ANAL YSES One-way sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the model results related to the underlying parametric assumptions (see Supplementary Material 2 for parameters and ranges). Sensitivity analyses used realistic ranges for each of the base-case parameters, derived from published sources wherever possible. Results are presented as tornado diagrams for cost results only. ST ATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Five datasets on RVGE in children aged 5 years should be collected at country level: diarrhoea events; rst- and second-line visits; hospitalisations; and deaths. The advanced model calibrated the data against observations. The latter follow a Weibull distribution showing more cases at earlier ages before children reach 2 years old. This is important, as most RVGE cases occur before the age of 2 years and failure to adjust may produce less accurate results. The process of calibration in the model was an automated, iterative program in Visual Basic that brought the modelled values close to the observed values (di erence of <0.001%). As the simple model made fewer adjustments for factors such as breastfeeding, herd e ect, dose adjustment, vaccine e ect, cost discount, etc., the initial comparison was T able 3 Assumptions used in construction of base case for each model Assumption Rationale Impact Adv.: Breastfeeding protects children against rotavirus infection Sim.: No breastfeedingAdv.: Maternal antibodies are protective against rotavirus infection Sim.: No evidence available for protection by breastfeedingprotection by breastfeedingHigh proportion of breastfeeding during the rst 3 months a/ft er birth improves cost-e ectiveness Adv.: Parametric shape of the curve of RVGE events as a function of age (Weibull distribution) Sim.: Linear decrease as a function of ageageThe disease burden is higher in young infantsEqual spread of the disease over time may result in worse cost-e ectiveness because of discounting Adv.: Herd e ect is essentially seen in very young infants (<3 months old) Sim.: No herd e ectAdv.: Data from the impact study in Belgium shows that e ect Sim.: Di cult to integrateSim.: Di cult to integrateAdding a xed herd e ect improves the cost-e ectiveness Adv.: Vaccine e cacy a/ft er exponentially Sim.: No speci c dose adjustmentAdv.: Not enough data to know what happens in real life Sim.: No precise data availableExponential decrease in vaccine e cacy a/ft er one dose justi es the administration of a second dose being cost-e ective Adv.: Cohort modelling is appropriate for demonstrating the vaccine e ect over time Sim.: 1-year cross-sectional up to the age of 5 yearsage of 5 yearsAdv.: As long as there is no demographic change in the population one can opt for a cohort approach Sim.: Simulates one yearIs a more conventional way of reporting the economic value of a new intervention over time Adv.: No good data exist on the frequency of RVGE events that do not seek medical advice.

This estimated the basic di erence in cost o set and QALY s between the models, expressed as a percentage. Additional features were then successively added to the advanced model and the percentage deviation from the initial analysis calculated. This was conducted rst by evaluating each parameter separately as a one-way sensitivity analysis, then by combining di erent elements as a multi-way sensitivity analysis. We also reported the results of the advanced model as normally used (including breastfeeding, discounting of costs and e ect and waning, but excluding herd protection). RESUL TS Table 4 summarises the estimated number of rotavirus cases, cost and cost o set and QALY s lost for vaccination compared with no vaccination projected by each model. The advanced model was adjusted to be comparable with the simple one (i.e. no cost discount, breastfeeding, herd e ect or vaccine waning). The number of QALY s gained by vaccination was slightly smaller in the advanced model than in the simple one, because the simple model only discounted the life-years gained when deaths were avoided. The cost o sets were larger in the simple than in the advanced model because of the di erence in disease age-distribution and di erences in e ect and coverage for the rst and second doses in the advanced model. Table 5 shows the e ect of introducing into the advanced model the features that di erentiate it from the simple one, adding rst breastfeeding, then cost discounting at 5%, then waning, and nally herd e ect with a 10% improvement in vaccine e cacy.

The combined analysis showed the greatest e ect (2506 QALY s gained, compared with 2409 in base-case) but it was still smaller than estimated by the simple model (2604 QALY). One reason is that the simple model assumed a greater mortality gain than the advanced model. The greatest cost o set was seen when breastfeeding was included. Breastfeeding is assumed to confer full protection against rotavirus infection, and therefore adds bene t for a limited time after vaccine administration [25]. The lowest cost o set was seen when discounting was applied to cost, but the change was modest because most cost occurs during a small time window of 2-3 years. It is reassuring that the additional features in the advanced model essentially result in more precision in the end result, rather than a radically di erent end result. Adding herd protection to the model resulted in a slight change in favour of vaccination, and discounting the cost or adding vaccine waning resulted in a larger change that was unfavourable to vaccination.

V accine e cacy had a smaller e ect, perhaps because vaccine e cacy was high and the input range limited. The advanced model also indicated the importance of cost discounting and dose compliance, but these were not major drivers (Figure 1B). DISCUSSION The results of both the simple and advanced models projected that rotavirus vaccination could produce important cost o sets in hospitalisation and medical visit costs in Turkey. This refl ects the large medical and QALY disease burden associated with rotavirus in Turkey. Reduction of this burden by vaccination may result in estimated cost o sets of up to $29.5 million per year, a decrease of 92% of the current estimated cost of rotavirus disease. The conclusion was similar using either a simple or an advanced model. This should be expected, as both models should reach the same conclusion when answering simple questions with the same data input, unless there is a problem with the model construct. The simple model produced more optimistic estimates Figure 1 T ornado diagram on key variables measuring the cost di erence in (A) the simple model and (B) the advanced model.

Prop, proportion; VE, vaccine e cacy; y, year Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 76than the advanced model in its normal con guration. This is because the simple model had a simpli ed approach to discounting and age distribution of rotavirus disease, did not adjust vaccine e cacy over time, and made no adjustments for rst and subsequent vaccine doses. As the results from both models in the current study indicated that vaccination would reduce medical costs and improve QALY s, the greater precision o ered by the advanced model has limited bene t except to indicate the potential range of cost o sets and QALY s gained. In other situations where one strategy is both more expensive and more costly than the comparator, the ability of the advanced model to adjust for factors such as breastfeeding, changes in vaccine e cacy over time and any herd protection may be important to obtain precise estimates of discounted costs, bene ts and incremental cost-e ectiveness ratios. The similarities and small di erences between the simple and advanced models in the tornado diagrams are of interest. Both models were a ected by disease incidence and cost variables more than by vaccine e cacy. The relatively small impact of changes in vaccine e cacy refl ects the characteristics of rotavirus disease. Rotavirus incidence drops dramatically after the age of 24 months, due to age-related behavioural changes and development of natural immunity after repeated infections, so after this age any change in vaccine e cacy has only a small e ect on the results. This illustrates the importance of calibrating the advanced model closely with the data to simulate precisely a disease distribution concentrated in young children (aged <24 months) [13]. Both models can include indirect costs if needed, as lost earnings are associated with time missed from work by parents caring for their children. Both models used life expectancy at birth, rather than natural mortality rates. This assumption is acceptable if the economic evaluation measures health gain only amongst children, and if no large change is expected in population demographic structure. The same approach is used when developing an age-structured dynamic model [26;27]. Recent observational studies on the impact of rotavirus vaccination in real life have indicated that the decrease in vaccine e cacy reported in clinical trials may refl ect a reduction in net e ect due to development of natural immunity over time, rather than a real decrease in vaccine e ect [28]. This supports the use of vaccine e cacy maintained over time in the simple model. Long-term studies may provide de nitive evidence on whether vaccine e cacy is indeed maintained over time. Advanced models have often been used in developed countries such as in the US, France, UK, or the Netherlands. However, attempting to make a straightforward comparison between the results of those models from those countries with the Turkish situation may highlight an issue illustrated by a recent review on the cost-e ectiveness of Rotarix vaccination. The health and economic problem caused by rotavirus di ers greatly between developed and emerging countries./uni00A0 In developed countries the healthcare cost is high, mainly driven by hospital Chapter 2 77costs, and mortality is low./uni00A0 In contrast, emerging markets such as Turkey have a lower cost problem and higher mortality. The review was therefore split into two separate papers, one covering developed countries and one covering developing countries[29]. The economic analysis and the comparison showed that in more developed countries the o sets in QALY loss are limited, due to the low mortality from rotavirus in developed countries. In emerging markets the situation is quite di erent, as rotavirus mortality is higher and the scope for QALY gains consequently larger. In contrast, the cost o set could be important in both market types. As a consequence it is likely that a new vaccine against rotavirus would be cost-e ective in emerging markets, whereas in the more developed world cost minimisation drives the economic end result. This type of analysis has limitations, and we propose the simple model presented here as an exploratory method for obtaining the best estimates possible with limited available data. It should help decision-makers to orient their choices, but the ndings will need subsequent con rmation if vaccination is introduced. It will be helpful to use both models if possible as part of a validation process. The advanced model is more sophisticated than the simple one, and if both produce similar results that should support con dence in the ndings. Conversely, large di erences in the results may indicate that an explanation should be sought. The simple model with its graphical interface should help decision-makers understand and explain rotavirus disease and the potential impact of rotavirus vaccination. To date, few studies in the literature have compared results between di erent types of models for the same disease, although it is known that data are scarce in some countries. The present analysis is therefore interesting and helpful for countries that have limited data available, as it shows that they can still perform a meaningful economic analysis of a speci c infectious disease and a speci c prevention strategy. CONCLUSIONS With a large rotavirus disease burden and high vaccine coverage the health bene ts of rotavirus vaccination can be overwhelming, producing both improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. If few data are available in a country, the simple model o ers a good rst step to estimate the potential e ects of vaccination, making best use of the data available. The simple model produces results similar to those of a more advanced model when used to answer simple economic questions. Where more data are available, we recommend using both models in parallel. The combination of two di erent modelling approaches provides useful validation for the results, and will help to improve understanding of rotavirus disease and its management using new techniques such as vaccination.

Pharmacoeconomics 2011 May;29(5):439-54.80IMPACT STUDIES The challenge when launching a new vaccine is that the evaluation period of randomized clinical trials often has a short duration for obvious reasons. With short duration I emphasize periods of maximum 2 - 3 years in which the vaccinated group is evaluated separately from the unvaccinated group. There are two particular points to make here about this approach. One is that there could be additional bene t beyond the period of observation. It is not because the e ect of the vaccine is assessed over a certain xed period that suddenly it stops once the vaccine is not studied anymore as some authorities were claiming when presenting our clinical trial results. Because one was unable to evaluate that e ect in a randomized fashion over long enough periods I tried to evaluate the assessment through modelling exercises. But that is a problem for some evaluators on how to precisely model the assumed bene t over time. Sensitivity analysis could help here as well. Another way to look at the problem is to check whether the model predictions t with reality by designing impact studies [23]. I was able to develop such a study in Belgium called the RotaBIS (Rotavirus vaccine Belgian Impact Study) study among 11 hospital centres spread all over the country. I reported results at 2, 5 and now 7 years after the introduction of the vaccine. The last evaluation allows starting the comparison of a cross-sectional analysis with a follow-up of vaccinated birth- cohorts over time. Interestingly by doing this comparison I observed a di erence in the source of infection over time, from children in baseline at a very young age to parents or other care-givers over a maintained long period of observation (Standaert B et al., submitted, 2015). Another interesting point is that by doing these impact studies and analysing the data on an infectious disease with a rapid spread such as rotavirus, it is possible to measure a herd e ect very early on in the follow-up period of randomised clinical trials. Therefore any trial with duration longer than a year will be under the infl uence of indirect vaccine e ect if that infection follows an annual epidemic spread. As a consequence lower vaccine e cacies were obtained in the second year after the vaccine introduction, because of the calculation method used to assess the vaccine e cacy. The denominator is the number of rotavirus events in the control arm that is decreased due to the herd e ect [24]. One recommendation I want to make here is that health economists should be closely involved into the development and design of the epidemiologic studies that evaluate the bene t of vaccines over short and long term periods. They are the ones most interested in understanding and evaluating the indirect bene t that vaccines create. That particular bene t often helps bringing the vaccine over the hurdle of becoming cost-e ective./three.lfChapter 3 81REDUCTION IN PAEDIATRIC 2011, 30: e120-e125 ABSTRACT BackgroundBackground : This study investigated the impact of pediatric vaccination against rotavirus on the number of rotavirus-related hospitalizations of children in Belgium. Methods : This retrospective database study was conducted at 12 pediatric hospitals in Belgium (546 pediatric beds, 30.6% of Belgian total). Children 5 years attending hospital for any reason were eligible if they had a rotavirus stool test at one of the study centers. The number of rotavirus-positive stool tests and hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were compared for study periods pre-vaccination (June 2004 - May 2006) and post-vaccination (June 2007 - May 2009). Results : The number of rotavirus-positive stool tests in children aged 5 years decreased from an average of 881 in the pre-vaccination period to 368 in the rst year post-vaccination and 199 in the second. In children aged 2-24 months the percentage reductions were 65% in the rst and second years after vaccination, respectively, compared with pre-vaccination. In children aged <2 months the reductions AGE- driven hospital admissions and hospitalization days for AGE declined by 33% and 36%, respectively, from pre-vaccination to the second year post-vaccination in children aged 2 years. Conclusions : Paediatric rotavirus vaccination in Belgium signi cantly reduced rotavirus-related hospitalizations in the rst and second years after the introduction of the vaccine. INTRODUCTION Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children worldwide,[1] and is associated with more severe symptoms and more hospital admissions than gastroenteritis due to other causes.[2] It is estimated to cause over 146,000 hospital admissions per year in children aged <5 years in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region,[3] and over 87,000 per year in the European Union countries.[4] In Belgium, the average number of hospital admissions due to rotavirus gastroenteritis in children aged <5 years was 6,790 per year between 2000 and 2005, and 12-21% of hospital days among children aged <2 years were associated with rotavirus.[5] In children aged <7 years, the incidence of hospitalization due to rotavirus has been estimated at 676 per 100,000 children b Life Sciences Industry Consulting, Deloi/tt e, Diegem, Belgium. c Paediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Epidemiology and Infection Control Unit, Universit\u00e9-Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. d Centre e GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Wavre, Belgium.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 82in Belgium (5,600 hospitalizations annually).[6] Estimates of the annual economic burden of rotavirus disease in Belgium range from \u20ac12.5 million (53% direct medical costs),[7] to \u20ac7.7 million in direct costs and a further \u20ac12.8 million in indirect costs.[6] V accination against rotavirus is recommended in European guidelines[8;8] and by WHO.[9] Two rotavirus vaccines are currently available in Belgium, monovalent The two vaccines have been partially reimbursed (10.3 Euros/dose is charged to the patient) in Belgium since November 2006 and June 2007, respectively. Overall vaccine coverage in Belgium is estimated using sales data at approximately 85%[13] to 90%[14] in 2008-2009. The expected impact of vaccination on rotavirus hospitalizations and costs has been estimated by modeling studies in several countries.[15-18] Field data are important to demonstrate the impact of vaccination in routine practice. The aim of the present study was to assess the real-world e ect of vaccination on rotavirus-related hospitalizations in children aged 5 years, by comparing data collected before and after the introduction of generalized vaccination in Belgium. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective database study at 12 hospitals in Belgium (9 general hospitals with a pediatric ward, 3 pediatric hospitals). Four were university hospitals. The centers were distributed across the three geographic regions of Belgium (Brussels, Flanders, and Wallonia). The 12 centers had 546 pediatric beds, representing 30.6% of the total of 1793 pediatric beds in Belgium.[19] Eleven of the participating centers provided information on the laboratory assays used to detect rotavirus. Of these, one used immunofl uorescence assay and the others used rapid immune-chromatographic tests. Two centers reported a change during the study period, using the same type of test but with a product from a di erent manufacturer. In Belgium a rotavirus antigen test is reimbursed for all children aged 2 years. Data collection All children aged 5 years who had a rotavirus detection test performed at one of the participating centers from 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2006 (pre-vaccination study period) or 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2009 (post-vaccination study period) were eligible for inclusion. The following information was recorded for each sample: patient's birth date and gender; sample date; rotavirus test result; date of admission and discharge. Only hospitalized patients were included in the primary analysis. Multiple samples taken from the same patient in the same AGE episode, de ned as the same hospitalization or a time lapse of <30 days between two samples, were considered duplicates. If all samples during the episode were all positive or all negative, the rst sample was included. If some samples were positive and some negative during the episode, only the rst positive sample was included. Chapter 3 83Data analysisData analysis The pre-vaccination study period was de ned as 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2006. In analyses of the seasonal pattern of rotavirus tests, this was further divided into two study seasons, June 2004-May 2005 and June 2005-May 2006. The rst post-vaccination study season was de ned as 1 June 2007-31 May 2008, and the second post-vaccination study season was de ned as 1 June 2008-31 May 2009. The number and proportion of rotavirus-positive tests was calculated per month for each study season. Hospitalization was classed as AGE-driven if the stool sample was collected within 48 hours of hospitalization. The mean length of stay and total number of hospitalization days were calculated for hospitalized patients. Rotavirus infections were considered community-acquired if a stool sample taken within 48 hours of hospital admission was rotavirus-positive. Owing to changes in data management systems, only nine of the participating centers could provide a complete dataset for all four study seasons. Three centers had incomplete or missing data during the June 2004-May 2005 season. To avoid potential bias introduced by missing data, our main analysis included only the nine centers with complete datasets. To test whether excluding the centers with incomplete data could have infl uenced the results, we conducted a separate analysis including data from all twelve centers. Data were analyzed by age groups (<2 months, 2-24 months, and >24 months). A further sub-analysis was conducted in children aged 33 months, as this age group would have been too old for vaccination. Children aged <1 month on the date of hospital admission were excluded from the analysis of length-of-stay because the full date of birth was not collected in the rst study year and this was the only way to exclude premature babies (who tend to have longer duration of hospitalization than other age groups). We compared the absolute numbers of rotavirus-positive test results between the pre-vaccination study period and each of the two post-vaccination study seasons using the chi-square test assuming that the number of positive tests in the pre- vaccine period is the reference. The underlying assumption about the comparison of the periods pre- and post-vaccination is that the coverage area for each of the hospitals participating in the study is the same across the whole study period. Thus, the most relevant value to compare pre- and post-vaccination is the average absolute number of positive tests observed. The relative proportion of positive tests per season has less meaning if the number of tests taken per season has also decreased, because less pathology is observed overall. Hence, the denominator for comparison is not the number of tests conducted, but the number of positive tests observed in the pre-vaccination period. For data on the length of stay, we compared the di erent study periods using the Mann-Whitney U-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically signi cant. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 84A separate analysis examined the number of rotavirus-positive tests in patients born in di erent birth cohorts. Birth date information was used to categorize patients into four birth cohorts: those born before 1 September 2006 (pre-vaccination); between September 2006 and August 2007 (cohort 1, early vaccination period, 65% estimated coverage); between September 2007 and August 2008 (cohort 2, 87% estimated coverage); and between September 2008 and the end of the study in May 2009 (cohort 3, 89% estimated coverage). Sales data showed that vaccine coverage was low prior to reimbursement, and we assumed that no children were vaccinated prior to reimbursement. Ethical approval was not required because there was no medical le consultation, although ethics committee approval was obtained in four of the twelve centers. All ethics committees were informed about the study. RESUL TS The number of rotavirus-positive stool tests in hospitalized children aged 2-24 months declined from 716 per year pre-vaccination to 249 per year in the rst year after vaccination, a decrease of 65% (95% con dence interval [CI] 62%, 69%) (Table 1). The second year post-vaccination showed a further decline to 140 rotavirus- positive tests per year, a decrease of 80% (95% CI 77%, 83%) compared with the pre-vaccination period (Table 1). Children in the other age groups also showed a decrease in the number of rotavirus-positive tests post-vaccination (Table 1). T able 1 Rotavirus-positive tests pre-vaccine and post-vaccine, hospitalized patients Age group Number of rotavirus-positive tests / all tests (%) Pre-vaccination (June 2006)First post- vaccination overall number of rotavirus tests performed in hospitalized children aged 5 years fell from an average of 3161 per year in the pre-vaccination period to 2187 in the second year post-vaccination (Table 1), a decrease of approximately 1,000 (30%) in the annual number of tests. Figure 1 shows the seasonal pattern in the number of rotavirus-positive tests, with the pre-vaccination period divided into two study seasons (June 2004-May 2005 and June 2005-May 2006). The characteristic seasonal peak in rotavirus activity Chapter 3 85in the winter and early spring (January to March) was observed in both pre- vaccination seasons in children aged 5 years, and was delayed and attenuated in the two post-vaccination seasons (Figure 1). A similar pattern was observed in children aged 2 years (data not shown). Figure 2 shows the absolute numbers of rotavirus-positive tests by month in the three birth cohorts born after vaccine introduction. By the latest birth cohort (cohort 3, born after 1 September 2008), the number of rotavirus-positive tests had fallen to a very low level and the seasonal peak had almost disappeared. The maximum age of vaccinated children in the study was <33 months (born in or after September 2006, just in time to receive the vaccine after reimbursement of the rst product in November 2006, and included in the last month of the study in May 2009). Children aged 33 months would have been too old for vaccination when reimbursement became available. The number of rotavirus-positive samples in this age group was 46/293 (15.7%) in the pre-vaccination period. In the 2008-2009 season, 138 tests were performed and the number of rotavirus- positive samples was 24. The decrease from 46 to 24 rotavirus-positive tests in this unvaccinated population is consistent with a modest herd protection e ect, Figure 1 Number of rotavirus-positive tests in the two years pre-vaccination and the two years post-vaccination in children aged 5 years, hospitalized patients 0Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr MayNumber of rotavirus-positive tests Month300 250 200 150 50 0June 2004 - May 2005 June 2005 - May 2006 June 2007 - May 2008 June 2008 - May 2009 Figure 2 Number of rotavirus-positive tests in successive birth cohorts, hospitalized patients 0Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr MayNumber of rotavirus-positive tests Month50 40 30 20 10 0Post-Vaccine 1: Born between 1/9/06 and 1/9/07 Post-Vaccine 2: 1/9/07 and 1/9/08 Post-Vaccine 3: Born on/a/fter 1/9/08Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 86although the numbers are small and a larger study with routine rotavirus testing would be needed to quantify the magnitude of the e ect. The 24 positive tests in the 2008-2009 period represent 8.2% of the number of tests in the pre-vaccine period (24/293), a decrease of 7.5 percentage points. Excluding newborn babies (aged <1 month), the number of community-acquired rotavirus infections was 722 in the pre-vaccination period in children aged 5 years, decreasing to 278 in the rst year post-vaccination (61% decrease vs pre- vaccination) and 158 in the second (78% decrease vs pre-vaccination and a further 43% decrease vs rst year post-vaccination). The number of nosocomial rotavirus infections in children aged 5 years (excluding newborn babies) decreased from 140 pre-vaccination to 75 in the rst year post-vaccination (46% decrease vs pre- vaccination) and 33 in the second (76% decrease vs pre-vaccination and a further 56% decrease vs rst-year post-vaccination). The number of AGE-driven hospital admissions in children aged 2 years decreased in both the years post-vaccination compared with the pre-vaccination period (Figure 3), and the di erence was statistically signi cant for the second year post-vaccination compared with pre-vaccination (p=0.016). The number of AGE-related hospitalization days also decreased in the two years post-vaccination compared with pre-vaccination, with a decrease in the proportion of days accounted for by rotavirus-positive cases (Figure 3). Mean length of stay in AGE admissions was not statistically signi cantly di erent between the study periods (pre-vaccination 5.1 days, rst year post-vaccination 5.5 days, p=0.329, second year post-vaccination 5.1 days, p=0.192). The proportion of rotavirus-positive samples in the study periods was similar in both the 9-centre and 12-centre analyses (Table 2). The same trend for a decrease from the pre-vaccination study periods to the post-vaccination study periods was observed in each of the study centers (data not shown).Figure 3 Number of AGE-driven hospital admissions and hospitalization days in the two years pre-vaccination and the two years post-vaccination in children aged 2 years Number of hospitalisation days Number of AGE-driven 6000 4000 2000 0Chapter 3 87T able 2 Comparison of results from the main analysis of 9 centers with complete data sets and the separate analysis including 3 additional centers with incomplete data (12 centers in total) 9 centers (356 pediatric beds)12 centers (546 pediatric beds) Pre-vaccination T otal number of samples per hospital per year 351 357 Number of rotavirus-positive samples per hospital per yearhospital per year98 96 Percentage of samples year post-vaccination (2007-2008) T otal number of samples per hospital per year 278 366 Number of rotavirus-positive samples per hospital per yearhospital per year41 44 Percentage of samples year post-vaccination (2008-2009) T otal per hospital per year 243 297 Number of rotavirus-positive samples per hospital per yearhospital per year22 27 Percentage of samples rotavirus-positive 9.1% 9.2% DISCUSSION Belgium was one of the earliest countries in Europe to include rotavirus vaccination in its pediatric immunization schedule, and coverage was estimated at approximately 90% in 2008.[14] This rapid uptake and high coverage means that Belgium o ered one of the rst opportunities in Europe for a study such as the present one to investigate the real-world e ect of generalized rotavirus vaccination in routine practice at a national level. Our results show that in Belgium the number and percentage of rotavirus-positive stool tests in children aged 5 years at the study hospitals dramatically decreased in the two years after introduction of generalized rotavirus vaccination. The seasonal peak in the winter and early spring that is characteristic of rotavirus in temperate countries,[1;20] was apparent in both the pre-vaccination years and was reduced and delayed in both the post-vaccination years. This is consistent with a reduction in rotavirus transmission, as observed in the US.[21;22] The e ect was larger in successive birth cohorts, consistent with increasing vaccination uptake. The number of rotavirus-positive tests also fell in children aged 33 months, which would have been too old for vaccination when reimbursement became available. The before-and-after design is a potential limitation of our study. Our data measure trends in rotavirus disease activity before and after the introduction of vaccination, and could therefore be infl uenced by natural fl uctuations between rotavirus seasons or changes in practice. However, the sustained reduction in rotavirus-positive tests observed in our study is more likely to have been caused by the vaccine. Moreover, a similar reduction in positive tests was observed across all the participating centers. It would be interesting to compare our ndings on rotavirus-positive tests with other similar practices, such as tests obtained for respiratory viral infections, and this would be a useful analysis to conduct in a subsequent follow-up study.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 88Another potential limitation is that we collected data from a sample of Belgian pediatric hospitals and wards. However, the 12 centers in the study (546 beds) accounted for 30.6% of all pediatric beds in Belgium, and the nine centers in the main analysis (356 beds) accounted for 20%. Furthermore, the study centers were drawn from all three of Belgium's geographic regions, and included a mix of general, pediatric, regional, and university hospitals in a range of socioeconomic environments, so they should be reasonably representative of the country as a whole. Another potential limitation is that no clinical data were available because we did not access individual patient records, so severity may not be assessed. We assumed that AGE was likely to be the cause of hospital admission if a stool sample was taken within 48 hours of admission. The Belgian policy of reimbursing rotavirus tests only for children aged <2 years may alter the use of rotavirus testing in older children. The analysis including the three centers with incomplete data showed a decline in the proportion of rotavirus-positive samples that was similar to that observed in the analysis only of centers with complete data (Table 2). Thus, the conclusions reached by the study would be the same regardless of whether the centers with incomplete data were included. Our results are consistent with ndings reported from other countries, which have reported a reduction in the number of rotavirus-positive tests from laboratory surveillance or a reduction in rotavirus hospitalizations. In a small study of hospital database records in Spain, the incidence of rotavirus AGE hospitalizations decreased by 75.6% in the 2008-2009 season compared with the pre-vaccination season.[23] An early ( rst season) analysis of data in children aged 15 years collected by a sentinel network in Austria including 11 pediatric hospital wards estimated a 74% decrease in hospitalization rate due to rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine target population.[24] In our study, the number of rotavirus-positive tests in children aged 2-24 months decreased by 80% in the second year post-vaccination compared with pre-vaccination (Table 1). In Australia, a retrospective analysis of routinely collected data investigated the impact of publicly funded rotavirus vaccination introduced in Queensland in July 2007.[25] Rotavirus noti cations in children aged <2 years declined by 53% in the rst year after vaccination and by 65% in the second year, and the proportion of rotavirus-positive tests decreased by 45% and 43%, respectively, compared with pre-vaccination.[25] There was evidence for a herd protection e ect, as noti cations and the proportion of rotavirus-positive tests declined post-vaccination in older children.[25] A study in New South Wales reported substantial decreases in the seasonal increase in laboratory-con rmed rotavirus infections in children aged <15 months (young enough to be vaccinated) and in children aged 15 months to 5 years who were too old for vaccination.[26] Data from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System (NRVESS) showed a substantial reduction in the number of rotavirus-positive test results, with a shorter and later rotavirus activity peak, in the seasons after Chapter 3 89introduction of rotavirus vaccination (2007-2008 and 2008-2009) compared with the seasons before vaccine introduction (2000-2006).[22] This is consistent with our observation of an attenuated and delayed seasonal rotavirus peak after vaccination in Belgium (Figure 1). However, the US surveillance system does not allow evaluation of the impact on hospitalization. Few other countries had as high and rapid an uptake of rotavirus vaccination as experienced in Belgium. In the present study, we show that rotavirus vaccination had an impact both on the number of rotavirus-positive tests and on AGE-driven hospitalizations, with a sustained e ect over two seasons. Continued disease surveillance will be needed to assess the long-term impact of rotavirus vaccination on the disease, for example to monitor any changes in virus genotype distribution.[27] We have compared our observed results with the expected decrease in rotavirus- related hospitalizations predicted by a previously published model[17;18] developed by one of the authors (BS) and colleagues (Figure 4). The model-predicted e ects match the observed data well, although the model estimates were slightly lower than the observed e ect. This is because vaccination can reduce infections in the unvaccinated population by herd protection,[28] which a static model cannot take into account. The absolute di erence in hospitalization reduction in children aged 5 years was 3% in the rst year post-vaccination and 6% in the second.[29] The di erence was smaller in children aged 2 years, because vaccine coverage is high in this age group whereas the age group of children 5 years includes children who were too old to receive vaccination. Thus, there is more potential for a possible herd protection e ect in children aged 5 years, resulting in a larger di erence between the model and observed data. Since rotavirus infection occurs mainly in children aged <5 years, after which natural immunity typically develops, the herd protection e ect is expected to be transient during the introduction of vaccination. Figure 4 Comparison of model predictions with real-world observations 1 2 3 4 Model predicted < 5yExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 90When the whole population of children <5 years has been vaccinated, the e ect of herd protection should decline towards zero, assuming that vaccine coverage in the target population remains high. The close match between our observed ndings and model-predicted results supports the validity of our model in Belgium, and shows that modeling can be an e ective method for estimating the expected e ect of preventive interventions such as vaccination. In conclusion, this study showed that rotavirus vaccination in Belgium signi cantly reduced rotavirus-related hospitalizations in children aged 5 years in the rst and second years after the introduction of the vaccine. This supports the results of randomized controlled trials and is an example of the substantial reduction in the burden of pediatric hospitalizations that can occur shortly after rotavirus vaccine uptake in a population. Further monitoring of the number of rotavirus infections and rotavirus-related hospitalizations over subsequent years will provide valuable data on the long-term impact of rotavirus vaccination.

Rotavirus vaccination has now been available for several years in some countries, and data have been collected to evaluate the real-world impact of vaccination on rotavirus hospitalisations. This study compared the economic impact of vaccination between model estimates and observed data on disease-speci c hospitalisation reductions in a country for which both modelled and observed datasets exist (Belgium). Methods : A previously published Markov cohort model estimated the impact of rotavirus vaccination on the number of rotavirus hospitalisations in children aged <5 years in Belgium using vaccine e cacy data from clinical development trials. Data on the number of rotavirus-positive gastroenteritis hospitalisations in children aged <5 years between 1 June 2004 and 31 May 2006 (pre-vaccination study period) or 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010 (post-vaccination study period) were analysed from nine hospitals in Belgium and compared with the modelled estimates. Results : The model predicted a smaller decrease in hospitalisations over time, mainly explained by two factors. First, the observed data indicated indirect vaccine protection in children too old or too young for vaccination. This herd e ect is di cult to capture in static Markov cohort models and therefore was not included in the model. Second, the model included a 'waning' e ect, i.e. reduced vaccine e ectiveness over time. The observed data suggested this waning e ect did not occur during that period, and so the model systematically underestimated vaccine e ectiveness during the rst 4 years after vaccine implementation. Conclusions : Model predictions underestimated the direct medical economic value of rotavirus vaccination during the rst 4 years of vaccination by approximately 10% when assessing hospitalisation rates as compared with observed data in Belgium. INTRODUCTION The economic assessment of the newer rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix\u00ae [Rotarix is a registered trade mark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies] and Rotateq [Rotateq is a trademark of Merck & Co. Inc.]) at the time of their rst introduction in 2006 was largely model-based, in the absence of long-term data on vaccine e ects [1-3]. Most assessments at that time used static Markov cohort models instead of dynamic models [4], which simpli ed the model construction, the number of Baudouin Standaert1 Jorge A Gomez2Jorge Argentina of Jessa Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium 4GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, Wavre, Belgium 5Medical Research Unit on Infectious Diseases, Pediatrics Hospital, National Medical Center-Century XXI, Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico 6Unit of Pharmacoepidemiology & Pharmacoeconomics (PE2), Department of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, Groningen, The NetherlandsExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 94assumptions introduced, and the data requirements [5]. Cohort models analyse the vaccine situation at epidemiological steady-state [6] when vaccination is already well established in the population at risk, children less than 5 years old in the case of rotavirus. More recently, there has been a shift towards developing more complex models for estimating the total bene t of rotavirus vaccines because a herd e ect after vaccination has been reported from observational data [7-10]. Observational studies have shown that rotavirus infection produces partial immunity after each exposure [11;12], with complete immunity acquired after three to four infections. This partly explains the peculiar distribution of rotavirus disease as a function of age, which forms a bell-shaped curve during the rst two years of the birth cohort. A Markov cohort model can replicate the natural history of rotavirus disease in a birth cohort over time, with the highest disease burden occurring in children aged between 6 months and 2 years, followed by a sharp decline up to the age of 5 years, after which natural immunity across the cohort is maintained. The early economic models of rotavirus vaccination included much uncertainty due to the many unknowns in the data available at the time, such as the impact of rotavirus disease on quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), waning of vaccine e cacy over time (presumed from clinical trials), and the proportion of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases who do not seek medical care [13]. Such unknowns were modelled using 'best-guess' baseline assumptions, tested in sensitivity analyses to evaluate their impact on the incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio (ICER). Among these unknowns, vaccine waning is of particular interest. V accine e cacy in the cohort models was derived from clinical trial results for the rotavirus vaccines. The trials indicated higher vaccine e cacy against rotavirus diarrhoea during the rst year than in subsequent years [14]. However, it should be noted that the decrease in vaccine e cacy measured over time in the European trial was mainly due to a large reduction in rotavirus diarrhoea events reported in the non-vaccinated arm (-42%), rather than due to an increase in the numbers of events in the vaccinated arm as one would expect from vaccine waning over time. This indicated that the vaccine waning assumption in the early models should be re-examined. The two rotavirus vaccines have now been in use for several years, and real-life data are becoming available. A few follow-up studies after vaccine introduction provide information on real-life vaccine e ectiveness on speci c mortality reduction in Mexico and hospitalisation rates in Brazil, US, Australia and some European countries [15-22]. It is now possible to test whether the model-predicted results presented at the time of the product launch were accurate enough to report reliable cost-e ectiveness data. Clearly, should substantial discrepancies occur between prediction and observation, understanding the possible causes would be valuable to improve the next generation of vaccine models. Few attempts have yet been made in the published literature to compare results predicted by models at vaccine introduction with real-life data observed over time. Chapter 3 95Belgium provides a good opportunity to conduct such a comparison for rotavirus vaccination, as modelled estimates and observed data from a follow-up study of four years post-vaccination and two years pre-vaccination are available [18;23]. In a previous paper on the impact of rotavirus vaccination on hospitalisation in Belgium, we reported that the observed reductions in rotavirus hospitalisations after vaccine introduction were greater than those predicted by modelling [18]. In the present analysis, we have explored this discrepancy further using the most recent data from the observational study (up to four years post-vaccination) to identify potential reasons for the di erences, and have adjusted the modelled ICER for di erences between predicted and observed data. METHODS Model construction When rotavirus vaccination was introduced in Belgium in 2006, a Markov cohort model, mainly based on the model published by Melliez et al. [23;24], assessed at vaccine steady-state the rate of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in a birth cohort by month up to the age of 5 years. The model included di erent management options typical for the Belgian context such as staying at home, seeking medical advice from a primary care physician or a specialist, visiting the emergency room, or admission to hospital. The distribution of rotavirus AGE cases by age was constructed following a Weibull function [25]. A Weibull distribution with its shape (k = 1.5) and scale ( = 24.2) parameters allows replication of the distribution of rotavirus disease as a function of age, infl uenced by the gradual disappearance of maternal antibodies after birth and by new rotavirus infections appearing over time that stimulate the development of natural immunity. The two parameters should be adjusted for country-speci c data using calibration techniques specifying breastfeeding behaviour and the frequency of infection exposure over time. V accine e cacy data used in the model were taken from a European trial, which showed a decrease in e ect over time that di ered between mild (staying at home), moderate (seeking medical advice), and severe (hospitalised) cases [14]. For each level of disease severity, speci c costs and utility scores were applied [23]. The model compared vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts and allowed for changes in vaccine coverage. Herd protection was not included. The model estimated the vaccine e ect on the number of AGE events, medical visits, emergency visits, hospitalisations and deaths in a birth cohort of children up to the age of 5 years. It also reported the overall cost, QALY impact, and ICER for vaccination compared with no vaccination. Observational studyObservational study A vaccine impact study was set up one year after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in Belgium [18;21]. Full details and the results for the rst two years post- vaccination (up to May 2009) have been published elsewhere [18]. Data were collected retrospectively after each rotavirus season from a sample of 12 Belgian Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 96hospitals. All children aged 5 years who had a rotavirus detection test performed at a participating hospital from 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2006 (pre-vaccination study period) or 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010 (post-vaccination study period) were eligible. Only hospitalised children were included, and data were analysed for the nine centres with a complete dataset. Ethical approval was not required because there was no medical le consultation. The post-vaccination study period was divided into successive years, each running from June to May (June 2007-May 2008, June 2008-May 2009 and June 2009-May 2010) to cover the winter rotavirus season. The period between 1 June 2006 and 31 May 2007 was not included in our study, because reimbursement for rotavirus vaccination was not available for the whole of this period (partial reimbursement was introduced in Belgium in November 2006 for Rotarix\u00ae and in June 2007 for RotaTeq [18]). Thus, although June 2006-May 2007 could be considered as the rst year post-vaccination, the date of reimbursement meant that it was neither fully pre-vaccination nor fully post-vaccination. In this study we therefore analysed data from the second post-vaccination year (June 2007- May 2008) onwards. For each year the number and the proportion of rotavirus- positive episodes were calculated per week. Hospitalisation was classi ed as AGE- driven if the stool sample was collected within 48 hours of hospitalisation. The most relevant variable to compare in the pre- and post-vaccination periods is the absolute number of rotavirus-positive episodes observed, assuming no change in catchment area between the study periods for each participating hospital. Comparison between observed and modelled dataComparison between observed and modelled data From the raw observed data we rst calculated the frequency of hospitalisation per week for each of ve 1-2 years; 2-3 years; 3-4 years; 4-5 a period of one year for the pre-vaccination period and for the second (June 2007-May 2008) and fourth (June 2009-May 2010) years post-vaccination. As the data are from a small sample, it is likely that data from a larger sample would follow a smoother distribution. This is represented by adjusting the raw frequencies to smoothed parametric curves using @RISK 5.7 software (Palisade Corporation, US). The software is an add-in program in Microsoft Excel\u00ae that uses the collected data as input variables, for which it creates a distribution expressed as a probability density function from a list of around 20 continuous parameterised distributions. Since all probability distribution functions must have a unit area, the software automatically scales the probability values so that the density curve has an area of one. The method of least squares is used to minimize the Root-Mean Square Error between the curve points and the theoretical distribution function selected (RMS Error value < 0.05 or the best Chi-squared statistics noted between the observed data and selected parametric distribution). The gures obtained are referred to in this paper as smoothed curves, or adjusted observational data. Because the smoothed curves are parameterised distributions, they are easier to work with when calculating values for the areas under curves. The original modelled data were derived from a hypothetical birth cohort followed over time from birth to age 5 years, whereas the observed data were derived from Chapter 3 97multiple one-year cross-sectional observations in a population of children aged up to 5 years. To allow a transparent comparison between the two, it was necessary to transform the results from the cohort model to a population approach, which could be compared with the population data from the observational study. This transformation includes as a rst step elaborating the original single cohort model into a multiple cohort model with ve birth cohorts, sequencing the start by delaying each subsequent year. This construction allows the vaccine coverage rate and the vaccine e cacy to be varied by month, year, and age group. V accine e cacy and coverage values are shown in Table 1. The baseline age distribution for rotavirus AGE events in each cohort model followed a Weibull function as described above. The age distribution for hospitalised events used a modi ed distribution to take into account the higher hospitalisation rate in infants and young children. The parameter values used in each Weibull distribution are shown in Table 1. The net hospital age-distribution result in each cohort model was the combination of the two distributions, multiplying the density probability function of the AGE distribution by the hospitalisation distribution, leading to a combined distribution (Figure 1).

First, we assumed that the annual epidemic rotavirus spread of hospitalised disease in children aged up to 5 years followed a normal distribution. Registry data on the annual spread of rotavirus indicate that this assumption is acceptable [26]. We therefore constructed a normal distribution over a 52-week period with a standard deviation of 0.16 for a mean value of 1, by which the spread of the disease is absent over a period of 16 weeks per year. The second assumption was that the age distribution per week in the normal distribution followed the combined distribution of the age cohort, as de ned in Table 1. As a consequence, the disease spread each year appeared rst and disappeared last in infants and young children, compared with older children, refl ecting the distribution with a higher hospitalisation rate in infants and young children. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 98This approach allowed precise measurement of di erences between the impact of vaccination in the model construct and the observational data. Any di erences identi ed between the observation and the modelled results were explored to see if potential explanations could be found. Once potential explanations were identi ed, we adjusted the model input values to be equivalent to the observed data to estimate adjusted ICERs. RESUL TS Figure 2 shows the pre-vaccination curves for adjusted observed data on the number of hospitalisation events by week and age group (Figure 2A) that were similar to the modelled results from the multiple age-cohort model (Figure 2B). As expected, the pre-vaccination peak in rotavirus hospitalisations was highest in children aged <1 year. In the observed data the peak appeared at approximately the same time of the year (Week 8) in all age groups, consistent with seasonal rotavirus spread and indicating a dependency in rotavirus transmission between age groups. The two assumptions introduced into the multiple cohort model to construct a population approach appeared to hold when comparing the distribution results of the model and the observation data. Moreover, there was close agreement between the observed and modelled numbers of rotavirus hospitalisations by age group per year for the pre-vaccination scenario (Table 2). In the post-vaccination period, the observed data showed that the seasonal peak in rotavirus hospitalisations was reduced in magnitude and delayed (shifted to the right) in the second year after vaccine introduction for the rst two age groups, with further reduction and delay in the fourth year across all age groups (Figure 3A-D).

The reduction in hospitalisations post-vaccination compared with pre-vaccination observed in the age groups who were too old to be vaccinated (Table 3), indicated that the vaccine had an indirect protective e ect.

Adjusted data refer to modelled data with vaccine waning removed from the model (i.e. assuming that vaccine e cacy is the same in subsequent years as in the rst year) There is a second group of children ineligible for vaccination, those too young to receive the vaccine (aged up to 2 months). The number of observed rotavirus gastroenteritis events in this age group also declined in the years after vaccine introduction (Table 4) (Chi-square-test for trend, p <0.01). The results indicated that a herd protection e ect may also occur in children too young for vaccination, due to reduced transmission of natural rotavirus infection after vaccine introduction.

The overall herd e ect that occurred in real life was not included in the model. But the more rapid decrease in hospitalisations in the observed data, compared with the model, is also noteworthy because the model assumed a decrease in vaccine e cacy year on year (Table 1), which was not apparent in the observed data. In Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 102sensitivity analysis, the model was run with no decrease in vaccine e cacy (i.e. assuming that vaccine e cacy was the same in subsequent years as in the rst year). These data are shown in Table 3 and Figure 4 as ' Adjusted' data. They closely followed the observed data for the fourth year post-vaccination. The estimated ICER for rotavirus vaccination was based on the modelled data at the time of vaccine introduction. Our earlier results [18] indicated that the model underestimated the reduction in hospitalisation rates. Our present results show that herd e ect on the one hand, and lack of waning on the other, were the main di erences between the original static model and real-life data (Figure 3, Tables 3 and 4). Adjusting the model for these factors produced an estimated ICER slightly more favourable to rotavirus vaccination than the estimated ICER without these adjustments (Table 5). The change in the ICER was small (approximately a 10% improvement), because the major impact of change was mainly measured two years after vaccine introduction when the hospitalisation rate was already reduced. The ICER was calculated from the perspective of the healthcare system (direct medical costs only), and so did not capture some categories of cost such as lost productivity from parents taking time o work to look after a sick child. Such costs were not included because we were unable to collect data on them in a real- life setting. A further reduction in the ICER would be expected with an analysis performed from a societal perspective capturing a wider range of costs.Figure 4 Pre- and post-vaccination data by year and age group 500 400 300 200 100 fourth year post-vaccination; Adjusted, modelled results assuming no vaccine waning, included for comparison purposesChapter 3 103T able 5 Cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus observed data on rotavirus-related hospitalisations collected in routine clinical practice for four years post-vaccination in Belgium with previously modelled estimates of the e ect of vaccination in the same country. The observed reduction in hospitalisations with data from two years post-vaccination has previously been shown to exceed the reduction predicted by the static model [18]. Two di erences between the modelled and the observed data were identi ed that could explain this discrepancy. First, the observed data indicated an indirect herd e ect in infants too young (aged <2 months) and too old for vaccination when the vaccine was introduced, which was not included in the model. Second, the model assumed a waning of vaccine e cacy over time based on clinical trial data, which did not appear to be refl ected in the observed data from a real-life situation over time frames of three or four years. Regarding waning of vaccine e cacy, analysis of the vaccine e cacy results of the European trial may o er an explanation that better helps in understanding the di erence between the modelled and the observed data. V accine e cacy is normally measured as the proportion of one minus the ratio of events that appear in the study arm that received the vaccine divided by the number of events that occur during the same time interval in the non-interventional arm. When analysing the vaccine e cacy in the rst and subsequent years of the trial, researchers assume that if a dramatic decrease in events occurs in the non-interventional arm in the second year compared with the rst year, as seen in the European trial (the decrease observed in the rst versus subsequent year is > 40%), a similar decrease should also be observed in the vaccinated arm on top of the measured vaccine bene t of the rst year. Any deviation from this result is explained as a reduction in vaccine e cacy called vaccine waning. This assumption is hard to accept as the explanation. The absolute number of events in the vaccinated group during the second year amounted to about the same values as in the rst year. So, most of the decrease in vaccine e cacy in the second year in the trial was due to a sharp decrease in the number of events in the denominator, rather than to a sharp increase of the numbers in the vaccinated arm. We hypothesise that the results in the non-interventional arm could have been infl uenced by a herd e ect in the trial, because the randomisation process included 2 vaccinated children for 1 non- vaccinated child. This 2:1 randomisation may have further decreased the number of events in the non-vaccinated arm in the second year of the trial. As a result of Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 104this observed evidence - a large imbalance in the number of events observed over time in the non-vaccinated arm - the true vaccine e cacy measured in the trial may be an underestimate compared with vaccine e ectiveness observed in real life, as seen here in the impact study results. It is of interest that the decrease in the subsequent year seen in the 2:1 randomised trial (>40%) was greater than that observed in a 1:1 randomised trial of rotavirus vaccination conducted in the US, where the reduction from the rst year to the second was approximately 15% [27]. Even if we introduce a correction into the model by excluding the waning scenario (adjusted results in Table 3), the model still underestimates the total vaccine bene t, mainly because of the indirect protection in infants too young to be vaccinated (aged <2 months). This can be seen in Figure 4, where the change in number of hospitalisations between pre-vaccination and the second and fourth years post-vaccination in children aged <1 year was considerably larger in the observed data (Figure 4A) than in the modelled data (Figure 4B). The indirect vaccine e cacy seen in these very young infants is likely to remain at steady- state level. This analysis also provides indirect information about rotavirus transmission in children. Since rotavirus vaccination appeared to have an indirect protective e ect on young infants, our results suggest that children in the age range eligible for vaccination can infect younger children. If vaccination alters the natural transmission of rotavirus in the population outside the at-risk group, it is possible that an age-shift of rotavirus disease could occur, as predicted by dynamic models [7]. However, if the wild-type rotavirus still circulates in the whole population, allowing reinfection and boosting of natural immunity, age- shifts of rotavirus disease may be less likely to happen after introducing vaccination.

It is, however, likely that reported observations over longer time periods will see less important herd e ects per year than observed here as soon as the whole at-risk population (children aged <5 years) has been vaccinated. Our analysis of the observed data suggests that no reduction in vaccine e cacy (vaccine waning) occurred in real life during the rst 4 years. It is known that subjects repeatedly exposed to rotavirus gradually build up natural immunity over time. This has been well illustrated by Velazquez and colleagues [28] and others [29]. The observed age-related disease pattern (more cases in young children than in older ones) refl ects this immunity build-up, together with other factors that could a ect exposure such as behaviour changes. Therefore the e ect measured in a clinical trial is not only the vaccination e ect, but is a di erence between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (which can be called a net e ect) (Figure/uni00A0 5). As natural immunity develops over time in the non-vaccinated group, the net e ect would change over time, and that could be mistakenly interpreted as vaccine waning. Herd protection e ects could infl uence the change in net e ect as natural immunity would be larger in its absence (because exposure to the virus would be larger). The results presented in this paper indicate that the ICER estimated from the model for vaccination versus no vaccination, using vaccine e cacy results from randomised controlled trials, may have underestimated the bene t of rotavirus vaccination. Adjusting for that di erence would result in a model outcome more closely related to the observed data. The e ect is marginal from a healthcare system perspective, as the bene t is mainly seen after two years of vaccine exposure when hospitalisation rates are already low. However, it may have a larger impact on the ICER considered from a societal perspective. We conducted a simulation exercise to explore the potential e ect if the reduction in hospitalisations observed in this study were also to occur across the whole disease management area of non-hospital medical visits and indirect costs. If non-hospital medical visits and indirect costs are reduced by the same amount as observed for hospitalisations, the ICER results estimated by the model would improve by >30%. Collecting real-life data on non-hospital medical visits and indirect costs to test this prediction would be a valuable area for future research. This nding will of course be country-speci c, depending on the speci c disease management programmes in place and whether the economic assessment is conducted after reaching the steady-state level. In conclusion, it is likely that previously published economic models underestimated the total bene t of rotavirus vaccination, by not including an estimate of herd protection and by including a vaccine waning e ect that was not refl ected in real-life conditions during the rst 4 years of vaccine introduction. These ndings could be applicable in other disease areas in which natural immunity develops over time as a result of regular exposure to the infectious agent, although this is not often observed. Static cohort models have major di culties in capturing such e ects and may therefore underestimate the total bene t of vaccines when introduced in children.

Submi/tt ed to BMC Health Services Research, 20 March 2015 ABSTRACT BackgroundBackground : Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced in Belgium since 2006. A sharp decline in hospitalisations was observed during the rst years after vaccine introduction with the high uptake it had (>85%). Our study objective is to investigate whether this hospital decline is maintained and to simulate projections. Methods : The Rotavirus Belgium Impact Study (RotaBIS) allows an analysis of rotavirus vaccine impact amongst children in 11 hospitals in Belgium over a 9 year period (2005-2013) with 2 years pre- and 7 years post-vaccine introduction. Results are compared by year and by subsequent birth cohort aging up to 5 years. The 2 di erent analysis methods help dismantling the di erent (direct and indirect) e ects of vaccine protection to simulate future hospitalisation trends. Results : During the whole observation period 40,552 rotavirus detection tests were performed of which 5,832 were positive (14.4%). After rotavirus vaccine introduction a signi cant reduction in number of tests performed (-35%) was combined with a dramatic drop in numbers of positive test results (-76%). The decreases were spectacular during the rst two years of vaccine introduction but after that the decrease fl attens. Comparing cross-sectional with cohort data it shows that the initial drop was heavily infl uenced by the herd e ect of the vaccine. Cohort analysis demonstrates a low rate of residual disease over time suggesting another infection source than the child population. Conclusions : Residual disease will be maintained in the community when a same vaccination strategy is continued over time starting vaccination of children only at 6 weeks' time. Keywords : rotavirus, vaccination, gastroenteritis, hospitalization, children INTRODUCTION Rotavirus (RV) infection is the most common cause of diarrhea in young children less than 5 years old across the world [1;2]. The infection has a seasonal epidemic spread in temperate climates with a much higher frequency during the winter [3-5]. Severe consequences of RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) are more often observed in children under the age of 2 years, after which a dramatic drop in the number of diarrhea events is noticed [6]. After the age of 5 years, children have normally acquired a natural immunity so that RV diarrhea is seldom reported [7-9]. B Standaert* D Strens\u00b0 109RVGE is very contagious and therefore its spread remains di cult to control even with rigorous application of primary hygienic measures [10]. As a result, the RVGE epidemic is a well-known annually recurring public health problem. In Belgium for instance, before the introduction of the vaccine, it was causing a disease burden of around 70,000-75,000 diarrhea events per year in children under the age of 7 years [11;12]. But the RV infection has some interesting features that make the contagion quite unique. RV immunity is built up by successive infection exposures of which the rst one is the most severe leading to acute symptoms but the following ones are progressively less severe [9;13]. To reduce this public health burden a radical change in disease management should be considered such as the early stimulation of infants' immunity between the ages of 6 and 10 weeks, thus providing protection while still being regularly exposed to the virus. This new management strategy uses RV vaccines, which have been available in Europe since 2006 for a two-dose vaccine, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline V accines, Rixensart, Belgium), and since 2007 for a three- dose vaccine, Rotateq\u00ae (Merck and Co. Inc, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, United States). The rst dose of the vaccine can be administered from 6 weeks of age, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between subsequent doses [14;15]. To date, only a few countries in Europe have taken the advantage of the vaccine availability to start reimbursement or to make the vaccine accessible through tenders. Four countries in Western Europe introduced the RV vaccine into their routine immunization schedules soon after the vaccine became available: Austria, Belgium, Finland and Luxemburg [16]. By February 2014, national universal RV vaccination recommendation had been implemented in a few additional countries, including Estonia, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom (UK) [17]. Studies from Austria [18;19], Finland [20] and Belgium [21-23] have reported quite impressive reductions in hospitalizations 2-3 years after vaccine introduction combined with a vaccine herd e ect. The medium- to long-term e ect of the vaccine within the same at-risk group has not often been reported [24;25]. In the study presented here we report about results of Belgium where the vaccine uptake was very high from start (>85% rst year) and where cohorts of children 5 years of age were followed from 2005 through 2013 (2 pre-vaccination and 7 post-vaccination years) [26]. Such a long follow-up period should help in better understanding how the vaccine is working in real life conditions. For instance we hypothesize that if there is only one infection source (the children themselves) and the vaccine e ectiveness remains the same together with a well-maintained high vaccine uptake (>85%), the reduction in RVGE hospitalization rate should continuously decrease year after year leading to an elimination of the disease very soon. This suggestion can now be tested by analyzing the number of hospitalizations seen and expected by year and in each birth cohort over time, and by comparing the di erences. If there are major deviations between expected and observed results, the shape of the curve could help identifying a likely reason for the di erence. Sources of curve deviation could include another source of infection not a ected by the vaccine, vaccine waning, variable vaccine coverage rate, selection bias among some of the participating centers, or a combination of the di erent reasons.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 110MATERIAL AND METHODS Data source Retrospective hospital database analyses were conducted at the same 11 hospitals in Belgium over an observation period of 9 years (2005-2013). Nine were general hospitals with a pediatric ward and two were pediatric only hospitals. In addition 4 of the 11 centers were university hospitals. The centers were distributed across the country and covered the three regions of Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia. All the centers had combined around 500 pediatric beds, representing 17% of the total of 2,750 pediatric beds in Belgium. Each participating center provided information on the laboratory assays used to detect RV . We collected in each center the following information: center code; children's date of birth; children's test results (negative, positive); outcome (ambulant or hospitalized); date of hospital admission and discharge; and length of hospital stay in days. The data were pooled anonymously before any analysis occurred. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from each participating hospital, each year we collected the data. All children aged 5 years old who had a RV detection test performed at one of the participating centers from January 1, 2005 to May 31, 2013 were eligible for inclusion in the current analysis. The pre-vaccination study period was de ned as from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006. The period from January 1, 2007 to May 31, 2013 was considered as the post-vaccination period (reimbursement of the vaccine was introduced in November 2006). The number of tests performed and the proportion of RV-positive test results were calculated for each participating center, per month, per year and for 7 di erent age groups (2 months, >2-12 months, >12 months-2 years, >2-3 years, >3-4 years, >4-5 years, >5 years). Children aged <12 months were subdivided into two groups (2 months and >2- 12 months) because the former group was too young for vaccination but could experience a herd protection e ect once the vaccine is introduced. Data analysisData analysis The data are analysed in two di erent ways: cross-sectional by year: the number of hospitalizations during the epidemic period of each year (January until the end of May) for the 7 age-groups during the period 2005-2013 is summed up and reported annually. The data are compared by age-group and overall per year: pre-vaccination versus post-vaccination (1st year, 2nd year, nnd year... 7th year post-vaccination). by birth cohort followed over time: the number of hospitalizations during the epidemic period is noted in the birth cohort for the rst and for each subsequent year of that cohort until the children are getting 5 years old. The results are summed up by year for each birth cohort and for the total follow-up period. The results are compared by subsequent birth cohorts. Using this approach, we could report 3 vaccinated subsequent birth cohorts getting 5 years old and 5 Chapter 3 111vaccinated subsequent birth cohorts getting 3 years old. We also compare those results with the pre-vaccination period but cross-sectional only as those data were not under the infl uence of RV vaccination. Two important assumptions underlying the comparison of the annual number of RV-positive test results are that the catchment area for each of the participating centers remained the same across the whole observation period of 9 years and that no change in disease management behavior for testing the children 5 years old on RV disease occurred during that period. It means that if fewer tests were performed once the vaccine has been introduced, this has mainly to do with less suspected cases presenting themselves to the hospital unit and not with a change in behavior of the physician who was less likely to perform RV test once the vaccine was introduced. Therefore, the most relevant value to compare between the years is the accumulated number of RV-positive test results and not the proportion of RV-positive test results. Model simulation To well-understand the real impact the vaccine has, this can best be achieved by comparing observed results with a model simulation in which we separately control the di erent aspects that could impact the outcome (hospital reduction) such as changing the vaccine e cacy over time, initiating a second source of infection not being under the infl uence of the vaccine, changing the vaccine waning rate, or changing the vaccine uptake per year. For doing that comparison we selected from the observed data the birth cohort follow-up data up to the age of 3 years in order to obtain enough data-points over time. We developed a time di erence equation model based on the initial data collection of the rst years of observation. An analysis is then simulated in which the decrease in hospital numbers for the rst few years ts the observed data with xed parameters over time, a calibration process: Xn+1 = Xn * covn * 1 - r + Xn * 1 - covn + Xm in which: r is the xed decreasing value equivalent to the vaccine e cacy (VE), cov is the vaccine coverage rate, x0 is the starting hospital numbers at t0, xm is the residual disease hospitalization (Xm = X0 *f), f is the fraction of hospitalization caused by another source of infection n indicates number of years Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 112With the model we may easily adjust the shape of the simulated curve changing separately the vaccine uptake (cov) at speci c n time points, the vaccine waning by decreasing r, the residual disease caused by another source of infection by changing f. The simulated shape can then be compared with the observed data and the best t is selected for the most plausible scenario of projected future hospitalizations related to the disease. Outcomes An annual comparison of cross-sectional data will identify the importance of the herd e ect generated by the vaccine. Analyzing and comparing successively vaccinated birth cohorts over time will indicate whether the vaccine wanes. Comparison of the summary measures of vaccinated birth cohorts per year with simulated predictions will test the hypothesis about di erent sources of infection. Finally, the proportional di erence in RV-positive test results between pre- versus the most recent post-vaccination period analyzed (2012-2013) across the 11 participating centers will identify any selection bias in participating centers that may explain why residual disease could be observed over time. Results are tested for statistical signi cance using Chi-square tests for trend of proportional data, with a statistical signi cance level of p<0.05 [27]. RESUL TS Cross-sectional analysisCross-sectional analysis Among the 11 participating centers 40,552 RV tests were conducted over the observation period of 9 years, with a much higher frequency during the epidemic months. The overall number of RV-positive test results recorded during that period was 5,832 (14.4%). Over the years, the overall number of tests performed signi cantly decreased from 6,278 tests in 2006 during the pre-vaccination period to 3,893 tests in 2012 during the post-vaccination period, representing a reduction of 38%. Moreover, the absolute number of RV-positive test results decreased from 1,399 tests in 2006 during the pre-vaccination period to 327 tests in 2012 during the post-vaccination period, representing a reduction of 76.6%. The decrease in RV-positive test results was extremely sharp during the rst 2-3 years after the introduction of the vaccine and then fl attened over time, compared with the more linear decrease in the number of RV-negative tests over time (Figure 1). The non-linear reduction in the number of RV-positive test results over time was statistically signi cant ( 22=215.95; p<0.0001). The number of RV-positive test results is shown by age group and year in Figure 2. There was a sharp drop in the number of RV-positive cases in the rst year after the introduction of RV vaccination, especially in the vaccinated age groups (>2-12 months and >12 months-2 years) which represent nearly 78% of the entire study population. There was also a drop in the number of positive cases in children who were either too young (2 months) or too old (>2 years) to be immunized.

The accumulated data represent 85% of the total RV-positive test results, with the remaining 15% observed in the other months of the year, especially November and December. In 2007, the cross-sectional results indicated a total of 710 RV-positive test results, which was 44% lower than the year before when no vaccine was provided (there were 1271 RV-positive test results in 2006). Following the birth cohort from 2007 to 2012, and summing the values year-by-year with increasing age in the table (69+305+199+44+16+5+2), reached 640 RV-positive test results. As expected, this is lower than the cross-sectional result of 2007. The di erence between the two values (710 versus 640) is explained by the di erence between age groups subject to the herd e ect only (marked as yellow cells in the table for the cross-sectional calculation) versus the age groups subject to direct vaccine e ect plus the herd e ect (marked as light brown cohort cells).

A herd e ect was maintained after the rst 5 years of the vaccination programme, as shown by the continued reduction in RV-positive test results seen in children <2 months of age who are too young for vaccination ( rst row, yellow cells). A particularly interesting nding in the cohort analysis is that the data do not show any additional drop in the early age groups (>2-12 mo and 12 mo-2 yrs) after the large decrease of the rst 2 years. This indicates that the rate of decrease in hospitalization changes over time, which indirectly reveals that another factor must infl uence the process of RV infection in this child population. Model simulations Figure 3 compares rst-year observed results (a) with simulations of having another source of infection in the population (b), having no other source of infection in the population (c), vaccine waning (d), and having a di erent vaccine uptake scenario (e). Chapter 3 115There was a good t between the observed data and the simulations for the rst 3 years when the r-factor in the simulation equation equals 0.5 and no other source of infection was present (c). Under such scenario we could normally foresee an elimination of the disease over a few years as we initially hypothesized. However, a much better overall good t of the whole observed curve shape (b) was obtained if the additional source of infection with residual disease (f-factor) was introduced in addition to the r-factor (slightly adjusted to 0.4 rst year and 0.6 in subsequent years). The f-factor was estimated at 12% of the hospitalizations in the equation.

To obtain a perfect t with the observed data the annual waning would have to reach 35%, starting in the second year of vaccination. V arying the vaccine uptake from 85% to 65% in 3rd year doesn't a ect the curve (e) so much as the biggest drop in hospitalization occurs in the rst years and what happens thereafter appears having a marginal e ect. The point to make here is that any decrease in vaccine uptake later on, cannot explain the observed curve as it is now. Finally the proportion of RV-positive test results across all the participating hospital centers was higher during the pre-vaccination period (2005-2006) than during the post-vaccination period (2012-2013) as expected. The average di erence between 2005-2006 and each of 2012 and 2013 was 0.163 (minimum 0.10 to maximum 0.24) and 0.178 (minimum 0.07 to maximum 0.30), respectively. No center was noticeably an outlier (see Figure 4). DISCUSSION This analysis of medium- to long-term impact of RV vaccination on speci c test results measured annually in the same 11 hospital centers in Belgium has identi ed several interesting features. First, there was a large reduction in frequency of RV disease during the normal seasonal epidemic period after vaccination of the rst birth cohort had started. The decrease of 70-80% in RV-positive test results, compared with the period of no vaccination, was achieved within two years after vaccine introduction. After that large initial drop, subsequent annual decreases were more modest (around Figure 4 Di erence in proportion of RV-positive test results during the post-vaccination period (2012 and 2013) compared with the pre-vaccination period (2006) in each hospital center (code) Nbr: number; RV: rotavirus.Chapter 3 11710-15% per age group). A similar early vaccine e ect (the sharp drop in the rst year) was seen in the UK during the rst year after the vaccine introduction [28]. The decline was more spectacular during the rst year than in the present study. This could be due to the start date of the vaccination campaign in the UK, which was planned by the end of the second quarter the year before the start of the next epidemic season. In Belgium, vaccination began much closer to the next epidemic season, namely in the fourth quarter of the year [29]. Second, in addition to the important direct vaccine e ect seen in the rst vaccinated birth cohort, we also observed during the same period a substantial drop in the unvaccinated age groups (i.e. children too young or too old to be vaccinated, as shown in Table 1). This phenomenon clearly indicates the high transmission rate of the virus between the di erent age groups, resulting in a high indirect herd e ect of the vaccine during the rst years of the vaccination programme until the whole at-risk group (aged up to 5 years old) is covered. The overall drop in disease events was spectacular during the rst 2 years, because the younger age groups targeted by the vaccine programme are the groups most a ected by RV disease (peak incidence rates) and are the highest receivers and transmitters of the virus to other age groups. Virus transmission within these age groups and to other age groups was directly and indirectly reduced by the vaccine. Once the at-risk group has been vaccinated, herd e ects in the older age-groups would be expected to disappear, as children in this group would have been vaccinated when they were younger. This would leave herd e ects only in children 2 months of age (who are too young for vaccination) as an additional bene t sustained over time. With 7 years of real-world observations after vaccine introduction, this study provides information about the likely source of infection of RV disease in the child population. The results split by age group in Figure 2 indicate that the role of the vaccine is primarily to stop the spread of the infection within the child population. The vaccine ful lls that task very well, as it induces a high herd e ect across the di erent unvaccinated age groups during the same period. To obtain such a high vaccine impact, the main source of infection must be within the children themselves as such a high vaccine e ect can only be obtained if it blocks the root cause of infection transmission. However, the amount of indirect herd e ect depends heavily on how children are normally nurtured during that period. For example, do they attend day-care centers and at what starting age, do they have regular contact with other children elsewhere, and are di erent disease patterns observed between di erent age groups if child management or behavior changes? These questions a ect the likely sources of infection and patterns of disease transmission between and within age groups, and would be valuable areas for further research. Finally, the di erent observed rates of disease reduction in subsequent years across di erent age groups are a signal that di erent infection forces operate within the child population. The most plausible explanation, simulated in Figure 3, is that there is an additional source of infection that can be clearly seen once most of the herd e ect has faded away after the vaccine Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 118programme has been in place for a few years and all the at-risk children have been vaccinated. This scenario appears much more likely than a vaccine waning scenario, because an annual decrease of 35% in vaccine e ect starting one year after its introduction must occur to t the observed data. Another possibility could be that the vaccination coverage rate fl uctuated over time, but it is unlikely that that potential disturbance may impact so heavily the outcome results. In addition in Belgium the vaccine coverage rate remained stable and quite high during the whole observation period (>86%, IMS data). These indications of additional sources of infection suggest that the disease and the virus will not be easily eliminated unless the other sources of infection can be targeted by di erent vaccination strategies. A cohort analysis illustrates e ects within the child population over time, including the dynamics of indirect vaccine impact. This type of investigation is more sensitive and better able to identify the real-world bene t of the vaccine than using vaccine e cacy data obtained through randomized clinical trials, where the control group may be infl uenced by the herd e ect. This may reduce the measured vaccine e cacy, as seen in the European trial [30]. Following a rst birth cohort over time should normally demonstrate a larger reduction of RV-positive test results than a rst-year cross-sectional evaluation, because the vaccinated birth cohort includes a mixture of direct and indirect vaccine e ects in each subsequent year if the coverage rate is not 100%. In contrast, the cross-sectional analysis only includes the measured herd e ect in addition to the rst-year direct e ect of vaccination of a small age group. Thus, we would expect to observe a larger e ect in the birth cohort analysis than the cross-sectional analysis when comparing the two datasets, which is consistent with the results observed in this study. However, cross-sectional and cohort data would be expected to reach the same end result for the sum of the di erent at-risk age groups as soon as all the children from all the di erent at risk age-groups have been vaccinated, approximately 9 years from the start [31;32]. Comparing birth cohort and cross-sectional analyses can also estimate the magnitude of the pure herd e ect that can be generated by the vaccine in this disease. Finally, all centers responded to the vaccine in a similar way over time. The observation of a residual disease burden could have been linked to speci c centers that did not apply the same vaccination strategy in their catchment area, or to potential insourcing in some speci c areas of unvaccinated children from outside Belgium where vaccination is not yet routinely performed. These possibilities were not measured in the present study. A limitation of the current study is that we do not fully control the denominator of the study, and thus we assume that the target population has not signi cantly changed over the 9 years of the study period. For a small country as Belgium with a stable population, this assumption is reasonable. Another assumption is that no change behavior in testing the children for RV infection appeared over time after the introduction of the vaccine.Chapter 3 119This analysis may provide the rst evidence of another source of RV infection that exists outside the child population. This source appears to be less spectacular in spreading the disease in the child population than transmission within the age group, and may also be less likely to be signi cantly infl uenced by vaccination because the current vaccination strategy may not directly touch this reservoir. In conclusion, the results of this study help to ll a gap of important information about the impact of RV vaccination over the medium- to long-term. The main features reported are the sustained reduction in hospitalization. A new nding that could potentially be important is that there may be di erent sources of infection in the child population, which may make it di cult to reduce the disease to very low levels. A residual disease presence observed over time means that we need to continue to monitor events each year in order to detect any new developments.

The evidence of those values could only be measured if the vaccine was already introduced on a large scale for a few years in a country. I like to present here the domains of bene t/ value I have fully explored in depth today. /four.lf./one.lf QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVEMENT One is about the bene t of improving Quality of Care in the hospital environment after introducing the vaccine, B Standaert et al. accepted, 2015 . The point we want to make is that during every winter period the pediatric ward is overwhelmed by a huge patient infl ux because many infectious diseases in the very young children happen more or less during the same period. With the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine we have now a possibility to better regulate the patient infl ow into the health care system and as a consequence improve the Quality of Care (QoC) in that environment. I was able to demonstrate that this hidden bene t generated by this vaccine was overwhelming not only at the level of gastro-enteritis su ering patients but for the whole pediatric department. To assess well the QoC I proposed a simple method of calculation based on existing data easily accessible in a hospital environment. /four.lf./two.lf REDUCTION IN ABSENTEEISM The other interesting bene t is about the observed reduction in absenteeism amongst working mothers with a rst child during the epidemic season of rotavirus diarrhea. I observed a signi cant reduction amongst the administrative personnel in the City of Antwerp after the introduction of the vaccine in 2006 in Belgium, B Standaert et al, submitted, 2014 . The latter is quite interesting as we often claim and simulate in our economic models that there is a high indirect cost among working parents when exposed to infectious diseases in children and that there is much bene t to be expected from introducing the vaccine for that domain. Here I was able to show the evidence and to quantify the bene t related to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine with real life data./four.lfChapter 4 123IMPROVEMENT IN HOSPITAL QUALITY OF CARE (QOC ) AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF ROTAVIRUS VACCINATION: AN EVALUATION STUDY IN BELGIUM Accepted by Human Vaccines & Immuno Therapeutics, March 2015 ABSTRACT During each winter period hospital emergency rooms and paediatric wards are often overwhelmed by high patient infl ux with infectious diseases leading to chaotic conditions with poor quality of care (QoC) delivery as a consequence. The conditions could be improved if we were able to better control the infl ux by introducing for instance better prevention strategies against some of the most frequent infectious diseases. New prevention strategies using vaccination against rotavirus infection were introduced in Belgium in November 2006. We developed a measure of hospital QoC suitable for assessing the impact of paediatric rotavirus vaccination. The study is retrospective collecting routine data on bed and sta management in one paediatric hospital in Belgium. The data were divided in pre- and post-vaccination periods during rotavirus-epidemic and non-epidemic periods. The scores were constructed using Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA). All patients enrolled were admitted to the paediatric ward over the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009. The results of the epidemic period indicated that bed-day occupancy, bed- day turnover and unplanned readmissions for acute gastroenteritis were lower in the post-vaccination compared with the pre-vaccination periods. The QoC scores were therefore signi cantly lower (indicating improved QoC) after the introduction of rotavirus vaccination, compared with pre-vaccination. The data suggests that the reduction in the winter peak of rotavirus-related hospitalisations after the introduction of the vaccine reduces pressure on hospital resources and improves the quality of hospital care. The ndings should be further tested in similar settings. INTRODUCTION Rotavirus disease places a high demand on European healthcare systems, accounting for 56.2% of hospitalisations and 32.8% of emergency department visits for community-acquired gastroenteritis during the winter epidemic seasons in children aged <5 years [1]. The seasonal rotavirus peak coincides with other paediatric infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infl uenza, pneumococcal disease, and other causes of acute gastro-enteritis (AGE) [2;3]. Each winter, those infections cause a high infl ux of children with communicable diseases into paediatric hospital wards and emergency rooms. These winter increases in hospitalisations for infectious diseases in young children place a heavy burden on the delivery of medical care [4;5]. Overcrowding and excess workload in hospital care is recognised as a serious problem for patients and sta [6;7]. High patient-to-nurse ratios are related to unfavourable patient outcomes and increased self-reports of sta burnout and job dissatisfaction [8]. In addition to sta stress, the infl ux of infectious disease cases may result in B Standaert1 A Alwan2 D Strens3 M 3 Realidat, Grimbergen, Belgium 4 Jessa Hospital, Hasselt, Belgium 5 University of Groningen, Groningen, The NetherlandsExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 124wards crowded over capacity, facilitating pathogen transmission and increasing nosocomial infections [9]. This has been documented by epidemiological data, but the consequences have not been fully investigated [10;11]. Overcrowding leads to high turnovers, with consequent potential for premature discharge and high readmission rates [12-15]. Over-stressed conditions for sta may be associated with high sickness rates requiring recruitment of temporary personnel, which in turn may be associated with a risk of incorrect diagnosis and/or treatment. Thus, the seasonal infl ux of patients with communicable diseases during a short time risks a cascade of sequential problems each winter. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced in 2006 and o ers the potential for better control of the infl ux of infectious disease cases [16]. Rotavirus vaccination in countries with established vaccination programmes has consistently and signi cantly reduced the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) and associated hospitalisations, emergency department visits and outpatient/ physician o ce visits in the United States (US), Europe and Australia [17-20]. Belgium introduced rotavirus vaccination in November 2006, with an uptake of 85% in the rst year [21] and 89% in the second year [22]. This high vaccine uptake is maintained throughout subsequent years where parents are asked for a co- payment of the vaccine of 11.6\u20ac per dose [23]. We have previously investigated the change in winter paediatric hospitalisations from before to after the introduction of rotavirus vaccination [22]. By reducing the seasonal infl ux of urgent RVGE cases into paediatric hospitals, the vaccine could help to reduce the winter pressure on healthcare resources and sta , o ering potential wider bene ts beyond reduced healthcare costs and quality-of-life gains in improving hospital quality of care (QoC). Such bene ts would accrue to patients and their families, sta and hospital managers. Patients, who at present may be exposed to overcrowded hospitals with sta operating under stressful conditions, could bene t from better care provided by a less pressured service. Sta could bene t from reduced work stress and thus better conditions for optimal delivery of care, and could be less prone to infections. Health authorities and management may bene t from more e cient overall operation of the healthcare system, and will be better able to maintain a high quality of hospital care throughout the year. Can these additional potential bene ts of rotavirus vaccination on QoC be measured, and could such a measure be used as a benchmark for assessing the value of a new vaccine to hospital care? The objective was to obtain a daily QoC score based on easily accessible variables that refl ect the management of hospital beds and sta . The score should indicate when care management is at risk for a quality drop potentially a ecting patients and caregivers, and should be able to measure the impact of a vaccine introduction. The following hypothesis was therefore tested. The average daily QoC score in hospital management during winter epidemic seasons is signi cantly/relevantly worse in pre-vaccination compared with post-vaccination periods with a large score di erence amongst the AGE population, a moderate score di erence in the infection-only population and a marginal di erence score overall.Chapter 4 125RESUL TS Descriptive resultsDescriptive results Rotavirus infections Testing for rotavirus started on 1 June 2005.

During the observation period (1st of January 2004 to 31st of December 2009) the total number of bed-days occupied in the paediatric ward with 34 beds was 56,451 days (76%), of which 25,973 days (46%) were due to infectious diseases. Of these, 7,697 days (29.6%) were due to AGE. During the winter the mean number of occupied beds per day for AGE (BDOR) was much higher pre-vaccination than post-vaccination (7.52 bed-days vs. 4.47 bed-days, respectively). The AGE BTOR rate and AGE UnPln rate were also higher pre-vaccination than post-vaccination (0.048 versus 0.028 for BTOR and 0.56 versus 0.16 for UnPln, respectively). Sta management variables Surprisingly, the mean number of full-time equivalent sta per day (FTEs) and overtime hours (OTR) were higher in post- than pre-vaccination (Table 3, 14.468 FTEs versus 14.945 FTEs and 6.95 h versus 7.55 h OTR). However, the minimum numbers were much lower in post-vaccination periods (9.1 FTEs versus 6.9 FTEs and 3 h versus 0 h for OTR). It was not possible to split FTEs and OTR by patient group. Only a few days had overtime hours. Pre-vaccination, the number of days with overtime hours was 38/271 (14%), compared with 57/361 [16%] post- vaccination. Table 4 shows data on sta sick leave (SLT). The pre-vaccination period had higher average and maximum values for sick leave than the post- vaccination period (5.25 h versus 4.37 h). Analytical results Table 5 shows average Factor 1 (bed management score), Factor 2 (sta management score) and overall QoC scores (Factor 1 + Factor2) pre- and post- vaccination. QoC scores were signi cantly lower (improved QoC) post-vaccination than pre-vaccination in all three groups (AGE, Infection only, Overall). The largest di erence was in the AGE group, as expected.

This may be because the AGE group comprised a large proportion of the infection-only group, and there were relatively few non-AGE infections to bene t from improvements in time and bed-space. This is not the case when the overall paediatric ward is considered. Figure 1 compares the daily Factor 2 (sta management) scores during the winter of 2006 and 2008 as an example. In 2006 (pre-vaccination) there was a period of stress, indicated by high Factor 2 scores, with no equivalent in 2008 (post-vaccination). Figure 2 shows as another example of the impact of the vaccine, the absolute number of bed-days occupied per month in 2005 (1 year pre-vaccination) and 2009 (2 years post-vaccination). Post-vaccination, BDOR stayed below the ideal threshold throughout the winter rotavirus season (January-March), whereas pre-vaccination the BDOR was above this threshold for several months. The increase in November- December in both years is partly explained by the hospitalisation of RSV cases.

Overcrowding as indicated by excess BDOR has been associated with increased hospital infections and patient mortality [26-28], and exposure to BDOR of >10% in excess of the recommended limit of 85% for >6 months has been associated with antidepressant treatment in hospital sta [29]. Overcrowding typically occurs in the winter, when infl uenza, RSV , pneumococcal disease and Figure 1 Daily Factor 2 (sta management) scores in the winter of 2006 (pre-vaccination) and the winter of 2008 (post-vaccination) Nbr: number; RV: rotavirus. Figure Nbr: number; RV: rotavirus.Chapter 4 129rotavirus all circulate together, and can be exacerbated by rapid pathogen spread within the hospital causing high rates of nosocomial infection. However, although the problem of winter pressure is familiar to hospital sta , until now there has been no method to quantify that phenomenon into one single measure. The present study is a rst attempt to develop a single QoC score that can quantify stress in healthcare services and can assess the impact of interventions, such as rotavirus vaccine introduction, on service stress. As this was a retrospective analysis, we used data that were already available. This should allow replication of this analysis in other hospital settings collecting similar data which is the case for bed day management variables but could be more di cult for sta management variables that most often are not fully electronically available over a long enough period during pre-vaccination or before 2006 in Belgium. Overcrowding and its adverse e ects on sta stress should be visible in measures of bed management and sta management, so we concentrated on variables in these areas. Some of these variables should be correlated, e.g. when BDOR is high, BTOR is also likely to be high, which in turn increases the risk of unplanned readmission. The technique of Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) allows identi cation of links between the variables and the integration of several variables into a new measure. In the present study, we pre-de ned the number of Factors we wanted to work with, one on bed management and one on sta management, to facilitate the construction of an overall QoC score with the right weighting values for each variable in the EFA equation. As expected, the di erence in winter QoC scores pre- and post-vaccination was highest among AGE patients. Notably, there was also a substantial di erence for the overall group. This indicates that improved QoC after introduction of rotavirus vaccination bene ted the paediatric ward as a unit, and not only patients with the speci c infection targeted by the vaccine. We also explored an analysis of calculating QoC-scores in the non-winter periods expecting no much of a di erence between the pre- and post-vaccination periods for the 3 patient groups considered and obtaining much lower scores than during the winter periods. Our hypothesis was con rmed and indicated a way to validate the construction of the score-composition. We report these particular data in the Appendix 1. The analysis can also be used to identify periods of stress by plotting the daily scores. Our results showed that the daily Factor 2 (sta management) scores indicated an extended period of high stress in the winter of 2006, and bed occupancy indicated an extended period of overcrowding in the winter of 2005. Such information could be used to predict the development of problems and to implement remedial actions. It should be emphasised that this analysis does not support reductions in personnel numbers in paediatric wards during the winter period now that rotavirus vaccination has been introduced. Instead, it demonstrates that there was considerable stress in paediatric wards prior to vaccine introduction. This stress could have detrimental e ects on patients, sta and the e cient operation of the healthcare system. Introducing the rotavirus vaccine has reduced the seasonal Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 130peak in rotavirus admissions, thus reducing the winter stress on healthcare services and improving QoC, which should bene t patients, sta and hospital management overall. But QoC scores are likely to be dynamic, since they are composed of several variables, and it is likely that they will continue to evolve over time. The technique of EFA to build scores is not new and has especially been applied in the world of sociology [30]. In the medical world it has been used to help classifying patient-groups in function of disease severity levels based on scores constructed through the collection of data from questionnaires [31]. Currently, cost-e ectiveness analyses of new vaccines have not been able to include any QoC bene ts of vaccination. The present analysis o ers a way to quantify the QoC bene t, which may allow its potential impact on hospital costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY s) to be incorporated in economic analyses. We are exploring this in future research. However we need to be sure to make links between the level of QoC-scores and the cost of disease management in hospital care or the impact on QALY s amongst the personnel. The latter should preferentially be investigated with prospective data collection. That process doesn't facilitate the implementation of such a study. The present study has some limitations. First, it was conducted at a single centre, and the results should be con rmed in other settings. We are presently investigating the possibility of repeating the project in another hospital in Belgium with access to similar data. However, if we want to expand our research in other countries it will be di cult. As of today not many countries in Europe can con rm the analysis results we have as only a few of them have currently accepted the rotavirus vaccination as a universal mass vaccination program in children including the UK, Austria, and Finland. Moreover by limiting the study to one centre in Belgium it was also not possible to include all the variables we selected for the analysis. For instance we were unable to introduce nosocomial infection rates which are normally an appropriate indicator of stress situations in hospital management. That speci c event underwent a dramatic observed reduction after the introduction of the vaccine. But because of too low numbers registered during the observation period in this centre, we could not include the variable in the analysis. Another option to circumvent the problem of too low observation units is to change the time unit of observation from day to week or months. This is an option we would like to further explore. Moreover, the EFA approach remains a subject of debate amongst experts [32]. One challenging item is about the tting procedures to obtain the regression coe cients amongst the variables and the Factors in between, called the Factor loadings. Di erent approaches exist but there is no method that indicates the best or the worst approach in calculating these values. In this study here we have taken a conservative approach by selecting appropriate data and trying to make the analysis as uniform as possible. Full details are provided in the supplementary Appendix 1 to allow other researchers to replicate the analysis.Chapter 4 131Introducing a new vaccine that a ects a major public health problem could have many healthcare bene ts beside the improvements of clinical bene ts such as mortality and morbidity reduction. The new vaccine may also unexpectedly have an impact on other domains of the health care program if that program su ers as well about overcrowded hospital services during certain periods, stress in care delivery by health care professional, bad management of the beds to be used. These are conditions we often have di culties to measure correctly about the deviations of normal practice. The analysis method here described as EFA has just the facility to be able to collect that new information quantitatively in an easy to applied way and it does not require the collection of additional data. It integrates several aspects of healthcare service stress by including both bed-day management and care of sta , which are linked and should therefore be evaluated together. The result of such an approach is that we are now in a position to measure the additional hidden bene t a vaccine can o er, showing an improved summary score in QoC with better patient care, more sta time, reduced spread of infectious disease in hospitals and more resources to apply on other disease areas. The QoC score can be used to predict periods of stress and identify problems to tackle during day to day management. Using the quantitative QoC score it may help to nd more objective ways of analysing the issues of healthcare service stress and the bene t impact of new interventions. METHODS Hospital se/tt ingHospital se/tt ing The study was conducted at the Jessa Hospital in Hasselt, Belgium, which is also part of another rotavirus vaccine study [33]. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced in the region following the recommendation of the Flemish High Committee for Public Health Services (Hoge Gezondheidsraad). The hospital has 34 paediatric beds, and its database was electronically accessible. Its catchment area was uniform during the study period and there were no major management changes, allowing comparisons between pre- and post-vaccination periods. Ethical approval for the study was obtained in December 2012. Variables The hospital's existing database provided data on the following variables relating to management of patient beds and sta , measured per day that could be used for the construction of the QoC score: Bed-day occupancy number and rate (BDOR): beds available per day; Bed-day turnover rate (BTOR): Number of patients discharged/number per day; Unplanned readmission rate (UnPln): Number of readmissions discharge/total number of discharges per day; Rotavirus test rate and positive results (RVT): Number of tests performed per day and rate of positive test results; RVGE dayExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 132 RVGE speci c death rate of hospitalisations/total number of children in the catchment area per day Full-time equivalent sta per day (FTE): Total number of hours worked by the personnel per day/7.6; Over-time work by the sta per day (OTW): Total number of extra hours taken by the personnel/total number of regular hours per day; Sickness leave by the sta per day (SLT): Total number of paid and unpaid sick days/total number of FTEs per day. Sta replacement per day (SR): number of replacement of sta /total number of sta present per day. These variables were analysed descriptively and used to construct the QoC scores. First, the numbers per day were assembled to observe whether their distributions were normal. If not, the data were transformed using log-transformation, square- root or other methods until a normal or near-normal distribution was reached. Quintiles were then calculated in eight groups (5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, >95th) and each variable value per day was given a score of 1-8 according to its quintile category. We selected 8 categories in order to get enough granularity in the spread of the variable values. By not selecting too few or too many categories it may impact the analysis with too many empty cells or not enough sensitive correlation between variables. It should be noted that the end results (average daily QoC-scores) were analysed by grouping period of pre-vaccination and post- vaccination, pooling therefore the numbers of several years. We have also split the evaluation period within a year as rotavirus epidemic period or not. It is expected that the di erence in QoC scores are enhanced if we consider those periods separately instead of a full year analysis that may dilute the impact with a period where no di erence in results is expected when comparing pre-post vaccination in the non-epidemic seasons. Meanwhile the following variables (RVNR; RVDR; HR; SR) were deleted from the rst analysis. The event numbers were too small (no deaths and no replacement during the observation period) or showed no meaningful change over time, so these variables were not considered further. This was especially the case for RVNR that with 87 nosocomial infection observations over a 2557 day period was too low to obtain a meaningful result. Pooling results from di erent hospitals should enhance the analysis or considering a shorter time period for the assessment such as week observations instead of day observation could have been another approach to circumvent the obstacle of too few observations. Meanwhile changing the unit of observation may impact the calculation process when the data have been collected on a day to day basis. But it is certainly an option to consider when the analysing the data of only one center. Study periodStudy period Data were collected for the period between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, divided into a pre-vaccination period (before November 2006) and a post-Chapter 4 133vaccination period (after November 2006). Winter epidemic months were de ned as 1 January to 31 March. Between 2004 and 2009, there were 2,557 days of which 632 (24.7%) days were during the winter. Of the winter days, 271 (42.9%) days were during the pre- vaccination period and 361 (57.1%) days were during the post-vaccination period. In the current analysis presented here we only demonstrate the results of the winter or the rotavirus epidemic period. We did an analysis of the non-epidemic period as well but that is reported in the supplement of Appendix 1. Patients The study included data on all patients admitted to the paediatric ward over the study period, strati ed into three groups: Overall population (all admissions); Infection-only population (patients admitted for infectious disease of any kind); AGE population (patients in the infection-only group admitted speci cally for AGE). Data analysisData analysis Descriptive Summary descriptive statistics are reported for each variable selected for calculating the QOC scores with no statistical signi cance level reported per speci c period evaluated for each variable. We did this on purpose as the focus of the study is on the measurement of the QoC scores and not on the individual variable results used to calculate the QoC scores. Analytical A summary QoC score for hospital care should integrate data from several variables to provide a useful overall measure. Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) [34] is a statistical method that assesses whether a number of observed variables are linearly related to a smaller number of unobservable Factors. We used EFA to derive two Factors from the observed variables. A scree plot indicated that only two Factors could be constructed from the data. These two Factors can be summed to produce a summary QoC score if the Factors are independent from each other. Before conducting the EFA, the observed data were standardised into eight quintiles as described above in order to be able to assemble them correctly together. The EFA was conducted in several steps. First, the dataset was analysed with speci c tests to assess whether EFA can be applied [35], constructing a correlation matrix for the pairwise correlation coe cients between the variables. The EFA should meet three objectives: it should be parsimonious (minimum number of new explanatory Factors created to explain the observed data); the new Factors should be independent of each other as far as possible; and the Factor scores should make sense (e.g. a Factor score about sta management should be driven Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 134by variables such as overtime and sick leave). Second, the Principal Component Method (PCM) con rmed that two explanatory Factors could be derived. Third, each Factor was constructed with speci c factor loadings using varimax rotation because of the independence of each Fatcor. Finally, the weighting coe cient of each variable in the equation that produces the Factor was adjusted after rotation. Using the seven variables listed above, two new measures were constructed, Factor 1 (bed management) and Factor 2 (sta management). The daily score for each Factor was calculated with a regression equation of all selected variables. The sum of the two Factors is the summary QoC score. Higher scores indicate worse QoC. The Factor scores and QoC scores were compared between pre- and post- vaccination periods using the T-test, for each patient group in each season (winter and non-winter). All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics v22.0. IBM SPSS Statistics v22.0. IBM SPSS Statistics Summary results for each Factor and QoC scores are presented in this paper. A full EFA analysis showing the calculation of the regression coe cients and Factors for one period (winter) and one patient group (overall) is provided in the supplementary Appendix 1.

APPENDIX /one.lf: EXTENDED REPORT ON EFA - ALL WINTER - ALL WINTER - PERIODS (JAN TO MARCH ), OVERALL (/one.lf) & COMPARISON OF WINTER & NON/hyphen.caseWINTER PERIODS (/two.lf) EXTENDED REPORT ON EFA Variable selection Two main groups of evaluation were considered: variables for bed management and variables for sta management. Bed management includes 7 variables: bed occupancy rate/day, bed turnover Bed management includes 7 variables: bed occupancy rate/day, bed turnover Bed rate/day, and hospitalization rate/day per 100,000 children. Chapter 4 137 Sta management includes 4 variables: full-time equivalent/day, overtime Sta management includes 4 overtime Sta management work/day, sick-leave/day, sta replacement/day. Four variables (death rates, hospitalization rates, RVGE nosocomial infection rate, sta replacement), were excluded due to the following reasons: No speci c RVGE deaths were reported during the observation period Hospitalization rates per 100,000 people were calculated per age-group (i.e. age- speci c rates) using the Flanders population as standard population. No much demographic variation was observed during the observation period. In the absence of any variation during the observation period this variable is therefore not suitable for the analysis. The variable could have been useful if important migration was observed or a high change in birth rate per year in the region. Too small number of RVGE nosocomial infection were reported (87 cases over the 6 year period) No sta replacement was reported during the observation period Rates for bed-day occupancy (BDOR), bed turnover (BTOR), unplanned readmissions within 7 days after discharge (UnPln), and Full-time equivalent (FTE) were calculated using formulas given in Horton L.A. (2007) by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). Rates were calculated for 3 groups of patients: all hospitalizations (Overall), infection only (Infection Only), and Acute Gastro Enteritis (AGE). In this exercise here, we only present the calculation of the EFA for Overall and for the winter period only. Normally 6 EFA runs have been done to calculate for every season and every study period the scores. For RVGE infection (RVGE -WM) the % of positive tests (Nr of positive tests divided by the Nr of RV tests) is calculated for all 775 days between 1/06/2005 through 31/12/2009. For overtime work (OTR) (= overtime hours/regular hours) and sick-leaves (SLR) (= total paid and unpaid sick days/number of employees in the same period) were calculated per day. Rates were checked for normality distribution and transformed to obtain normal distributions using log-normal transformation, square-roots transformation or other methods. Results were then subdivided into 8 groups using their percentiles (5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, and >95th). Due to the nature of the data a signi cant number of days were event-free: no UnPln, no SLR, and no OTR. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 138 As a result 1,120 days (43.8%) for SLR, 2,187 days (85.5%) for OTR, 1,435 days (56.1%) for UnPln were zeros. For RVGE tests 523 out of the 775 days (67.5%) have zero denominators. Explanatory Factor AnalysisExplanatory Factor Analysis Factor analysis is a method for investigating whether a number of variables of interest Y1, Y2,..., Yl, are linearly related to a smaller number of unobservable factors F1, F2, ..., Fk (i.e. latent variables). Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used with principal component method (PCM) for the number of factor extractions and direct oblimin (oblique factors or direct oblimin (oblique factors or direct oblimin correlated factors) or varimax (for orthogonal or independent factors) for factor varimax (for orthogonal or independent factors) for factor varimax rotation function that selects the variables most closely related to each factor extraction in order to obtain the right weights per variable selected. Running EFA generates the following outputs: Correlation matrix depicts correlation coe cients between each pair of orrelation matrix depicts correlation coe cients between each pair of orrelation matrix variables. There are two potential problems: Correlations are not high enough. If a variable seems to have very low correlations with many other variables, it is excluded from the analysis. Highly correlated variables are another problem (extreme multi-collinearity and singularity (variables that are perfectly correlated)). They make it impossible to determine the unique contribution to a factor of the variables that are highly correlated. Bartlett's test of Sphericity tests whether the correlation matrix resembles Bartlett's test of Sphericity tests whether the correlation matrix resembles Bartlett's test of Sphericity an identity matrix or is signi cantly di erent from an identity matrix. If the test is signi cant, it means that the correlations between variables are overall signi cantly di erent from zero (good news). Non-signi cant Bartlett's test is a concern. Haitovsky (1969) proposed a signi cance test whether the determinant is zero (i.e. matrix is singular). If the test is signi cant it tells that the correlation matrix is signi cantly di erent from a singular matrix which implies that there is no severe multi-collinearity. Anti-image correlation which gives Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values, is a Anti-image correlation which gives Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values, is a Anti-image correlation measure of sampling adequacy (MSA). A value of 0.5 is the bare minimum. If a variable has a KMO <0.50, it must be dropped from the analysis. Total variance explained by each variable Total variance explained by each variable Total variance explained Scree plot (component on the x-axis versus their eigenvalues on the y-axis) to Scree plot (component on the x-axis versus their eigenvalues on the y-axis) to Scree plot select the number of new extraction factors. Communalities - measures the proportion of variance explained by the extracted factors given per variable, Reproduced correlation matrix - gives correlation coe cients based on the factor Reproduced correlation matrix - gives correlation coe cients based on the factor Reproduced correlation matrix model. To assess the t of the model, we look at the residuals (di erences between observed and tted model). The smaller the residuals, the better the t,Chapter 4 139 Component correlation matrix - depicts the correlation coe cient between the Component correlation matrix - depicts the correlation coe cient between the Component correlation matrix extracted factors. If the extracted factors are correlated (case one), then assumption of dependent factors is suggested and the oblique rotation (oblimin method) will be used to calculate the appropriate weighting values. If the extracted factors are not correlated (case two), then we run factor analysis with the use of an orthogonal factor rotation (varimax method) for independent factors. When factors are dependent (case one), we got the Pattern Matrix (contains Pattern Matrix (contains Pattern Matrix the regression coe cients for each variable on each extracted factor), the Structure Matrix (contains correlation coe cients between each variable and Structure Matrix (contains correlation coe cients between each variable and Structure Matrix factor), and the Component Score Coe cients per variable and per extracted Component Score Coe cients per variable and per extracted Component Score Coe cients Factor, for which Factor scores can be calculated per measurement day. Factor scores can be calculated per measurement day. Factor scores When factors are independent (case two), we got the Rotated Component Matrix which is the matrix of the factor loadings for each variable into each Matrix which is the matrix of the factor loadings for each variable into each Matrix extracted factor, and the Component Score Coe cients Matrix , for which the Factor scores can be calculated. Final output is the Factor transformation matrix . If the orthogonal (e.g. varimax) rotation were completely appropriate then we would expect a symmetrical matrix (i.e. same value above and below the diagonal). Period score calculations The dataset has been subdivided by months (winter months: 1st of January to 31st of March & other months: 1st of April through 31st December) for de ning the epidemic periods of rotavirus during the year which it is expected that the Factor scores will be di erent after the introduction of the vaccine, and by study period (pre- & post-vaccination). The rates for bed day management (bed-day occupancy, bed-turnover, and unplanned readmission 7 days after discharge) were calculated for Overall, Infection-Only, and AGE hospitalizations. The rates for sta management (FTE, Overtime and Average sick-leaves) were calculated for the Overall data only as it was impossible to de ne sta to infection only and to AGE only during the observation period. Factor Analysis of data was repeated 6 times. First three runs during winter months for Overall, Infectious-driven and AGE-driven hospitalizations. Second three runs were during other months for Overall, Infectious-driven and AGE- driven hospitalizations. We present here the EFA analysis for winter period only, Overall, as an example. Factor scores Following an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), factor scores are computed and used in subsequent analyses. Since both principal components and common factor extraction methods is used with EFA, a re ned method is going to be used, namely the Anderson-Rubin (A-R) method. The A-R method is a variation of the Bartlett procedure, in which the least square formula is adjusted to produce factor scores that are not only uncorrelated with other factors, but also uncorrelated with each other.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 140Computation procedures consist of multiplying the vector of observed variables by the inverse of a diagonal matrix of the variances of the unique factor scores, and the factor pattern matrix of loadings for the observed variables. Results are then multiplied by the inversion of the symmetric square root of the matrix product obtained by multiplying the matrices of eigenvectors and eigenvalues (Formulae below). The resulting factor scores are orthogonal, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The A-R scores are automatically generated in SPSS by selecting the Anderson and Rubin option in the Factor Analysis. A-R = F1xm of observed variables, m: number of factors, F: the row vector of m estimated factor scores, Z: the row vector of n standardized observed variables, X and X': matrices of n x n eigenvectors, D: the n x n matrix of eigenvalues, G: the matrix product of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and G-1/2: the inverse of the symmetric square root of G. The calculated A-R scores per Factor is then used to assess, using two-sided t-test for independent-samples, whether factor scores were statistically di erent between pre- and post-vaccination periods. Elevated A-R scores per extracted factor, indicates excessive burdens (i.e. higher: bed-day occupancy rates, bed turnover rates, unplanned readmission rates, overtime work, average sick-leaves and more FTE needed). Levene's test was used to assess the equality of variances in the A-R scores. If the test was not signi cant, the two variances are assumed to be equal. Consequently, the t-test will be selected accordingly. RESUL TS Factor Analysis - winter monthsFactor Analysis - winter months During the epidemic months (January 1st through March 31st) there were a total of 632 days of which 271 days (43%) were during the pre-vaccination period and 361 days (57%) during the post-vaccination period. As we include the data of testing for RVGE with only 268 days of observation during the winter months, the total analysis for the winter period relies on 268 days of observation. Frequency distribution of data (percentiles) is shown below in Table 1 . For overall data (n= 268) during winter months, Factor Analysis was repeated 4 times and summary of the results is shown below in Table 2 . In the nal run (4th), UnPln and OTR were excluded from the analysis due to their individual KMO values being under the bare-minimum of 0.50.

The rst half contains Pearson's correlation coe cients between all pairs of variables whereas the bottom half contains the 1-tailed signi cance level of these coe cients.

So, it is reasonable to assume independence between the extracted Factors. As a result, the determinant of R-matrix has increased to 0.379. The value of this determinant is vital for testing for multicollinearity or singularity that must be > 0.00001. 3 Kaiser, Henry. An Index of Factorial Simplicity. F.Psychometrika, 39, 1, 31-6, Mar 74Chapter 4 143With a sample of 268 (N), 5 variables (p) and a determinant of 0.379 gives Haitovsky's Chi-Square test score of 86.52 with 10 degrees of freedom (p*(p- 1)/2). The observed value is greater than the critical value of 23.21 (for 1% level of signi cance). In addition, the KMO measure of sampling adequacy increased to 0.614, and total variance explained has increased to 66.5% (with two factors). Bartlett's test of Sphericity (approx. chi-square) of 256.592 (with 10 degrees of freedom) was highly signi cant indicating that Factor analysis is an appropriate method for analysing the data.

For Factor 1, Levene's test result of 4.228 was statistically signi cant, p= 0.041, equal variances cannot therefore be assumed. While for Factor 2, Levene's test of 0.341 was not signi cant (p= 0.560), equal variances can be assumed. The results of the t-test are therefore selected accordingly ( Table 12 ). Table 11 depicts descriptive statistics for factor scores per Factor and study period. For Factor 1, average A-R score were similar between Pre- and Post-vaccination (t-test= 1.034; p= 0.302), while for Factor 2, the average A-R scores were signi cantly higher during the pre- vaccination period compared with post-vaccination (t-test= 10.309; p<0.001).

Submi/tt ed to BMJ Open ABSTRACT ObjectivesObjectives : Rotavirus vaccination has been reimbursed in Belgium since November 2006 with a high uptake (>85%). Cost-e ectiveness analyses of the vaccine have been reported, including estimates of the indirect cost gain related to the reduction in work absenteeism. The objective of this study was to evaluate the latter parameter using real-life data. Design & Settings:Design & Settings: A simple model was built to estimate the reduction in absent work days per working mother with a rstborn baby after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. Next, data on work absences were retrospectively analysed (from 2003 to 2012) using a database of administrative employees (n =11,600 working women per year) in the city of Antwerp. Observed reductions in absenteeism after the introduction of the vaccine were compared with the results from the model. These reductions would most likely be observed during the rotavirus epidemic periods (from January to the end of May) for short-duration absences of 5 days. We compared data from outside epidemic periods (from June to December), expecting no changes over time pre- and post-vaccine introduction, as well as with a control group of women aged 30 to 35 years old with no 1st child. Results : Model estimates were 0.73 working days gained per working mother. In the database of the city of Antwerp, we identi ed a gain of 0.88 working days during the epidemic period and an accumulated gain of 2.24 days over a 3-year follow-up period. In the control group no decrease in absenteeism was measured. Giving vaccine access to working mothers resulted in an accumulated net cost gain of \u20ac187 per mother. Conclusions : Reduction in absenteeism among working mothers was observed during epidemic periods after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in Belgium. This reduction is in-line with estimates of indirect cost gains used in cost-e ectiveness models of the rotavirus vaccine.

INTRODUCTION The rotavirus (RV) epidemic is an annual recurrent public health problem of severe diarrhoea in young children, with a peak incidence before the age of 2.[1;2] RV disease preferentially occurs during the winter months in the northern hemisphere and in countries with a more temperate climate. The viral spread occurs amongst young children but may manifest a higher rate of transmission around 10 months old, for it is at this age that being in a day-care centre the child is a conducive virus transmitter to younger and older children. [3] RV vaccination was introduced in Belgium in November 2006 as a new management strategy against the illness.[4] Belgium was one of the rst countries in Europe to integrate this vaccine into its routine childhood immunisation programme.[5] V accine uptake was high from the start (>85%) because it was recommended by the High Committee of Health Promotion. Moreover, the organisational structure for implementing immune protection in children and a good follow-up process are both well developed in the country.[6] Several cost-e ectiveness evaluations of the RV vaccine have been conducted and most of these analyses have included indirect cost estimates.[7-10] An analysis of the nancial burden of RV disease in four European countries indicated that the indirect costs could be substantial: half of the total cost of the disease per child at- risk could be linked to these indirect costs.[11] However, until now these estimates have always been simulated and nobody has been able to evaluate the reduction of work absenteeism using real-life data subsequent to the introduction of the RV vaccine.[12] Obtaining that type of evidence is not an easy task as we need to have an environment where employment is stable among a large number of employees in order to follow enough working mothers with young children under the same working conditions and having the same exposure to the disease. In addition, we needed to obtain detailed information on each period of absenteeism with a start Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 152and end date linked to the employee's family condition when a new child is born. The data should be available over a long enough period of time (at least 5 years) and in electronic format with easy access so that the time periods before and after vaccine introduction can be analysed and compared. It was postulated that during epidemic RV disease periods working mothers with a 1st child would be absent from work for short durations ( 5 days) more often than during non-epidemic periods or after the introduction of the vaccine. In addition working women with no exposure anymore of children to the rotavirus disease should not experience any bene t of the vaccine expressed as a reduction in work absenteeism. We rst constructed a simple, back-of-the-envelope model that could give us guidance in our search of parameters in real-life data sets. DESIGN AND SETTING Simple model constructionSimple model construction The simple model calculates the expected di erence in worker absenteeism when comparing exposure versus non-exposure to the RV vaccine. It is expressed as the estimated number of days per year and per working mother with a 1st child. The value measured would then serve as a benchmark for analysing the observed data. Observed data We selected a database from the city of Antwerp which has a su cient number of subjects from the target group (n11,600 women per year) over a long period of time (from 2003 to 2012). This database collects detailed information on absences from work for all its administrative personnel, including an overall reason with no particular details, duration, and time period of the absence (start and end date). It is also reasonably accurate because the personnel payment data is linked to that system. Moreover, through a unique subject number the database could be linked to other databases in the city which compile information on family composition and the birth dates of children born to each employee. The data were made available after decoding subjects to prevent identi cation of individuals and after approval of the project and its objectives by the administrative head of the city. We performed the analysis in three steps. First, to increase the chances of observing a di erence in absenteeism due to vaccination, we selected a target group of women with a 1st child approximately 10 months of age during the typical epidemic RV season (January through May) of each year. These children are known transmitters of the virus. In a second step, we conducted an annual analysis of the same working mothers but with a 1st child born any time during the year prior to the next epidemic period. We expected a larger di erence (i.e., less absenteeism) from the rst analysis than from the second one. In a third step we selected from the same data-base women aged 30 to 35y old with no 1st child, but working during the same observation period from 2004 to 2012, from January to May. It was hypothesized that these women, considered as a control group, should not bene t from the rotavirus vaccination and therefore we would not observe any decrease in work absenteeism over time.Chapter 4 153Thus, in the rst step we selected working women with a 1st child born during the months of April through July on a yearly basis from 2003 to 2011. That number was variable per year. We then recorded short absences from work (5 days) which were registered 10 months after the birth of their child. That speci c period of 10 months postpartum was equal to the normal RV epidemic season. The sum of all work absences during that annual period of time in all years from 2004 to 2012 was then divided by the number of mothers considered the previous year in order to obtain an average value per working mother with a 1st child during the following epidemic period. We compared the data by year to observe any marked di erence in work absenteeism after 2006, which was the year RV vaccination was introduced. We also analysed absenteeism data from the same working mothers which was outside the epidemic period, expecting a much lower rate. To be able to compare the same values by time period, we analysed the average value by month for each period (epidemic and non-epidemic). If an important di erence was observed in the rst step, we would then proceed to the second step of evaluating work absences during each epidemic period among mothers with a 1st child born anytime during the previous year (whole year birth cohort). We again reported the sum of all days absent from work in the postpartum year during epidemic and non-epidemic periods. We hypothesised that if the di erence in absenteeism was large enough in the rst step, it should still be present in the second step and that would facilitate the analysis of other time periods. In addition, we evaluated the same type of absences from work among mothers with a rstborn child in its 2nd and 3rd year of life (e.g. absences of mothers with a rst child born during 2003 were evaluated in the epidemic periods of 2005 and 2006, respectively). Finally, we compared this observed data with the estimates we had obtained from the simple model. The control group was analysed the same way as the other groups. We report the same type of outcome measure over time which is the average number of days being absent from work per women during the epidemic period per year. Based on the above results we could calculate the net cost gain per working mother through the average reduction in absenteeism post-vaccination. This was adjusted by the cost of the vaccine, which was considered at \u20ac60/dose [13]. The average gross salary for a working mother in the city of Antwerp was estimated at \u20ac135/day [14]. To observe a statistically signi cant di erence between pre- and post-vaccination absenteeism per working mother, we compared the data by ranking mothers into 6 categories according to the number of days absent from work (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days) during the epidemic period. We then applied a statistical ranking test (Mann Whitney U-test with p<0.05). Statistical analyses and the computation of 95% Con dence Intervals (CI) were done using IBM SPSS Statistics v22.0 and GraphPad v6.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 154RESUL TS Modelled data As shown in Table 1, the simple model indicated that the introduction of the RV vaccine produced a gain range of 0.73 to 0.80 working days per mother with a 1st child in the vaccinated cohort. Because there was no maximum vaccine coverage in the vaccinated cohort, we needed to include a normal rate of infection among the unvaccinated in that cohort (=\"Rest\"). A sensitivity analysis around that value was performed since high vaccination levels result a herd e ect in the \"Rest\" group. Therefore, the di erence between pre- and post-vaccination absenteeism could be higher.

It should be noted that a reduction in absenteeism is observed only after 2008 because the vaccine was introduced in November, 2006. In the non-epidemic period, large changes are not seen in any given month. We observed a substantial reduction in absenteeism (average days per woman (2003 to 2008) - average days per woman (2009-2012) = 0.821) noted from 2009 onwards, so that we proceeded with the second step.

From 2009 on, we observed a clear increase in the number of 0-day absences from work and a decline in the number 5-day absences. In the same table we report the data of the control group of women aged 30 to 35 years old with no marked change in absenteeism seen over time. The average values and the 95% CI are also reported. There is no much di erence to be noted in the average values for the full cohort of women (Table 3) compared with the targeted cohort (Table 2) except for a narrower con dence interval in Table 3 because of the higher number of persons enrolled in the analysis. We further observed that during the non-epidemic period there was no big variation in the numbers noted year after year.

The graph compares the average value per month and per time period because the epidemic and non-epidemic seasons have di erent durations (5 and 7 months, respectively). It is important to note that the full cohort of women with vaccinated children doesn't reach the same level of absenteeism of the non- epidemic period, but at the same time the control group does not manifest any substantial decline in absenteeism during the same observation period. Figure 1B also shows the average number of absent work days during the epidemic period when the rstborn child is in its 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of life. It is interesting Chapter 4 157that the same type of decline in absenteeism is observed in subsequent years as for the 1st year postpartum analysis. As already mentioned, reductions in absenteeism started after 2008 following the introduction of the RV vaccine by the end of 2006. If we work with averages over the whole observation period, we can see that prior to the introduction of the vaccine the average number of days absent from work during the epidemic period was an estimated 1.71 days (average value from 2004 to 2008). The average number of days absent from work in the Figure 1 (A) Average number of short work absences per woman per month for the control group (blue), the full cohort mothers during the epidemic period (red), and during the non- epidemic period (green) and (B) Average number of short work absences per woman in the full cohort in the 1st (red), 2nd (blue) and 3rd (yellow) year postpartum during the epidemic period, and the non-epidemic period (green) Nbr: number; RV: rotavirus.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 158non-epidemic period was 0.83 days (average value from 2004 to 2012). Thus, the estimated di erence in absenteeism obtained from switching from no vaccination to vaccination is approximately 0.88 days per working mother with a 1st child in the 1st year of life (1.71 - 0.83); 0.70 days for 2-year old children (1.53 - 0.83); and 0.67 days for 3-year old children (1.50 - 0.83). The accumulated gain per working mother with a 1st child during the epidemic period is 2.24 days (0.88+0.7+0.67). The absolute gain is di cult to measure from the database, which reports fl uctuating numbers and di erent lengths of duration each year. Table 4 shows the calculated values, which is based on the average numbers we obtained.

At an average gross monthly salary of \u20ac3,000 or \u20ac135 per work day, the gross gain is \u20ac67,095 for the entire working mother cohort. The employer will spend a total of \u20ac26,640 for the vaccine if the cost is an estimated \u20ac120 per mother. The net gain is then quickly calculated, which is \u20ac40,455 for the cohort or \u20ac187 per working mother. DISCUSSION Many economic models evaluating the cost-e ectiveness of paediatric vaccines report the indirect cost impact in sensitivity analyses.[10;15;16] These costs are estimated using the human capital cost evaluation method in which the estimated number of days in productivity loss are multiplied by an average cost per day for the target population under study.[17;18] The approach gives a rst indication or exploration about the real value. We know, however, that these vaccination interventions can avoid a great amount of productivity loss, especially among working mothers whose children are at high risk of infection and who are receiving the paediatric vaccines. [19] In the current study, we conducted an investigation of the problem using real-life data and compared that to the results of a simple modelling exercise. The analysis con rms that there is a measurable reduction in work absenteeism among working mothers after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. When looking at the data in greater detail, we observed that this reduction was among cases with a high number of absentee working days (e.g. 5-day absences, see Table 3). Chapter 4 159The initial intention of the project was focused primarily on increasing our chances of being successful in the selection of the right target group to show a di erence in absenteeism which could be linked to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine. Therefore, we opted for mothers with a 1st child since it is most likely in the Belgian culture that that person would be the rst who takes time o work when the child su ers from an illness. Meanwhile, a critical question remained as to whether the observed reduction in work absenteeism was linked to the rotavirus vaccination introduction as many other reasons for short absences from work may cause a fl uctuation in this parameter. The analysis here gives 5 reasons for the potential link. First, the reduction happened after the introduction of the vaccine in 2006 at the time we would expect to observe a major reduction during the epidemic rotavirus season. Secondly, mothers with a 1st child in their 2nd and 3rd year of life also manifested a reduction in absenteeism starting during the same year (2008), which can be explained by the known herd e ect post-vaccination. If no herd e ect was known for this vaccine, we would not observe these additional reductions in the other age groups. Thirdly, the observed reduction per working mother closely matches the modelled estimates (see Table 1), which was surprising. No reduction in work absenteeism was seen during the non-epidemic period, making it unlikely that new rules had been put in place by the employer to minimize short-term absences; otherwise we would have seen a reduction in absenteeism during all time periods after 2008. Finally, women with no exposure of their children to any rotavirus vaccination did not show any reduction in absenteeism during the same observation period. One additional point to mention here is that trying to link the reduction with the fl uctuation of other childhood infections such as infl uenza is di cult to make as high epidemic infectious diseases during the pre-vaccine periods resulting in high rates of absenteeism should have been reported in the literature or in local disease reports which was not the case.. Speci c conditions in retrospective data analyses must be ful lled before it is possible to measure the changes observed. Those conditions are: 1) the demographic composition (gender and age) of the study population must remain stable in order to have the same denominator; 2) the rules and conditions for taking time o work must be maintained; 3) the disease must be causing a serious public health problem over a certain period so that a change in working patterns (e.g. absenteeism) can be observed; 4) the new intervention (e.g. the vaccine) must have an immediate high uptake as well as a large and rapid impact on the disease; 5) the data registry must be adequate, of high quality, consistent over time, and easily stored and accessible; 6) and nally, the target population must be a well-de ned group. We cannot work with cultural changes over time (e.g. fathers instead of mothers suddenly becoming the main ones taking care of young children when the latter become sick). We obtained that unique combination of all these di erent factors in the database of the administrative personnel of the city of Antwerp. For instance, the fact that the data collected on absenteeism was linked to the payment condition of an employee makes the quality of the data very rich. If one of the conditional elements mentioned above is of poor quality, it automatically decreases the value of the whole investigation and the analysis. All the di erent elements are essential and none of them are more or less important Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 160than the others. So it was highly critical that all the di erent elements were present at the same time in order to t the analysis well. Having a back-of-the-envelope estimate was a very helpful tool in understanding the potential gain to be observed in the real-life database. At the beginning of the study, we were looking at all the days of work absences and all mothers with children. That was not a viable option because the speci c condition we were looking for was lost in the bigger numbers that were not related to a disease situation among children necessitating short absences from work (i.e., 5 days). It is also interesting that the observed data in the 1st year of a child's life was not so di erent from what we measured with the model. Surprisingly, it appeared that the bene t was even a little higher in real life than in the model, which could potentially be related to a higher incidence or distribution of the disease than what the model predicted or to a herd e ect in the vaccinated age group itself. What is clear from the data, however, is that a herd e ect was realized in other age groups who were unvaccinated when the vaccine was introduced, as reported in Figure 1B. The data con rmed what we observed in the RotaBIS study, in which we also observed the vaccine making a large impact as soon as it was introduced among unvaccinated age groups.[3] We know that the sample size of working mothers with a rst child was small and could be considered as a limitation of the study. However, the analysis made was the best we could made in a country where the vaccine coverage rate for rotavirus vaccines was very high from start. To our knowledge, this type of analysis is the rst one to demonstrate that speci c e ect of the RV vaccine using real-life data. The conditions of RV infection provided the opportunity for this to happen: the disease is very contagious, preferentially hits very young children, is mainly incident during a short, epidemic season every year at the same time, and occurs among small children who need care by an adult. That conditional fl ow allows comparison of work absenteeism during epidemic and non-epidemic periods. It reinforces the circumstantial evidence showing a link between the observed reduction in absenteeism and the introduction of the vaccine, but we cannot claim or prove a clear causality from the data here. There are potentially other methods for collecting the same data prospectively, but it would be di cult to attain the same quality in the nal results if one has to start from nowhere[20]. This is not a clinical trial. It is an analysis of an administrative database, in which the prospect of collecting that type of information in such a rigorous way is not obvious. It should also be clear that the overall bene t of the vaccine on a reduction in absenteeism in the workplace could be greater than what we measured here with a very speci c sub-group of working mothers (those with a 1st child). It is likely that we could observe the same bene t among working mothers with a 2nd or 3rd child who was never previously exposed to RV . Finally, will the results here discovered in this particular environment be easily transposable to other settings? Given the many conditions necessary to observe and measure the e ect of a vaccine, it is likely that in other settings other amounts of bene t will be seen. For example, the facilities needed to be easily absent from work for childhood illness must be present in other places before we can observe the same result. Chapter 4 161CONCLUSIONS Working mothers with a 1st child bene t from RV vaccination through a reduction in work absenteeism. The model estimates and the observed data t well for absences from work during the year following birth. The higher observed gain (0.88- versus 0.72-day gain) could be explained by a herd e ect of the vaccine. There is possibly an underestimate of the total gain as only a selected group (mothers with a 1st child) was investigated. In the case of the city of Antwerp, the bene t can be expressed as a cost gain per woman as a cost-bene t ratio of 1.85 (working days gained/vaccine cost). Con rmation of these results with datasets from other public organisations in Belgium is expected in the near future.

J Clin Epidemiol 2000 Jul;53(7):688-95.163COST/hyphen.caseEFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS (CEA ) AND EXPLORING FOR AL TERNATIVE APPROACHES One of the rst questions raised when I started with the health economic analysis of vaccines for developing countries using CEA, is how a decision maker can work with that result if the investment in health care in the country is low, the disease burden therefore large, while the cost-e ectiveness threshold recommended by the WHO -that is the GDP per capita-, is much too high. Under such circumstances everything done to reduce the disease burden must be very cost-e ective at quite a high price for that country. Published data about cost- e ectiveness results of rotavirus vaccination in Latin-America activated my rst suspicion that there is something bizarre with the numbers presented [25]. The analysis showed that one could ask a higher price for the vaccine in low income countries and still be cost-e ective compared with the price for low middle income countries. The point was that the authors didn't report any paradox in the analysis presented in table format. I rst analysed the same data in a graph to better understand the underlying di erence between the numbers by di erent country type. In a next step I explored how the graphs were constructed given the cost and the e ect elements that were in the analysis. One of the options was to reinvestigate the problem more in depth by making the comparison between di erent country types across the whole world and not only Latin America with a same vaccine using a same CEA technique. The di erence by country type remained at the level of the GDP per capita. I wanted to calculate the price range the vaccine will obtain for still remaining cost-e ective in countries with di erent GDP levels. I presented that exercise in the next paper [26]. An important nding of that analysis is that the CEA in countries that have already maturely invested in health care programs will have a CE-price range for a new intervention that appears reasonable. Extra -payment that can be obtained for the extra-health gain achieved is within an acceptable price band. But this approach is completely out of scope for low-income countries because the investment in health care is too low and the need much too high. Here, other techniques than CEA should be used to de ne health care priorities linked to an economic assessment that identi es priority setting, health goals to be achieved within a reasonable time and budget frame. One of the techniques I proposed to work with is using optimisation modelling. I rst explored the approach for the better positioning of the Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV) vaccine versus di erent screening frequency methods and no intervention at all. A very reasonable price level could be identi ed for emerging and high income markets such as Brazil and the UK [27]. The analysis is quite spectacular for the rich countries as for a same annual budget spent on cervical cancer prevention today but switching the screening frequency to a lower rate while spending the money saved into vaccination, the model predicts an overall bene t in reducing cervical cancer cases up to 45% per year. /five.lfExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 164But the technique of optimisation modelling can be applied under many di erent conditions and formats. I investigated the problem of a 2 versus 3 dose vaccination scheme under a xed budget for rotavirus disease, [28]. Health authorities in many countries work with xed annual budgets for their prevention programs in health care. They are sometimes exposed to new deals suggested by international bodies about changing the dosing frequency of vaccination programs. It has been suggested that for Rotarix\u00ae to be used in developing countries it may improve the \u00ae to be used in developing countries it may improve the \u00ae reduction in diarrhoea events by changing the frequency from 2 to 3 doses. When operating under a xed budget it doesn't appear obvious to go for a 3 dose scheme when the recommended dosing scheme is 2. Only under extreme circumstances or a perfect combination of 3 factors (low vaccine coverage rate, high cost di erence per dose, and high e cacy increase for the third dose), can the 3 dose program result in a better deal. In the same area of discovering new economic assessment tools for health care I was able to work closely with Dr Mark Connolly from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands from 2008 onwards. We were both looking for new ways of economic evaluation in health care that helps demonstrating where the bene t of a health gain obtained through new interventions is an added value for society instead of focussing on the individual bene t only. The approach should be especially useful for prevention activities such as vaccination. For instance if countries are su ering from a high child mortality rate because of an infectious disease such rotavirus that is a major cause of infant diarrhoea, what could be the incentive for an authority to go for that vaccination? We have the tendency to look very closely to our own silo program of mortality reduction and the Ministry of Health being the main sponsor for such an intervention for obvious reasons. But we thought that there could be additional bene t elsewhere than just having the child mortality reduced if we introduce the vaccine. If that additional bene t is identi ed elsewhere than there must be a sponsor elsewhere as well. With Dr Connolly, based on his past experience of exploring new economic approaches in the world of assisted reproduction, we developed what could be seen as an interesting approach for convincing local authorities and not only health authorities to invest in vaccination. The investment can be seen as a method to increase tax payment for the government as a mid to long term bene t if more children survive. The tax fl ow over time can be huge compared with the small investment one has to do once with vaccination of a child at birth. We fully explored that approach in one publication with Egyptian data that we were able to present to the local health administration [29]. Unfortunately the recent events that occurred in Egypt didn't give us the full chance to move forward with the project, but the initial responses we received from the health administration of that country at that time were extremely encouraging. They nally found a study with results using a language that other decision makers in their governmental organisation could understand: rate of return, net present value, among other terms that is normally used by the nance administration. This program on return on investment for vaccines received much attention from the WHO that sponsored a few other projects in low income countries in Vietnam and Ghana [30]. Chapter 5 165COMPARING COST/hyphen.caseEFFECTIVENESS RESULTS FOR THE SAME INTERVENTION ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE: WHAT CAN WE LEARN? (CEA) using country-speci c thresholds tied to gross domestic product (GDP) might not be appropriate in countries with low healthcare investment and a high disease burden as a consequence. Methods : Using data from previously published CEA of rotavirus vaccination across nine countries worldwide, we calculated the cost-neutral price (Pn) for the new intervention that refl ects the price resulting in no net increase in health care costs compared with the current situation, and the maximum price (Pm) obtained with an incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio (ICER) at the threshold value of 1 x GDP/capita. Results : In countries with low GDP/capita the paradoxical nding for rotavirus vaccination is that the Pm is much higher than in countries with a high GDP/capita. On the other hand, the Pn for the low GDP/capita countries is much lower than for high GDP/capita countries because of the low investment in health care. Conclusions : In countries with low healthcare investment and a high disease burden the di erence between the Pn and Pm for rotavirus vaccine which is the price range within which the ICER is below the WHO threshold value, is large. One reason could be that the WHO threshold value may not properly account for the local opportunity cost of health care expenditures. Therefore either alternative threshold values should be selected or alternative economic assessment tools should be considered such as budget optimisation or return on investment if we want to communicate about real economic value of new vaccines in those countries. INTRODUCTION Current economic assessment of a new medical intervention such as a drug, device, or vaccine aims to provide local decision-makers with information on the additional bene t generated for the additional cost incurred, compared with the existing situation (1;2). This is most commonly conducted using cost-e ectiveness analysis (CEA), with results expressed with incremental cost-e ectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER can be used to help de ne an acceptable \"value-based\" price range for the new intervention, with the maximum acceptable price being the price at which the ICER crosses a de ned threshold (2). The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is a well-accepted threshold measure, as proposed and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (3) (4). If the price of the new technology leads to an ICER below the threshold, that price is quali ed as being highly cost-e ective following the Netherlands; 5 RTI Health International, Research T riangle Park, North Carolina, USAExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 166CEA is a well-established economic assessment technique in healthcare (6) ; (7), (8). It was initially developed in industrialised countries with mature healthcare systems which had already made considerable investments in healthcare infrastructure. More recently, the use of CEA has been extended to economic evaluations of health interventions in developing countries. For example, CEA results for rotavirus vaccination have been reviewed in developed countries (9) and developing countries (10). These two reviews reported that the vaccine was very cost-e ective in low-income countries, but the picture was mixed in high-income countries. A similar result was reported by Rheingans et al. (2009) comparing the cost-e ectiveness and price setting of rotavirus vaccination for di erent country groups in Latin America from low income (L), via low middle (LM), to upper middle income (UM) (11). They reported that the price per vaccine dose that is cost-e ective was higher in L countries than in LM and UM countries. This is counter-intuitive, as it would be expected that the maximum price for favourable cost-e ectiveness would be lower in L countries, refl ecting the lower income and lower resources available for healthcare, compared with higher-income countries. The authors of these papers did not attempt to explain this paradoxical nding. The analysis provided here builds on these previous reports by seeking to explore how these apparently paradoxical results could arise. This paper focuses on rotavirus vaccination as an example. It is an interesting example, as the rotavirus vaccine has been the subject of CEA in a range of countries worldwide, and the bene ts obtained from the vaccine appear quite di erent in high- versus low-income countries (12). In low-income countries, the bene t of vaccination is primarily a reduction in the high mortality rate. In high- income countries, in addition to a reduced need for hospital care the bene ts are more subtle, such as better time management for working parents (11) (13). In this paper, rst a theoretical framework and interpretation of the \"value- based\" price range is presented for a new vaccine program. In the next step, an application in practice for rotavirus vaccination using published country-speci c data for rotavirus to estimate the \"value-based\" price range in nine countries was conducted. This allowed an analysis of the relationship of the \"value-based\" price range for each country and the GDP/capita. Finally, the ndings are interpreted and recommendations made for alternative/additional economic evaluations. METHODS Theoretical Framework The rst step demonstrates, using mathematical equations, the relationship between the price of a new intervention, the ICER, the threshold value for cost- e ectiveness and the cost-neutral price (Pn) and the maximum price (Pm) linked to that threshold. The relationship between the ICER and the price of a new intervention is expressed as a linear function (y = ax + b), where y (= ICER) is the dependent variable and x (= price or cost of the new intervention) is the independent variable, here the cost Chapter 5 167of the vaccine (CostV). This relationship is now considered within the context of a static cohort model for modelling the cost-e ectiveness of the intervention of the rotavirus vaccine (14). Additional equations and variables help to specify which exact parameters de ne the slope of the line (a) and which the intercept (b) that is the remaining disease cost after the impact of the new intervention divided by the di erence in disease outcomes attributable to the new intervention. Calculating the association between the price of the new intervention and the ICER allows testing the price range over which it is still cost-e ective. This is de ned here as the price range for which the ICER lies below the threshold value, de ned as 1 x GDP per capita (3). The linear function also indicates at what price the ICER equals zero (because of no di erence in total cost with the intervention compared with the total cost without the intervention). This is referred to as the cost-neutral price (Pn). The maximum price (Pm) above which a new product is no longer cost- e ective is de ned by the point where the threshold value intersects with the increasing linear function for new interventions that are more e ective but result in higher total costs than with the current health care program (see Figure 1). Now, we further elaborate on the mathematical properties of the relationship described above. In its simplest form, the relationship between the ICER and the cost (price) of a new intervention (vaccine) is de ned by the following equations: Figure 1 Cost-neutral (Pn) and maximum price (Pm) of the vaccine per dose at a threshold T (for example $40,000/life-year gained) a, slope; b, Threshold.Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 168where: CostDv: remaining disease-related cost with vaccination CostV: acquisition cost of the new intervention (vaccine) CostDNV: initial disease-related cost in the absence of vaccination (no vaccine) EV: remaining health losses (e ects) with vaccination ENV: health losses without vaccination (no vaccine) ICER: incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio a: slope of the line b: intercept T= Threshold (here de ned as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)/capita From the equations above, the slope (a) is de ned by the inverse of the e ect di erence, while the intercept (b) is de ned by the cost di erence without including CostV divided by the e ect di erence. There is one additional variable to be de ned in the equations, the vaccine impact on disease-related costs and negative health outcomes: where: V accineE ectC and V accineE ectE: the vaccine e ects on costs and negative outcomes (range of values between 0 and 1) obtained from randomised clinical trials entered into the model. For simplicity only two factors are assessed here, disease-speci c mortality (negative outcomes) and hospitalisation (costs). The output of EV and ENV is expressed in survival loss expressed in life-years, in which the di erence between the two is presented as a gain in survival time. The vaccine may have di erent e ects on costs and health outcomes in di erent elements of the disease burden. For example, the e ect of the vaccine in reducing hospitalisations, medical visits or total numbers of cases may vary, and the e ect on the total cost will depend on the frequency of each of these elements in the total cost burden. To simplify the model, in the present paper only one cost component is considered, hospitalisation. In rotavirus disease, it is normally assumed that deaths occur in hospitalised cases. Thus, in this simpli ed case that refl ects an environment with a well-established health care system, the e ects of the vaccine on costs (hospitalisations) and health outcomes (deaths) are likely to be equi-proportionate. It may be di erent in those situations where the health care system is less well developed. Hypothetical baseline modelHypothetical baseline model To illustrate this theoretical framework a model was constructed for a hypothetical developed country with a threshold value of $40,000/life-year gained, equivalent to the GDP per capita of the hypothetical country. The currency was selected as Chapter 5 169$ because international data are commonly expressed in $. The model development is based on experience obtained from rotavirus disease and the impact of paediatric rotavirus vaccination in Europe. The model assumes vaccine coverage of 100%, but the coverage rate has no impact on the ICER as long as a static epidemic model is used, because the coverage rate a ects both sides of the ratio (higher coverage results in both higher costs and higher e ect). Table I summarises the input values selected. The baseline value for CostDNV was $60/subject, calculated from data in studies in a NV was $60/subject, calculated from data in studies in a NV recent literature review (9). It represents the average cost for rotavirus hospitalisation in Europe per child in the birth cohort (i.e. the total cost of rotavirus hospitalisations averaged across all children in the cohort). As only a small percentage of children in the birth cohort will be hospitalised for rotavirus, the cost per subject is much smaller than the cost per hospitalised case or per hospitalisation event. The baseline value for ENV (0.00031/subject) is based on the following reasoning. The maximum NV (0.00031/subject) is based on the following reasoning. The maximum NV individual loss in health outcome is the loss of full life expectancy at birth (78 years, discounted at 3% per year = 31 years). That value is multiplied by the disease-speci c mortality rate (0.00001 per year) for infants in the region to estimate the individual loss in health outcomes per unvaccinated subject in the infant population. The perspective is that of the healthcare system. Figure 2 shows how the vaccine price range (Pm-Pn) can shift and change for countries with di erent cost-e ectiveness thresholds but also di erent potential gains in health outcomes resulting in a change of the slope. As the threshold value increases, Pm becomes larger. In addition, as the absolute e ect di erence becomes smaller because of a smaller disease burden in the absence of vaccination Figure 2 Cost-neutral (Pn) and maximum price (Pm) at di erent thresholds and slope lines. The green line indicates a country with a low threshold (T3), the red line a country with an intermediate threshold (T2), and the blue line a country with a high threshold (T1). As the threshold increases the cost-neutral point (where the line intercepts the X-axis) shi/ft s to the right and the slope steepens, refl ecting higher healthcare expenditure and lower remaining vaccine cost; ICER, incremental cost-e price in Low Income country; PnMC, cost neutral price in Middle income country; PnHC, cost neutral price in High income country; T , ThresholdExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 170(ENV) the slope of the line steepens. As the amount of current spend on the disease increases, Pn becomes larger. Such a situation would be expected in a high- income country (indicated by the high GDP per capita threshold value), with a low disease burden (indicated by the steeper slope) and a higher current expenditure on the disease (Pn and Pm both shifted to the right). Thus the slope of the line is likely to be steeper and the absolute di erence between Pn and Pm lower for countries with a higher GDP/capita associated with a lower disease burden and higher disease expenditures in the absence of vaccination (see Figure 2). Country-speci c dataCountry-speci c data The next step is to apply this theoretical approach to real-life published data from nine countries across the world for which the cost-e ectiveness of rotavirus vaccine has been evaluated using a similar model (15), taking the country-speci c GDP per capita as the threshold value. The model adjusts for di erent current disease-related costs and di erent vaccine impacts in high income and low income countries, and for other factors related to country-speci c conditions such as life expectancy, unit cost (expressed in $), disease management, and GDP, among others. E ects are consistently discounted at 3% per year. The same current-intervention CostDNV (hospitalisation) and ENV (disease-speci c mortality) variables are used as in the base case model. Cost variables were not discounted because of the short period (the rst 2 to 3 years) when health care expenditure on vaccination and disease-related cost occurs.

Country-speci c dataCountry-speci c data For each country, country-speci c values for the variables of current cost (CostDNV) and loss in health outcomes (ENV) were used to calculate the Pn and Pm of the vaccine at the country-speci c threshold (GDP per capita). This exercise provides a better understanding of the meaning of a cost-e ectiveness result for countries with di erent income levels, expressed through their GDP values. Table II presents the input data for each country, obtained from published sources as follows: Vietnam (16), Egypt (17), Philippines (18), Algeria (19), Turkey (20), Portugal (21), France (15), Netherlands (22), Norway (23). Life expectancy data for all countries were obtained from WHO Health Statistics 2013(24), and GDP per capita from World Bank data (25). Table II also shows the CostDNV and ENV per subject with the calculated Pn and Pm at the GDP threshold for each country. Figure 3 presents the relationship between Pm and GDP per capita across the nine countries, plotted from the data in Table II. It shows that the countries fall into two groups for the relationship between Pm and the country-speci c GDP threshold values. For the cluster of countries with a GDP per capita >$10,000, the lower the GDP threshold, the lower the Pm. In this group of countries, the slope is steep, with a fairly narrow range between Pn and Pm (see Table II).

The di erence between Norway (GDP per capita $53,396) and Portugal (GDP per capita $23,363) illustrates that e ect on Pm with a higher threshold. The Pm with one rotavirus death per year is $28.52 in Norway, considerably higher than the maximum price of $14.04 in Portugal (left-hand of the three lines for Portugal in the gure [dash-dotted line]). The three lines for Portugal illustrate the e ect of increasing the disease burden in the absence of vaccination from one rotavirus death per year (left-hand [dash-dotted] line) to two rotavirus deaths per year (middle [dashed] line) and then to three rotavirus deaths per year (right-hand [dashed] line) while assuming expenditure for the disease treatment remains constant. It can be seen that as the disease burden (number of rotavirus deaths per year) increases, as expected Pm also increases even without a change in the threshold. This is because as the disease burden at baseline increases with the increasing number of deaths, the bene t of the vaccine in reducing the disease burden will also be higher in absolute value, the slope of the line in Figure 4 will be lower and therefore the price range over which the vaccine is cost-e ective will be larger. The vaccine price range for cost-e ectiveness (Pm-Pn) is, however, much larger in Norway than in Portugal, despite a disease burden that is 1.3 times lower in Norway than Portugal. In the second cluster of countries, those with a low GDP per capita, the pattern of systematic decline of the Pm with lower GDP per capita no longer ts the data.

The slope factor is given by the equation: The slope angle is very shallow because of the high reduction in losses in health outcomes, and the Pn value is close to zero because of the low current expenditure per case for the disease and thus the potential for only minimal cost o sets. DISCUSSION An important outcome from the analyses presented in this paper is that the results for rotavirus vaccination split the countries into two clusters with di erent characteristics using the GDP per capita as a measure of distinction. Countries with a high GDP/capitaCountries with a high GDP/capita CEA has been applied mainly in higher income countries for many years now as a technique currently used to compare the value of alternative treatments and/or in combination with threshold values representing willingness to pay for an incremental unit of health as the basis for \"value-based\" pricing. It is an established method in health economic assessment to help to de ne the price at which a new intervention is considered good value for money compared with the current standard of care at the individual, most often, patient level (26) (27). Typically, a new intervention has an impact on both the cost and the e ect side in the ICER. CEA makes most sense in capturing the value of a new intervention when there is investment in healthcare for the disease of interest but with disease burden still remaining. Under such circumstances a new intervention can achieve both an important cost o set and a reasonable e ect gain. It is then meaningful to estimate a cost per life-year or quality-adjusted life year gained in relation to a pre-speci ed threshold within a price range. Such situations are likely to occur within mature healthcare markets. ICER values calculated from CEA can be useful in de ning the acceptable price range in such countries. The steeper the line in Figure 1, the narrower the price band over which the ICER moves from Pn to Pm. When Pn equals Pm, the focus of price-setting may shift from cost-e ectiveness to cost savings. The maximum price in this group of countries is strongly infl uenced by the threshold value (GDP per capita) and the remaining disease burden in the absence of vaccination. As the threshold value increases, the maximum price also increases. In addition, as the disease burden in the absence of vaccination increases, the slope of the line decreases and the maximum price increases even without a change in the threshold, as illustrated in the present analysis using Norway and Portugal as examples.Chapter 5 175Countries with low GDP/capitaCountries with low GDP/capita The situation is quite di erent when conducting CEA outside mature healthcare markets. This refl ects an environment with low existing healthcare investment (CostDNV) and high disease burden (ENV) as a consequence. The low existing healthcare expenditure on the disease allows minimal scope for cost o sets, so the Pn is close to zero. The high disease burden has the potential for large reductions in health outcome losses, so an e ective intervention can be cost-e ective (as de ned by the GDP per capita threshold) over a wide price range, because of the low slope. This wide price range within which rotavirus vaccination is cost-e ective o ers a possible explanation for the paradoxical results for rotavirus vaccination CEA reported in the literature. Reviews of rotavirus vaccination reported high cost- e ectiveness in low-income countries and a mixed picture in high-income countries (10). A study in Latin America found that the vaccine price that was apparently cost- e ective was higher in low-income countries than in middle-income countries (11). Y et it is clear that high prices are not a ordable or acceptable for low-income countries. The present analysis suggests that the apparently better cost-e ectiveness results at a relatively high intervention price in countries with low GDP per capita refl ects the large increases in health outcomes possible in such environments. In situations with high potential increases in health outcomes accompanied by low current health care expenditures, ICER values calculated by conventional CEA have limited value in de ning a reasonable price band for a new intervention. Even if the estimated ICER value indicates that a high price would be cost-e ective based on a 1x GDP threshold, the price may be rejected on the basis of the a ordability of the acquisition cost (28). A price close to the Pn is likely to be preferred by the low-income country, but as the Pn is likely to be very low (because low existing healthcare expenditure o ers minimal scope for cost o sets), such a price might not be seen as reasonable by the seller of the new intervention. Thus, if Pn and Pm de ne price bands in low-income countries that are questionable at the extremes for both payers and producers, CEA performed under these conditions might not be able to serve the same function in low-income countries as in high-income countries, where CEA is used to help de ne a reasonable price band. Although the value of $10,000 GDP per capita that di erentiates the two groups of countries in this analysis is an arbitrary threshold, it acts as a proxy for the degree of healthcare development in a country. Countries in the group with a high GDP per capita typically have well established healthcare systems with infrastructure already in place. In these countries, the xed cost of healthcare infrastructure is already accounted for and variable costs for treatment are well accepted. In these cases decisions about new interventions can be made at the margin using incremental costs and bene ts for individuals, as described in the ICER calculated by conventional CEA that assumes that prices are a fair representation of opportunity costs. Conversely, in the countries with a low GDP per capita, healthcare infrastructure may be limited and the healthcare system not yet fully developed. Because of this, prices de ned as acquisition costs may not refl ect the true opportunity cost of the intervention. In these situations, Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 176a ordability and practical considerations such as the alternative possible uses for the additional healthcare investment (including other health investments or non- health investments) are important considerations. Potential future directions Our results suggest that CEA is not necessarily the optimum economic analysis method for de ning a feasible price band for a new intervention in low-income countries (29). Measuring shadow prices could be an alternative if cost-bene t analysis or CEA are used for economic assessment of new interventions in those situations (30). In low-income environments with low health investment and a high disease burden, almost any improvement in health will require extra spending. The question therefore should be phrased not as a comparison of the new intervention with the existing situation which could be considered as a substitution economy, but as a consideration of which alternative interventions would provide the greatest additional health bene t for a given amount of extra money spent -an add-on economy instead of substitution (31). Health problems that a ect a whole population (as is often the case in low-income countries) should be assessed using economic approaches, tools or techniques that describe the problem well at the population level. In addition the impact of increased spending on health care on other sectors of the economy should be included in the analyses. Budget optimization modelling (BOM) (32) and return on investment (ROI) (17) are possible alternative economic techniques for estimating the true value of a new intervention in low-income countries. The choice of technique should be driven by the economic question asked, a good understanding of the economic problem to be solved, data availability, and the requirements of the decision-makers who need to understand and use the economic analysis. BOM is attractive when the problem is one of integrating di erent management options into a speci c health goal within certain constraints, such as budgets and/or logistics (33). Its application is not especially complicated. Furthermore, the BOM is well suited to the type of problem that needs to be addressed in low healthcare investment areas. Instead of comparing a new intervention with the existing situation, which as described here has weaknesses when applied to countries with a low GDP/capita, it considers the question of how best to optimise the use of the health investment budget available today. It is essentially a more fl exible and dynamic version of budget impact assessment. However, a limitation of budget optimisation is that it is more di cult to evaluate the e ects of uncertainty than in conventional CEA, because the e ects of varying the proportions of di erent interventions in the mix have to be taken into account, as well as uncertainty in the parameters describing each intervention. ROI analysis is also attractive. It is based on the premise that the health problem must be substantial at population level and compares di erent investment policies in terms of bene t within that population projected over time as a function of tax Chapter 5 177payment/income for the government. It can compare investment in prevention through vaccination with either doing nothing or increasing healthcare infrastructure to reach the same health bene t level. However, a limitation is that it considers health bene ts only in terms of the e ects on future tax revenues, and does not take into account intangible bene ts such as the improvement in human welfare arising from reductions in the disease burden. A further area of uncertainty is whether the average GDP per capita refl ects the right threshold value (34). First, the distribution of GDP per capita in low-income countries is often skewed, and much of the population may receive little bene t from any healthcare services o ered because they do not have access to them. This issue is not refl ected in the average per-capita GDP value, but is refl ected in the remaining health problem (ENV). For example, Egypt has a relatively high GDP per capita, close to the value reported for Algeria, while the disease burden (ENV) is high and comparable with populations such as the Philippines (see Tables II) . Second, GDP per capita does not necessarily relate to the investment a country is willing to make in healthcare, which may be a ected by other competing priorities. The present analysis has limitations. Not all the di erent costs and bene ts related to rotavirus vaccination have been included in the analysis, as the focus was only on the parameters that drive the main results, hospitalisation and mortality. However, a more detailed assessment is not likely to change the main discrepancy between the clusters of countries with high versus low income. Furthermore, the analysis has only investigated a single intervention and disease, rotavirus vaccination. The next step would be to explore whether other disease areas show similar patterns, which would indicate whether the ndings are likely to be generalizable. In conclusion, the paradoxical results of CEA in countries with low GDP per capita described in this paper, suggest that conventional CEA may have limited applicability for de ning an acceptable price range in such situations. This may be because current methods for cost-e ectiveness analyses do not properly account for the opportunity costs of the new intervention in low income countries. Alternative economic methods may be better suited to the economic assessment of healthcare interventions in low-income countries, and this should be explored in greater detail.

Decision-makers need information about choosing the most e cient dose schedule to maximise the total health gain of a population when operating under a constrained budget. The objective of this study is to identify the most e cient vaccine dosing schedule within a xed vaccination budget from a healthcare payer perspective. Methods : An optimisation model is developed in which maximizing the disease reduction is the functional objective and the constraint is the vaccination budget. The model allows variation in vaccination dosing numbers, in cost di erence per dose, in vaccine coverage rate, and in vaccine e cacy. We apply the model using the monovalent rotavirus vaccine as an example. Results : With a xed budget, a 2-dose schedule for vaccination against rotavirus infection with the monovalent vaccine results in a larger reduction in disease episodes than a 3-dose scheme with the same vaccine under most circumstances. A 3-dose schedule would only be better under certain conditions: a cost reduction of >26% per dose, combined with vaccine e cacy improvement of 5% and a target coverage rate of 75%. Substantial interaction is observed between cost reduction per dose, vaccine coverage rate, and increased vaccine e cacy. Sensitivity analysis shows that the conditions required for a 3-dose strategy to be better than a 2-dose strategy may seldom occur when the budget is xed. The model does not consider vaccine herd e ect, precise timing for additional doses, or the e ect of natural immunity development. Conclusions : Under budget constraint, optimisation modelling is a helpful tool for a decision-maker selecting the most e cient vaccination dosing schedule. The low dosing scheme could be the optimal option to consider under the many scenarios tested. The model can be applied under many di erent circumstances of changing dosing schemes with single or multiple vaccines. BACKGROUND The initial dosing schedule of a new vaccine is based on the results obtained in randomised clinical trials which evaluate the e cacy at the individual level. When real-world data on e ectiveness become available questions may be raised over whether the initial dosing schedule is the most appropriate one to achieve the maximum bene t at the population level from limited available healthcare resources. This is an interesting economic question in which the number, timing and e cacies of vaccine doses should be assessed in detail. In the analysis Baudouin A Standaert1,, Desmond Curran1*, the NetherlandsChapter 5 181presented here we evaluate the impact of a change in number of vaccine doses and the economic value of such a change under the constraint of a xed vaccine budget, a situation most likely to occur in low-income countries. We have used the monovalent rotavirus vaccine ( Rotarix \u00aea) as a concrete example as it has recently been suggested that the number of doses for this vaccine should be increased in low-income countries [1]. Rotavirus infection results in a high burden of acute gastroenteritis disease in children, especially in low-income countries, with approximately 450,000 deaths that could be prevented each year by vaccination [2]. There are currently two vaccines available against rotavirus [3], but all analyses here performed are presented with the 2-dose attenuated single \u00ae) [4;5]. In 2009 the World Health Organization recommended the inclusion of rotavirus vaccination in routine immunization programs worldwide [6]. However, trials and observational studies conducted in low-income countries have reported lower vaccine e cacy than in high-income countries [7-9]. Many hypotheses have been formulated to explain this, but no de nitive conclusions have been drawn [10;11]. Nevertheless, the morbidity and mortality impact expected in low-income countries greatly surpasses that in high-income countries, despite the lower inferred vaccine e cacy [12]. To improve the results of vaccination it has been recently suggested that adding one dose to the existing vaccine dosing schedule could improve overall vaccination e cacy [1]. However this is by no means certain as 3- dose vaccine e cacy studies with other rotavirus vaccine products tested in low-resource environments have also reported lower e cacy estimates compared with wealthier settings [13;14]. In low-income countries where healthcare budgets are tight, a 2-dose schedule could be a more e cient option than a 3-dose schedule as fewer administrations may reduce the overall vaccination cost [15]. Administration may be particularly expensive in those countries, as the costs of the logistics required to maintain a cold chain may be high [16;17]. A 2-dose schedule may also achieve improved compliance and completion of the total dosing at an earlier time point as it obviously requires fewer doses to obtain full vaccination compared with a 3-dose schedule [18]. Given the considerations above, administering an additional dose could improve the rotavirus vaccine e cacy, but it raises an economic question of whether this would provide acceptable added value. Traditional health economic analysis would calculate the incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio (ICER) to explore whether the additional dose is cost-e ective compared with the current 2-dose schedule. If the analysis indicates that the extra budget needed for reaching the extra bene t is acceptable under the local constraints, it then requires that extra budget is found to secure the implementation of this new intervention. However, in low-income countries there may be no extra budget available to administer the additional vaccine dose even if it would be cost-e ective. In such environments, Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 182the addition of an extra vaccine dose may be possible only at the expense of cuts elsewhere in the xed budget. Conversely, it may be possible to improve the clinical results by increasing the vaccine coverage rate without adding an extra dose. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to consider a di erent economic approach and to compare the clinical outcomes obtained with a 2-dose schedule with a higher vaccine coverage rate versus the clinical outcomes obtained with a 3-dose schedule at a higher vaccine e cacy but a lower coverage rate. In other words, given a xed budget, when would it be e cient to move to a 3-dose strategy? The solution to this question is no longer driven by a cost-e ectiveness threshold but by the xed budget: what is the best way to spend money under a xed budget in order to obtain a maximum health bene t? This type of question can best be analysed at the population level (accumulated bene t and cost), in contrast to cost-e ectiveness analysis that can be assessed at the individual level. It also seems to be a realistic way for local decision-makers to evaluate the bene t of vaccination strategies [19]. In this paper we evaluate the potential cost and health e ect of adding a third dose to the existing 2-dose schedule of the monovalent rotavirus vaccine in low- income countries, using a hypothetical model to explore this. The model uses optimisation theory, in which a wide range of scenarios are explored to nd the optimum solution under budget constraint. In sensitivity analysis, we investigate the infl uence of several variables on the results, including vaccine e cacy, coverage rate, and price per dose. METHODS The economic question raised in the introduction, \"what is the best way to spend a xed budget to obtain the maximum health bene t from vaccination?\" can best be explored using optimisation or mathematical programming models [20]. The exercise is to reach speci c (functional) objectives or goals under certain constraints. In this setting, the objective function is to maximise health bene ts. The model has been programmed to evaluate just one particular disease with one intervention type, but di erent diseases with di erent interventions assessing a same outcome could be considered as well. In the particular case of rotavirus disease, the outcome measure, used to assess the bene t, is the total number of diarrhoea events in the population of children aged <5 years, and the objective is to minimise the number of such events. As a direct consequence of this, mortality and hospitalisation rates due to rotavirus disease would also be reduced. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with an annual budget, estimating events per year in the at-risk population at steady-state. The latter typically refl ects the situation when disease spread and vaccine e cacy have reached their equilibrium across the entire at-risk population. The model constraints are: Annual vaccination budget is xed; V accine e cacy for a 3-dose strategy than that for a 2-dose strategy; V accine e cacy for a 3-dose strategy < 150% of that for a 2-dose strategy;Chapter 5 183 Cost per dose for a 3-dose strategy < than that for a 2-dose strategy; The model assumes a xed cost per dose for the administration and for the logistics to maintain the cold chain. The coverage rate allows a variation between 0% and 100%. No discounting is applied as it concerns a budget analysis. The model construct is developed in Microsoft Excel , using additional Solver tools (Frontline Systems, Inc.) from software speci cally designed to be integrated as an add-in into Microsoft Excel . The results of the optimisation model indicate which strategy (i.e. a 2- or 3-dose strategy) would produce maximum health bene ts under a budget constraint. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the healthcare payer system. A copy of the model is available as a Microsoft Excel spread sheet (see Additional-File-1.xls). As the current exercise is hypothetical we do not apply it to a speci c country. The whole analysis is focussed on the relationships between the critical variables and their relative values. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying three key parameters that a ect the results, vaccine e cacy, price, and coverage. The relationships between the variables are as follows: the number of overall diarrhoea events avoided by a 2-dose schedule (y) is a function of the vaccine coverage rate (a), the vaccine e cacy (x) obtained, and the disease population incidence rate (i): y = a * x * i The increment (c) to reach the objective function (maximising the reduction in diarrhoea events) with a 3-dose schedule is a function of the change in the vaccine coverage rate (a1) and the extra vaccine e cacy (x1) obtained, compared with a 2-dose schedule, while the population incidence rate remains unchanged: y + c = [(a + a1) * (x + x1)] * i The change in coverage rate (a1) was assumed dependent on the relative price di erence per dose between a 2- and a 3-dose vaccine schedule, given a xed budget for vaccination. There will automatically be a link with the reduction in vaccine coverage rate, if the price di erence per dose and per vaccine scheme decreases, as an increase in the vaccine e cacy (x1) is then required for the 3-dose schedule to keep its advantage over the 2-dose schedule. Sensitivity analysis should demonstrate what price di erence, what vaccine coverage rate, or what vaccine e cacy di erence would be required to achieve a change in the preference between the two dosing schedules. In addition, the change in health outcomes will a ect the overall management cost of the disease. Changes in vaccine coverage rate and/or vaccine e cacy would be expected to a ect the cost drivers for overall disease management costs, such as hospitalisation rate. To address this, we add an evaluation of the budget change for overall disease Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 184management as a relative value to the xed budget for vaccination as an additional output variable in the sensitivity analysis. RESUL TS Analysis with xed dataAnalysis with xed data Tables 1 and 2 provide an example to illustrate the model. Table 1 shows the input data and Table 2 the modelled outputs. This hypothetical example assumed an annual birth cohort of 10,000 children who could be vaccinated. Based on the assessment of disease burden and the nancial priorities, the health ministry is assumed to have allocated an annual budget of $200,000 for rotavirus vaccination. The annual incidence rate of rotavirus diarrhoea without vaccination was set at 0.3 per child per year for the at-risk period (from birth up to age 5 years) of the birth cohort, thus an average of 3,000 children per year would be expected to develop diarrhoea without vaccination.

With a target coverage rate of 75%, the cost of vaccination was estimated at $195,000 (=10,000*0.75*$26) which represents 97.5% of the total available vaccination budget. As such, there would be su cient budget (i.e. the budget would not be exceeded) and the target coverage rate would be reached. Assuming a vaccine e cacy of 60%, 900 of the 7,500 children in the vaccinated part of the cohort would be expected to develop diarrhoea, in addition to 750 of the 2,500 children in the unvaccinated part of the cohort, yielding a total of 1,650 diarrhoea cases. Thus, the health bene t gained by vaccination with a 2-dose schedule would be a reduction of 1,350 diarrhoea cases (a reduction of 45%) for the full birth cohort, compared with no vaccination (Table 2). Under strategy B (nb =3), the cost per dose was set to $10 and thus the cost per course of vaccination was $30 (=$10*3). With the same target coverage rate of 75%, the total cost of vaccination would be $225,000 (=10,000*0.75*$30), representing 112.5% of the vaccination budget. Thus, there would be insu cient budget (a shortfall of $25,000). This shortfall implies that the budget would have Chapter 5 185run out with 833 children among the targeted population still to be vaccinated ($25,000/$30 = 833), and thus the available budget would be su cient to vaccinate 6,667 children. Assuming a vaccine e cacy for the 3-dose schedule of 65%, 700 of the 6,667 children in the vaccinated part of the cohort would still develop diarrhoea, in addition to 1,000 of the 3,333 children in the unvaccinated part of the cohort, yielding a total of 1,700 diarrhoea cases. Thus, the health bene t gained by vaccination using a 3-dose schedule would be a reduction of 1,300 diarrhoea cases (a reduction of 43.3%), compared with no vaccination (Table 2). Comparing the two strategies, although the cost per dose was 23% lower with a 3-dose schedule (strategy B), the cost per course was higher ($30 vs $26). The 2-dose schedule (strategy A) was not only cheaper overall ($195,000 vs. $200,000), but also resulted in a greater reduction in diarrhoea events (45% vs 43.3%), despite having a lower vaccine e cacy than the 3-dose schedule. This is because the lower cost per course with the 2-dose schedule would allow more children to be vaccinated within the available allocated budget.

Consistent with the illustrative example shown in Table 2, with a 2-dose schedule a 45% reduction in diarrhoea events would be observed at a cost of 97.5% of the vaccination budget. Allowing the cost per dose for strategy B to vary, the gure illustrates that a large cost di erence per dose of >33.3% would be required before the 3-dose schedule would become less costly; this occurs at the point at which the dash dotted line (- . -) crosses the dashed line (- -). A high cost di erence per dose (>25.9% cheaper) would also be required for the 3-dose schedule to achieve a larger reduction in diarrhoea events than the 2-dose schedule; this occurs when the dotted line (...) crosses the solid line. Thus, a 2-dose vaccine schedule would always be the better choice when the relative cost di erence does not exceed 25.9%. There is a small area between a cost di erence per dose of 25.9% and 33.3% where a larger reduction in diarrhoea events would be observed at a total vaccination cost within the xed budget using the 3-dose strategy, while still remaining at the vaccine coverage rate of 75%. This area varies depending on other factors such as the vaccine e cacy di erence. In situations where the 3-dose vaccine is cheaper, no additional reduction in diarrhoea events would be observed above the targeted vaccine coverage rate of 75%. Figure 2 shows the e ect of adding a treatment cost for a diarrhoea event, set at $50 per event, to estimate an overall cost for disease management (vaccination plus the cost of treating cases) with a vaccination cost of $195,000. For example, in Table 2, 1,650 cases of diarrhoea would be expected to occur with the 2-dose schedule, and the cost of treating these cases would be $82,500 (=1,650*$50). The total cost of the 2-dose strategy A would therefore be $277,500 (vaccine cost of $195,000 + cost of treating cases of $82,500). This value is 42.3% higher than the vaccination budget. Thus, under strategy A, assuming a vaccine e cacy of 60% a 45% reduction in diarrhoea events (solid line) could be achieved at a total disease management cost of 42.3% (dashed line) over the vaccination budget. Assuming a vaccine e cacy of 90%, a 67.5% reduction in diarrhoea events (solid line) could be achieved at a total disease management cost of 25% (dashed line) over the vaccination budget. In Figure 2, it may appear counter-intuitive that a higher vaccine e cacy is needed with a 3-dose strategy versus a 2-dose vaccination strategy to obtain the same overall result. This refl ects the higher vaccine coverage rate that can be achieved with a 2- dose vaccine strategy under budget constraint. In addition, the total budget would always be lower with a 2-dose schedule than with a 3-dose schedule when the di erence in price per dose is lower than 33.3% (as shown in Figure 1 and discussed above). Figure 3 demonstrates the e ect of target coverage rate on the budget increment and the avoided diarrhoea events. On the left-hand side of the graph, where the target coverage rate is low, there would be su cient budget for both strategies. Thus, the 3-dose strategy would prevent more cases (due to its higher e cacy) but at a higher cost. The cost for the 3- dose strategy (dash-dotted line) would exceed that for the 2-dose strategy (dashed line) at all coverage rates modelled. However, as coverage increases the number of events prevented by the 2-dose strategy (solid line) would Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 188overtake the number of events prevented by the 3-dose strategy (dotted line). This is because the maximum coverage rate achievable within the xed budget would be higher for the 2-dose schedule (75%) than for the 3-dose schedule (66.7%). Thus, on the right-hand side of the graph where target coverage is high, the 2-dose schedule would prevent more cases than the 3-dose schedule at a lower cost. DISCUSSION The results of the modelling exercise presented here indicate that when the vaccination budget is constrained a 2-dose schedule for vaccination against rotavirus infection with the monovalent rotavirus vaccine would be expected to produce a larger reduction in disease events than a 3-dose schedule in most circumstances when using the same vaccine. This refl ects the higher coverage rate that can be achieved with a 2-dose schedule than with a 3-dose schedule within a xed budget. According to the model the 3-dose schedule would produce results superior to the 2-dose schedule only under the following conditions: large improvement in vaccine e cacy for the 3- dose schedule compared with the 2-dose schedule; large reduction in cost per dose for the 3-dose schedule compared with the 2-dose schedule; low target vaccine coverage rate. The e ects of these parameters are closely intertwined. So a situation in which the 3-dose strategy would become superior to the 2-dose strategy may be achieved by a large change in one parameter alone, or by smaller changes in several parameters in combination. We will discuss each parameter separately. A study in Africa reported vaccine e cacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis of 63.7% for a 3-dose schedule and 58.7% for a 2-dose schedule [21], a di erence Figure 3 E ect of target vaccine coverage rate on total cost and e ect T otal cost (right Y-axis) and e ect (reduction in diarrhoea events, le/ft Y-axis) as a function of target vaccine coverage rate. Assumptions: vaccine budget, $200,000; 2-dose vaccine e cacy (strategy 3-dose vaccine e cacy (strategy B), 65%; 2-dose vaccine cost per dose (strategy A), $13.00; 3-dose vaccine cost per dose (strategy B), $10.00; target vaccine coverage, allowed to vary.Chapter 5 189of 5 percentage points. However, it remains uncertain whether adding an extra dose truly improves the overall vaccine e cacy, as 3-dose vaccine e cacy studies using other vaccine products / candidates in low-resource environments have also reported lower e cacy estimates than in wealthier settings [13;14]. The di erence in vaccine e cacy in our model was similar to the di erence observed in the African study (65% versus 60%). Our results indicated that this magnitude of improvement in e cacy with the 3-dose strategy would result in an overall health gain (fewer diarrhoea events) compared with the 2-dose schedule only with a cost per dose for the 3-dose schedule of at least 25.9% lower than the cost per dose for the 2-dose schedule. The exact value will vary depending on the absolute vaccine e cacy values used, the budget available and the vaccine coverage rate, and thus will vary according to local circumstances. The smaller the gain in vaccine e cacy, the larger the cost di erence per dose required. V accine prices are often negotiated according to the total number of doses ordered by a country. An order for 60,000 doses intended to implement a 3-dose strategy covering 20,000 people may vary relatively little in price compared with an order also for 60,000 doses intended to implement a 2-dose strategy covering 30,000 people. Use of a budget optimisation tool may help decision-makers to identify the optimal strategy in their local environment, taking into account any changes in price as well as the expected change in vaccine e cacy and coverage. The results presented here suggest that a 2-dose schedule is likely to be the optimal strategy, due to a higher vaccine coverage rate that the given budget allows. However, the vaccination budget is not the only factor infl uencing coverage rates. Other factors may include education, religious beliefs, attitudes to complementary and alternative medicine, gender-based inequity, civil unrest, the percentage of the population living in urban versus rural areas, accessibility of vaccination and other healthcare programmes, and nancial factors [22-25]. Such issues are not insurmountable and high vaccine coverage rates can be achieved in low-income countries, as illustrated by high 3-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis coverage rates in Kenya, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka [26]. Other interventions beyond the vaccination programme may be needed to improve the coverage rate, such as health education, better transportation, reduction in communication barriers to vaccinations, outreach to religious leaders and nancial incentives. Many studies have investigated the problem of optimal vaccine dosing schedules. Some have addressed the question from the opposite direction, evaluating whether a smaller number of doses can achieve the same clinical outcomes. For example, a 2-dose-plus-booster schedule for pneumococcal vaccination is accepted as having similar e cacy to a 3-dose-plus-booster schedule [27]. In the present analysis, as the e ectiveness of the 2-dose rotavirus vaccine appears to be reduced in low-income countries the relevant question is whether adding one dose could improve clinical results. The strength of the model presented here is that it explicitly recognises the reality of a xed budget. Adding an extra dose requires increasing the number of doses per vaccinee. Under a xed budget this either requires an equivalent reduction in price to cover the same number Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 190of people or a corresponding reduction in coverage, or a combination of the two. An optimisation model can explore the question of whether increasing vaccine e cacy by adding an extra dose, or increasing coverage by using a 2-dose schedule, would be the best strategy to maximise the population health gains. It can also quantify the extra budget that would be required to achieve a larger health gain, providing a transparent method of assessing the best strategy for managing disease burden. The model presented here could be applied to any question about the optimal dose schedule for any vaccine. For instance, the potential switch from a 2-dose to a 1-dose schedule for hepatitis A in Latin America is an important decision that requires careful choice of the optimal administration schedule [28]. The modelling exercise outlined here could provide useful guidance on this question that may be helpful for decision-makers. Additional re nements may be needed, as the present analysis did not use a dynamic model and did not consider the potential e ect of an additional vaccine dose on herd protection, or di erential waning rates for a 1-dose versus a 2-dose vaccine. The model is simple in its construction and therefore has some limitations. For example, it does not take account of herd e ects which may be important when considering the impact of changes in coverage. The higher coverage achievable with a 2-dose schedule compared with a 3-dose schedule within a xed budget may lead to greater herd protection and thus to a larger di erence in health bene t than estimated in the present model. Furthermore, the model does not cover changes in the timing of doses, e ects of disease spread before the nal dose, or natural immunity. In the case of rotavirus infection, natural immunity that develops with repeated infections is a competitor to vaccine-induced immunity, leading to a progressive reduction in the scope for vaccination to provide protection over time [29]. The model also does not take account of factors such as logistics and access to healthcare facilities to administer the additional dose[16]. However, in case of working under a xed budget and increasing the number of doses per person, extra administration cost could be limited as a same person who already received vaccine doses will get an additional one. Things could be dramatically di erent with the reduction of the number of doses per person. The extra administration cost could then be much higher than in the previous situation because one has to reach additional people (increase the coverage rate) with the extra doses available. Finally, we opted for a limited perspective in the analysis, namely the health care payer. We thought that essentially these people are most interested in the results when operating under a xed budget. The societal perspective would only indicate that if a lower vaccine coverage rate was achieved with a 3-dose program, the societal cost could increase. The optimisation approach here presented is very di erent from cost-e ectiveness analysis. Cost-e ectiveness analysis estimates the incremental cost per unit of incremental bene t to calculate an ICER value, and compares it with a threshold value considered to represent acceptable cost-e ectiveness. However, to be meaningful Chapter 5 191this threshold must be locally de ned, taking account of local circumstances. If the threshold is uncertain, the estimated ICER for an intervention may be of limited value in making a decision. Even if the threshold value is accepted, the ICER may not take account of infrastructure expansions required to implement an intervention. For example, a vaccination programme requiring a large increase in cold-chain capacity could be challenging for low-income countries, which in turn could result in a delay to vaccine introduction with consequences for expected health outcomes. Furthermore, an intervention requiring a substantial increase in expenditure - as may be likely with mass population interventions such as vaccination - may exceed the budget available, in which case it may be impractical to implement no matter how favourable the ICER. The biggest di erence between a cost-e ectiveness analysis and an optimisation modelling is that in the latter it can take into account the coverage rate as an important variable to reach a certain health goal. In a cost-e ectiveness analysis with a static model the vaccine coverage rate may not infl uence the ICER per se. This is di erent for a budget impact analysis where the vaccine uptake expressed through the coverage rate will impact the budget cycles. However budget impact analysis only informs about the nancial spread over time and is not particularly linked to the goal or objective to be achieved within a de ned period as optimisation modelling is pursuing. Optimisation modelling, as presented in the exercise here, is clearer and simpler to understand [19]. Instead of a threshold value, it identi es the strategy that o ers the largest health gain (in the case of a preventive intervention, the lowest number of disease events) within a xed budget. This more closely refl ects the reality of healthcare decisions. The number of available healthcare interventions continually increases, yet national healthcare budgets are not unlimited. It can be applied to simple problems such as the comparison between a 2-dose and 3-dose schedule for rotavirus vaccination illustrated here, or more complex issues such as human papillomavirus vaccination [20]. We may even consider the assessment of di erent vaccines against di erent diseases in order to prioritize their indication within a clear budget and time frame such as a multi-year vaccine portfolio management program[30]. Further research will be valuable to re ne the simple model described here to take account of more complex issues such as herd protection e ects or multi-criteria decision analysis designs. CONCLUSION Optimisation modelling indicates that within a xed budget and for the monovalent rotavirus vaccine, a 2-dose vaccine schedule would be expected to provide better health outcomes in most circumstances than a 3-dose schedule. The model can be used to quantify the conditions of changing dose schedules that would be optimal for any vaccine. It is a more transparent and powerful technique than the more conventional cost-e ectiveness analysis for evaluation of the economic questions faced by decision-makers, because it explicitly recognises the budget constraint that is a reality in most healthcare systems around the world.

The assumption being that increased childhood survival in vaccinated cohorts leads to increased numbers of children consuming government resource, and an increased number of future tax payers. Methods : The model framework adopts the Egyptian government perspective for RV immunization costs and all government transfers (eg: education costs, health costs, pensions). To refl ect the government tax revenue we applied a xed income tax burden to earnings over the lifetime of vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. At each year of the model we derive net taxes (gross taxes less transfers) discounted to the immunization year to refl ect the present value of investment costs. Results : Lifetime discounted cash fl ows for RV vaccinated and unvaccinated birth cohorts are LE 62,666 million and LE 62,627 million, respectively, at year- 25. At year-50 net tax revenues were LE 274,149 million and LE 273,765 million for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively. The internal rate of return for government based on RV vaccination at year-25 and year-50 was 10.6% and 14.9%, respectively. Within the rst ve years of vaccination small health service cost-savings were achieved attributed to reduced RV-related gastroenteritis cases. Conclusions : The government perspective is useful for evaluating investments in RV vaccination because of ongoing government transfers and tax receipts attributed to changes in RV attributed morbidity and mortality. Using this approach we illustrate both short-term cost advantages, and long-term economic advantages attributed to RV vaccination. BACKGROUND Investments in health have shown to be one of the most important human capital determinants that infl uence economic growth and development, of which vaccines likely play a signi cant role [1-3]. Previous analyses have estimated an internal rate of return from investments in vaccination programs ranging between 12% and 18% [1;2]. Investments in vaccination not only save lives, reduce su ering, and contribute to economic growth, but they also lead to direct savings in healthcare costs worth millions of dollars every year [3]. Recognizing the important public health bene ts and economic advantages of vaccination Mark University, Phoenix, 195programs, the WHO has included vaccines against communicable diseases in the list of essential medicines [4]. The economic bene ciaries of improved health are worth considering in the context of health investments. In most cases the individuals themselves and society as a whole will bene t from improved health. This is attributed to several factors including wage increases, and indirectly through improved educational opportunities infl uencing future earnings [1;2;5]. Additionally, governments can also be infl uenced by population health, whereby poor health has the capacity to increase government expenditure in health care and social programs as well as reduce tax-receipts from fewer individuals working [6]. Conversely, the same would be true as economies expand because of improved population health, all things equals, governments will receive more tax revenue [7]. The above observations suggest that it may be in the interest of governments to think carefully about healthcare expenditure to optimise economic growth and sustaining public nances [8]. V accination programs can positively infl uence macroeconomic and microeconomic parameters. Meanwhile the analytical framework commonly used to value health technologies including vaccines mostly ignores the relationship between health investment, human capital, and the economy overall [9;10] Rather emphasis is placed on cost-e ectiveness analysis where outcomes are expressed using quality- adjusted life years (QALY s) that have a questionable, tangible economic value. A recent review has summarised the weakness of the frameworks normally used for valuing vaccines citing outcome-related productivity gains, behaviour-related productivity gains, and community externalities are often unaccounted for in the evaluations of immunization programs [11] This is particularly relevant to economic studies of rotavirus (RV) where indirect costs can represent 25-80% of total RV costs [12]. In the developed and developing world RV poses a signi cant humanistic and economic burden, however they are di erent. There are more health care costs and fewer deaths in the developed world. But the annual deaths in children 5 years of age worldwide caused by RV infection are estimated to be 352,000-592,000 per year, with signi cant economic consequences [13;14] Considering the high mortality and resources used to treat RV gastroenteritis, it is likely that changes in RV attributed gastroenteritis epidemiology will have signi cant economic consequences. In this study we explore new investment in RV prevention strategies considering two perspectives: (1) societal and (2) governmental. The underlying premise of the governmental perspective is that changes in RV related morbidity and mortality will increase the number of children utilising government resources, as well as increased numbers of working adults, and future tax payers. Investments in vaccines o er both short and long term economic bene ts. Furthermore, the bene ts will accrue to di erent elements of society depending on the time period considered. For example, in the short-term, families and the health service are likely to bene t from reduced RV attributed gastroenteritis. Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 196However, over time, the government more broadly can bene t from increased survival, increased working-aged populations increasing numbers of tax payers. To refl ect how the economic perspective changes over time we construct a model that considers both the governmental perspective, and the societal perspective based on RV vaccine investments. The analysis described here is a continuation of a previously reported economic analysis that evaluated healthcare costs in Egypt attributed to RV vaccination from the health service perspective [15] MATERIALS AND METHODS RV vaccination has been shown to saves lives; therefore we sought to estimate how lives saved can infl uence future government expenditure on social programs such as health, education, and pension costs, as well as infl uencing future tax receipts. This is referred to as the \"government perspective\" analysis and requires constructing a model that refl ects the life course of average Egyptian citizens taking into consideration average schooling, employment, marriage, wages, pension costs, etc. The model was also constructed to refl ect the societal perspective. To refl ect the government and societal perspectives we combine three modelling approaches. Namely, budget impact analysis of RV health costs, human capital modelling based on lives saved and lost productivity, and generational accounting which accounts for a range of other government scal transfers to citizens such as education, non-RV health costs and pension costs [16-18] The integrated modelling framework allows us to consider ongoing costs that arise from saving lives attributed RV vaccination, as well as the future tax-receipts attributed to children that would have died in the absence of vaccination. Within this framework, lives saved from the government perspective are not only a cost, but also a future revenue source. Model designModel design The model considers hypothetical RV vaccinated and unvaccinated birth cohorts [19]. For each cohort, the costs and consequences associated with di erences in RV related gastroenteritis were estimated. Considering the high RV mortality in Egypt for children <5 this approach was deemed appropriate for comparing RV investment costs that infl uence birth cohorts.[14]. Furthermore, the approach allows for comparing the average life course of children receiving RV vaccination with the life course of cohorts without vaccination to evaluate RV investment costs versus no vaccination. Annual adjustments to the birth cohort for RV speci c deaths between ages 0-5 year are made based on local epidemiology, and non-RV related deaths from ages 0-100 based on existing life table data [20]. In contrast to most budget impact models that typically complete the analysis ve years post-vaccination [21], we attempted to account for ongoing government transfers attributed to vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts by extending the analysis for 72 years, the average lifetime of an Egyptian citizen. This is particularly relevant considering the survival bene ts attributed to RV vaccination. From the surviving vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort we estimated government transfers Chapter 5 197for education and health expenditure up until the average age of starting work in Egypt at age 15. Throughout the lifetime, per capita expenditure on education and health is used to estimate the economic impact of vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts on government accounts. Rotavirus epidemiology Rotavirus epidemiology We calculated incidence rates for children 0-3 years old based on data collected in 4 areas; Abu Homos, Benha, Cairo, and Fayoum, which represent a mix of rural, urban, and sub-urban settings and reported previously [22]. The peak incidence of infection occurs at approximately 10 months of age, which falls within the reported range for the worldwide average peak incidence of between 4 and 36 months [23]. The average incidence for this period was calculated to be 0.19 episodes per child-year. The probability that RV related death would result in children less than ve was 0.0018 estimated using a combination of local data and published methodology [24]. Health costs The costs attributed to non-fatal RV cases were accounted for in the model based on previously reported care-seeking behaviour and treatment costs in Egypt [15]. The costs of care were applied to four di erent RV health states and treatment scenarios: (1) no treatment; (2) outpatient treatment; (3) hospitalization; and (4) death. Cost of care was based on actual costs accrued by the patients at two hospitals, Benha and Abu Homos, that participated in previously described studies [15] The average cost of hospitalization due to RV , 102 LE, at these two hospitals was used since the former is rural and the latter is peri-urban and Egypt has an even mix of these treatment centres. Both hospitals calculated the same average cost for outpatient care of 23.3 LE. Every year following RV we accounted for healthcare costs, infl ated from the base year to derive the rotavirus budget impact similar to the approach used by other authors [12;21]. Costs attributed to non-RV related health costs over the lifetimes of the RV vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts were also included in the analysis. The model utilises per capita government costs to which we apply a standard function to account for lower healthcare expenditure in younger ages and higher expenditure in elderly persons. Costs in the base year were LE127 based on 1995 estimates and infl ated every year in the model. However, previous studies have noted that per capita investment costs have not increased signi cantly over past decade [25;26]. The impact of growth in public health costs were assessed in the sensitivity analysis. RV coverage and e cacyRV coverage and e cacy In the analysis it was assumed that RV vaccination would be administered within the existing national immunization program because RV can be piggy-backed onto the current Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus and (DPT) vaccination schedules. Costs are based on two dose administrations delivered within the rst year of life. Similar to the model described by Ortega et al , we assume vaccination of the birth cohort of 1,909,000 children in the rst year with 98% coverage. No Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 198adjustment for early mortality was made so this likely over estimates vaccination costs as a proportion of children would have died before being vaccinated. The impact of vaccination acquisition costs is explored in the sensitivity analysis. RV e cacy was based on previously published studies [27], and estimates applied in previous Egyptian modelling studies [15]. The vaccine price for two injections used in the base analysis was LE154 with low price (LE98) and high price (LE210) points assessed in the model. Wages and taxesWages and taxes The human capital component of the model uses the combined male/female age- speci c wages applied to vaccinated and unvaccinated survivors over their working life (age 15-65). Consistent with the generational accounting methodology wages are infl ated over time based on increases in productivity. Earnings are adjusted based on current unemployment rates in Egypt and held constant over the lifetime of the model. Information on average earnings is obtained from the Egyptian Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). The unemployment rate currently approximately 9% is held constant over the lifetime of the model [28]. Based on current income tax bands and tax receipts a xed proportional tax burden of 12% was applied to earnings in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts [29]. An adjustment for tax compliance of approximately 65% was performed [30]. To refl ect the possibility that RV may disproportionately a ect those from lower socioeconomic groups, and consequently lower wages and tax compliance, we performed a sensitivity analysis based on lowering tax compliance to 20%. Applying a xed tax burden to salaries likely underestimates total tax burden. Income tax only represents 15% of total government revenues and ignores consumption taxes, stamp duties and other levies [29]. Average weekly wages for public and private workers are LE327 [28]. Public Pensions Public pensions costs based on 90% coverage were applied at retirement aged. Public pension bene t was calculated to start at age 60 years for RV vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts based on current pension bene ts and infl ated over time [31]. Productivity lossesProductivity losses The societal cost was refl ected by accounting for time o work for parents based on average wage rates [28] Consistent with previous investigators, we assume two days lost productivity for the parent per RV case [32;33]. Lost productivity costs are only applicable in the rst year ve. Discounted net taxes Every year after birth the model estimates age-speci c government transfers and age-speci c gross taxes for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. At every age the di erence between gross transfers and gross taxes are used to derive discounted net tax contributions. The valuation method is based on discounted cash fl ows to estimate the attractiveness of an investment based on the present value of the investment and resulting nancial consequences attributed to the investment. Chapter 5 199In the early stages of life RV vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts are net recipients of government transfers and tax contributions are zero, consequently the net tax is negative. From the age of birth to commencing employment, the accumulated net taxes remain negative. As the child ages and enters working age gross taxes increase and government transfers are negligible. RV vaccine costs are evaluated as an investment costs for government expenditure at year 0 for the birth cohort. To refl ect the present value of the investment we calculate the net present value (NPV) of RV investment costs and all subsequent government transfers and taxes over the lifetime of the birth cohort as follows. Rt = Sum of gross taxes paid by cohort Et = Sum of age-speci c direct government expenditure per cohort over lifetime (e.g., education, healthcare, pension) r = Rate of discount T = Life expectancy K0= vaccine purchasing costs at birth age (0) To assess the present value of RV investments costs for government we assess the pro tability index (PI) as follows: Present value future cash fl ows/Initial investment = PI. The standard convention for interpreting PI is that ratios of 1.0 are the lowest acceptable measure, and values lower than 1.0 indicate the project's present value is less than the initial investment. The internal rate of return (IRR) from positive and negative cash fl ows was also estimated. Timeframe In the short-term (5 years) we assess the societal perspective taking into consideration RV treatment costs, and lost productivity of parents caring for children. Over longer time horizons the government perspective is assessed to the average life-expectancy of 72 years to assess the sustained economic e ects of RV vaccination. Results Annualised discounted societal costs for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort are shown in Figure 1. From the societal perspective, costs increase in year-1 attributed to vaccine acquisition costs. However in subsequent years, costs in the vaccinated cohort decrease from reduced RV related gastroenteritis direct medical costs and indirect costs associated with improved productivity. From the societal perspective, the net present value (NPV) of vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts at 5-years was -LE1,334 million and -LE1,269 million, respectively, with an incremental NPV of -LE 65 million. In the rst ve years of life di erences between the societal and government perspective models are minimal; therefore, only societal perspective data are presented.

Discounted net tax revenue from the vaccinated cohort is greater than unvaccinated cohorts with incremental net tax revenues at year-25, year-50, and year-72 of LE28 Million, LE384 Million, and 364 Million, respectively (Table II.). The pro tability index and IRR from the government perspective associated with investing in RV vaccination are also shown in Table II. Under di erent time horizons evaluated, the pro tability index is greater than 1.0 and the IRR at all three time points is greater than discount rate proposed by Egyptian National Bank of 8.5%. In the government perspective model, the discounted future cash fl ows associated with implementation of RV vaccine becomes positive after the birth cohort reaches the age of 22 years (Figure 2). At age 22 (payback) all government transfers to the vaccinated cohort for education and health, including vaccination costs, have been Chapter 5 201paid for by net taxes paid by the cohort. The discounted future cash fl ow starts to become negative as cohorts retire and draw public pensions at age 60. Sensitivity analysisSensitivity analysis The univariate sensitivity analyses for di erences in RV incidence, mortality and vaccine price are described in Table III. In the low price scenario and with increased RV incidence, the NPV for RV vaccination becomes positive at age 4 due to direct and indirect costs saved that cover resources spent on vaccine. Expected NPV under the worst case scenario including reductions in RV incidence, reduced RV mortality and high vaccine pricing, turns positive after vaccinated individuals become 32 years. Under the worst case assumptions individuals need to work approximately 10 years longer in order to o set vaccination costs compared to base case. Altering tax compliance to 20% lowered discounted net tax revenues to LE79,889 million and LE79,821 million in vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, and increased the payback age to 35. DISCUSSION Few people would dispute the bene ts of investing in health and its impact on human capital. Despite the fact that human capital formation is directly infl uenced by investments in health, the analytical framework often used for evaluating health programs often ignores the relationship between health and human capital. Instead, measurement tools consistent with welfare economics such as health state preferences and health-related quality of life have become the preferred tools for valuing health gains [9]. Generational accounting is an informative tool used by governments to assess the impact of policy changes on intergenerational tax burden [17]. Furthermore, Figure 1 Cumulative government expenditure and tax revenue for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in Egypt with cumulative discounted net present value projected to base year. NPV= net present value RTV = rotavirus vaccineExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 202Figure 2 Time-dependent univariate sensitivity analysis for the rotavirus vaccinated cohort at 25, 50 and 72 years. CI = con dence interval; NPV= net present value; RV= rotavirus of mounting scal challenges posed by ageing populations in many countries, the GA framework has been advocated for modelling budgetary implications of social expenditure [34]. In this study we employ a modi ed GA framework to assess discrete investments in health programs to understand the ongoing nancial impact of a health investment on government accounts resulting in signi cant changes in RV morbidity and mortality. While Egypt is not experiencing an ageing population, the consequences of introducing RV could save thousands of children every year that will pose di erent nancial pressures for government. Furthermore, similarly to results obtained with GA, it is important to recognise that the results described here based on investments in RV do not refl ect precise forecast of the future. Rather, they refl ect a potential scal scenario based on prevailing macroeconomic conditions and the interaction of these variables over time [35]. The modelled evaluation suggest that immediately following RV vaccination, vaccine investment costs are partially o -set because of reduced cases of RV attributed gastroenteritis. Although, the cost o -sets and discounted cash fl ows are not su cient enough to achieve a positive return on investment from the vaccine costs, over time, as the cohort ages, become educated, and enter the work force, they represent revenue for the Egyptian government through future tax contributions. From the government perspective, RV vaccinated children reach a neutral balance with the Egyptian government based on future government transfers o set against contributed tax receipts at age 22 (i.e. breakeven age), even after adjusting for unemployment and tax non-compliance. At the ages of 25 and 50 the RV vaccinated cohort represents an additional LE39 million and LE384 million in additional net tax revenue compared to the unvaccinated cohort. At age 25 and 50 for RV vaccinated cohorts the internal rate of return of these investments are 10.6% and 14.9%, a rate of return comparable to public investments in tertiary education in OECD countries [36]. The framework described here acknowledges that saving lives through medical interventions represents ongoing costs for government in education and healthcare costs, and that dramatic changes in population health can infl uence government accounts and economic growth [37] At the margin, our analysis seeks to answer, from the government perspective, whether lives saved by investing in RV will o er a return on investment for the Egyptian government based on future tax receipts attributed to lives saved. The analytical framework discussed here is based on a previously described government investment framework applied to assisted reproductive technology [38]. One of the main arguments against valuing life in economic terms as required with the human capital approach is that it undervalues intangible bene ts attributed to changes in health status. Although the use of human capital for valuing health may not be aligned with welfare economic principles, it is an economic reality that keeping people alive will generate ongoing costs for government in direct transfers, as well as economic bene ts in the form of future tax receipts [34]. The GA method developed several years ago recognised this fact, and attempted to rationalise Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 204government spending in relation to future revenue and expenditure that are likely to arise from policy decisions. Within the GA framework governments, and speci cally treasury departments, recognise that total expenditure is linked to the number of people who demand government resources, as well as the number of people that are helping to nance the system through taxation. In this respect we have attempted to capture the fact that as vaccination programs are introduced they will save lives and these lives will have an impact on government accounts both positively and negatively over time. Those that doubt need only look at how changes in longevity, generous spending and shrinking working-age populations are starting to raise concerns over sustainability of public nances [39] Since introducing an economic framework to inform resource allocations, considerable debate has focused on the merits of the health service perspective versus the societal perspective to inform decision making [40] In this analysis we circumvent this debate and apply a \"government perspective\" analysis assessing discounted net tax revenue as the principal economic metric. A government perspective analysing applied to health investments is particularly relevant considering changes in population health can infl uence government expenditure and tax receipts [6]. Furthermore, considering the proportion public funds used to pay for health services in Egypt as well as many other countries, the broader application of a government perspective analysis is justi able. Additionally, in light of the established relationship between health and economic growth, a government perspective analysis refl ects the fact that any growth attributed to health investments, Cters paribus, will result in increased government tax revenue. Resource allocation decisions in healthcare are challenging, especially in developing countries, because of the need to balance the needs of many with nite resources. Decisions are often based on priorities based on unmet need, burden of illness, fairness, equity and a ordability. The research presented here is provocative because it assigns future net tax revenue to discrete investments in RV vaccination. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask how decision-makers should respond to information illustrating the potential economic bene ts attributed to resource allocation decisions. We do not expect decision-makers to abandon the core elements of decision-making. Although one of the aims of our work is to highlight the scal consequences associated with investments in health. This is particularly relevant in Egypt because increased birth cohort survivorship suggests ongoing costs; however government can also reap nancial bene t from previous human capital investments in health and education. All economic models have inherent weaknesses, and the framework described here integrating three modelling approaches is no exception. Modelling long run economic events requires making predictions about future economic conditions that are certain to change. The simplest approach is to hold variables constant over time and test the sensitivity of those variables likely to infl uence the results. In this analysis we have shown that decreases in RV infection rates and increased vaccine prices will prolong the payback period for vaccine investment costs. In contrast, increased RV incidence improves the value of prevention because of reduced Chapter 5 205consumption of health costs and payback is achieved much quicker. Similarly, reduced vaccine acquisition costs decreases the payback period because it is much easier to o set costs from reduced RV cases when the purchase price is low. The underlying premise of our analysis is that lives saved through RV vaccination will eventually go on to become average economic citizens in every respect. At the margin the analysis seeks to understand whether discounted net taxes paid by those saved are enough to pay for the RV vaccination. However, some might argue that RV disproportionately a ects lower socioeconomic groups that may not achieve normal wage rates in the Egyptian economy which would infl uence the conclusions described here. Whilst socioeconomic conditions may infl uence care seeking behaviour for infected children, there is limited evidence to suggest that socioeconomic status is a determinant of RV incidence [41;42]. To refl ect the consequences of RV disproportionately impacting lower socioeconomic groups we lowered tax compliance to 20% to account for lower government revenue. This had a dramatic impact on tax revenue; however the vaccinated cohort still achieves a positive return on investment, although the breakeven point was increased to age 35. Additional criticisms could be levied against the fact that we account for 'per capita' expenditure in every year of life, while also accounting for RV speci c costs. Although this does represent double counting of health costs in the year that the event occurs, these costs are trivial in the scheme of all other government costs included in the health investment model described here. To validate this conclusion we did run simulations excluding health costs and noted there was no impact on the model conclusions. CONCLUSION The government perspective analysis described here suggests the Egyptian government can achieve both short and long term economic bene ts from investing in RV vaccination. We have identi ed initial cost o sets within the rst ve years attributed to reduced health services costs from treating RV cases. However, the predominant economic advantages for government are achieved as the cohort of vaccinated children mature and eventually enter the work force and pay taxes. Investments in RV vaccination are o set when the vaccinated cohort of newborns are 22 years of age. This suggests that policy planners need to take into consideration a longer time horizon to enable RV investments to reach maturity. REFERENCES [1] Bloom DE, Canning D, Weston M.

The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics 2003;45:290-4.208LIMITS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE In this last chapter I summarise what we have learned from studying rotavirus vaccination during the past years and from analysing the approach we took in health economics for this vaccine worldwide. I will present in addition what I consider remaining challenges and I will indicate ways I would like to further explore these domains as there is still much to examine and to value. /six.lf./one.lf WHAT DID WE LEARN? When selecting the subject of health economic analysis of rotavirus vaccination for this thesis I thought at start -and many with me as well- this will be an easy task to accomplish. The analysis is straightforward because the disease happens in a well-de ned target group -the very young ones- and the results of the vaccine from the European trial were quite impressive, especially when the disease was severe with a 100% reduction in hospitalisation rate during 1st year [31]. Well, that statement about easiness in the analysis is not completely true. Rotavirus disease creates a more complex environment than seen at rst sight and the impact the vaccine has is quite sophisticated. But 3 elements came out from the studies we undertook in Belgium that now better clarify how the rotavirus puzzle and its immunisation process ts together that was unclear before the vaccine was introduced in the market. One is that we observed from the trial results that the vaccine e cacy measured with the formula we all know in the 2nd year compared with the 1nd year compared with the 1nd st year measurement. An explanation for that st year measurement. An explanation for that st phenomenon easily given was that the vaccine's e cacy is waning after one year and that this waning process will continue during the subsequent years. It took much e ort to convince other parties that the vaccine e cacy was not waning over time rather the increase in natural immunity in the child population is the reason for a decreased denominator in the formula of measuring the vaccine e cacy. On top of that an important herd e ect was present in the control arm of the European trial during the 2nd year of evaluation as the children were randomised 2 to 1. The nding nd year of evaluation as the children were randomised 2 to 1. The nding nd that there is no waning in vaccine e cacy to be suspected after one year -this is based on the comparison between model predicted and observed data-, had major consequences [24]. Many specialists thought that we should go now for a booster dose if the vaccine waning is prominently present in the vaccinated population after 2 years. This booster dose is currently heavily promoted in developing and in emerging markets like India for instance. But the opposite is the truth. Earlier vaccination of the child population in the developing world is a more sensitive way to create more health gain than planning a 3rd dose later on when an already rd dose later on when an already rd high spread of the natural immunity in the child population will compete with the vaccine immunisation process stimulated by the 3rd dose. Also from an economic rd dose. Also from an economic rd point of view is a 3rd dose program not such a good option to select when the vaccine rd dose program not such a good option to select when the vaccine rd prevention budget is limited as we have shown with the optimisation modelling technique./six.lfChapter 6 209We could have been stronger in our assessment about the post-vaccine ndings of 'no vaccine e cacy waning' over time at the moment of the product launch in Europe. But what we missed were reliable and detailed epidemiology data on the natural history of the infection and the disease. These data should have shown the progressive immune protection generated by the natural, subsequent infections with the virus. We had data from Mexico of Dr Raul Velazquez who did a remarkable study on infection rates in a cohort of children in 1996 a few years before the RotaShield vaccine was on the market [32;33]. However, that was all we had. We had no information about the detailed spread of the infection and the disease by speci c age-groups under 5 years old in Europe. We did not know how the children were normally behaving in their contact patterns when they were very young. Much at the time we started modelling the disease was 'best guessing'. Still today we have no good explanation why the spread of the virus preferentially occurs during the winter period each year in our world of the northern hemisphere. Second is that the disease spread has an intimate connection with the vaccine impact through the way children are nurtured during their rst year of life: are the children going to a hub site such as day-care centres where the spread of the infection is heavily multiplied or not [33]? V accination with a high uptake will stop the spread of the infection in day-care centres not only amongst those vaccinated but especially amongst the unvaccinated children. They could be younger or older than the rst target group. As a consequence the drop in hospitalisation when one starts introducing the vaccine at the right moment -no later than the end of the 2nd quarter of the year prior the next epidemic period-, will be huge during the epidemic period as we have observed now in the UK. In addition we are suspecting that there is another source of rotavirus infection that hits the children besides themselves. These are the professional and non-professional care-givers. As the vaccine doesn't impact that speci c source directly, it is likely that the rotavirus will continue being endemic and infecting the child population at a much slower pace than if the infection comes from within the group. At the end it will be di cult to reach a 'disease elimination' status soon if we keep the vaccination strategy as it is now. A last interesting nding is related to the previous one with the massive hit the vaccine causes on the reduction of hospitalisation. We should have had a better focus on that point from the beginning when we were thinking about rotavirus vaccination: understanding under which circumstances the disease appears and what could be the impact of a huge drop in hospitalisation on the management of this sector in health care after the vaccine introduction. We were maybe a little na\u00efve or blind about the results of the clinical trial with a 100% reduction in hospitalisation. This nding was too much considered as if it was another interesting nding of the trial but we were not thinking behind the numbers reported. Meanwhile 1/3 of the hospitalisations during the winter period are caused by rotavirus diarrhea, the virus is a major cause of nosocomial infection in hospital care amongst children, the disease happens in a period when other prominent infections occur. Under such circumstances the introduction of the vaccine with a high uptake must create an imbalance into the health care system during the epidemic period. We should have better observed, measured Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 210and reported those ndings. The imbalance could be a cause of unrest amongst the professional health care workers or it could be considered a major break- through bene t by the same personnel desperately seeking for a solution against overcrowded wards during each winter period. This is what we analysed with our quality of care study that reports for one hospital in Belgium the in-house bene t of moving into a vaccination program against rotavirus disease. That change engendered positive consequences on bed-day patient management and on personnel management during the epidemic periods in hospital care. I could have listed other interesting data observed from all the other research undertaken in many di erent countries across the world. We measured for the rst time the real bene t of absenteeism reduction amongst working mothers after the introduction of the vaccine. We discovered a high cost at home of a sick child in many middle-income countries where the whole village passes by to nurture the family members. This is a perfect spread of the disease we now can easily stop with the introduction of the vaccine and make important savings at the level of the family unit. We also measured the impact the disease has on the quality of life of parents and particularly on working mothers. All these di erent studies indicate that a simple disease as rotavirus diarrhea has a much broader societal impact than we ever rst thought. The bene t of vaccination can be more intense than we estimated in our models of economic evaluation as we don't always capture all the -sometimes small, but critical- values to be expressed into monetary terms or in QALY s in the equation. /six.lf./two.lf REMAINING CHALLENGES While our research has put new light on what was rst seen as a simple infection and disease with an easy to value vaccine, I also discovered remaining challenges regarding understanding well what could be the full economic bene t of the vaccine in di erent parts of the world. I summarise them hereunder in a few points. A rst challenge is that we transferred without analysing in depth the economic assessment tool of Incremental Cost Utility Analysis (ICUA) performed with therapeutic drugs in a well-established health care market to preventative vaccines in the world of public health that is currently su ering in having no much of an attractive image. We then also easily transposed the same technique from developed to the developing world. So, we moved around with a health economic evaluation tool that was not well tested whether it was appropriate for the evaluation of new features in new environments. The question is now why do we think that ICUA is maybe not appropriate for the evaluation of prevention and particularly for the prevention against infectious diseases with vaccines and why will this tool also have di culties to be applied in developing countries? Let me rst answer the rst question about treatment versus prevention. 6.2.1 T reatment versus prevention6.2.1 T reatment versus prevention As explained in my introduction ICUA has been initiated a while ago within a health care program that at that time was already well focussed on treatment Chapter 6 211and cure. Within that programme the action of health care only starts if there are patients who have complaints, then step into the system for getting their symptoms diagnosed and measured by a physician who is waiting for them to come. The doctor will subsequently apply a treatment that shows signs of improvement for the patient. In that patient-physician relationship the physician will chose a treatment amongst many options. He will select the one that guarantees best chances of success for him and his patient. That approach is workable and sustainable if there is a social security system in place behind the scene to nance the process of diagnosis and treatment. In all aspects of that program everything is directed to the individual, from care-giver to care-taker. In addition the health gain for the individual patient, achieved through the treatment applied, has been nancially estimated to a maximum price set in the range between 20,000 and 50,000\u20ac/e ect gained or 54\u20ac to 137\u20ac for a perfect healthy day. All new treatment options that enter the health care market today from which a physician can chose, have been evaluated within that scheme of extra-payment for extra health gain achieved to a certain maximum level. If the physician choses another treatment option, the system doesn't collapse. Rather it is expected that he makes the change because there is more chance of treatment success for the individual patient. Now, looking at prevention, the starting points are quite di erent from treatment and cure and the way to measure success. First, with prevention performed through vaccination one doesn't need to be sick before entering the program rather the opposite. When a person is sick, adding vaccine prevention at that time is too late. In addition, with prevention one likes to reach the largest group of the at risk population as possible. So, the action of the medical personnel is in the opposing direction to treatment. Not waiting until the patient comes, but being active until all subjects are covered by the vaccine. The organisational consequences and logistics of vaccine prevention are therefore completely di erent from therapeutic care. Many countries have developed a special health care structure for implementing successfully a vaccine preventative program for infants and children separate from normal care. If one achieves a high vaccine coverage rate, there is then more bene t to be measured at the population level than summing the individual gain per subject because of the potential herd e ect caused by the vaccine. So, measuring vaccine success should preferentially occur at the population than at the individual, patient level. Meanwhile, calculating the speci c, preventative successes is a challenge because with good prevention nothing should happen and measuring nothing over a long period of time is not very exciting. It can often lead to errors as surprising this may be (cfr. pap smear results in cervical cancer screening after the introduction of HPV- vaccination [34]). In addition because nothing is happening a tendency will appear to weaken the continuation of the vaccine program as initially developed leading to a lower coverage rate and to a higher susceptible group of individuals at risk. Next is that, if one shifts from one health care intervention type such as treatment and cure to another one such as prevention, there is a major change that must occur within the delivery of care that is not obvious to organise quickly and well. It is certainly not as easy as switching treatment options as mentioned in the previous paragraph. For instance when the rotavirus vaccine was brought into the European Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 212market in 2006, we all thought that authorities will chose for it immediately. In reality nothing like that happened. It rather took time (= years) to get it implemented because of lack of budget availability, organisational changes to get a new vaccine prevention train rolling, convincing many stakeholders about the additional hidden bene t of the vaccine. We should have better prepared ourselves to get the vaccine prevention train right on the rails with the health administration of a country, but we did not. We went too quick and were too self-reassured. Finally comes the issue of economic comparison between treatment and prevention. Treatment always comes late in the process of disease development and the evaluation often stops when there is any more medical attention whereas the person still may recover from his disease and my not function under optimal conditions so that his Quality of Life (QoL) is still impaired. Prevention always comes before treatment when symptoms appear that don't always need medical attention and avoids as well the quality impact period post-medical treatment. As a consequence the accumulated QALY-bene t in a cohort will always be higher with prevention than with treatment because prevention will avoid more harm as it operates earlier in the disease process and it can avoid subsequent disease impact that isn't captured by the normal medical attention during the period of medical treatment and post-medical recovery. Avoiding more QALY loss with prevention than with treatment may lead to a higher cost for vaccine prevention if the price setting happens the same way we are doing it as for treatment. The next Table 6-1 and Figure 6-1 gives a better sense about what amount of QALY-loss di erence between treatment and vaccine prevention we are talking about. It is a simple hypothetical disease case comparable to rotavirus but other infectious diseases in childhood could be compared as well such as pertussis, for instance. The accumulated bene t gain expressed in reduced QALY-loss is measured for a T able 6-1 Measuring and comparing the amount of QALY loss by special treatment or prevention No Sp treatment Sp treatment Prevention Impact 0.9 0.9 Dysutility Days QALYs Days QALYs Days 1st day -0.2 1 -0.00055 1 -0.0005 0.1 -5.48E-05 1 83.1507 122.0548 Gain 2 38.9041Chapter 6 213cohort of 100,000 subjects over a period of one year. With vaccine prevention one may avoid close to 4 times more disutilities than with a new special treatment option. The disease utility loss that is never expected to be impacted by the medical care program is now prevented by the vaccine. I like to raise here two questions that are part of the challenge to position vaccines in an attractive way compared with treatment. One is: should the monetary threshold per QALY gained be the same as the one used in treatment for disease events that don't need medical attention? In other words should we maintain a threshold of \u20ac 20,000/QALY for the whole prevention period or do we need to adjust in function of what is prevented when, where? The other question is: should the sick periods avoided through prevention be nanced by the health care system or by other means that see bene t in obtaining those particular additional gains? The two questions are critical as they are related to the nancial sustainability of the health care program especially in light of the new trend of evaluating new interventions in terms of value based pricing. To put the issue at the extreme with a very simple health problem we are all exposed to every year: common cold. It is a very frequent illness with a seasonal peak during wet and cold periods each year. It doesn't always need medical attention. But let's suppose we develop a nasal vaccine -easy to administer with no side e ects. The vaccine is very e ective and especially e cacious if we achieve a high coverage rate during pre-seasons. Who should pay and how much? This is a domain of investigation I would like to explore during the coming periods so that price setting of vaccines better refl ects the true economic value. Figure 6-1 Assessing the individual QALY gain/loss with prevention or treatment Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 214Each vaccine in the market has an important part of its bene t that has no return on investment to the health care program (see Figure 6-1, the non-measured or intangible bene t). We often don't consider these features as critical to be separated from the total medical bene t because they are underreported or not always transparent in the way they are measured and quanti ed. Meanwhile this extra gain is part of the individual bene t as well as part of the societal bene t. More coverage with a vaccine of the susceptible group will lead to more societal than individual gain. So, if everything within vaccine prevention is preferentially driven towards a level of assessment that is the population instead of the individual, shouldn't we then look for economic evaluation tools that preferentially assess the bene t and the cost at that level? Could therefore CBA, a technique that has more a societal ambition in economic evaluation than CUA, be a better option to work with for our economic assessment of vaccine prevention? Again, this is a domain I would like to explore in the coming years. Finally, one should accept that vaccine positioning in society has evolved over time: from reducing and avoiding deaths, to limiting costly medical interventions and outbreaks, to also gaining in preventing non-medical disease events as we see it today. This can only be well accepted if the economic evaluation is recommended to be initiated at the level of a population. Prevention has of course bene t or value for the individual but the full value can only be demonstrated at the higher level. The evaluation must have that ambition to look preferentially at the level of a population [35]. Three arguments push me therefore to think and to act in the economic evaluations of vaccines into that direction: the herd e ect caused by the vaccine; the maximum bene t that can only be attained with a high vaccine coverage in the population; and more bene t is obtained than with treatment through the avoidance of disease events that don't impact directly the health care program but society. 6.2.2 Developed versus developing countries6.2.2 Developed versus developing countries The other challenge or question I identi ed about the appropriateness of ICUA for vaccines is when transposing this analysis tool from the developed to the developing world. More striking for a developing country is that it is still in its infancy of developing a full health care program. Under such circumstances priority setting between di erent health care development options (public health versus care) is critical with a confrontation between two worlds of applying medicine (prevention versus therapy; societal versus individual). In that type of environment could prevention been cheaper than treatment? Low-income countries may therefore go in the opposing direction of high income countries (see further) and start with public health development before investing in treatment and therapies. As mentioned in chapter 5 the technique of cost-e ectiveness analysis is for low- income countries an instrument of economic evaluation that is not so helpful because the right threshold is di cult to be identi ed and the CE-price-range is much too large for making a sensible selection for new interventions. Identifying and communicating that there is a problem is one objective of the paper submitted. Bringing a solution to that problem is the next step to take and to present. Chapter 6 215One way to give direction in solving the problem regarding which priority to take in health care development (treatment versus prevention) is an analysis we recently undertook to be further explored with real data. Our starting point is that every major infectious disease condition can be tackled from two di erent angles: treatment and prevention. With treatment we have to build extra hospital beds to achieve our goal to maintain a certain controlled level of mortality rate caused by the disease. With prevention we need to establish a vaccination program with a certain level of coverage to maintain the same level of mortality rate. Suppose that our ambition is to work with both options (treatment and prevention), we should be able to demonstrate what combination of treatment and prevention will give a same result in output (same mortality reduction). In a next step we can calculate the budget needed to get this combination of cure and prevention in place. It shouldn't be di cult to demonstrate that the more prevention is pushed forward the budget will be lower whereas the more one pushes for extra hospital beds, the higher the budget. The next graphs illustrate what could be an analysis and presentation of the results. The rst graph (left) indicates the construction of a mortality rate isoquant for a speci c infectious disease by combining hospital beds with vaccination that leads to a same output along the blue line plotted. In the next graph (right) we construct in addition a budget line that indicates a combination of money to be spent on hospital beds versus vaccination coverage. The Y-axis in the right graph is split into two (one left and one right). The right one and going up in value, is about the availability of extra hospital beds to manage a certain level of mortality rate for a speci c disease (same Y-axis as in the rst graph). The left one and going down to increase value, is the budget needed to manage and maintain the speci c mortality rate for that disease split into a budget for hospital beds versus vaccination. The X-axis indicates the coverage rate needed for vaccination to reduce to the same level of mortality rate (same X-axis in both graphs). It is not so di cult to see that under such circumstances there is an ideal point of low budget that ts the 3 points: mortality, vaccination coverage rate and extra hospital beds. The objective in the coming months is to collect now eld data from registries and literature on mortality, budget, hospital care and vaccination for a speci c infectious disease to Figure 6-2 Assessing budget priorities (red line) between hospital care and vaccination for achieving a same mortality rate (blue line) Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 216feed the model design for a country that still needs to build up its total health care program. This graph should help designing priority setting for a given budget and a given health goal to be achieved. 6.2.3 Optimisation modelling6.2.3 Optimisation modelling That brings us to the next analysis performed to identify solutions for the economic assessment of vaccines in low income countries and emerging markets using optimisation modelling. The technique helps solve di erent issues I have highlighted in the previous paragraphs such as the di culty of de ning a maximum threshold for valuing the QALY/DALY gain, having a too large price range for being cost-e ective, being unable to combine di erent intervention options, identifying what is really a relevant combination of options, and at what price level for the new intervention can we work under speci c constraints. But let's make it clear from start. Optimisation modelling isn't the unique solution we were all waiting for that suddenly solves all our problems in the economic assessment of new medical interventions to be introduced in the health care market. Using this technique it will lead to new problems and new challenges to tackle. But the approach helps indicate directions where solutions seem to be better accepted than with ICUA and it helps thinking in a frame of working under speci c constraints. Because the big challenge of today for any health care program to be developed whether it is in the developed or in the developing world, is Money, Finance. How to make the health care program progressing and sustainable for the future? One cannot deliver good health care if there is no right price de ned by which everyone can get access who needs medical support of good quality and that motivate the workers in the system to stay tuned and focussed on their tasks. In addition it must have the incentive for good research by which continuously additional health gain can be achieved. Sometimes the health gain should preferentially to be measured, sustained, and developed at the population level as we are trying to argue here for prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination. But sometimes the health gain can only be achieved and measured at the individual, patient level. A good health care development program has the right balance between both types of medical interventions. It is not always easy to nd that perfect equilibrium because in some environments the approach of the population level through public health with vaccination has been neglected and been overwhelmed by treatment and cure. Sometimes the opposite has been seen that too much public health is promoted where the treatment approach could have done a more e cient job. This is for me a next big challenge to explore: identifying the world of ideal combination between prevention and treatment for di erent groups (age, sex, social, and environment) within an attractive budget equilibrium sustained by a good nancial support and depending of the health care development status.Chapter 6 217/six.lf./three.lf FINAL CHALLENGES Finally, there is one other area of interest, I would like to further explore. To disentangle the cost-e ectiveness analysis we are doing now into more valuable pieces of better information. I like to express the following refl ection regarding CEA that needs further exploration in depth. A big weakness of ICEA is the way we are using it now. We are blind in trying to achieve incremental health gain with any new intervention we want to bring on the market. If we achieve that goal, we expect to get a price premium for the new intervention that as an end-result will increase the total cost side of the health care budget as long as the ratio of the cost-di erence divided by the e ect di erence is below a certain threshold. What we assume in our way of applying the cost-e ectiveness threshold is that the QALY-gain occurs independently from the cost-di erence, which is not always the case. As a matter of fact we often do at double counting. We reduce the cost-side for hospitalisation reduction and improve the QALY side by not going to the hospital. We can skip one of both if we know that the cost we pay in the medical sector for any intervention we have avoided, perfectly refl ects the QALY improvement the new intervention generates. But we know that the prices we are paying are not real market prices and the QALY changes we obtain are an approximation of the value we gain. As an end- result both sides are biased. However working in a cost contained environment we should try to focus the analysis on cost-reduction and cost-o set and less on QALY- gain if that gain is marginal. We should try to identify a threshold when the QALY- gain is anymore marginal or result in a sensitive improvement. What could be an interesting domain to explore in CEA is to include the level of cost-o set as a barrier to allow an increase in price-setting independent of the QALY-gained. That seems counter-intuitive but we shouldn't try to deliver a health care program that focus on cost increase how acceptable it is, rather than on a cost-containment strategy. The cost-increase should be allowed for those situations that cause a QALY-gain but with limited cost-o set in order to stimulate a reasonable price setting for any new intervention and research initiative that generates better quality health. Related to that we should further investigate the statement about why vaccines are considered to be cheap. That question has been raised to me many times. By looking at the problem more in depth it helped to explore two additional features about the use of vaccines today. One is the current investment in vaccination as part of the total health care budget in a high income country. That amount is surprisingly very low: around 0.03% in the UK and the same can be found for France and other European countries using the EOCD data-base analysis. The other is that we observe that in the latter type of countries an expansion of preventative activities against diseases other than the infectious ones occurs these days such as the use of statins against cardio-vascular diseases. What we should try to analyse and to compare are data per prevention technique (vaccine versus drugs) and per broad disease area (infectious diseases versus cardio-vascular diseases) in a country like the UK for which there is a su cient number of relevant data available. We should explore the investment rate, the bene t, the cost-e ectiveness, and the budget impact analysis per disease area and per intervention type. We may discover two Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 218forces that explain why statins compared to vaccines can achieve a much higher investment budget while the health gain could be lower and still be cost-e ective (see Figure 6-3). One force (F1) is related to what is happening under the budget horizon of cardiovascular diseases versus infectious diseases. Cost-o sets in cardio-vascular diseases are much higher while infectious disease management is much cheaper. So, the cost-neutral price to start with is much higher in statins than in vaccines. Therefore the cost-neutral point (the point where the curve per product crosses the X-axis) shifts from left (vaccines) to right (statins). The second force that bene ts the statins in a better price setting than vaccines is a better ability to de ne the at-risk population. The at risk population for rotavirus infection is the whole birth cohort although we know that only 40% of them will get the disease up to the age of 5 years. With statins we are able to delimit a group where the risk for getting the disease is much higher than 40%. As a consequence the slope factor of the curve for vaccines is much higher than for statins (a1> a2) because the bene t is diluted over a higher number of individuals in the cohort than for statins. Statins can therefore go for a higher maximum price than vaccines (M2 > M1). So, it shouldn't be so much of a surprise that the investment in statins is so much higher than in vaccines because the disease conditions are so di erent regarding management cost and focus. However the question remains, should the price of prevention be equivalent or being higher than treatment + the additional health gain in order to go for it?Figure 6-3 Comparing the economic value of vaccines with statins 219RECOMMENDATIONS We are living in an environment that globally becomes more complex. Under such circumstances we cannot expect that we should always be able to apply a uniformed solution to a same problem manifesting di erently under di erent circumstances. If we choose for that one option solution, there is a high risk for making mistakes in obtaining the right implementation of the vaccine because of not being economically attractive. We need to remain cautious and take into account the diversity of the environments to analyse and to present economic results adjusted to the local contexts. What I have tried to demonstrate in this thesis is that rst a vaccine has intrinsically a moving bene t target to be achieved over its life cycle that will impact its economic value assessment at two levels: the individual and the group level. An attractive economic result will therefore be depended where and when the assessment is performed. This is typical for any active prevention program that is initiated when a problem is substantial. From reducing the burden where the economic value of the new intervention will be high to controlling the outbreaks where the economic game of using the intervention is then di erent and may be more depended on the risk assessment. We often forget about that change in focus linked to the bene t vaccines can achieve over time. When we introduce a new vaccine in a community, it is not only about reducing speci c mortality -the vaccine can achieve that sometimes very easily and very quickly-, but the vaccine is mainly brought in because it has the ability to control the disease spread towards a critical helping hand in the process of elimination or even eradicating speci c disorders. But the economic value and the assessment tool to be used will be di erent by focus type. Second is that the vaccines we are working with today are used towards the prevention of infectious or communicable diseases. This has implications for the assessment of the bene t that doesn't remain at the level of the individual as we see it for treatment, but at the level of a population or a group. We know that when we introduce a vaccine in a community it will be very di cult to reach a full coverage. Because of that we will obtain an indirect bene t by the vaccine, called the herd e ect. We need to be sure that we capture well that extra hidden bene t in our economic assessment. But there are other important additional hidden bene ts that are economically critical for the value assessment of the vaccine: reduction in productivity loss and improvement in quality of care. Maybe other bene ts could be discovered as well, we haven't thought about. Third is that to be most successful vaccines need to obtain a high coverage. Therefore the logistics must be there to facilitate the access. If the disease burden is huge -and that should be the case anyway otherwise one shouldn't introduce a new vaccine universally- and the vaccine coverage is high at uptake, it must create an imbalance into the established health care system. In those environments where the health care programs are maturely developed, vaccines will be a ' substitute' for substitute' for substitute'/seven.lfExploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 220the existing situation. The vaccine must then show high added value. We often miss to demonstrate the full picture at launch for obvious reasons. The economic assessment tool can be ICUA, but the shift should now be more in favour of CBA. With vaccines the initial investment is large, the assessment should be at the population level preferentially, and all the societal bene ts need to be accounted for and not using a silo approach. A much di erent approach is suggested in an environment where the health care program is not so well developed. In those circumstances the vaccine will be an ' add on' project and not a substitute. In an add on' project and not a substitute. In an add on' 'add on' environment the driving force is about budget allocation and prioritizing. 'add on' environment the driving force is about budget allocation and prioritizing. 'add on' The new economic tool to be used then is about optimising the resource use and being most e cient. Many challenges remain ahead for bringing those new messages across. But that is part of the game of performing the appropriate economic evaluation of vaccines depending of the environment where we are living in. REFERENCES [1] Postma MJ, Standaert BA.

Visiting a new country I will immediately investigate two things: identifying the local type of cow if there is one around and nding a museum of local modern art. There is no link between both, but it identi es 2 of my 3 passions. The third one I will reveal at the end of this acknowledgement. Meanwhile the link between vaccines and cows seems obvious. What is less clear is the ensuing development that I should jump on economics of vaccines and ending writing a doctoral thesis on the subject. Two facts have helped me moving towards that direction at a more mature age. First and foremost were the regular contacts at congresses and the many exchanges of emails and information with a gentle and a very patient academician, working in the north of Holland, who was utterly convinced that I should and could do it. I would like to thank wholeheartedly my promotor, Prof Dr MJ Postma for pushing me over the edge to get where I stand now with a doctoral thesis. Without his help and commitment, I would have been unable to nish this work. It is very gracious of him that he embarked in this adventure with me. We made it and I really enjoyed the whole process of elaborating and nishing this research. With professor Postma and with my co-promotor, Prof Dr O Ethgen about whom I was so glad to get him on board as well, I was able to pursue this work during a 3 year period. The support of Olivier at the end was extremely precious. His way of giving advice was so tactful and 'aimable', typically '\u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'. A great thank you to both of you. My appreciation about this entire e ort is that it is absolutely worth doing it, for me personally as well as for my direct environment I'm working with. It helps so much to scrutinize on the one hand and to synthesize on the other the many ideas we all have in our heads bringing it back to a clear and simple reasoning that allow moving to new evidence. I would recommend this e ort to everyone who has the possibility/opportunity to do it. Age shouldn't be a limiting factor. It rather is an asset as time gives the chance to get a better and deeper grip on the subject and helps selecting the priority in the work to be done. And that was the second factor that motivated me for defending a thesis. There were/are new facts and gures to communicate about the health economics of vaccines that should attract the attention of a broad audience so that the product has now a better position about its right economic value which we didn't discover so well yet. I consider this thesis as a helping tool in a process towards the right economic assessment of vaccines, where still much needs to be done to capture it fully. This brings me to the second part of my acknowledgement. I have been blessed during my early career to be directed and to receive support by deeply inspiring gures and tutors such as Prof Dr W Eylenbosh (), Prof Dr L Denis, Prof Dr M Lechat (), Prof Dr P Boyle, Prof Dr P Piot, Dr V Nelen amongst many others. They Exploring new ways of measuring the economic value of vaccination 228gave me the right introduction into the world of epidemiology in Belgium, Europe, Africa (Burundi), and Latin America (Suriname). But then suddenly came the switch from epidemiology to economics and another unique group of persons pushed me forward into that new eld and into the world of vaccines such as Dr K Torfs, Dr A Alwan, Dr H Erder, and now Prof Dr M Toumi, Prof Dr M. Raes, Dr M Connolly and last but not least Dr J Mauskopf. I am sure that I'm missing many more names on that list and I hope that those not mentioned here will forgive me. Such a list can never be comprehensive but many have helped and inspired me in the work I'm doing now and I would like to express my greatest gratitude for all the support, I received. Finally there are two groups of people always very close to my heart that may remain so for ever. First, there is that unique team of health economists at GSK V accines, with its large network of external experts, with whom I debated a lot during the many meetings we have had over the past 10 years. As a person in charge of leading the department it was easy to organise meetings -not mandatory- but the debate I had with you all was always lively, straight, clear, fresh, challenging, and so helpful for my thinking. Thank you so much to all the Nadias (3), Gen, Rachel, Meghann, Emmanuelle, Katsia, Xiao, Emma, Sharon, Carole, Carla, Danielle, Ilse, Christophe, Des, Nicolas, Jorge, Rodrigo, Jean-Etienne, Lijoy, Augustin, Stephan, Oscar for creating such a stimulating environment. Three more persons remain to be mentioned here, and they are special. Georges, he has been my 'compagnon de route' for more than 15 years now in the world of health economics. I could always count on him whenever and wherever I am/was with very memorable events in Scotland, in Lyon, le Concorde, or in the open o ce now at GSK. It is always so nice that when meeting people again after a long period, they always gently and spontaneously ask me about Georges. The work he did and how he did it impressed many. The next person I like to thank here is Nathalie. She is the one who always helps whenever the day moves to a next disaster. Her smile, good temper, and unique network always helped the bad mood on Monday morning and she knows me better for that than myself. It is so good to know that this team is like a second family to me. If I still do the job I'm doing today it is because of you: you have always been so nice to me, so responsive, so helpful. Thank you so much for all that great support. The last person to mention in that GSK list is my current boss, Thomas Breuer, who remained curious but much enthusiastic about all the work we initiated in our health economic group. In big organisations like GSK it is critical to have leaders in place in which one can trust and discuss openly. Thomas is such a person. Many thanks for your great support. The last group to mention is the one I missed most when I'm travelling on Friday evening and I cannot attend our known rendez-vous in the restaurant 'Den Uil', my family, my wife and our two boys, Bruno and Eric. These gatherings are so precious to me and to Carole as well. The debates, the jokes, the fun, but sometimes the 'tristesse' or the simple presence of being together, the one family event, is such a stimulating force for me and Carole at the end of tiresome weeks. I hope I didn't cause too many headaches with my focus on cows, paintings, caulifl owers, drone stories, wishes to help changing the world, and ways to see too much the universe 229Acknowledgements through health economic glasses with models. But I thought it is good to know that your father is passionate about his work. His work was and is his greatest hobby. But the last who deserves most attention of gratitude here is my wife, Carole. This year we will o cially be 30 years together, 30 years of great adventure, 30 years of great support in all what I'm doing, and the blessing of being there when I needed it most. Many thanks for all that free giving that we enjoy so much together most during our bird watching walks, my third passion she generously introduced it to me, more than 30 years ago. I was then discovering that a duck is not a duck, but can be a Shelduck, a Mallard, a Teal, a Gadwall, a Wigeon, a Pintail, a Shoveler, a Pochard, and many more beautiful species with impossible names to remember in di erent languages. To all of you a 'very big' thank you that you gave me the chance to develop and nish this thesis.230CURRICULUM VITAE Baudouin ACGM Standaert (1955) was born in Bruges, Belgium. He rst studied medicine (MD) at the KU Leuven, Belgium, and nished the special course in Tropical Medicine at the Instituut voor Tropische Geneeskunde (ITG) in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1982. After his medical degree he immediately went abroad to Suriname with a 1-year scholarship studying the epidemiology of schistosomiasis and the evaluation of road accidents in the city of Paramaribo under the guidance of Prof Dr BJF Oostburg . After that year he came back to join the department of Social Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Antwerp (UIA), under the supervision of Prof Dr W Eylenbosch . He started there the research on prostate cancer screening using the PSA-test and the ultrasonography of the prostate gland in collaboration with Prof Dr L Denis from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). L Denis from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). L Denis After 3 years he was selected to work in Burundi for initiating the evaluation of the AIDS problem for the AGCD, the Belgian Administration for Cooperation and Development, in an emergency program under the guidance of Prof Dr P Piot (ITG, Antwerp). After 2 years in Africa, he was o ered a position at the WHO in Geneva to work on cluster analysis of AIDS transmission through infected needles in developing countries. He came back in Belgium in 1987 in the department of Disaster Epidemiology of Prof Dr M Lechat at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de M Catholique de M Lechat Louvain (UCL) in Brussels. The project initiated there was about identifying emergency medical support after cyclone impact in the Solomon Islands in the Paci c Ocean. The project was sponsored by the European Commission. After one year, the decision was taken to move to a next level of career development. He became the new director of the Provincial Institute of Hygiene (PIH) in Antwerp in 1988, working in close collaboration with the provincial deputy politically responsible for that Institute, J Geuens . The PIH has a long tradition in working on quality control of water and soil as well as on public health issues in the province. The Institute has around 160 employees split into a lab environment and eld work in collecting basic health and environmental information for the province. Many new projects were initiated during that period in developing the institute at the right level of regional, national, and international recognition through new collaborations with universities and other institutes in Belgium and in Europe including Prof Dr L Denis (prostate disease), Prof Dr L Denis (prostate disease), Prof Dr L Denis P Boyle (cancer P Boyle (cancer P Boyle prevention at the International Agency on Research of Cancer (IARC)), and Prof Dr M Lechat (registry of EUROCAT in the province of Antwerp), and Prof Dr M Lechat (registry of EUROCAT in the province of Antwerp), and Prof Dr M Lechat M Barch of the Provincial Institute of Li\u00e8ge (Healthy Cities). During that period B Barch of the Provincial Institute of Li\u00e8ge (Healthy Cities). During that period B Barch Standaert became the representative of Belgium in the scienti c board of IARC in Lyon, France. After a few years the interest for economic evaluations in health care emerged with the collaboration of K Torfs from the University of Antwerp K Torfs from the University of Antwerp K Torfs (UFSIA). Health economics was at that time a new domain to explore with a clear necessity to value new medical products coming into the health care market. Because B Standaert was still working on prostate diseases pharmaceutical companies were interested in getting his expertise in house. A new critical decision had to be taken in 1995 to move to the industry and to stop working for the public health institute. He took that decision in May 1995 to join AMGEN to become 231Curriculum Vitae the rst health economist for that biotech company in Europe. Over the years a small health economic team was set up in Brussels with 8 people coordinating all the health economic activities in Europe for AMGEN but reporting directly to the health economic team in the US under the leadership of Dr H Erder . Then the decision was taken by upper management of AMGEN to move the European HE-program from Brussels to Zug in Switzerland in 2005 where the commercial head-quarters for the company in Europe were located. That was the reason for B Standaert to decide to move to another international group in Belgium and to start working on vaccines. In November 2005, B Standaert became the head of the global health economic group of vaccines in GSK Bio, Rixensart, Belgium. He started with a small team of 3 collaborators 9 years ago, rst working on the health economic assessment of Rotarix and Cervarix and then later on that of Synfl orix. The group of Health Economics (HE) counts today 18 people and the team works closely with the clinical and the commercial groups of GSK V accines worldwide. The overall HE program is supervised by Dr T Breuer , head of the V accine V alue and Human Science program within Research and Development of GSK V accines. The HE-team has a wide experience in developing di erent types of economic assessment tools going from the very simple back-of-the -envelope models to the more advanced dynamic and macro-economic models for pandemic infectious diseases such as malaria, TB, HIV , Flu. The health economic group also explores new economic evidence away from the conventional cost-e ectiveness analysis such as optimisation modelling, return on investment, and macro-economic evaluations. Collaboration with many international groups and universities in Belgium and in the Netherlands, in particular the University of Groningen, has been set up to exchange ideas, study results and projects. B Standaert has numerous publications in the many di erent elds he has worked on including prostate diseases, AIDS, cancer, infectious diseases, and public health. He was also during several years the representative of the industry for the working group on economic modelling of the WHO (QUIVERT/IVIR), Geneva, in Switzerland. 232L IST OF PUBLICATIONS 1.
