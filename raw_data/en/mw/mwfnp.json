Govinda's Health Food - Govinda offers sweet alternatives to candy that do not contain any artificial flavours or other artificial ingredients. According to Ayurveda, these sweets balance the doshas and are safe for any gourmets! The Cocoa: - The carefully fermented and slightly roasted cocoa beans are gently broken up and gently processed in a patented process. All ingredients are checked for their quality. During production, no heat is added, so that the valuable ingredients of the cocoa bean are fully preserved. Raw Cocoa - Cocoa beans contain important bitter substances, are rich in antioxidants, iron, magnesium and zinc. Their protein and carbohydrates make up the nutritional value of the cocoa bean. Tannins, aromatic substances, organic acids and, above all, theobromine are responsible for their great taste. |Brand:|| | Nutritional Information |Nutritional Information||per about Govinda Organic Chocolate Nuts Customer Reviews English reviews written for Govinda Organic Chocolate Nuts 1 customer review in all languages 1,0 out of 5 stars | | 5 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 4 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 3 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 2 stars | ||0||(0%)| | | 1 Stars | ||1||(100%)| 1 review We do not have any reviews in English yet, but we do have 1 review available in another language. - No reviews available Related products Customers also bought Magazine Articles: Discover Ayurveda 101 : Free delivery in Germany from 49,90 \u20ac Free returns 24-hour shipping More than 6.950 products "}
