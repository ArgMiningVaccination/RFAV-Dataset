Western medicine excels in trauma and crisis management. Learn more about how Eastern Medicine works, when to use it and how it can improve the overall health and well being for ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities. SPEAKER: Jonathan King- American Acupuncture ABOUT THE SPEAKER: Jonathan King discovered Acupuncture and Eastern Medicine while curiously and skeptically tagging along with his wife for an acupuncture treatment. When the pain from an injury he was discharged from the Army for disappeared in three seconds flat, he knew immediately he needed to learn how to provide the same relief for others. He started the Masters degree program two weeks later. He has advanced training in both Pain Management and Rehabilitation as well as working with complex constellations of chronic health issues. Jonathan loves what he does and is passionate about sharing the benefits of this life changing longevity science. Who should attend YOU!
