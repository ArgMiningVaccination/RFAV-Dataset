Members that were once staunchly opposed to female clerics eventually embraced women in spiritual leadership duringTaylor's tenure. Deacons that were initially unsympathetic to their firstfemale assistant pastor soon became her biggest supporters, and laymembers learned to function as gatekeepers of God's calling to femalecongregants that displayed ministerial gifts. Women also joined thedeacon and trustee boards, positions of great power in Baptist churches,and continued to function as leaders in the church. This article delineates how the strong leadership of their new senior pastor and female assistant pastor helped Second Baptist Church ofEvanston transform into a free space for women to exercise ministerialleadership and spiritual gifts. It is first important to contextualize Sec - ond Baptist's transformation by briefly discussing the preclusion ofwomen clergy among black Baptists in general. Second Baptist's em - brace of women clergy controverts a longstanding rejection of womenclergy in black Baptist conventions. BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN CLERGY Social constructions are often the products of power relations rather than neutral negotiations among collective actors of equal social stand-ing (Morris and Braine 2001). Women pursuing clerical appoint-ments are denied access, face severe restrictions, and often experienceprejudice, discrimination, and humiliation in many denominations andchurches (Baer 1993; Lehman 1993). Even in denominations withactive affirmative action policies, female pastors are overrepresented insmaller congregations and have fewer opportunities for full-time em (Nesbitt 1993; Konieczny and Chaves 2000). While female-led congregations are more prevalent among African American thanwhite or Hispanic congregations (Konieczny and Chaves 2000), menmonopolize positions of religious leadership in most African Americanmainline denominations, forcing women to pursue leadership in sectar - ian movements (Baer 1993) or in groups with no mainline denomina - tional ties (Konieczny and Chaves 2000). Black Baptist congregations reproduce gender inequality through clerical assignments. Lincoln and Mamiya's (1990) national study re - ported only three black Baptist churches with women senior pastors,whereas Riley (1999) named six churches. None of the mainline black156 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from Baptist conventions officially endorse the ordination of women\u2014 partly due to their respect for church autonomy and partly due to theiroften vocalized disapproval of women clergy. Lincoln and Mamiya(1990) found that almost 74 percent of pastors in the largest black Bap - tist convention disapproved of women clergy. Though Higginbotham (1993) depicted women's auxiliaries as vehi - cles of power in Baptist networks, Morris and Lee (forthcoming)emphasized that significant power rests in the governing boards of Bap - tist conventions that are predominantly composed of male pastors. LikeHigginbotham, Gilkes (1997, 375) also discussed how female leader - ship is mediated through informal networks of support and empower - ment in local churches, but conceded that women are organized under a\"system of relatively unyielding male authority\" within most Baptistchurches and conventions. Women are not allowed to preach behindpulpits in many black Baptist churches nationwide (Lincoln andMamiya 1990) and are frequently denied the respect allocated to theirmale counterparts (Morris and Lee forthcoming). Hence, to be a femaleseeking ordination and respect among mainline black Baptist conven-tions is still a lonely and difficult task (Chapman 1996), as most Baptistchurches and networks remain hostile environments for women clergy. While sociologists study the forces behind the acceptance or rejec- tion of women clergy on a denominational Nesbitt1993; Chaves 1997; Gilkes 1994, 1997; Sullins 2000), ap-proached the latter with congregational studies. Gender inequalityamong clergy is a result of embedded cultural values particularly resi-dent in local congregations (Sullins 2000), and therefore, studying howreligious elites craft narratives concerning gender and ordination isvitally important for deciphering the mechanisms involved in movingwomen into ecclesiastical authority. METHOD AND SETTING Second Baptist is a popular church in Evanston, a small city north of Chicago, with over a thousand members; the overwhelming majorityare African American. A significant portion of the membership con - sists of businesspersons, judges, lawyers, professors, doctors, and in - fluential politicians, including the current mayor of Evanston. Presi - dent Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Gwendolyn Brooks, CongressmanLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 157 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from John Conyers, and Jessie Jackson are a few of the many politicians and celebrities that have spoken from Second Baptist's pulpit and manyothers have made visits. I first learned of Second Baptist while working on a national study of black Baptists. A Chicago pastor's description of Second Baptist as arefuge for women clergy prompted my interest because I was aware thatmost black Baptist churches are unsupportive of women clergy. In myfirst few visits, I learned that women were active leaders in the church asassistant pastor, ministers, deacons, and trustees. I later discovered thatSecond Baptist was not always supportive of women clergy but under - went several changes after Dr. Hycel Taylor was appointed senior pas - tor. The latter discovery impelled me to study how Second Baptistchanged to embrace women clerical leadership. The senior pastor, Hycel Taylor, granted permission to study the con - gregation, introduced me to the congregation during a Sunday service,and provided a two-hour interview and many conversations about histenure at the church. Members were very supportive, and I did notencounter resistance during any part of the study. Part of the lack ofresistance is explained by Second Baptist's location five blocks awayfrom Northwestern University. Members were accustomed to graduatestudents and professors visiting and studying the church, and thus, mypresence did not seem unusual. Another contributing factor to mem-bers' support of my study involves Second Baptist as a middle-classcongregation with a strong appreciation of higher education. Manymembers were impressed with my connection to Northwestern Univer-sity\u2014an institution with tremendous cache in Evanston\u2014and offeredto help the study in any way possible. Data come from a year of participant observation at Second Baptist. During this period, I visited worship services, Bible studies, and specialevents and interacted with a significant amount of clergy and members.Field notes were taken after every visitation. Data also come fromthirty-five in-depth, open-ended interviews with members of thechurch that ranged from thirty minutes to two hours. Though theseinterviews were important sources for my knowledge of historicaldevelopments that preceded my arrival, numerous conversations withlongtime members during participant observation were equally vital.The interviews and participant observation provided opportunity toexplore the before-and-after process of their acceptance of womenclergy.158 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from Lee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 159 My approach for choosing interview subjects was from a careful snowball process of meeting new prospects through previous contacts as well as through visiting different Sunday school classes and churchfunctions that exposed me to diverse members. Because I was inter - ested in historical changes, my sample was skewed toward longtimemembers. Twenty of my interview subjects were members at SecondBaptist before Taylor's arrival; four of these longtime members weredeacons, and two were trustees before and during Taylor's tenure. Ofthe total sample of interviews, eighteen were with women, four ofwhich are former members who accepted the call to ministry at SecondBaptist and were ordained by Taylor. My sample has other subjects thatwere/are active in various dimensions of spiritual life at Second Baptist,including the current chair of the deacon board, the youth director, pastand present members of the women's auxiliary, choir members, andthe secretary of the church's programming committee. Data collectedthrough participant observation and interviews allowed me to analyzebeliefs about women in ministry before, during, and after Second Bap-tist's spiritual revolution from the perspectives of representatives thatparticipated in various dimensions of the church. Though Second Baptist is somewhat of a transient church, both my interviews and field notes confirmed that a large contingent of thechurch remained active after Hycel Taylor's arrival and new initiatives.The latter is important to demonstrate that Second Baptist's spiritualrevolution did not derive exclusively from disgruntled members' leav-ing and new members' joining. Although Second Baptist continued togain and lose members gradually to death and relocation, Taylor's lib - eral preaching and new initiatives did not cause a significant loss ofmembership, and the church has a visible contingent of long-termmembers still active in leadership. The names of members quoted in the text are pseudonyms with the exception of the well-known pastors Brenda Little and Hycel Taylor.Second Baptist is a high-profile church, and it would be futile to substi - tute names for the church and Taylor and Little. The latter consented totheir names' being used in the study, and Taylor provided written con - sent for the use of the church's name in publications. I should also men - tion that I never became a member of Second Baptist and that my inter - est in visiting was strictly sociological. References in this article towomen in Second Baptist \"receiving God's calling\" do not reflect mytheology but echo Second Baptist members' penchant for associatingecclesiastical authority with a divine calling. at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from 160 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 SECOND BAPTIST'S SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION We are aware that God has chosen us to be pioneers in the liberation of African-American women to be preachers, prophets, and priests. Weknow that in so doing we participate in the liberation of the church ingeneral, and the black Baptist church in particular, from the bondage andignorance of chauvinism. \u2014Rev. Dr. Hycel B. Taylor (Spring Revival bulletin, 2000) A few years ago, Second Baptist Church of Evanston's senior pastor Hycel B. Taylor and two ministers visited First Corinthian Baptist Church in North Chicago for a special service. Rev. Taylor\u2014the guestspeaker\u2014and the two ministers walked into First Corinthian and con - vened with other clergy in the pulpit area. What made their act contro-versial was the fact that the two ministers that accompanied Taylor werewomen and hence violated First Corinthian Baptist Church's strict pol-icy precluding women from occupying clerical space. Ten minutes aftertheir arrival, the pastor of First Corinthian demanded that the femaleministers leave the section designated for clergy and sit with the layaudience. Taylor capitulated but not before having his say: This is not man's pulpit! This is God's pulpit and God does not discrimi- nate! If these women are not good enough to stand up here, I am not goodenough to stand up here. (Riley 1999, 1) Sacred space is laden with symbolic meaning in countless churches to perpetuate male clerical hegemony. A prominent Baptist pastor in Chicago claimed that he does not even allow women behind his pulpitto clean it (Morris and Lee forthcoming). To enforce norms againstwomen's functioning as clergy, many black Baptist churches forbidwomen access to space on stage behind the pulpit area that is generallydesignated for clergy. Women clergy from Second Baptist are oftenforced to sit with lay members when visiting other Baptist churches,while their male counterparts sit with clergy. Years ago, Second Baptistalso did not allow women to occupy clerical space but changed tobecome a refuge for clergywomen, and the catalyst for their spiritualrevolution was its appointment of Dr. Hycel B. Taylor as senior pastorin 1972. at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from Before Taylor's tenure, Second Baptist was led by Pastor Nathaniel Hawk. A longtime trustee described Hawk's leadership as \"the old- fashioned style of pastoring.\" No women functioned as ministers, dea - cons, or trustees during Hawk's long tenure. Evon Davis, a longtimemember of Second Baptist, described women in ministry under Hawkas a nonissue because there were neither women ministers nor womenstriving to function in church leadership. Ernestine Guillebeaux men - tioned that it was not even a topic of discussion during Hawk's tenure,because most members did not believe God called women to ministry.Vincent Ransom, a trustee under both Hawk and Taylor stated, \"PastorHawk expressed that it was the man that was the minister.\" Pastor Hawk never allowed women to sit in the pulpit area desig - nated for ministers, and so congregants were unaccustomed to seeingwomen speak from behind the pulpit. But Second Baptist abolishedsuch gender norms after the church appointed a new senior pastor, Dr.Hycel B Taylor, in 1972. Taylor's liberal preaching and appointment ofa female assistant pastor contributed to Second Baptist's transforminginto a free space for women clergy. PRELIMINARY FACTORS FOR CHANGE Several preliminary factors prepared the church for change under Taylor's new leadership. For one, old age played an integral role in forc- ing Nathaniel Hawk's retirement, thus fracturing their institutionalworld and bringing the need for new leadership: What we wanted to do was to give [Hawk] a reception and let him resign and he could be pastor emeritus if he wanted to continue at the church buthe didn't want that so they had a meeting and they voted him out. It wasunfortunate it had to be that way but he had gotten a little on the senileside and it was difficult to deal with. (Reynolds interview) Preaching constructs shared meaning and group cohesion, and Hawk's preaching perpetuated male clerical hegemony, so his removal openedthe door for new pulpit discourse. Another factor is that with its location in Evanston, Second Baptist maintained a high proliferation of educated members as a middle-classchurch. Several large corporate offices are located north of Chicago,and Second Baptist for a long time has attracted African AmericanLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 161 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from executives looking for a middle-class congregation. Consequently, it was not surprising that members were enthralled by the prestige ofHycel Taylor's faculty position at Northwestern University, as dis - cussed by a member: Second Baptist has been a middle-class church since I have been there and I think back from the early days a lot of people have had some kindof formal education. So I think the church was impressed with his pro - fessorship status. (Field notes) Second Baptist's capitulation to Taylor's demands\u2014including a reduced schedule and summers off\u2014demonstrated their enthusiasm for him to be their pastor, which provided important leverage to circum - vent potential resistance to new ideas. Taylor's popularity impededearly political confrontations with the deacons and trustees who wereinitially unsympathetic to some of his new ideas, and thus, Taylor had aconsiderable amount of room to navigate his new leadership. An edu-cated and professional laity also may have fashioned Second Baptistwith a proclivity toward Taylor's progressive preaching, as a longtimemember discussed: If [Taylor] were in a highly rural or traditional kind of place it might have been a whole lot different. But we're [near] metropolitan Chicago, we'rein a university community, a lot of people have college degrees andbeyond. The city of Evanston was ready, the people of Second Baptistwere ready and I think it was just a match at that time. (Brown interview) A third preliminary factor involves the rise of black consciousness in Evanston during the years that preceded Taylor's arrival. The assassina - tion of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 provoked unrest in over a hun - dred cities, and the Chicago area was no exception. A few months after King's death, Northwestern students worked with African Americansin Evanston to protest racial inequality at the University by conductingsit-ins. Unrest at Northwestern University combined with the BlackPower movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s to produce a pro - gressive climate and rise of black consciousness in Evanston. Taylorbecame pastor at Second Baptist as an active participant in the civilrights movement, and his revolutionary style resonated with manymembers:162 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from At that time I was much more radical than I am now: I was a young radical, I had a giant beard and wore those dark glasses and dashikis[laughs ]. That's what we so-called black radicals out there did. (Taylor interview) Taylor arrived at his new church merging his Christian existentialism from his seminary experience with radical activism to construct a newvision for the church by preaching a message of black liberation andfreedom, as a longtime member discussed: People were ready for his message of empowerment; his message of \"you are able to do anything that you want to do and you can do it\" andthat kind of thing. He uses the term \"The Church of Faith and Freedom\"and the point of being completely free; free to make your own decisions,free to conquer the world, free to be your own person; \"There are nochains that can bind me now\" kind of message and I think the fact that hewas able to proclaim it so vehemently, people were very open to that.(Brown interview) The rise of black consciousness in Evanston provided a climate more apt for black Christians to challenge the status quo. Taylor's message offaith and freedom resonated with a growing radicalism in Evanston thatcaused middle-class Second Baptist members to reevaluate what itmeant to be black and Christian. The latter discussion demonstrated how Second Baptist's demo- graphics, its vacuum in leadership, and the cultural changes inEvanston helped prepare members for Taylor's new leadership, pro - gressive preaching, and liberal ideas. It is now important to briefly dis - cuss how Taylor's seminary experience influenced him to become asupporter of women clergy. This demonstrates the vital impact of pro - fessional socialization on the theological and political orientations ofclergy, who in turn influence their congregations. TAYLOR'S PROFESSIONAL SOCIALIZATION Taylor's seminary experience played a major role in shaping his theological worldview. Taylor studied at Oberlin during the period it merged with Vanderbilt University's seminary:Lee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 163 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from The theology of the seminary at that time was very much German theol - ogy. The existentialist theologians dominated the life of seminaries, in particular the seminaries of universities. So you were reading Tillich andNiebuhr, and Karl Barth. These theologians were writing out of themilieu of Germany and the Nazi regime; we were reading DietrichBonhoeffer, all of the existentialist philosophers. (Taylor interview) Vanderbilt's approach to doing theology was analytical and critical, dif - ferent from the Fundamentalist approach at Baptist or Evangelical seminaries: My major theologian was Paul Tillich. You were dealing more with philosophical theologians who were in search for the very essence andquintessence of religion. So dogma and doctrine, though they werethere, they were always subject to great criticism. (Taylor interview) Reading Tillich emancipated Taylor from engaging in doctrinal quar- rels concerning women in ministry by providing an existential vision ofChristianity that emphasized freedom. The latter influenced Taylor'spastoral ministry to be more committed to the existential concerns ofhis congregation rather than a Fundamentalist observance of doctrinaltenants: I learned that church is a means to an end, the Bible is a means to an end, but if you don't know what the end is then you fall in love with the meansand you lose total sight of what the end is supposed to be. I now feel thereis something behind the church, the liturgy, the choir singing, preaching;there's a spiritual dimension that these things are supposed to help us toreunite and reconcile ourselves. (Taylor interview) Swidler (2001) contended that people's strategies of action influ - ence the kind of goals they pursue instead of the other way around. Taylor's seminary experience discouraged him from preaching exposi - tory sermons on Biblical themes emphasized by many of his Baptistcolleagues. It was in seminary where Taylor developed his sensitivity tochallenge aspects of culture and tradition that impede Christians' free - dom. This existentialist vision was the fulcrum for Taylor's early deci - sion to add the subtitle \"The Church of Faith and Freedom\" to SecondBaptist's name as a consistent theme to permeate the church:164 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from There is a freedom that I think many of us have gained growing up through Second Baptist and that is this attitude of expectation that wecan be free to do anything we want; and that has caused dissonance in acouple of ways when we interact with other Baptists. (Phillips interview) In Taylor's first years at Second Baptist, his sermons reflected the lib - eral ideas he learned in seminary and set the stage for transformation: In many ways Dr. Taylor got us ready for change; not only in politicalactivism, but in supporting women preachers too. He just kept hitting uswith that \"Church of Faith and Freedom Theme\"\u2014he had it in our bulle - tins, flyers, or whatever we did as a church. He just kept preaching free - dom and I think many of us bought into that way of thinking even beforeRev. Little came. (Wilson interview) Whereas his predecessor's old-fashioned preaching inspired and re- inforced members' prejudice against women clergy, Taylor crafted anexistential narrative that prepared the congregation for moving womeninto ecclesiastical authority. After seven years of emphasizing faith and freedom, Taylor's de- cision to ordain and appoint Brenda Little as Second Baptist's firstwoman cleric was as vital to the church's transformation as was his lib-eral preaching. Scores of women would eventually accept God's callingto preach after seeing Brenda Little function as assistant pastor. It isnow worthwhile to discuss her role as Second Baptist's pioneer and pro-vocateur for women in ministry. BRENDA LITTLE AND SECOND BAPTIST Brenda Little grew up in Chaplain, Illinois, a small city about 135 miles south of Chicago. At the age of sixteen, Little perceived a very vivid calling from God to the ministry. This epiphany occurred in thelate 1950s, a time when female preachers among black Baptists werescarce: I had never seen a woman in the pulpit all of my sixteen years of being involved in that church and all of my role models were men. So when Icame to my aunt and said, God has called me to preach, there was fear onher face. She let me know that she really was glad for me but she was alsoLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 165 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from afraid and she said, \"Baptists do not believe in women preachers so you better keep your mouth closed about that.\" (Little interview) Little received no encouragement from her church concerning a future in ministry and consequently abdicated her call to ministry and becamea registered nurse in Chicago. Years later, after advancing in her nursing career, Little had another significant religious experience during a civil rights speech that pointedher back to her ministerial calling: I could just hear Martin Luther King Jr. saying \"If you have not found anything worth dying for then you have not found anything worth livingfor,\" and I knew that I had not really gone ahead with what God hadcalled me to do. (Little interview) King's speech prompted Little to pursue seminary training. Her semi- nary experience became difficult when she could not find a black Bap-tist church in Chicago to accept her internship as a minister. After beingrejected by several churches, Little came to Second Baptist in her thirdyear of seminary because she believed that Taylor's liberal preachingindicated he would be accepting of women clergy. (Little interview) Little's calculation that Taylor would support her was correct, and she completed her internship at Second Baptist in 1978. Her firstassignments were to administrate the Sunday school, accompanyTaylor in the pulpit area, read scriptures, and offer prayer during ser-vices. A year later, Taylor decided that Little was ready to be the firstwoman ordained in Second Baptist's hundred-plus-year history. Taylorreflected on his decision to ordain a woman: To ordain a female was not that difficult for me; it was more difficult for the female than it was for me. I never have reservations about doing whatI believe was right. I may have some problems, but no reservations.When I decided to ordain Brenda she asked me, \"should we inform thechurch and have some classes to prepare them for this?\" I said, \"no,did the Lord call you?\" She said \"yes\"; then I said, \"Why inquire thechurch?\" [ laughs ] And that was that. See when you act with that kind of \"ex cathedra\" authority there's usually nobody to get in your way. (Tay - lor interview)166 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from After her ordination in June of 1979, Taylor immediately appointed Little as assistant pastor, and she became Second Baptist's first femalecleric, a position she held until leaving Second Baptist to accept a seniorpastorate at Bethany Baptist Church of Evanston in 1986. Little's ordination and seven-year tenure as assistant pastor was vital to Second Baptist's transformation to embrace women clergy in severalways. For one, although Taylor had been a vocal advocate for women inministry, he had not yet ordained a woman. By requesting to do herinternship at Second Baptist, Little tested Taylor's existentialism to seeif it was merely theoretical or truly foundational to his spiritual vision.Taylor's immediate acceptance and support of Little provided an appli - cation of Second Baptist's new theme as \"The Church of Faith andFreedom.\" Taylor's pastoral appointment of Little also provided a cru - cial test to his authority. Even though some members were apprehen - sive, no one attempted to impede Taylor's decision. A standoff by eitherthe trustee or the deacon board could have impeded Taylor's existentialvision and foreshadowed resistance to future initiatives. Notwithstand- ing the latter reasons, I will now discuss how Brenda Little's internshipand clerical appointment was significant to Second Baptist's spiritualrevolution because of her role as Second Baptist's first clergywoman. EARLY RESISTANCE AND CHANGE The experiential commensurability of a perspective or worldview represents whether the experience of participants provides a proclivity toward accepting or rejecting the perspective or worldview (Snow andBenford 1988). Brenda Little's internship and clerical appointmentrepresented the first time a woman occupied clerical space and thuschallenged the symbolic use of space that reinforced male clericalhegemony. This allowed congregants to experience the ministerial giftsof a female for the first time: Interviewer: Who was the first woman that you remember giving a sermon at Second Baptist? Guillebeaux: Rev. Little. It had to be twenty-five years ago. Interviewer: How did it make you feel?Guillebeaux: It was strange to me because all I had known were men preachers. But I thought she did well and they gave her a chance and thepeople really liked it.Lee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 167 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from Additional interviewees confirmed that Little's internship and assistant pastorate provided numerous longtime members their first experiencesof being preached to and prayed for by a woman pastor. Some members were initially uneasy about Little's appointment be - cause it went against Second Baptist's long history of patriarchal lead - ership and many members' Biblical worldview concerning genderroles. Though a few left the church and others expired, most traditional - ists were won over shortly after experiencing Little's ministerial giftsdespite initial reservations. Here is an example of how Little's ministryactivity caused a member to reconsider her original stance, which wasagainst women's functioning in spiritual leadership: Williams: I was very much not into accepting women in leadership roles in the church. I had been brainwashed that number one, women didn't preach; and number two, women definitely didn't pastor if they had theaudacity to preach. Interviewer: When did you stop being uncomfortable?Williams: The Lord changed me because it was obvious to me that Rev. Little was anointed by God and it was obvious to me through her ownpersonal progress and her testimony in her preaching that the Lord haddone this to her. It was through opportunities for her to minister whereyou actually saw God behind it and that kind of verified her calling. Mostpeople were convinced by her and her presence and the fact that she trulywas called by God and can present herself in that way. A similar experience occurred with some members of the deacon board, the legislative branch with authority under the church's bylaws to challenge pastoral leadership. Though none of them officially pro - tested, some had preliminary reservations about women in ministry, asa longtime deacon discussed: Ransom: The old deacons didn't think so much of a lady being a minister. They thought a man should be the person. Of course, that changed. Interviewer: How? Ransom: The old deacons gave Rev. Little a hard time but as time went on they began to melt. Rev. Little was strong and sturdy but a very wonder - ful woman.168 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from Greta Wilson discussed how her late husband was among the disgrun - tled deacons that felt the Bible does not sanction women ministers but later changed to support Little: It didn't take long for him to come around and believe it or not he eventu - ally enjoyed Rev. Little's preaching more than Dr. Taylor because she preached from the word a little bit more. Years later when Rev. Littleinterviewed at Bethany, my husband and Charlie gave Rev. Little greatrecommendations and she became Bethany's first female senior pastor.It really touched my heart when Charlie cried during Rev. Little's lastday at Second Baptist because he gave her so much grief in her first year.(Wilson interview) Charlie Johnson admitted that he and a few deacons initially showed disrespect by calling her \"Little Brenda\" and intentionally fallingasleep during her first few sermons. But Johnson also admitted that\"Rev. Little preached the word, making it impossible for us to denyGod's calling on her life.\" George Franklin, a member of the trusteeboard, discussed how he grumbled when Little first began to sit along-side Taylor, but later relented after Little visited him in the hospital.Brenda Little also confirmed that seeing her in ministry helped quicklygarner the support of most reluctant deacons: Some of the deacons gave me some stress at first. Basically I would say that they were won over and those older deacons became my greatestsupporters. I did what God had called me to do: I preached the gospel, Itaught bible study, I visited the sick, I served communion, I baptized,I evangelized, I ministered to people, I counseled, and when they hadthat confidence that I was able to do all of those things they became mygreatest supporters. (Little interview) Hence, occupying clerical space and fulfilling ministerial duties nor - mally completed by male clergy had a powerful effect on resistant members' perspective on women clergy. Brenda Little's ministerialduties provided experiential commensurability for a supportive per - spective on women in ministry.Lee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 169 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from SECOND BAPTIST AS FREE SPACE FOR WOMEN CLERGY What heightened Little's impact was the fact that Taylor took sum - mer vacations during her early years at Second Baptist, placing her atthe helm of executive leadership for three months: There was a time when Dr. Taylor would be gone the entire summer. The day that school let out, the next day he and his family were gone and theydidn't return until like a week before school so the assistant pastor usedto run the church in the summer. So when Rev. Little used to do that Iused to assist her in getting ready for worship and was kind of like herpersonal assistant as a very young woman. (Howlett interview) This quote shows how Little's presence inspired mentoring opportuni - ties for young women like Howlett to participate in ministerial activi- ties. Howlett represented the generation of young women socializedunder Little's leadership that grew up believing God's call to ministrytranscends gender. Whereas patriarchal leadership was unquestionedunder Taylor's predecessor, members that grew up under Taylor andLittle took for granted that God calls women to pastoral ministry, asHowlett confirmed: I was in middle school when there were women in the pulpit at Second Baptist so I was young. As I moved into the place of accepting the call formyself, I did not have the struggle that some women have in terms ofhaving to wrestle with whether or not God can call women. So that wasnot one of my struggles because I grew up there. So for me to go to achurch and not see women in leadership is foreign and uncomfortablebecause since age ten or eleven there was always a woman at SecondBaptist. (Howlett interview) Howlett currently is an ordained minister and credits those early years under Little as crucial to recognizing her spiritual gifts and ministerialcalling. Brenda Little's presence socialized female members to believe that women can be leaders in the church. Little's seven-year experience asassistant pastor inspired greater participation from women in severalleadership positions at Second Baptist:170 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from I think more women got involved in more important places in the church under Rev. Little. Women began to take part running different depart - ments while she was there. (Guillebeaux interview) It was therefore no coincidence that female members of Second Baptist did not routinely answer God's call to preach before Brenda Little'sarrival. Taylor and Little encouraged women to recognize their ministrypotential, thus causing Second Baptist to become what movement theo - rists call a free space for women to exercise gifts and abilities and to dis - cover their callings: Dr. Taylor gave me opportunity and room within the ministry of Second Baptist to use my gifts and it was through the process of just doing what Iliked to do that I discovered that I had gifts in ministry and I loved doingwhat I was doing and it just got to a place where I heard God saying thisis what you are to be doing full-time. Just doing things in the ministrythat I absolutely love, I discovered that I had the gift of being able to see avision and pull people together to implement the vision and that's basi-cally what I still love doing to this day. (Howlett interview) It is important to emphasize that Howlett discovered her clerical call- ing after Taylor provided her numerous opportunities to minister.Howlett's ability to perceive God's calling more than likely would havebeen stifled in a church that prevented women from exercising minis-terial gifts. As spiritual gatekeepers, clergy nurture potential ministers toward accepting their calling from God. Taylor encouraged women towardthe ministry and helped confirm their calling, as discussed by a formermember who is now a cleric in a Methodist church: Dr. Taylor told me that, \"God is calling you into the ministry; you're gonna be one of those pioneer women,\" and I was like what is he talk - ing about? I just could no longer deny it and I started talking with peo - ple and I met with Dr. Taylor and he gave me a lot of information onwhat schools to attend and just a lot of good mentoring advice. (Scottinterview) Lay members of Second Baptist also became gatekeepers of God's call - ing on female congregants and thus formed an internal support systemLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 171 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from for women clergy. For example, Rose Green was young when members confirmed God's calling on her life to ministry: There was a struggle on my part but my calling had always been affirmed by members of the congregation based on things that I would do. Theywould say, \"Oh I know you're called to preach\" and I tried to ignore thatbut then it came to a point that I had to accept that this was my calling inthe Body of Christ. (Green interview) The fact that Green gradually learned of her calling through church members'responses to her ministry activities demonstrates their gender - neutral perspective of God's calling. It is safe to assume that most mem - bers in other Baptist churches would not have interpreted Green's giftsand talents as indicative of a possible calling for ministry: I think the way had been prepared for me in that Second Baptist is a church that is used to seeing women in ministry so it's not new to themto see women clergy. So they knew then and they know now how toacknowledge and recognize female clergy. (Green interview) After Brenda Little's departure in 1986, two more women served Second Baptist as assistant pastors and many functioned as ministerial assistants. Taylor also appointed women to the deacon board\u2014a movethat is in some Baptist churches more controversial than having womenpreaching\u2014as an early female deacon discussed: See deacons are the last old-boys network. When [Taylor] first started putting women on the deacon board and he asked me to be a deacon, Itold him I'd have to struggle with that, and he said, \"well you're doingeverything now,\" and teasing me he said, \"you're everything except theman of one wife\" [ laughs ]. So I really struggled with that but now I very much feel that God has called me for this day and time right now. (Browninterview) Diaconal boards enjoy tremendous authority in most black Baptist churches, and Second Baptist's inclusion of women was a powerfulstep toward gender equality in spiritual leadership. Once a thought style takes hold, any exception to its system initially appears unthinkable (Fleck 1935/1979). Taylor and Little helped con - struct a transgender norm for clergy at Second Baptist. During his172 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from tenure, Taylor ordained over twenty females whom he refers to as \"The Preaching Daughters of Second Baptist,\" and Little continues to en - courage female preachers in the Chicago vicinity with spiritual retreatsand individual mentoring. Most of the \"Preaching Daughters of SecondBaptist\" are now assistant pastors at other churches, some having lefttheir Baptist origins to join other religious groups more supportive ofwomen clergy. Whereas most Baptist churches invite a female speakeronce a year for their Women's Day celebration, Second Baptist recentlydevoted the entire month of September to women and invited BrendaLittle and several of the \"Preaching Daughters\" back to offer their min - istry gifts to the congregation. Taylor, who ordained and mentored allthese women, was excited to have them conduct this special revival andsaw this as a historic event for black Baptists in the Midwest. DISCUSSION Thomas Kuhn (1962) contended that a scientific revolution causes practitioners of a new paradigm to engage in an entirely different world.Similarly, as a result of their spiritual revolution, Second Baptist di-verted from over a century of precluding women clergy to become achurch where leadership and laity confer divine callings on talentedfemale members. Congregants that shared Taylor's predecessor's prej-udice against women clergy eventually learned to embrace and supportfemale ministers. Converts under Taylor's tenure simply took clericalgender neutrality for granted, and many young female congregantsreceived training for spiritual leadership at Second Baptist, whichformed a deliberate system of support for women. Before Taylor arrived, Second Baptist members never witnessed a woman preach or teach from behind their pulpit and thus lacked experi - ential commensurability with a transgender clerical perspective. Butafter seeing Brenda Little perform ministerial gifts, many membersembraced a new perspective concerning the Bible and women clergy.By allowing women to sit in the pulpit area and function in tasks previ - ously reserved for men, Taylor constructed a new symbolic use of spaceto support women clergy. Young members socialized under Taylorwatched female ministers occupy clerical space and eventually per - ceived God's calling on their lives to preach. This may indicate thatcongregants' exposure to female clergy influences how likely they areLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 173 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from to support women in ecclesiastical leadership or to pursue a clerical calling as females. After its spiritual revolution, Second Baptist generated a continual cycle of women pursuing ecclesiastical leadership. By functioning as afree space for women clergy, young females were able to recognizetheir talents by participating in ministry activities, and thus, overtwenty women were ordained under Taylor's watch and now functionas clergy. This suggests that along with a transgender policy for cleri - cal leadership, active encouragement and mentoring are mechanismsbehind moving more women into ecclesiastical authority. A lack ofsuch mentoring and encouragement may explain why some denomina - tions and churches fail to generate more women clergy in spite of hav - ing official policies that support women clergy (Lehman 1985). Like St. Sabina's shift toward progressive activism (Cavendish 2001), Second Baptist's spiritual revolution occurred at the dawn of anew pastoral administration, thus demonstrating the susceptibility ofreligious institutions under new leadership. Before Taylor's arrival,there were neither women ministers nor women striving to function inchurch leadership at Second Baptist. Taylor arrived at a time when theirinstitutional world had been fractured by the dismissal of their tradi-tional pastor. Taylor's new ideas exemplified by his \"Church of Faithand Freedom\" theme prepared members for his clerical appointment ofBrenda Little and to eventually embrace women clergy. Through pulpit discourse, mentoring, and ministerial activity, clergy help construct gender roles in local congregations. ResemblingCavendish's (2000) hunch that a congregation's internal structure anddemographics are more significant than its denominational affiliationwhen predicting a congregation's likelihood to engage in communityactivism, Second Baptist's stance on women clergy was more influ - enced by religious elites'support of women clergy on a congregationallevel than by their denominational affiliation, which is overwhelminglyunsupportive of women clergy. One may argue that internal dynamicsare more predictive than denominational affiliation in Baptist churchesbecause the autonomy of each congregation prevents denominationalpolicies from having a binding effect. But I suspect that studies of non - autonomous congregations will also demonstrate that pastoral leader - ship, demographics, and internal structure are more salient in decipher - ing a church's policy on women clergy than denominational affiliation.This would confirm Chaves's (1997) contention that a \"loose coupling\"174 JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY / APRIL 2004 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from exists between denominational decrees and congregational practices concerning women's functioning in ministerial positions. Second Baptist's radical transformation raises several issues con - cerning moving more women into ecclesiastical authority. For one, itdemonstrates that a church with a longstanding history of male clericalleadership can change to embrace women clergy under the right cir - cumstances. With an educated and middle-class laity, Second Baptistshowed a proclivity toward the kind of liberal thinking conducive toTaylor's new ideas. But in addition to showing that demographics andinternal organization can influence a congregation's proclivity towardaccepting women clergy, Second Baptist's transformation raises animportant issue concerning the role professional socialization playson clergy and lay members' perspective on gender and ecclesiasticalauthority. One of the neglected areas of clerical research concerns ananalysis of the socialization processes that influences their doctrinalperspectives (Guth 2001), and Second Baptist's transformation demon-strates the vital impact of professional socialization on the theologicalorientations of clergy. Taylor's seminary experience afforded him a cul-tural toolkit for existential preaching that proved useful in preparingSecond Baptist members to embrace a more egalitarian perspective onwomen clergy. The fact that Second Baptist's transformation was pre-ceded by liberal preaching supports Chaves's (1997) contention thatFundamentalist churches are more resistant to women clergy than thosethat are Biblically liberal. This may indicate that the more pastors areexposed to liberal theology during professional socialization, the lesslikely they are to embrace a hermeneutic that precludes women fromfunctioning as clergy. Hence, professional socialization can play a vitalrole in shaping the theological worldview and political attitudes ofclergy and consequently the spiritual institutions they lead. Religious elites use public discourse to craft collective narratives for theological issues. Pastors directly influence cultural values concern - ing ecclesiastical authority, and hopefully, this study will inspire moreethnographers to analyze the relationship between pulpit discourse andcongregational perspectives on women clergy. More ethnographicstudies should test my hunch that a congregation with clergy socializedin liberal seminaries, public discourse that affirms women functioningin church leadership, and/or women already functioning ministerialactivities among congregants, is considerably more likely to maintain alaity that affirms women in ministry and, in return, to reproduce moreLee / BLACK BAPTISTS AND WOMEN IN MINISTRY 175 at WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIV on August 5, 2010 jce.sagepub.com Downloaded from clergywomen than those congregations without such conditions. Addi - tional work should compare mentoring and support networks for women clergy in churches that vary in success at generating morewomen clergy. Black Baptists and their responses to the profusion ofwomen's seeking clerical assignments provide intriguing arenas forsociological analysis of the politics involved with the social construc - tion of gender in spiritual institutions.
