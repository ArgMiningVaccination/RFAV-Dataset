Wade is dangerous and detrimental to patients, providers, and our community at-large. The termination of pregnancy is part of established medical therapeutics, and therapeutically indicated in medical literature. All healthcare providers should follow established medical science regarding autonomous medical decisions and support all pregnant peoples' safe and timely access to the medical care they need. AANMC member institutions strongly recommend that all members of their communities, particularly those working or learning in a clinical setting, receive COVID-19 vaccination as soon as it becomes available to them. The emerging evidence on COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments is being closely monitored, and all AANMC members support adhering to federal/state/provincial/territorial government and public health agency guidelines for healthcare providers and academic institutions. The AANMC is extremely saddened to share the news of the passing of Dr. Guru Sandesh Singh Khalsa. Dr. K, as many fondly addressed him, was a pillar of the naturopathic professional and academic communities and widely regarded by so many in the integrative health community. The lives of hundreds of ND graduates in the US and Canada were touched directly and indirectly through his decades of service to the profession. On behalf of the AANMC Board of Directors, we are pleased to announce that Dr. Melanie Henriksen has been appointed to the position of president of the AANMC Board of Directors. She will assume the role vacated with the retirement of Mr. Harlan Patterson from Bastyr University. Bastyr University will be represented on the AANMC Board by their new president, Dr. Devin Byrd. In retrospect, I came to naturopathic medical school seeking solutions to my own health issues. Today I hope to inspire and educate those seeking additional therapies to treat their illnesses as illness can often be cured when one creates the conditions for health. We have so many powerful tools and can make so many positive changes with naturopathic medicine because it is so good at working on the whole person and not just the disease. Being passionate about naturopathic medicine and having a clear vision of what you want to do will set you up for success. As an athlete, I struggled with chronic stress fractures and eventually fractured my pubic bone. After a lack of answers from medical specialists, I was forced to search on my own for the underlying cause, which ultimately led me to a career in Naturopathic and Chiropractic Medicine. "}
