(NYSE:PFE) today announced positive top-line results from the pivotal Phase 3 trial (NCT04440163) assessing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of its investigational pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenABCWY) in healthy individuals 10 through 25 years of age. The trial met all primary and secondary endpoints, with the investigational vaccine demonstrating non-inferiority to licensed vaccines for the five meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease: serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.1 Currently, MenACWY and MenB vaccines are licensed separately, and no single vaccine is available to help protect against the five serogroups. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive either two doses of MenABCWY or licensed vaccines (two doses of Trumenba\u00ae + one dose of Menveo\u00ae). Non-inferiority was demonstrated for all five serogroups following two doses of MenABCWY compared to two doses of Trumenba\u00aeand one dose of Menveo\u00ae. Additionally, a single dose of MenABCWY met the non-inferiority criteria for serogroups A, C, W and Y compared to one dose of Menveo\u00ae. Furthermore, in individuals who had not previously received a meningococcal vaccine, the proportion of subjects with 4-fold increases in immune responses was observed to be higher following either one or two doses of MenABCWY for serogroups A, C, W and Y compared to one dose of Menveo\u00ae. Finally, the proportion of subjects with 4-fold increases in immune responses was also observed to be higher against all four serogroup B strains following two doses of MenABCWY compared to two doses of Trumenba\u00ae. The pentavalent vaccine candidate was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with licensed vaccines. \"We are very pleased with these positive Phase 3 data, which are the first for a MenABCWY vaccine candidate,\" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. \"A pentavalent vaccine has the potential to help simplify what is currently a complex meningococcal vaccination schedule in the U.S. and improve vaccine coverage. Our goal is to help ensure as many adolescents and young adults as possible are protected against this devastating disease.\" Based on these Phase 3 results, which meet pre-determined criteria for licensure, Pfizer intends to submit a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter of this year. Submissions to additional regulatory authorities outside the U.S. are also planned. \"The potential recommendation of a pentavalent vaccine in the U.S. as an alternative to the existing MenACWY vaccines across both the 11- to 12-year-old and 16-year-old vaccination platforms provides a significant opportunity for Pfizer to enter the U.S. MenACWY vaccine market and help protect more young people across the country. Today, we estimate there are approximately 52 million adolescents and young adults who are in the age range for meningococcal vaccination according to CDC guidance,\" said Angela Hwang, President, Global Biopharma Business, Pfizer. \"We look forward to the public health impact a pentavalent vaccine may provide, and to strengthening our position as a global leader in the prevention of meningococcal disease.\" Potential Public Health Impact of a MenABCWY Vaccine Meningococcal disease is an uncommon but serious illness that can lead to death within 24 hours, and for survivors can result in life-altering, significant long-term disabilities.2 Together, five serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y) account for 96 percent of all invasive meningococcal disease cases worldwide, with serogroup B accounting for the majority of disease in adolescents and young adults in the U.S. and Europe.3 In the U.S., the current vaccination recommendations for adolescents and young adults include a MenACWY vaccine and a separate MenB vaccine (total four doses) to help achieve the broadest protection available against meningococcal disease. However, less than a third of U.S. adolescents receive even one dose of a MenB vaccine, and fewer complete the two-dose series, resulting in many adolescents being unprotected against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y.4,5 If approved and recommended, Pfizer's pentavalent vaccine candidate could help simplify the meningococcal vaccination schedule by potentially reducing the total number of doses needed for individuals to be fully vaccinated against the five serogroups.6 Routine use of a MenABCWY vaccine could help improve meningococcal vaccination rates and coverage, thereby reducing cases of invasive meningococcal disease and associated mortality, the rate of long-term sequelae in survivors, and costs associated with controlling outbreaks.7 About the Phase 3 Trial The randomized, active-controlled and observer-blinded Phase 3 trial of Pfizer's vaccine candidate (NCT04440163) was [initiated in June 2020](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pfizer.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-release%2Fpress-release-detail%2Fpfizer-announces-start-four-phase-3-clinical-trials&esheet=52904742&newsitemid=20220914006052&lan=en-US&anchor=initiated+in+June+2020&index=1&md5=a07daa422946e20030cc7dc33f4251c9) and enrolled 2,431 healthy adolescents and young adults (10 through 25 years of age) from the U.S. and Europe. The study was designed to compare immune responses in individuals after MenABCWY administration to responses in control groups receiving licensed vaccines Trumenba\u00ae (meningococcal group B vaccine) and Menveo\u00ae (meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine), as well as to describe the safety profile of the MenABCWY vaccine. Immune responses were assessed by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA). The study enrolled both individuals who had previously received a MenACWY vaccine and those who had not. All participants had not received any meningococcal group B vaccine prior to enrollment. Additional information about the trial can be found at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov&esheet=52904742&newsitemid=20220914006052&lan=en-US&anchor=www.clinicaltrials.gov&index=2&md5=0747e2329e77dc20b2c52c8e6aef0057). Pfizer plans to present the detailed results from this trial at a future medical congress and submit the results for peer review in a scientific journal.
