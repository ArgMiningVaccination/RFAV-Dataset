Maybe the pain even wakes them up. What's going on? It may be a condition known as growing pains. We see it commonly at Eastern Oklahoma Chiropractic. Fortunately, we can provide effective treatments and helpful advice that will soon have your child feeling better. Facts About Growing Pains Growing pains are the most common reason for musculoskeletal pain in children, from toddlers to young teens. The name came about originally because medical researchers thought the pain was caused by bones growing more quickly than tendons. That's since been disproven, but the name has stuck. Some current theories about the causes of growing pains include: - Joints that are too flexible, leading to muscle strains with activity - Overuse of muscles due to greater physical activity - Flat feet - Low pain threshold - Poor bone strength, possibly due to diet deficiencies Although growing pains are temporary and benign, your child's pain is upsetting and can be disruptive to your family's life. Growing Pain Symptoms Typically, children feel pain in both legs, especially in the calves, shins and front of thighs. This aching or cramping pain usually strikes anywhere from late afternoon to overnight, especially after an active day. It may last for a few minutes or for hours. Although the discomfort can be strong enough to interrupt sleep, the pain is gone the next morning and during much of the day. Some kids are affected by their growing pains every day, while others may go longer, even several months, between bouts of pain.
