There are four major systems that control almost all of our bodily functions, the most important of which is the nervous system. The nervous system is the master conductor over the human body because many of the functions of the nervous system are essential to life. Functions such as breathing, digestion, and our heart rhythm would not be possible without the autonomic nervous system. The brain and spinal cord are making big strides early in life as both develop at around 17-21 days post-conception. The brain communicates to the body through small protein molecules known as neurotransmitters; this communication flows from our brain to every part of our body. This makes the difference in how our bodies function and feel. This might be the difference in feeling energetic or drained, happy or depressed, healthy or sick. In a perfect world, the brain would communicate flawlessly with the body because the brain-body connection would be at 100% function. This equates to no pain, no digestive issues, sinus problems, fatigue, no anxiety or depression. In a perfect world, we would all be skipping to work, smiling before we have had our morning coffee and feeling a total and complete sense of health and wellbeing. The job of a chiropractor is to identify where the brain and body are not connected and communicating as optimally as they should be. Unfortunately, not many of us are operating with our brain-body connection at 100% functioning of the nervous system. In fact, many people are chugging along at much less than 100%, which is called malfunction. This malfunction causes disease and diseases lead to symptoms which cause many people to seek care from a medical doctor. In many cases, one would be prescribed a medication that would mask the symptom and make it easier to survive day to day life. We have to wonder, if the symptom is merely being masked, then how is the problem being solved? The Three T's of Chiropractic The beauty of chiropractic care is that the focus is on the lack of communication of the brain-body connection, which they refer to as vertebral subluxation or nerve interference, e.g. the cause of the symptoms. Most people choose chiropractic because they suffer from pain, however, while chiropractic can relieve pain symptoms, it is because the brain's communication to the body is restored that the pain decreases or disappears. Chiropractors do this by detecting and correcting vertebral subluxation. With consultations, assessments, exams, and adjustments, a chiropractor can educate patients on the major effects of what is called the three T's of chiropractic: \u00b7 Traumas, such as those caused by a car accident, sports injuries, repetitive motion or physical stress, and sometimes the trauma of childbirth. \u00b7 Toxins from food allergies or sensitivities, exposure to smoke, prescriptions and other pharmaceuticals, or household chemicals. \u00b7 Thoughts caused by emotional stress, arguments, a long work day, grueling work hours, or anxiety over events. Trauma is the most well-known and often the easiest to understand as the cause of subluxation. Forceful injuries or falls and car accidents are obviously traumatic to the body. We can also suffer from micro-traumas daily due to common behaviors. Poor habits such as: \u00b7 Carrying a heavy purse on the same shoulder or a heavy backpack \u00b7 Sleeping in the same poor position \u00b7 Wearing high heels \u00b7 Poor posture \u00b7 Crossing your legs \u00b7 Wallets in back pockets \u00b7 Looking down at your computer, tablet or cell phone. Exposures to toxins may not be as obvious, but it can interfere with the pathway of communication as well. Many of the toxins that we are exposed to are known central nervous system disruptors. Our bodies can become imbalanced through toxins found in what we eat and that are present in our environment. Toxins may enter the body through: \u00b7 Air pollution \u00b7 Chemical cleaning agents \u00b7 Our water supply \u00b7 GMO, processed, allergens, and inflammatory foods \u00b7 Vaccines and other medications \u00b7 Leaching from plastics \u00b7 Food sensitivities The third T, thoughts (what most of us think of as stress), can be one of the biggest contributors to subluxations. Stressful situations trigger a chemical imbalance in our bodies, increase blood pressure, and increased heart rate that can trigger muscle tension. Lack of recovery from this imbalance can disrupt every system of the body. Whether we are conscious about the stress or not, it will still have a negative effect. Even while on vacation, if we begin to think about our stressful work environment, our bodies can feel the effects. Our bodies start to react to triggers such as our spouses, coworkers, children, etc. as if they were Bengal tigers to run from. The Fourth T: Threshold The fact is we have to eliminate, prevent, or adapt to these stressors in our lives if we want our body to be healthy. When the body is in a state of balance, it is called homeostasis; this is the body's ability to maintain stability within while dealing with external changes. In other words, when our bodies are in a state of homeostasis, then we can have a strengthened threshold to outside stressors. Our physical homeostasis depends on a properly functioning nervous system. Without this proper function, our internal balance of the \"fight or flight\" (sympathetic) and \"rest and digest\" (parasympathetic) nervous systems are inhibited. When we seek care from a chiropractor and they remove subluxations through manual adjustments, we no longer have a malfunction of the brain communicating with the body. This gives our nervous system the opportunity to maintain a balanced, self-healing body with a heightened threshold for other stressors that may not be as easily avoided. It is important to see a chiropractor for regular adjustments, but that alone cannot remove traumas, toxins, and thoughts. We ourselves are responsible for evaluating and improving our lives to bring ourselves to a better state of health and well-being. As chiropractors, we encourage homeostasis through adjustments and recommendations on lifestyle. Among the many factors that play a role in our health, the studies of genetics and epigenetics are making great strides in helping us to understand the individual needs of each person's body. When looking at the role of heritable changes in our gene expression - as with epigenetics, we are able to better understand the underlying change in the DNA that has been passed down to us. We at Kadin Family Chiropractic & Wellness Center are committed to educating our patients. We help them to learn how to better express their genetics and epigenetics through education about a "}
