It is a gentle, natural, and holistic approach to health care. Homeopathy supports the natural healing by stimulating the body's innate ability to heal. Homeopathic remedies are made from plants, animals, minerals, and imponderables in a process of dynamization which is dilution and succussion of the substance. It is based on the concept of \"like cures like\", minimal dosage and totality of symptoms. As such you receive the minimal dosage required to heal you, which is matched to you as a person, and the symptoms you present. At [Serene Self PLLC](https://www.sereneself.com/about/), we believe that our health is determined by physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and spiritual elements. As such we aim to heal the whole person. Remedies are regulated by the FDA and created in homeopathic pharmacies under the supervision of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States ( [HPUS](http://www.hpus.com/what-is-homeopathy.php)).

I will discuss the remedy dosage with you in the consult when I start you on a remedy. Please call/text with questions if you are confused. Some people like to read and follow the labels of homeopathic remedies, especially for acute care. Please DO NOT take any other homeopathic remedy unless instructed while you are under my care. It may interfere with the action of the remedy that I recommended. Please don't hesitate to request a five-minute consultation over the phone if required. Avoid the following while in homeopathic treatment: - Avoid strong odors including oils and perfumes, Altoids or breath strip mints, menthol, eucalyptus (especially Hall's Mentholyptus), camphor, Tea Tree Oil, Tiger Balm, and Vicks VapoRub. They may interfere with the action of the remedy. - Sometimes, coffee and decaf coffee are an issue. It is recommended you avoid excessive intake of coffee. All other caffeinated beverages (green and black teas, sodas, etc.) are fine. Talk to me if this is a concern. - Deep energy therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic or other energetic therapies should not be started at the same time as homeopathic care. They are fine after the effect of the remedy is apparent and can be adequately evaluated. - Dental work, especially drilling, may inhibit the action of your remedy. If after a dentist appointment you feel your symptoms returning, please contact me so we can evaluate to remediate the situation. - Please store all homeopathic remedies in a cool, dry place. The bathroom is NOT recommended as the steam may adversely affect the remedy. Intake/ initial interview - Questions regarding the presenting problems - Questions regarding the history of the condition and any others related or unrelated to it. - An exploration of the physical, mental, and emotional state of you in general and with the condition you are consulting me about. - Review of all the body systems and any conditions related/seemingly unrelated. Remedy - It is possible that you might have to wait for 2-3 days before I recommend the remedy as it might require more study of your case. - After the initial intake I might call/email or text you with some questions as I study your case and decide on a well-matched remedy. You are not charged for these calls. - The remedy might be available online, at a local Health store, or PIMHA medicinary. - Instructions for taking the remedy and the dosage will be provided at the time of remedy recommendation. - I might make some recommendations regarding the maintaining causes of your condition, suggest other holistic treatments, or even refer you to your primary care physician or other medical professionals for testing/assessments. After taking the remedy - Since this is a highly individualized treatment and no two people react in the same way to any given remedy, I will want you to call me in the next 2-3 days, or at the most, after a week to check in to let me know how you are doing. - You may experience an aggravation of your symptoms in the first 10 days of taking the remedy. It's nothing to be alarmed about as it is a path to healing. Regardless, please do call to inform me. - Please do not expect an overnight improvement in constitutional or chronic cases. We work gradually towards healing. Depending on the condition it may take up to a year or more for healing to happen.
