Autism is a complex developmental disability in which the normal ability of a child to perceive, process, interpret and respond to external inputs is affected, making it harder for them to communicate and interact in a social environment. Children with this condition find it challenging to link words to their meanings. Parents will usually complain that their child isn't responding to their name when called or pays no heed when asked to follow simple commands. To date, there is no known definite cause of ASD. Suspected causes are: Genetics Vaccines Environmental pollutions Chronic inflammation of brain cells - neuron Poor neuro immunity Heavy metal toxins Active TORCH infection to mother during pregnancy. Even a minor event in the child's life is the event of that child's world because children are like wet cement; whatever falls on them makes an impression. These impressions are the root cause of the sufferings like changed behavior and ADHD, autism, aggressiveness, etc. Autistic children tend to experience and react abnormally to sensory inputs like loud sounds, bright light, touch, crowds, etc. and may show repetitive self-stimulatory behavior such as hand flapping, rocking, head banging, excessive jumping, spinning objects, etc. Autism is a spectrum disorder as children in this spectrum may experience a wide range of symptoms and their level of disability can vary considerably.

Modern medicine has no cure for Autism but by giving homeopathic medicines, there is a significant improvement in Autistic symptoms. Homeopathic medicines act at the genetic level thereby improving the symptoms of the patient without any side effects. Based on our past experiences, we have achieved a 54% success rate in overall cases of Autism. Improvement differs from case to case depending on several factors on how much we are able to understand the child's symptoms and how does the child responds to our medicines. Autism usually manifests itself at the age of 15-18 months. Though some children may show symptoms even before 1 year of age. Primary Autism is a type of Autism where the cause is during pregnancy or during labor. In such cases, a very observant mother can notice symptoms as early as 7-8 months of age.

While it is a challenging task for moderate to severe forms of autism but with the help of homeopathic medicines these forms can also be nicely taken care of. Our motto at Homoeocare is \"A journey from being Dependant to Being Independent.\" A mild autistic child can go to a normal school whereas moderate and severely autistic children require special school. After the successful homeopathic treatment, as the child shows improvement he/she can be shifted to normal school. The main problem here in such cases is the education system, which adopts a policy age bar policy for admission in schools. So if the child is below or over his age, then he is denied admission to the school. Now in Autism, the child is already having speech and language difficulty. After some time when the child improves, and he is ready for schooling, the school is not ready to admit him because he is too old for his age to get admission. So this more of a technical problem and not a disease problem that the child is not able to study. We suggest parents adopt Open schooling in such cases. Most autistic children have no problem in hearing and therefore they can speak. There might be delays in speech and when the speech is present, their meaningful speech is often absent. They might either not respond or repeat certain words. They have difficulty in understanding and giving proper and appropriate responses.

If the child is below 5 years of age and is speaking one or two words or has a good vocabulary, such cases with a proper homeopathic medicine for autism, do develop normal speech. Yes.
