Joint Regulatory Conferences: The Ultimate Connection PDA has thousands of members who spend a great deal of their time tracking regulatory requirements around the world and communicating with regulators about quality and GMP issues. Over PDA's long history, the membership has found that coming together through the association to participate in the regulatory process was an effective and preferable way of communicating with the regulatory bodies. Many members volunteer to serve on committees to develop comments. This regulatory activity is embodied in the third element of PDA's 2010 Strategic Plan, which states: \"REGULATION\u2014Our regulatory activities are scientifically and technically focused, and current information is communicated to our members.\" This is further defined with four criteria, the first two calling for: 1) the provision of science- and technology-based input on regulations and guidelines related to PDA strategic areas, utilizing PDA's volunteer and membership base, and; 2) maintaining valuable and effective relationships with global regulators, and educate members on current expectations. Over the past two decades, PDA's membership has moved beyond just commenting on new regulations and guidance. Through hard work and careful planning, PDA has been able to host joint conferences with regulators, provide specialized training to regulatory authorities, and include regulatory officials in its processes for developing technical reports. These closer forms of cooperation all started with PDA's involve- ment with the US FDA regulatory process, which led to the creation of the PDA/FDA Joint Regulatory Conference nearly a quarter of a century ago. It did not take long for this conference to become one of the most important annual events hosted by PDA for its membership. Attendance at the meeting grows each year, as does the num- ber of attendees and speakers representing not just FDA, but regulatory bodies from around the world. Over the years, the PDA/FDA Joint Regulatory Conference has focused on key topics important to the agency and the industry, including aseptic processing, GMPs for the 21st Century, ICH topics, and supply chain. This year's event is no different with the focus on implementing and advancing a sustainable global quality culture. Sessions have been tailored so attendees receive updates on global regulatory strategies from speakers representing FDA and other regulatory bodies and practical take-home strategies on how to meet the regulatory challenges from industry speakers. Following the meeting, the PDA Training and Research Institute will host a number of courses on similar topics for those who need to drill deeper. A highlight of the 2012 PDA/FDA Conference is the post-conference workshop, Responsibilities of Executive Management (Operations and Quality)\u2014Implementing the Principles of ICH Q10 2012 PDA/FDA Pharmaceutical Quality Systems. This event is designed to provide senior management and operations personnel an understand- ing of the framework established by ICH Q10 for the creation of an efficient and robust quality system that meets regulatory expectations around the world. In recent years, PDA and FDA have increased the number of cosponsored events held annually to provide more focused attention to hot-button issues like sup- ply chain and pharmaceutical glass quality. The hard work and outreach of PDA's European members has formed bridges with regulators throughout Europe as well, and the formation of the European equivalent to the PDA/FDA Joint Regulatory Conference\u2014the PDA/EMA Conference, which has been held approximately every other year since 2005. It will be held next in December 2012. Over the last decade, PDA's focus has been on building relationships with regula- tors throughout the world to meet the needs of our members globally. We held a PIC/S workshop earlier this year and have had meetings and trainings with regulators from Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and many others. It is these activities that exemplify the membership's tireless focus on \"Connecting People, Science and Regulation.\" zRichard Johnson is president of the Parenteral Drug Association (PDA).

Ten laboratories have been awarded two-year grants to develop tissue chip technology, with part of the funding coming from the recently established National Center for Advancing Translational Science. Tissue chips are microchips ranging from the size of a quarter to the size of a house key lined with living tissue. The goal is to accurately model the three-dimensional structure and function of human organs, reproducing the complex interactions, both chemical and biomechanical, that occur among different cell types within an organ system. The chips could then be used to predict drug toxicity and efficacy more accurately and at lower cost than current methods. The 10 funded projects will model organ systems important for metabolic or toxicology studies, including heart, liver, kidney, and brain. In addition, some of the funded projects aim to model cancer, in the belief that simulating the micorenvironment in which tumor growth and metastasis occur can help better predict the tumor's response to a therapy. Seven additional awards were given to explore the potential of stem and progenitor cells to differentiate into multiple cell types that represent the cellular architecture within organ systems. These differentiated cells could then act as a source of cells to populate tissue chips. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is conducting a separate but parallel program. It has awarded two grants, one to the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and the other to MIT, both of which also are NIH tissue chip grant recipients, to develop engineering platforms capable of integrating 10 or more organ systems. \u2014Amy RitterReport from Brazil Brazil's regulatory health authority, Anvisa, plans to establish quality requirements for locally produced pharmaceutical excipients, Anvisa told BioPharm International. The organization publicly released a draft proposal on this policy on June 4, 2012 and the public had 60 days to comment. There is no set timing, however, for the process, according to Anvisa's regulatory and health surveillance specialist Simone de Oliveira Reis Rodero, as several steps are needed before the actual publication. Debate on responsibility According to information from the Pharmaceutical Trade Union of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sindusfarma, drug manufacturers are currently responsible for the quality of excipients included in the drugs they produce. Currently, says the Union, the sector lacks specific rules for such products and the pharmaceutical industry uses only a portion of the overall excipients produced in Brazil (other sectors such as health and beauty products use them as well). Many producers may not be interested in complying with all requirements coming from the pharmaceutical industry. The discussion is likely to continue as the industry and regulators debate competing interests and opinions. The need for quality requirements Anvisa is responsible for developing standards, authorizing pharmaceutical company operations, and for supervising the quality of pharmaceutical excipients used in drug prducts. Anvisa does this through health inspections to ensure compliance with quality controls in the drug-manufacturing process. Rodero added that Anvisa has started a database of active pharmaceutical excipients from companies that manufacture, import, export, fractionate, stock, expedite, distribute, and pack such products. \"Good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical drugs do not include their pharma excipients as criterion for manufacturing differs,\" says Rodero. Therefore, a set of clear rules is being suggested to regulate the excipient sector, Rodero says. \"The norms are not being requested by international organizations. The need came up due to the lack of regulation, which ma kes the harmonization process difficult during inspections. We requested that health authorities in countries that hold technical cooperation agreements with Brazil to send information on how excipients are treated regarding local norms and authorizations,\" says Rodero, adding that the responses are now being evaluated and the data consolidated. The draft proposal, made public on June 4, 2012, was written based on documents from the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council-Europe, the World Health Organization, and the US Pharmacopeial Convention, revealed Rodero. Adverse reactions related to excipients According to Anvisa, because excipients can affect the final quality of a given drug, the establishment of an \"Resolu\u00c7\u00e3o da Diretoria Colegiada\" (RDC\u2014Anvisa's Collegiate Board of Directors Resolution) is important for minimizing health risks involved during the manufacturing process. Standardizing GMPs and practices for the Brazilian sector, qualifying suppliers, and strengthening local producers are part of the goal as well, states the health authority. Excipients used in pharmaceuticals may act as antiadherents, binders, coatings, disintegrant s, fillers, flavours, colors, lubricants, glidants, sorbents, preservatives, and sweeteners, according to pharmaceutical data from Anvisa. Discovery Pipeline 10 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Global News Pfizer Settles with DOJ and SEC Pfizer has resolved with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) matters related to certain improper payments in the operations of two of its subsidiaries outside the United St ates. A Pfizer subsidiary (Pfizer H.C.P . Corporation) will enter into a deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and pay a fine of $15 million. Under the terms of a civil settlement with the SEC, Pfizer agreed to a disgorgement of profits of $16 million and prejudgment interest of $10.3 million. The DOJ declined to bring a criminal action against Pfizer. The DOJ settlement with Pfizer H.C.P . Corporation covers improper conduct in Bulgaria, Croatia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The Pfizer SEC civil settlement covers improper conduct in all of these countries as well as in Italy, China, the Czech Republic, and Serbia. As part of its agreement with the DOJ, Pfizer H.C.P. Corporation will continue to cooperate with the DOJ for a period of two years in connection with its settlement. In a separate civil settlement with the SEC, Pfizer's Wyeth subsidiary has agreed to a disgorgement of profits of $17.2 million and prejudgment interest of $1.66 million to resolve issues involving certain improper payments in the operations of four subsidiaries outside the US. Pfizer conducted a risk-based Foreign Corrupt Practices Act due-diligence review of Wyeth's global operations after it acquired the company in late 2009, and voluntarily disclosed these issues to the US government, according to an Aug. 7, 2012, Pfizer press release. Pfizer's postacquisition due diligence review of Wyeth identified certain improper payments in China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Pakistan. \"There is no allegation by either DOJ or SEC that anyone at Pfizer's or Wyeth's corporate headquarters knew of or approved the conduct at issue before Pfizer took appropriate action to investigate and report it, \" said Pfizer in its release. \"As soon as these local activities came to the attention of Pfizer's corporate headquarters, they were voluntarily brought to the attention of the DOJ and SEC. Today's settlements are focused solely on these local activities.\" All the conduct at issue was investigated by Pfizer and voluntarily disclosed to the US government, according to the company. Pfizer began self-reporting to the US government in 2004 after the discovery of certain improper payments that had been made by employees of a recently acquired Pfizer affiliate in Croatia. Pfizer legal and compliance staff, outside counsel and auditors, conducted an internal investigation and re gularly briefed DOJ and SEC on its findings, said Pfizer in its release. \u2014Patricia Van ArnumAccording to Rodero, the need for local producers of excipients to comply with quality requirements is important to increase public health safety because excipients can generate side effects or affect the final pharmaceutical product. Excipients in drugs sold in Brazil were responsible for cases of adverse drug reactions (ADR) in adults and children, according to a study conducted in 2004 by the Federal University of Cear\u00e1. Industry reaction Brazil's pharmaceutical industry professionals are asking whether a pharmaceutical resolution for excipients would affect producers. If approved, established companies would have a period of one year to comply with the new rules. According to Anvisa, changes would facilitate issuance of authorizations and health licenses, because standards would be put in place and minimum quality requirements needed for guaranteeing the quality of excipients would be absolutely clear. However, Brazil's National Pharmaceutical Laboratories Association (ALANAC) protests: \"ALANAC supports any and all regulation initiati ves as long as they improve the quality of the feedstock used in producing [pharmaceutical] drugs and [only] if it can stimulate industry competition and the development of local production,\" said Henrique Uchi\u00f3 Tada, executive technical director for ALANAC. \"Anvisa's public consultation number No. 31/2012 on an RDC resolution for GMPs of pharmaceutical excipients defines that rules will only be applied to the local production, however, most of the excipients used in the pharma industry are imported,\" complains Tada. According to Tada, the association fears that the real objective of having an RDC\u2014achieving quality assurance\u2014will not be obtained if the rules only apply to excipients produced locally. Just like the RDC for pharmaceutical drugs, for example, which is valid for local and imported medicaments, \"We understand that this proposal...should also be valid for products manufactured abroad,\" says Tada. According to the director of ALANAC, similar rules for excipients are not applied by other countries' health authorities as the GMP for pharmaceutical drugs already require that industry suppliers be qualified and guarantees quality controls during all production processes, he adds. \u2014Hellen Berger is a business writer based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Follow us on Twitter@BioPharmIntl Join us on LinkedIn/BioPharm International September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 11Global News Novartis in Cancer Collaboration with University of Pennsylvania Novartis has entered into a global collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania to research, develop, and commercialize targeted cancer therapies. In particular, the two parties will focus on targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapies. As part of the agreement, Novartis will acquire exclusive rights to the university's investigational CAR therapy, which targets a protein associated with several B-cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The therapy is currently being studied in a clinical trial. Novartis will also gain an exclusive worldwide license for any other CARs developed through the collaboration. As part of the collaboration, Novartis and the university intend to jointly establish a new R&D facility, which will be located on the university's Pennsylvania campus, called the Center for Advanced Cellular Therapies. A specific focus of the center will be to develop and manufacture adoptive T-cell immunotherapies. In addition, as part of the agreement, Novartis will provide an up-front payment, research funding, funding for the establishment of the R&D center and milestone payments for the achievement of certain milestones. Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, said in a statement, \"Immunotherapy is one of the exciting frontiers in cancer research and the CAR technology developed by the team at Penn has shown early promise as a new way for treating cancer.\" \u2014Stephanie SuttonElan to Spin Off Discovery Sciences Elan Corporation announced plans to spin off its discovery unit and Neotope Biosciences division to create an independent entity focused on R&D. Discovery sciences will be incorporated in a new company called Neotope Biosciences that will focus on identifying and translating targets into potential therapies for chronic degenerative and other related disease areas. This entity will continue to focus on innovation, differentiated scientific advancement, intellectual property creation, and translational capability to transform science into clinical assets. The second company, Elan Corporation, will continue the development and commercialization of Tysabri, a monoclonal antibody therapy marketed in collaboration with Biogen Idec for multiple sclerosis and other potential indications. In addition, the company will continue to develop ELND005, a small molecule asset set to enter Phase II for a range of neuropsychiatry and symptomatic diseases that targets non-amyloid pathologies. Elan Corporation will also oversee continued interest in Janssen AI, which, with Pfizer, manages a portfolio of biologic products in early clinical development. \"With Elan's commitment to capitalize Neotope's Bioscience, our highly talented scientific team, who have previously discovered Tsyabri and an approach to immunotherapy for Alzheimer's, will have the resources and time to advance programs for chronic degenerative diseases, such as synuclein for Parkinson's disease, along the drug development stages and provide opportunities for investors to participate in this journey,\" said Dr. Lars Ekman, chairman designate of Neotope Biosciences in the press release. He continued, \"In the longer term, the team's heightened focus and dedication to translating unique scientific insight into clinical programs will provide benefits to the field of life sciences across a broad array of diseases for the ultimate benefit of patients.\" \u2014Amy RitterThe UK is to invest \u00a38 million ($12.5 million) in a new center that will be dedicated to stem-cell biology and medicine, with the aim of developing new therapeutic approaches to illnesses that currently have no effective treatments. The funding will come from the UK's Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, two of the country's largest funders of medical research. According to a press statement, stem cells have shown promise in potential treatments for liver disease, diabetes, blindness, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative disorders, and can be used to study the mechanisms of human disease. The institute, named The Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, will bring together research scientists, technology specialists, and doctors, and will principally focus on the areas of pluripotency, haematopoiesis, epithelial tissues, neural, and cardiovascular stem cells. \"Our aim is to close the knowledge gap and to drive stem-cell research towards clinical applications,\" Austin Smith, the director of the institute, said in the statement. \"The world-class facilities will attract the best international talent from the fields of stem-cell biology and regenerative medicine to pursue this goal.\" An 8000-m 2 facility is being purpose-built for the institute on the University of Cambridge's Biomedical Research Campus. The location, close to one of Europe's largest biotechnology clusters, will provide ample opportunity for industry collaboration. \u2014Stephanie SuttonUK Invests in Stem-Cell Institute 12 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Global News EMD Millipore is GermanyYou Direct.

All reserved.14 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Regulatory Beat Digital Vision/Getty Images Drug counterfeiting has become big business for international criminals, lured by easy profits and relatively low risk of prosecution and penalties. Analysts calculate that counterfeit drugs cause 100,000 deaths worldwide each year and provide approximately $75 billion in revenue for ille-gal operators. Distribution of phony medi-cines has become such a global public health threat that it made the agenda of the Group of Eight (G8) world leaders at their May 2012 annual meeting. G8's concluding declaration supported exchange of information on rogue Internet pharmacy sites and on methods to combat counterfeit medical products. The Chinese government is looking to coun- ter its reputation as the lead global source of fake and adulterated medicines by crack-ing down on counterfeiters of drugs and healthcare products. In a raid last month, some 18,000 law officers detained nearly 2000 suspects and seized approximately $182 mil-lion in illegal remedies for diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and other conditions. Unfortunately, a similar effort in 2011 led to the arrest of 114 suspects and seizure of $30 million in bogus products, but that apparently did not deter the counterfeiters. An EU report on customs enforce- m en t in 20 1 1 s ta t es tha t m edi cin es accounted for the most (i.e., 24%) of detained articles. The document notes that counterfeit drug enforce-ment units broke up rings in Spain and the UK and uncovered fake HIV medications and unauthorized asthma drug inhalers. Counterfeiters n o l o ng er f ocus j us t o n \"lif es ty l e \" drugs for erectile dysfunction and weight-loss, but market medicines for a range of serious conditions. MORE OPPORTUNITIES Despite more active anticounterfeiting efforts, shortages of key medicines in the US and Europe have created new opportunities for illicit traders, while ever-longer manufacturer supply chains open the door to diversion and theft. In the past two years, FDA has uncov-ered Internet sales of counterfeit Abbott pain medicine Vicodin, fake Phentermine tablets, and a phony version of the \"morning after pill\" called Evital. In May, FDA warned consumers and health professionals that Internet opera-tors were selling counterfeit versions of Teva Pharmaceutical's Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine). Severe shortages of the short-acting treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder prompted patients to seek new sources, but many of these products ei th er la ck a cti v e ingredi en t o r co n tain dan-gerous substances. Patients and physicians also are attracted to unknown suppliers by lower prices, as seen in the wave of counterfeit Avastin (bevaci-zumab), Roche's cancer therapy, which was purchased by dozens of US oncologists. FDA continued to uncover sales of the counterfeit product, in some cases under Avastin's Turkish brand name, Altuzan, despite widely pub-lished warnings in February that the phony vials lacked the key active ingredient. FDA has sent letters to more than 70 doctors and Campaign Mounts to Curb Counterfeit Drugs Manufacturers and regulators struggle to control phony versions of crucial medicines. Jill Wechsler is BioPharm International's Washington editor, Chevy Chase, MD, 301.656.4634, jwechsler@advanstar.com. Agency officials continue to press for a Roundup New FDA generic drugs chief Just in time to launch a host of new generic-drug regulatory programs and processes authorized by the generic drug user fee program (GDUFA), FDA's Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has a new leader. Helen Winkle, director of CDER's Office of Pharmaceutical Science, announced in July that Gregory Geba would head OGD, replacing OPS deputy director Keith Webber, who was acting director of OGD for more than a year. Geba is an MD and comes to FDA from Sanofi, where as deputy chief medical officer, he was involved with the drug approval process, clinical-research programs, manufacturing quality standards, and regulatory policies. That experience will be valuable in leading an expanding and changing OGD. Olympic games spur biomarker research It looks like there will be some lasting benefits from pharmaceutical and biotech company participation in drug doping detection programs for ath- letes at the London Olympics. A drug-testing lab provided by UK-based GlaxoSmithKline for the games will be developed into the Phenome research center to study how genetics and the environment affect human metabolism. Researchers will look for patterns in ph ysical and chemical markers that link to genetics, lifestyle, and environment and can serve as biomarkers to pre- dict disease risk and outcomes. The UK Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research w ill provide \u00a310 million (US$15.7 million) for the program, and another \u00a320 million (US$31.4 million ) will come from mass-spec supply firms Bruker and Waters Corp., as part of a public-private partnership with King's College London and Imperial College. Separately, the International Fe deration of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) are expanding their collaboration with the World Anti- Doping Authority (WADA) for detecting and preventing misuse of perfor- mance-enhancing drugs. The program al ready has helped WADA identify suspect components of some current therapies and now will focus more on keeping ingredients with doping potential out of pipeline therapies. A new \"Points to Consider\" document ai ms to help pharmaceutical and bio- technology companies identify suspect compounds so that manufacturers could revise the formulation or help WADA develop detection methods. The guide identifies classes of agents with potential for performance enhancement misuse and advice for evaluating these risks in pre-clinical and clinical development. WADA will help companies develop strategies for testing and for controlling access to potentially risky therapies. Drugs save money Low-cost generic drugs and discounts for Medicare are cutting consumer pharmacy bills\u2014good news for payers, but mixed news for manufacturers. Generic drugs saved patients $193 billion last year and more than $1 trillion over the past decade, according to analysis by IMS Health for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA). A lot of patent expirations generated a 22% jump in savings from generics last year, the biggest increase since 1998. In addition, Medicare officials are highlighting discounts on drugs pre- scribed to beneficiaries caught in the Part D \"donut hole\" as a key benefit of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Medicare enrollees saved almost $4 billion in lower drug costs since the reform law was enacted in 2010: $946 million in 2010 from $250 one-time rebates to seniors who hit the coverage gap; over $2.3 billion last year from the 50% discount on gap drugs provided by phar- maceutical manufacturers; and $687 million in discounts as of late July this year. The bulk of the Part D savings involved chronic treatments for diabetes, high cholesterol, asthma, blood pressure, and anti-clotting agents. Brand-generic deals on the docket The Supreme Court may get to weigh in on the legality of much-debated pay- for-delay arrangements between branded and generic-drug manufacturers following a ruling by the Philadelphia federal appeals court that the deals are anticompetitive. Manufacturers on both sides claim that these agreements save money and end up bringing competitive products to market earlier than under a lengthy litigious process, as in this case involving payments by Schering-Plough (now part of Merck) to delay generic versions of its K-Dur potassium supplement. But members of the Federal Trade Commission, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers object to patent settlements as a way for branded firms to extend their monopolies. Several other federal circuit courts have ruled in favor of manufacturers over the past decade, and the conflicting decision from Philadelphia could prompt the High Court to consider the issue. Similar marketing arrangements are on the table in the European Union, where antitrust regulators are challenging a pay-for-delay agree- ment involving Danish drug company Lundbeck and several generics makers. The European Commission also is weighing charges against other branded firms as part of a larger investigation into anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug-device combos raise challenges A proliferation of combination products such as prefilled syringes and certain implantables raise important quality and regulatory issues that were examined at the WCBP CMC Strategy Forum at the National Institutes of Health in July. The worldwide market for prefilled syringes, for example, doubled to two billion units from 2005 to 2010. This creates policy and development challenges for FDA and industry, including formulation considerations, design and character- ization expectations, clinical testing, and regulatory requirements. Even though FDA centers for drugs, biologics, and devices strive to collaborate on combi- nation products, the lead center can make a difference in testing procedures, application fees, and other issues. Manu facturers should analyze interactions between the device/biologic/drug components, advised Kathy Lee of the Office of Biological Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This should involve assessment of potential leachables between the product and the injector, of drug-injector interaction over time, of corrosion from the drug or biological, of seal integrity, and of the impact of the device on product quality using release and characterization tests. Some of these issues may be clarified further in FDA regulations on cGMP requirements for combination products expected in a few months. Recent FDA guidance ICH Q8, Q9, & Q10 Questions and Answers from Training Sessions, final guidance (FDA, updated July 25, 2012). September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 17Regulatory Beat clinics in 28 states warning against purchasing the illegal product and launched a major investigation of alleged distribu-tor Canada Drugs and other par-ties (1). Several online pharmacy operators were arrested, along with importers and distributors. TRACK AND TRACE ON HOLD FDA believes that the best way to keep counterfeit, diverted, and adulterated drugs out of the US supply chain is to establish a comprehensive drug track-and-trace system that can account for legitimate products at every step in the distribution process. In testimony last March before the House Energy & Commerce Health subcommittee, Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), emphasized the need for a system that can pro-vide complete records on all par-ties involved in distribution after a product leaves the manufac-turer. FDA can set standards for drug identification and authenti-cation, as seen in recent guidance for manufacturers to implement standardized numerical identifi-cation for prescription drug pack-ages, Woodcock explained. But the agency lacks explicit authority to require implementation of a national tracking system through- out the supply chain. Without such a system, added Allan Coukell of the Pew Charitable Trusts' Pew Health Group, there is no way to check whether an indi- vi d ual vial o r bo ttl e is a u th en ti c or fake. Industry opposes such an a p p r o a c h a s u n w o r k a b l e a n d too costly and blocked it from inclusion in the FDA Safety & Innovation Act (FDASIA) approved by Congress in June. Manufacturers claim that the tech- nology to support a fully electronic tracking system is unreliable, and that establishing such capabilities would raise the cost of medicines by billions of dollars. Pharmacists, moreover, protested having to check the authenticity of every dru g uni t co ming in fro m w h o l e-salers and distributors. The Pharmaceutical Distribution Security Alliance (PDSA), backed by manufacturers and wholesal-ers, instead supports the RxTEC model that calls for manufactur-ers to establish data systems that hold individual drug unit serial numbers. While PDSA claims this system could help regula-tory authorities validate products, detect counterfeits, and manage drug recalls and returns, Coukell objected that because the thou-sands of bottles in a lot may travel through multiple distributors, the tracking system needs to link unit serial numbers to shipping cases in order to know where a black-mar-ket vendor obtained illegal goods. The Senate proposed to include the RxTEC proposal in its ini-tial version of FDASIA, but the House did not agree, and pres-sure to approve a final bill by the end of June prompted the legis-lators to drop the issue. Instead, FDASIA contains important pro-visions that can help block the import of violative products and imposes stiffer penalties on coun-terfeiters. FDASIA allows FDA to destroy certain counterfeit or adulterated imports instead of having to return them to sender and strengthens requirements for manufacturers to notify FDA of stolen products or evidence of counterfeiting. Trafficking in counterfeit drugs was made a criminal offense, and persons who knowingly and intentionally produce counterfeits or sell them would face fines up to $4 million and 20 years in jail. These added authorities can help FDA uncover and prosecute drug counterfeiters, now a task for the Office of Drug Security, Integrity and Recalls (ODSIR) in CDER's Office of Compliance. FDA also continues to encour- age manufacturers to incorpo-rate physical-chemical identifiers in t o dru g p rod u cts , as seen in a guidance issued in October 2011 that describes considerations for adopting such formulations for solid oral dosage forms. Agency officials continue to press for a more comprehensive drug-tracking system, while also seeking additional opportunities to collaborate with other gov-ernment agencies and interna-tional organizations to combat counterfeiters. FDA works with the Commerce Department anti-counterfeiting task force and federal law enforcement and cus-toms agencies, as well as with the World Health Organization, to build global capacity for mon-itoring supply-chain threats. The agency participated in an INTERP O L- l e d ex e r ci s e t o t ar -get websites supplying illegal and dangerous drugs. A report from the Institute of Medicine due in 2013 will out-line further anticounterfeiting proposals for collective action among regulatory authorities, along with actions that the experts feel that industry should address. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg will dis-cuss these and other efforts to combat drug counterfeiting at the annual Partnership for Safe Medicines Interchange at the end of this month. All parties will be looking for effective and afford-able strategies for improving drug tracking through the sup-ply chain and for distinguishing genuine from adulterated medi-cal products.

(July 20, 2012). 18 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Perspectives on Outsourcing Don Farrall/Getty ImagesThe global economy and financial system are not in great shape. The European debt crisis rolls on and on, driving European economies into reces-sion. China's growth has slowed to \"only\" 7%, but that slowdown is enough to reduce growth prospects of countries that export to China. India's economy is feeling the effects of institutional problems, such as corruption and poor infrastructure. The US economy is growing, but at a rate too slow to bring down unemployment. The apparent incompetence of political leaders has not improved the mood. The inability of the US Congress to address the nation's debt and economic issues and the uncertainty surrounding the upcom-ing national elections have created great uncertainty and caused business executives to scale back investment and employment plans. The failure of European political lead-ers to resolve their problems has undermined investor confidence and created volatility in financial markets. Even in China, where the Communist party maintains a strong grip, the impending change in leadership has added an element of uncertainty. In the not-so-distant past, such macroeconomic developments would have had little impact on the bio/pharmaceutical indus-try. Global bio/pharmaceutical companies were generating large profits from patented blockbuster medications and pouring them back into expansive R&D pro-grams and investments in new laboratory and manufacturing facilities. People had to take their medicine and the effectiveness of drugs, such as Lipitor and Plavix, ensured that governments and private insurers would continue to pay for them regardless of price. Attracted by the returns on successful new pipeline candidates and flush with cash, investors poured record amounts of capital into early- and mid-stage companies. FULLY EXPOSED Today, having fallen over the patent cliff, the bio/pharmaceutical industry finds itself fully exposed to the vagaries of the macro-economy at a very inopportune time. Not only have companies lost the big profits from blockbuster drugs, but they also face increased pressure from governments and private payers who are desperate to reduce healthcare expenditures. Drug prices are being forced down, generic substitution is accelerating, and it is increasingly difficult to get coverage for expensive new drugs. Smaller companies are being buffeted by the uncertainty in financial markets. Venture-capital funds have less money to invest as their traditional investors have become more risk-averse, and venture capi- talists themselves have focused on less-risky investments with faster payoffs, such as social-media companies. In instances where they are still investing in bio/pharmaceuti- cal start-ups, they are favoring companies with later-phase candidates with strong near- term prospects for outlicensing. Funding Bio/pharmaceutical companies have been forced to remake their business models.The Macro View The weak global economy adds to the challenges of bio/pharma companies and their suppliers. Jim Miller is president of PharmSource Information Services, Inc., and publisher of Bio/Pharmaceutical Outsourcing Report, tel. 703.383.4903, Twitter@ 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm on Outsourcing by way of initial public offer- ings is scarce. The number of bio/pharmaceutical initial public offerings is way down, and most have lost value since they were launched. These pressures could not come at a worse time for an industry desperately trying to maintain profitability in order to fund new product develop-ment. Pipelines at many bio/pharmaceutical companies are sparse, and R&D operations have been notably unproductive despite significant cost-cutting. High profile drugs continue to fail at Phase III despite the \"kill-it-early\" philosophy that guides decision-making at most bio/pharmaceutical companies. So, instead of a stable mac- roenvironment in which to transition to the next genera-tion of products, bio/pharma-ceutical companies must fight fierce headwinds to make prog-ress. They have been forced to remake their business models not just to address the new scientific and clinical realities but also to reflect their closer connection to a world that cannot afford to maintain the rapid growth in healthcare expenditures. The business model changes thus far have been dramatic. Global bio/pharmaceutical companies now pursue growth opportunities in niche prod- ucts, generic drugs, and emerg- ing markets instead of traditional blockbusters. They are downsiz- ing their remote R&D campuses while building their presence in urban centers of medical research where their research- ers can be continuously exposed to new ideas and technologies (a model that other knowledge-based in d us tri es ha v e l o ng su b- scribed to). They are rebuilding R&D processes to more thor- oughly assess new candidates before graduating them to expensive clinical development stages. They are re-engineering supply chains to reduce costs and increase security. Although still dependent on physicians to prescribe their medications, they are looking for ways to interact more directly with patients. LINKED FORTUNES If the fortunes of bio/pharma-ceutical companies are now closely tied to the macro-envi-ronment, then too are the for-tunes of CROs and CMOs. CMO revenues and margins are directly impacted by the declin-ing unit volumes and growing customer demands in that they help absorb the lower prices being paid by governments and insurers. Providers of preclini-cal toxicology and API process-development services have seen their revenues stagnate as more rigorous graduation criteria and decreasing venture-capital sup-port have reduced the level of early-development activity. In these changing times, CROs and CMOs have two choices: they can continue their traditional strategies of passively bobbing up and down on the rising and ebb-ing tides of the industry or they can seize the opportunity to help bio/pharmaceutical companies deal with their increased expo-sure to the macro-environment. Clinical CROs have shown the way on how service provid-ers can help bio/pharmaceutical companies adapt to their new realities. Although originally just a so urce o f su pp l em en tal la bo r , they have come to set the stan- dards for quality and innovation in the running of clinical tri-als. In particular, they have led the way in the use of informa-tion technology to revolutionize the way in which clinical data are collected and analyzed. CRO-driven technology innovation has enabled faster review and analysis of clinical data, flexi-ble trials designs, and patient-reported data using mobile devices. Similarly, clinical packagers have been in the forefront of adopting sophisticated packaging and printing and logistics tech-nologies and practices to reduce the costs of clinical-trial materi-als while ensuring supplies get to patients in a timely manner. All of this has enabled clinical research to be conducted faster and more cost-effectively. C M O s h a v e l a g g e d b e h i n d other service segments in identi-fying technologies and practices that can help bio/pharmaceutical companies respond to the chang-ing macro environment. In par-ticular, they need to find more flexible and lower cost manu-facturing solutions to address a medical marketplace that is more focused than ever before on managing total expenditures. The ability and willingness of CROs and CMOs to contribute to the remaking of the bio/phar-maceutical business model, and especially to the ability of bio/pharmaceutical companies to respond to the macro-environ-ment, is likely to determine their long-term success. CMO revenues and margins are directly impacted by declining unit volumes and growing customer demands.20 BioPharm International September 2012Product & Service Innovations Advertorial A safer future starts here and now.

This month, Michiel E. Ultee, PhD, of Laureate Biopharmaceutical Services gives an update on \"Hybridoma Technology Prducts: Required Virus Testing,\" written by Eva Joner and Gary D. Christiansen in 1988, and the advance of monoclonal antibodies . Twenty-five years ago in Biopharm International E. Joner and G.D. Christiansen published an overview of the requirements and rationale for bio-safety testing of hybridomas and the resul-tant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made from them. Although the authors alluded to regulatory guidance documents for hybrid-oma and recombinant cell lines, their focus was on hybridomas, which at that time were the dominant technology for the produc-tion of antibodies. Since 1988, the balance has shifted dramatically in favor of produc-tion using recombinant technology in such well-known cell lines as the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Requirements for bio-safety testing are similar, however, and the need for stringent safety testing, including viral-clearance validation, has not changed. The industry has seen remarkable changes in the production of antibodies since 1988, beginning with the exponential increase of titers from cell culture. Both basal and feed media have improved markedly, allowing cells to grow well in suspension and reach high cell densities. These advances in cell- culture technology have also allowed the biopharmaceutical industry to stop using serum in cultures, thereby reducing risk from this animal-derived, heterogeneous component. Greater understanding of molec-ular genetics has led to new techniques to dramatically enhance expression of recom-binant proteins within each production cell, by coupling to highly transcribed genes or enhancing the transcription of genes by other means. Cell-culture titers are the product of the cell density times the productivity of each cell. Thanks to this multiplicative effect, titers have grown 100-500 fold in 25 years. Today, antibody titers are no longer expressed in mg/L, but g/L, with 2-5 g/L being the benchmark for good expression. Such high titers have further wid-ened the applicability of antibodies by lower-ing their cost of pro-duction. DOWNSTREAM ADVANCES Major changes have taken place on the downstream side of mAb processing as View \"Hybridoma Technology Products: Required Virus Testing,\" by Eva Joner and Gary D. Christiansen at BioPharmInternational.com/ Retrospectives. A 25-Year Retrospective on Bioprocessing Monoclonal Antibodies Today, monoclonal antibodies are the leading category of biopharmaceutical.September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 23 well. Early processes relied on slow chromatographic supports often run in the cold room, with operators dressed accord-ingly. Newer resins with faster flow properties, more robust polymers, and higher loading capacities have freed antibody processors from the cold room. More recent innovations using membrane supports for flow-through steps allow even faster processing times. The launch of nanometer-pore filtration in the early 1990s introduced a robust viral-clearance step, which added greatly to the safety of antibody and other protein pharmaceuticals. HUMANIZING ANTIBODIES The progressive humanization of antibodies is another success story that has enabled these ver-satile and exquisitely selective proteins to progress into large- scale therapeutics. Early anti-bodies were typically produced from murine gener-ated fusion of myeloma cells with antibody-producing lym-phocytes from immunized mice. The resulting murine antibodies were seen as foreign by human patients, resulting in a human - anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response in most cases. This unfortunate but understand-able side effect greatly restricted their applications as biopharma- ceuticals. Molecular biologists addressed this restriction by developing techniques to create chime-ric structures, in which three-fourths of the murine IgG antibody structure, the con-stant regions, were replaced with the corresponding human construct. Further advances led to additional humanization of antibodies, first through selec-tive amino-acid substitution and later through the construc-tion of fully human antibodies. These changes greatly minimized the patient immune responses to injected antibodies, enabling their widespread and repeat use. Today, mAbs are the leading category of biopharmaceutical. Their domination is likely to continue, based on the rich pipe-line of antibodies in develop-ment. The early promise of mAbs as therapeutics, the \"magic bul-l et\" co in ed by P a ul Er li ch m o re than 100 years ago, took the great advances in biology, genet-ics, biochemistry, and materials science of the past 25 years to be realized. As bioprocessors, we can be proud of the role we have played in bringing these power-ful new medicines to patients.

BioPharm International spoke with Howard Levine, PhD, president and prin-cipal consultant at BioProcess Technology Consultants in Woburn, Massachusetts, about what the guidance means for devel-opers of biosimilars. \"These guidelines have been anxiously awaited by industry for almost a year now , so it' s nice to see them finally come out,\" says Levine. \"They're a very positive and big step forward for development of biosimilar products in the US.\" Levine says there was nothing neces- sarily new or surprising about the guide-lines. \"I think FDA has been telegraphing w ha t was g o ing t o be in th ese gui d elin es for some time now. They made presenta-tions throughout 2010 and 2011 at various industry conferences and they've pub-lished several articles over the last year that talked about their approach to the development of guidelines for biosimi-lars.\" One of the most positive aspects of the new guidelines, according to Levine, is FDA's totality-of-evidence approach. \"FDA has been talking about this approach for awhile, meaning they'll look at the approval of biosimilars as a compilation of all of the evidence and characteriza-tion that a company has developed for a particular molecule. What this means is that there will, obviously, be extensive characterization of the biosimilar product using what FDA refers to as state-of-the-art analytical techniques.\" Levine adds that human clinical trials will always be required for a biosimilar, however. Even with the detailed biochemical and bio-physical characterization, there may still be a need for animal studies in some cases. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN US AND EU GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS Levine sees similarities between the new FDA guidance and the current guide-ance in Europe. \"They follow very closely along the lines of the European Union law,\" he says. Levine notes, however, that there are a few differences between the two, some of which are favorable to developers of biosimilars in the US and some of which actually are much less favorable than the EU law. Levine continues, \"I think one of the biggest advantages of the new guidance is the allowance of a non-US reference stan-dard for clinical trials. In the EU, the ref-eren ce s tan dard tha t' s used t o co m pare a biosimilar must be an EU-approved prod-uct. What FDA has done has allowed the use, for example, of European reference standards for approval of a biosimilar in the US. This is really very, very good news for companies developing biosimilars, because if they have clinical trials already underway in Europe, for example, using a European reference standard, those clinical trials don't necessarily have to be repeated\u2014provided they can show that the reference standard is an acceptable one for the US submission. Likewise, com-panies which haven't started their clinical development can put together a clinical program that encompasses both the EU and the US, again, by incorporating an EU reference standard.\" FLEXIBILITY IN APPROACH BioPharm International asked Levine whether he thought developers would be able to be fairly flexible in how they char-acterize biosimilars, or whether, as a result Challenges and Opportunities for Biosimilars Developers in the US Amy Ritter and Nora Barry Howard Levine, president and principal consultant at BioProcess Technology Consultants, discusses FDA's draft biosimilars guidance. Howard Levine, PhD September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 25Biosimilars Development of the new guidance, they would be pigeon-holed into a standard set of analytics that FDA would like to see. \"No,\" he said, \"This is not really any different than the requirement for characterization of a new product\u2014except, of course, one must demon-strate comparability or similarity to an existing reference product, rather than simply providing the charac-terization data for a new product. I think FDA will, once again, rely on their standard case-by-case approach as far as what analytical character-ization is required. Obviously, they will be looking to have as extensive a characterization of the molecule as possible, using the most up-to-date state-of-the-art techniques that are currently available.\" Levine says the biggest challenge for developers, from a technical standpoint, is demonstrating biosimi-larity from a biochemical and bio-physical perspective. \"One expects that there will be minor differences in, for example, glycosylation pat-terns or the extent of deamidation in a monoclonal antibody product. One expects that there will be slight differences between the biosimilar and the innovator product. The ques-tion is, how large a difference will be acceptable for the product to still be deemed biosimilar?\" The other challenges for devel- oping biosimilars in the US are not necessarily technical challenges, says Levine, but rather more commercial and regulatory. \"First of all, there is the 12-year data exclusivity period which means that a biosimilar prod-u ct in th e US cann o t co m e t o mar - ket until 12 years after the reference product or innovator product was first approved. This generally isn't a problem because the patents usually extend beyond that 12-year period, but it could be a problem in a case where a patent may expire earlier than this 12-year exclusivity period. The biosimilar company would be precluded from selling their product until the end of that 12-year period.\"He notes that the second commer- cial or legal challenge for biosimilar companies is the requirement that the biosimilar company must dis-close their entire dossier to the ref-erence product company to review. Levine believes this could prompt very frequent and lengthy patent and intellectual property litigation, which could be very costly and could, in the long run, hold up the approval of biosimilar products. INTERCHANGEABILITY When asked about the new guid-ance and the challenges in demon-strating interchangeability, Levine pointed out that, \"First of all, other than saying that FDA will consider interchangeability after one has demonstrated biosimilarity, there reall y is n o discuss i o n as t o w ha t the requirements for demonstrat-ing interchangeability might be.\" He a d d ed tha t if o n e l oo ks ba ck t o th e original BPCI Act, the bar for inter-changeability is extremely high and may actually be impossible to meet because the BPCI Act actually says that in order to achieve interchange-ability, one has to ensure that the molecule will behave the same as the innovator product in every patient. \"Achieving that from a scientific per-spective may actually be difficult, if not impossible.\"BIOSIMILARS TIMELINES Levine says that the development of biosimilars in the US will depend on how quickly it takes for the FDA draft guidance to become finalized. \"FDA, by their own releases, has said they've already had discussions with, I believe, nine companies regarding biosimilar applications. They have several other meetings pending. There's obviously been a lot of activ-ity behind the scenes of companies approaching FDA even before the guidelines were published.\" Levine thinks that the first wave of biosimilars in the US will most likely be those products that are already on the market as biosimilars in Europe. He points out that the clinical-trial requirements for biosimilar under the new guidance allow for a non-US reference product\u2014meaning that companies should be able to submit their clinical and postmarket data against that European reference stan-dard and it should be acceptable in a submission to FDA. \"What that means is compiling the data and putting together the appropriate application and submit-ting the application without actually having to run new clinical trials,\" he explains. \"So those will probably be the first products I would expect to see approved, probably within the first year after the guidance is final-ized. And then, beyond that, we'll begin to see new biosimilars that are not yet on the market in Europe.\" \"It will also be interesting to see what, if any, changes there are in the guidance between this current draft and the final version,\" says Levine. The guidance documents were open for public comment through Apr. 16, 2012, followed by a public hear-ing on May 11, 2012. \"The question is reall y , h o w l o ng will i t tak e th em to compile all those comments and revise and update the draft before they release it as final?\" A podcast of the full interview with Levine can be found at www.BiopharmInterational.com.The biggest challenge for developers, from a technical standpoint, is demonstrating biosimilarity from a biochemical and bio- physical perspective.26 BioPharm September 2012Peer-Reviewed: Endotoxin Removal Working with new experi- mental drugs for in vivo studies requires careful control of the endo- toxin content, so that any adverse effects caused by endotoxin are not superimposed on side effects from the investigational drug. The authors therefore developed a method that could give endotoxin values < 1 EU/mL without changing the composition of the drug formulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is com- posed of a carbohydrate portion and lipid-A, and appears in solution as molecular aggregates between 10,000 and 1,000,000 Da. Lipid A contains phosphate groups that give the molecule a negative charge and allow use of an anion exchanger for removal (1). The common methods for removal of endotoxin (LPS) from solutions are ultrafiltration, adsorp-tive matrices such as chromato-graphic resins, and ion-exchange resins (2-4). The choice of method is dependent upon the concentra-tion and type of drug molecule, the molecular weight, ionic strength, pH of the medium, pI, and the inter-action between the drug molecule and LPS (i.e., aggregation). For highly viscous solutions, attempts to remove endotoxin by any of the common methods was unsuccessful because of long centrifugation times and clogging of the filters. The authors identified a method that can be used as a final step directly on formulations of X-ray con-trast agents with high viscosities (20-35 mPas, * 640 mg substance/mL) and gadolinium-based magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents (5). Because most methods require diluted solutions, the high concen-tration of nonionic contrast agent provides an advantage by lower-ing the solubility of LPS in the medium and pushing this negatively charged species onto the exchanger. For research on new X-ray contrast a g e n t s s u c h a m e t h o d i s o f h i g h value and has not been described in the literature. A search in Scifinder retrieved only one publication ABSTRACT In this study, strong anion exchange membranes were found to depyrogenize highly viscous formulations (viscosities 20-35 mPas, 640 mg substance/mL) of triodinated X-ray contrast as Visipaque and the Gd-chelate based MR-contrast agent Prohance, without the need to dilute the formulation. The method was simple to perform and had no impact on pH, ionic strength, or concentration of gadolinium. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on endotoxin-contaminated formulatio ns with different ratios of Ca2+ and Na+, which remained unchanged after treatment with the anion membrane.A Method for Removal of Endotoxin from and Lars G\u00f8ran Wistrand Gunnar Hagelin, D. a senior research scientist and Lars G\u00f8ran Wistrand, PhD, is department manager, both in Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, Research, Medical Diagnostics at GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway. *To whom correspondence should be addressed, gunnarhagelin@ge.com, PEER-REVIEWED Article submitted: Oct. 04, 2011.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Samples Tri-iodinated aromatic X-ray compounds : Visipaque (Iodixanol 320 mg iodine/mL in 1 0 mM TRIS buff er p H 7 . 4 , os m o lal-ity adjusted to 290 mmol/kg with NaCl, viscosity = 24 mP a ) was used as w ell as several other chemically related derivatives formulated to > 3 20 mg I/ mL ha ving vis- cosities in the range 24-35 mPa. Gd-chelates for MR : Prohance (Gd-DOTA, 0.8 M in 10 mM TRIS buffer pH 7 .4, osmo-lality adjusted to 290 mmol/kg with NaCl) was used. Preparation of stock solution of LPS from Escherichia Coli One vial (10 mg, 10 e7 EU, Sigma Corp., USA) was added to 10 mL water for injection (WFI) and 1 mL acetonitrile to give a con-centration of 9.1 e 6 EU/mL = 9.1 e3 EU/L. Preparation of working solution of LPS from E. Coli 0.1 mL of the stock solution was diluted to 10 mL with WFI (dilution factor = 100) to give 91 EU/ Filter device: units with pore size 3-5 m made of cellulose modified with positively charged quaternary ammonium groups. Equilibration and sterilization of Sartobind Q15 : Each filter was eluted with 50 mL 10 mM TRIS p H 7 . 4 , f o ll o w ed by 5 mL 7 0% ethan o l tha t was allowed to stay in the filter for 3 min, and finally with 50 mL 10 mM TRIS pH 7.4. Endotoxin removal : The formulations were passed through the filter units by a flow of 1-2 drops/s. Sampling for endotoxin analysis Because of the high viscosity, it was crucial to mix the formulation thoroughly after elution through the Sartobind Q15 anion exchanger. As the absorption efficiency of the Q15 will decline rather sharply when the capacity is exceeded, a marked difference in the endo-toxin level can be observed between the start and end of the removal process.

September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 29Peer-Reviewed: Endotoxin Removal Analysis of endotoxin content All reagents and standards were supplied by Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). The chromo-genic method was used for determination of the endotoxin content with a sensitivity of 0.005 EU/mL, as described in the pharma-copeia. A dilution of 1:200 was prepared by diluting 50 l formulation in 9.95 mL WFI, and the sample was analyzed on the kinetic QCL instrument together with a positive control. If the positive control was positive, the test was considered valid and the results were automatically calculated by the soft-ware. No endotoxin present would give a result of NMT 1 EU/mL. Application to formulations containing Na + and Ca2+ Occasionally, unintentional contamination of sterile formulations takes place. The fol-lowing describes such an example where the method was used to depyrogenize for-mulations of X-ray agents having endotoxin levels far above values accepted for injection. The formulations were made with different ratios of Na + and Ca2+ that were important to preserve. In addition to the equilibration and sterilization procecures described above, the anion exchange membranes were equili-b ra t ed wi th TRIS-buff ers ha ving th e sam e Ca 2+/Na+ ratios as the formulations. The volumes of formulations were 100 mL, and Sartobind Q100 (100 cm 2) membrane filters having a theoretical capacity for endotoxin of 4750 EU were used. RESULTS Table I shows the measured values of E. Coli endotoxin before and after a single passage through Sartobind Q15. By plotting the data in a dia gram , i t can be inf erred tha t a saf e capacity of Sartobind Q15 membranes for E. coli LPS can be set to 450-460 EU (see Figure 1 ). Within this range, the filtrate has concentrations < 0.5 EU/mL, which is con- sidered acceptable for injection into experi-mental animals. The process had no effect on the iodine and Gd concentration and a negligible effect on pH. The method was successfully applied to formulations containing Ca 2+ and Na+ without affecting the ratio between them (see Tables II and III).DISCUSSION The method was ideal for preparing experimental formulations in exploratory phase where sterility of the starting materials is not an absolute requirement. As such, the method gave us an opportunity to increase the throughput for screening of new compounds.

EU International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Validation: Closed -Vial Techno improvement in the development of tech-nologies for aseptic filling of injectable products has led to innovative solutions. The main driver for innovation is that a small deviation from GMP may trigger product con-tamination leading to septic shock and even death for the patient. For exam-ple, analysis of an outbreak database has shown that, among 1537 patients contaminated by parenteral products, the mortality rate reached 15%. Of those contaminations, 20% were due to deviations during pharmaceutical drug manufacturing, showing that improve-ment of injectable processing opera-tions is worth investigating (1). The rate of contamination has been strongly reduced during the past 50 years thanks to major innovations tar-geting both the container and the filling technologies. Among the major changes observed during this period were:t\u0001&NFSHFODF \u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001WJBM\u0001BT\u0001UIF\u0001TUBO- dard primary packaging, replacing the ampul.

Crystal closed-vial technology aims to further address the quality issue for the patient and also to simplify the aseptic filling process (2, 3). The concept of crystal closed-vial technology consists of three different steps:t\u00015IF\u0001WJBM\u0001JT\u0001NPMEFE \u0001BOE \u0001EJSFDUM Z\u0001 assembled with its stopper in a ISO5 clean room, leading to a clean and closed vial. t\u00015IF\u0001WJBM\u0001JT\u0001UIFO \u0001TUFSJMJ [FE\u0001CZ\u0001HBNNB \u0001 irradiation, leading \u0001QSPDFTT \u0001B\u0001OFFEMF \u0001 liquid, followed by immedi-ate laser resealing of the stopper to restore closure integrity and capping by snap fit.

They can be split into four parts: the container-closure materi-als, the behavior of the container closure in various conditions, the specific filling operations, and the overall process. One crucial aspect of the container-closure is that the container has to be treated by gamma-irradiation to ensure its overall sterility, and not only asepsis.

The US Pharmacopeia requires a series of tests on poly-mers in USP General Chapter <661>. These tests are limited to nonvola-tile residues, residues on ignition, heavy metals, and buffer capacity. Some polymers such as polyethyl-ene require specific tests but these are not applicable to COC. In the European Pharmacopoeia , chapter EP 3.1.3 Polyolefines, is dedicated to polyolefin. Although COC does not fall in that category, because the definition of polyolefin is limited to \"polyethylene or co-polymer of eth-ylene with less than 25% of another organic compound,\" it was still decided to conduct that series of tests on COC. The vial body passed all these tests. Concerning the tests to be con- ducted on the the in vitro and in vivo tests described here as well as other selected.

In addition, these data are roughly two times lower than the particle content in glass vials measured according to the same procedure. This test is performed routinely to monitor the level of particle presence in vial batches. Container-clos ure integrity Container-closure integrity was assessed on vials that were pierced, filled, and laser resealed but not capped. The objective was to assess in one test the integrity at the junction between the stopper and the vial body and also the quality of the laser resealing. The dye ingress challenge test was used for validation and also for regular performance of batch release tests. The selected dye test was based on EP\u0001\u0014\u000f\u0013\u000f \u001a\u0001VOEFS \u0001 the denomination \"self-sealing test.\" The normal procedure consists of immersing vials in methylene blue solution and challenging them with a 27 kPa vacuum for 10 minutes, followed by a return to atmo-spheric pressure for 30 minutes. To be more challeng-ing, three successive cycles were applied, each of them consisting of a vacuum of 30 kPa for 30 minutes, fol- lowed by an overpressure of +15 kPa for 30 minutes. The results showed the absence of dye ingress. Microbiological tests have been conducted as well.

In particu-lar, water vapor loss of water from liq-uid product, resulting in change of product concentration. Oxygen ingress can lead to oxidation According to the ICH Q1A (R2) guideline, semipermeable contain-ers should be stored in the follow-ing conditions to meet the class III 5% (accelerated condi-tions) for products kept at room temperature. According to ICH, a loss of 5% water within a period of three months in accelerated condi-tions is the acceptable limit. If that limit is exceeded, investigations s h o ul d be co n d u ct ed t o assess th e effect on the product. Table III illustrates the loss of water in various storage conditions. In both accelerated conditions, water loss was significantly below the limit. Similar experiments are on-going with other vial formats and identical conclusions can be drawn. This supports the initial expectation that COC has excellent barrier properties for water vapor. It is less obvious how to measure oxygen permeation due to ambi-ent oxygen. Therefore, a specific UFTU\u0001XBT\u0001TFU\u0001VQ\u0001UP\u0001DIBSBDUFSJ [F\u0001UIF\u0001 vial behavior regarding permeation to oxygen. The vial was packed with a bag of FeO crystals, vali-dated regarding absence of loss of crystals outside the pack, inside a sealed aluminum pouch to serve as an o xy g en sca v eng er . S u ch an assembly will first deplete the oxygen around the vial, bringing the oxygen concentration inside the pouch in the range of 0.1% within 24 h. In a second phase, the oxygen will leak out of the vial because of the concentration dif-ferential. When exiting the vial, the oxygen is captured by the scavenger, keeping the external concentration permanently low. Figure 1 shows the different kinet- ics observed according to storage temperature, leading to residual oxygen concentration in the vial of less than 3% in two months. A useful application of that per- meation to oxygen is the opportu-nity to prepare oxygen-depleted vials in advance after ensuring sufficient preincubation time. When filling oxygen-depleted vials by piercing with the noncor-ing needle through the stopper, no significant oxygen increase was observed in the vial, maintaining the initial oxygen concentration without nitrogen flush.

VALIDATION OF THE EQUI PMENT The main changes in equipment compared with classical filling technologies are the needle pierc-ing of the stopper and the laser resealing of the piercing trace.Needle pierci ng Regarding the validation of the needle, the three main aspects assessed were the venting of the overpressure created inside the vial during filling, the level of particle generation during piercing, and the ability of the needle to support thousands of piercing. 7FOUJOH \u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001PWFSQSFTTVSF \u0001 was validated by using a manom-eter connected to the inside of the vial. It showed that the pressure increased during filling in the range of 0.1-0.2 bar according to GJMMJOH \u0001TQFFE \u0001BOE\u0001WJBM\u0001TJ[F \u0001UIFO \u0001 returned back to normal atmo-spheric pressure within 0.2 to 0.4 seconds. This measure correlates well with the observation that a short delay is necessary before needle withdrawal to avoid drop generation due to filling tube expansion, especially if silicone tubing is used. Results of the particulate anal- ysis showed that the needle gen-e r a t e s v e r y l i m i t e d a m o u n t o f particles during the piercing pro-cess. This result was obtained because of the noncoring pencil point design of the needle. Moreover, the evolution of the particle generation inside the vial along a 5000-vial filling cam-paign using the same needle, did not show any increasing trend that could have been induced by the needle wear.

The resealing depth ranged from 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm when using a 6 mm diameter 12W laser beam. To assess the resistance of the weld, overpressure was pro-duced inside the vials through their bottom side and leakage was assessed by bubble generation at the piercing trace. Resealed vials started leaking from 140 kPa to 200 kPa whereas a range from 30 kPa to 150 kPa was observed for the nonresealed vials.

ANASTASIA G. LOLAS AND ANURAG S. RATHORE With the dawn of the 21st century came the realization that changes must be made by both the phar-maceutical industry and regulatory authorities across the globe. These changes are necessitated by a plethora of issues that are faced by companies and the regulatory agencies alike. The number of blockbuster drugs launched each year has remained relatively constant at 6.5 per year (1). The nearly threefold increase in R&D spending over the past decade has resulted in an in crease in th e n um ber o f dru g can di da t es entering Phase I trials. However, this increase has been alm os t co m p l et el y n eu tralized by an in crease in attrition, with the probability that a candidate entering Phase I will become a successful product decreasing from 10% in 2002 to 5% towards the end of the decade (1). This decline in success rate, along with the increasing scrutiny of healthcare costs in developed economies, has resulted in unrelenting pres-sure on the pharmaceutical companies to control drug-development costs. On the other hand, regu- latory authorities are also grappling with the increas-ing complexity of pharma-ceutical manufacturing. Most pharmaceutical products sold in the US are manu- factured outside the US. Even for those drugs that are manufactured in the US, a significant portion of the raw materials and process intermediates is imported from manufacturers outside the US. It's no wonder that \"Supply Chain Management,\" \"Accountability in a Global Environment,\" \"Foreign Inspections,\" and \"International Compliance\" were some of the key sessions at the 2011 PDA/ FDA Joint Regulatory Conference. Implementation of quality by design (QbD) in this environment has further contributed to the need to clarify what information needs to be included in a regulatory filing and how it should be presented. FDA has addressed this gap to some extent through its ongoing QbD pilot program, but more guidance is needed from the regulatory authorities to ensure widespread successful implementation of QbD (2). Overall, the regulatory authorities must make changes to address the drug safety dangers that the global environment poses as well as make changes to the drug review and approval processes to encourage regulatory and pharmaceutical inno-vation and faster product availability to patients. Regulators also must offer more flexibility regard-ing manufacturing changes and application supple-ments based on science and risk assessment, so that limited resources on both the industry and regula-tory sides will be available for drug development and innovation. In this 28 th article in the Elements of Biopharmaceutical Production series, the authors focus on the regulatory challenges that arise in the QbD paradigm, in particular on how review and inspection practices have been and are evolving.ANASTASIA G.

Another aspect of the initiative was t o ensure tha t \" th e p rod u ct review and the inspection pro-gram operate in a coordinated and synergistic manner.\" The desired state was defined as \"a maximally efficient, agile, flexible pharma-ceutical manufacturing sector that reliably produces high quality drug products without extensive regula-tory oversight.\" FDA and the phar-maceutical industry are spending considerable efforts to understand how to achieve this incredible feat and to identify the necessary ele-ments required. This section dis-cusses some of these elements. The desired state must be defined first in more detail. The roles of manufacturers and regu-l a t o r y a u t h o r i t i e s m u s t a l s o b e defined. Under this paradigm, manufacturers have extensive knowledge about product, pro-cess, and quality attributes and strive for continuous improvement to reach the desired end point of consistent, safe and effective, pure and potent, drug products. They share this knowledge with FDA. The agency develops the expertise to evaluate products and processes using a science- and risk-based approach through the review of submitted data in applications and performance of prelicense and preapproval facility inspections. Subsequent, postapproval changes do not need the submission of sup-plements if these changes are to happen within the design space of critical process parameters as established and approved in the original application. Surveillance inspections are conducted periodi- cally using a risk-based approach to verify the changes. The desired state includes the potential for less inspectional oversight for a facil- ity or firm that has maintained an acceptable compliance status and has reached a state of quality excel- lence. Therefore, in addition to the expertise that application review- ers need to develop, field investiga- tors also must develop expertise to address the demands of the new desired state. An integrated model of review and inspection should be in place to complement and coordinate the attainment of the desired state for new pharmaceuti-cal products. New guidance docu-ments and compliance program guidance may need to be created. It appears that the new desired state can be achieved or at least approached with the adoption of two main elements by the phar-maceutical industry and by FDA: QbD and effective, agile quality systems with good quality risk-management principles. QUALITY BY DESIGN QbD is not a new concept (4). It was introduced decades ago and adopted by the automobile and food industries to enhance process design and consistency by employ-ing effective and measurable in-process controls with less reliance on end-product testing. The intent was to allow for corrections in real time for the manufacture of qual-ity product with less variability and with the expected attributes. Furthermore, this principle led to Six Sigma processes and lean manufacturing concepts. QbD was introduced relatively recently in the pharmaceutical industry and embraced by FDA as a means to enhance the regulatory process. QbD is defined in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q8 guide-lin e as \" a sys t ema ti c a pp roa ch t o development that begins with predefined objectives and empha-sizes product and process under-standing and process control, based on sound science and qual-ity risk management\" (5). The publication of FDA's guidance, PAT\u2014A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Quality Assurance , initiated an effort that eventually evolved into QbD (6). The underlying prin-ciples of science- and risk-based process and product develop-ment and commercialization are also reflected in the contents of the quality guidelines ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development , ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management, and ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System as well as by the recently issued guidance on process valida-tion from FDA (5, 7-9). The past five years have seen QbD gaining widespread adoption in the bio- pharmaceutical industry with several publications attempting to elucidate a path forward for its implementation and resolution of the various issues that serve as det-riments to its success (10-12). The key steps for QbD implemen- tation include: identification of the product attributes that are of signif-icant importance to the product's safety or efficacy (i.e., target product profile and critical quality attributes); design of the process to deliver these attributes; a robust control strategy to ensure consistent process perfor-mance; validation and filing of the process demonstrating the effec-tiveness of the control strategy; and finally, ongoing monitoring to ensure robust process performance over the lifecycle of the product (10, 11). Risk assessment and manage-ment, raw material management, use of statistical approaches and process analytical technology (PAT) provide a foundation to these activities. 46 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Special Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Quality by Design There are many significant dif- ferences that contrast a QbD-based process and product development from traditional practices. In the traditional approach, the pro-cess defines the product, and as a result, the process needs to be performed within narrow operat-ing ranges to get consistent prod-uct quality. In QbD, the product defines the process, so as long as the process stays within the defined design space, product qual-ity is acceptable. Product specifica-tions in the traditional approach are set based on process perfor-mance, and regulators expect them t o be narr o w ed aft er en o u gh p r o-cess history has been established. On the other hand, in QbD, prod-uct specifications are set based on process and product knowledge and this allows them to be kept wider, resulting in greater opera-tional flexibility. The regulatory filing in the traditional approach describes the process and presents data on product characterization. The focus is on presenting the status quo . In a QbD filing, the focus is instead on process and product knowledge. Data are pre-sented to explain how the process affects the quality attributes (QA) of the product and how the QA affect the safety and efficacy of the product. Postapproval support through product lifecycle requires high maintenance in the tradi-tional approach. The regulatory burden is high for process changes and, therefore, process improve-ments are few. Many postapproval supplements are focused on alleviating repeat violations of the approved ranges and limits even though these vio-lations do not necessarily affect product quality. Many postap-proval supplements introduce new filling lines and manufacturing sites for similar processes. In a QbD paradigm, the regulatory burden is low because there are wider ranges and limits based on product and process understanding. Changes within these ranges and lim-its do not require prior approval. Resolution of nonconformances is faster because the required process knowledge already exists. REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS OF QBD QbD cannot exist without an effec-tive quality system that oversees and manages process variability and product quality through appro-priate control strategies, documen-tation, data trending and analysis, risk assessment, and continuous review. It is a living system that incorporates gained knowledge and historical experience to effect updates and changes whenever and wherever necessary. From the regulatory side, FDA develops the expertise to understand and assess QbD elements. Decisions are made based on science and risk to patient safety and are documented under the umbrella of an effective qual-ity system. Knowledge is managed effectively to serve as reference in the future. Precedents and regu-latory decisions are recorded and managed. Data and trends are col-lected and analyzed to identify any patterns or trends for specific categories of products or similar products even after drug approval. Metrics are developed to under-stand the impact of regulatory deci-sions. Under the QbD paradigm, the success or failure of a marketed pharmaceutical product is assessed to incorporate lessons learned into future reviews of drug applications. An in t e gra t ed m od el o f revi ew and inspection for approval of a regulatory drug application serves as the platform for achieving the desired state. This model is espe- cially evident in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) as used for therapeutic bio- logical products, such as proteins and monoclonal antibodies. These products were transferred from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to CDER in 2003 and are rather complex, because they are produced from living organ-isms that are variable and not as easily controlled (13). Review and inspection responsibilities are shared between the Office of Pharmaceutical Science/Office of Biotechnology Products (OBP) and the Office of Compliance/Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality/Biotech Manufacturing Assessment Branch (BMAB). As described in FDA's MAPP 4730.3, issued in 2009, a team approach is followed for review of drug applica-tions and conduct of prelicense/preapproval facility inspections (14). This approach enables integra-tion of the two functions, review and inspection, as well as a more thorough and efficient assessment of firms' process understanding and quality oversight. Both offices share regulatory oversight and cGMP implementation of CMC standards as described in the bio-logics license application (BLA) and supplements. Both offices assess standards, inspect manufac-turing facilities, and observe oper-ations while the subject product is being manufactured as stated in 21 CFR parts 600 and 601. The same team of individuals per-forms review and inspection. This approach is complementary and The past five years have seen QbD gaining widespread adoption in the biopharmaceutical industry. September 2012 www.biopharminternational.com BioPharm International 47Special Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Quality by Design helps to ensure that a thorough evaluation is performed for the issuance of a biologics license and marketing approval of a biologic therapeutic drug. The prelicense or preap- proval inspection verifies the application of cGMP, execution of commitments, and data pre-sented in the application. OBP leads the overall assessment for product quality as described in the application and approves the manufacturing process and final specifications. On inspec-tion, OBP assesses product-spe-cific elements, verifies data and conformance to commitments in the BLA or supplement. BMAB provides a microbiology qual-ity assessment of drug substance and drug product sections of the applications, including microbio-logical specifications. BMAB leads the inspection team. Additional BMAB responsibilities on inspec-tion include the evaluation of the cGMP compliance status of a firm and conformance with commit-ments in the BLA or supplement. INSPECTIONS UNDER THE QBD PARADIGM Traditionally, inspections have been conducted using the FDA systems-based approach and in accordance with CDER's Compliance Program 7356.002M \"Inspection of Licensed Biological Therapeutic Drug Products\" (15). However, ques-tions arise as to the expected impact of QbD and recent initia-tives on prelicense or preapproval inspections for therapeutic pro-teins. Other questions, such as how these inspections will dif-fer from those of the past, what types of documents should the firms have available for inspec-tion, and whether there are any other changes envisioned under the auspices of QbD will be exam- ined in the following paragraphs. During prelicense or preapproval inspections under a QbD para-digm, the FDA inspection team will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the process design as described in the appli-cation and whether knowledge and risk management have been transferred successfully from devel-opment to manufacturing. It will be crucial to have FDA involved early on in product development to establish consensus of criti-cal elements. The inspection will evaluate the quality system and its effectiveness regarding consistent product quality, change control procedures, process improvements, deviation management, and knowledge and risk management during the product lifecycle. The oversight of the quality sys- tem is crucial under a QbD para-digm for the release of consistent product and perhaps even real-time release. Change management is of the utmost importance to ensure that opportunities for process improvements are acted upon as process and product knowledge increases during the product life-cycle and as data are gathered and technological advances made. Under QbD, a firm should be able to make process improvement changes without being constrained by regulatory requirements as long as these changes are justified through quality risk management. The inspection team would review these changes that may not require the submission of supplements. Because the members of the inspec- tion team are also the reviewers of the applications, they understand and know the product history to evaluate the risk of these changes. Screening and testing of raw materials, such as cell banks, would receive more scrutiny on inspection, as frequently the start- ing materials define a process. Vendor qualification, supply chain oversight, and sampling and test-ing plans would be reviewed dur-ing the inspection. Variability of raw materials and change manage-ment would be assessed. Current emphasis is on excluding complex biologically derived raw materials whenever possible and/or treating materials for inactivation or limita-tion of adventitious agents. This trend is expected to continue. Such approaches are in agreement with a QbD paradigm where risks are eliminated or mitigated through process design. With respect to microbial con- trol, elements of a QbD-based inspection could be the evalua-tion of risk assessment and analy-sis for identification of in-process controls and the establishment of appropriate limits based on pro-cess capability for bioburden and endotoxin. In addition, investiga-tors would review sampling and testing plans for in-process mon-itoring at crucial manufacturing steps in lieu of end-product moni-toring, and evaluate process ana-lytical technology and in-line or at-line sensors for early detection of microbial contamination. There is even the possibility of real-time release through the implementa-tion of alternate and rapid micro-biological methods and through the use of an effective microbial control strategy. A QbD inspection would evaluate the overall control strategy, including elements of facility and equipment qualifica-tion and maintenance as well as raw material screening and sup-plier management. Special empha-sis would be placed on process design, testing, and monitoring programs that demonstrate robust- ness and consistency. Even though these control-strategy elements 48 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Special Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Quality by Design exist today, they would be opti- mized for best performance results and would be scrutinized more by investigators under the QbD para-digm. The inspection team would review documents that present and justify the control and optimiza-tion of such important aspects of product quality assurance. The emphasis of inspection would be on in-process testing in lieu of end-product testing. Crucial steps of the process would be iden-tified and appropriate sampling and testing plans implemented through the - sive hold times, if needed, or hold steps where appro-priate t\u0001-JGFUJNF \u0001VTF\u0001TUVEJFT \u0001GPS\u0001QVSJGJDB t\u00017BMJEJU Z\u0001PG\u0001SJTL\u0001BTTFTTNFOUT \u0001BOE\u0001 evaluation and updates as knowledge increases. Under a QbD paradigm, new manufacturing facilities will be designed for appropriate contain-ment and segregation of opera-tions, best practices for cleaning and disinfection, and appropriate level of environmental monitor-ing. Risk assessments for adventi- tious agent ingress, contamination, and cross-contamination would be reviewed on inspection. It is important to note that differ-ent considerations apply to single and multiproduct facilities, prod-uct changeover, new product introductions, open versus closed operations, and sanitization versus sterilization of equipment. The inspection of the future will focus more on process and prod-uct consistency based on manu-facturing history and data. The history of microbial or viral con-tamination would be reviewed along with any measures imple-mented to prevent and mitigate future occurrences. The disposition of possibly contaminated prod-uct and quality oversight will be assessed. Investigations and root cause determinations, corrective and preventive actions, and peri-o d i c r e vi e w o f r i s k a s s e s s m e n t s would be evaluated. Furthermore, it is becoming more evident that inspections of manufacturing and testing sites of the future will rely more heavily on technology. More elements of the quality system continue to be managed through computerized systems. Investigators will need to know how to navigate through these systems and request appro-priate documents for review as well as understand the integration of these systems for consistent pro-cess and product quality. CURRENT REGULATIONS AND COMPARABILITY PROTOCOLS An overview of current FDA regu- lations and guidance is helpful to discover hidden opportunities and how they can be leveraged for the QbD paradigm for therapeutic pro-tein products moving forward. The requirements regarding changes to an approved biologics license application are described in 21 CFR 601.12. With respect to product and process changes, the regula-tion states that each change in product, production process, qual-ity controls, equipment, or facili-ties must be reported to the agency (16). This section also describes the need for conducting appropriate validation, including clinical and nonclinical studies to demonstrate that the change has no adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product. Reporting of the change m us t be in a cco rdan ce wi th re gu-lation or guidance that provides for less burdensome notification of the change. The changes requiring submission of supplements and approval prior to distribution of product made using the change (major changes), changes requir-ing supplement submission at least 30 days before distribution of product made using the change, and changes to be described in an annual report (minor changes) are provided in 21 CFR 601.12(b). The 1997 Guidance for Industry: Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products pro- vides additional guidance on the reporting categories (17). The com-parability protocol described in 21 CFR 60 1 . 1 2( e ) is used t o d em- onstrate the lack of adverse effect on the safety and effectiveness of a product for specific types of The inspection of the future will focus on process and product consistency based on manufacturing history and data.Global Bio/Pharmaceutical Services Are your bioassaysmisbehaving?

A com- parability protocol approach can be used to effect changes under a QbD paradigm with more regula-tory flexibility. This approach has been used successfully for drug substance manufacturing site transfers when certain require-ments were met. Comparability protocols can be leveraged to effect many differ-ent manufacturing changes that include many products and manu-facturing sites. They are not rec-ommended for one-time changes as th e p ro t oco l m us t be su b mi t -ted as a preapproval supplement (PAS) and be followed by addi-tional filings. Regulatory flexibil-ity is achieved by submitting the same change approved in a com-parability protocol for other prod-ucts or facilities as changes being effected supplements (CBEs) or even as annual reports. Therefore, such protocols are a good regula-tory strategy tool when a particular change affects multiple products. For example, if the container-clo-sure system is modified for many products that use the same system, or if a stopper changes, then the comparability protocol offers a way to submit one PAS containing the studies to be performed, the acceptance criteria, and the qual-ity risk-management concepts to be followed, especially regarding container-closure integrity aspects. Once the protocol is approved, the first product with the change can be introduced to the market through a PAS or CBE. Subsequent products can be introduced imme-diately and reported in annual reports. It is important to note that the submission strategy should be agreed upon between the firm and the FDA. Therefore, meetings are recommended when such strate-gies are followed. The comparabil-ity protocol offers advantages as the submission strategy for new in- process testing methods as well. For example, if a traditional method is replaced with a new more advanced and rapid microbiological method (i.e., polymerase chain reaction mycoplasma testing for cell culture instead of traditional microbiology methods) at many facilities and for many different products, a compa-rability protocol can serve as the p la tf o rm t o eff ect th ese chan g es without submitting a PAS for each product and facility. The expanded change protocol (eCP) presents a tool that has been used successfully by some biotech-nology product manufacturers to reduce postmarketing reporting requirements. A variation of the traditional comparability protocol, this protocol is gaining popularity, especially in its use for manufactur- ing site changes of drug substance. In this global environment, many biotechnology product manufac-turers have multiple manufactur-ing sites and/or partnerships with CMOs. Their products are sup-plied to a global market. The need to propose changes to the manu-facturing process and facilities in such a global market is expected during the product lifecycle as it offers increased network mobility. Associated with the need to imple- ment changes in a timely manner and have greater flexibility in man-ufa cturing is th e n eed t o revi ew changes in an efficient manner and reduce the number of postmarket-ing submissions to the agency. Traditionally, a comparabil- ity protocol is submitted to the agency to support the proposed changes. In July 2008, a notice was issued in the Federal Register seeking participation of phar-maceutical companies in a pilot program for the submission of quality (CMC) information in an eCP consistent with the principles of QbD and risk management in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This protocol can cover changes to manufacturing scale, changes across unit operations, changes to equipment, and/or manufacturing site transfers previously submitted as comparability protocols. The ICH Q5E guidance, Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process, applies to eCPs as well as tradi-tional comparability protocols to demonstrate product comparabil-ity (18). Expanded change proto-cols describe the holistic QbD and risk-based approaches to demon-strate the lack of adverse effect on safety and efficacy of a product and focus on critical quality attri-butes. Such submissions allow for decreased filing requirements for postapproval changes. The eCP approach leverages existing regulation as contained in 21 CFR 601.12(e) and current FDA initiatives. In addition, this approach leverages product and process knowledge to develop a design space and control strategy through the use of quality risk management. The potential appli-cations of quality risk manage-ment in quality systems, regulatory operations, development, facility and equipment design, material management, production, labora-tory control, stability, and packag-ing and labeling are described in A comparability protocol can serve as the platform to effect changes without submitting a preapproval supplement for each product and facility.Biomanufacturing \"out of the box\" FlexMoSysTM - flexible, modular integrated solutions52 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Special Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Quality by Design ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management (7). The use of these principles allows for defining the scope of an eCP and presenting an appropri-ate quality risk management plan to prevent and mitigate sources of risk. For example, a manufacturing site transfer eCP could define the scope of the protocol based on the licensed product to be transferred, the approved process, and facil-ity knowledge. When similarities between processes and equipment exist, the eCP elements are easier to define. There are two primary cases where the eCP approach has been used successfully. First, is the multi-use eCP for intro-ducing multiple products into multiple manufacturing sites covering the introduction of pre-viously approved commercial prod-ucts and new clinical products into licensed manufacturing facilities with an acceptable cGMP compli-ance status. The products can be produced from the same host or from different hosts but must be from well characterized cell lines (e.g., ICH Q5A) and not highly toxic or potent. The second case is the site transfer eCP and covers the introduction of an approved product into an additional licensed multiproduct facility. This eCP establishes a network of sites that provide the approved commercial product and those that receive the transferred product. In the site transfer eCP, there are additional considerations such as scale modi-fications, raw materials changes, and the use of disposable mate-rials that may be different from the first manufacturing site. Cross-contamination considerations are more concerning for the multi-use eCP, while comparability consider-ations are crucial for the site trans-fer eCP. In any case, all eCPs must provide adequate quality risk man-agement, and predefined require- ments and acceptance criteria in enough detail to allow for subse-quent reduced reporting require-ments following eCP approval. It is important to note that eCPs are recommended for already licensed products and manufac-turing facilities. They are not indi-cated for nonapproved products and facilities. However, the manu-facture of clinical material may be allowed as long as the cross-con-tamination risks are considered and included in the eCP . It is also important to make a distinction between drug substance and drug product manufacturing opera-tions and facilities for biotechnol-ogy products, because each case would require the consideration of different risks. Although poten-tially both drug substance and drug product manufacturing site changes could be included in an eCP, the broader the scope, the more complex the elements of the eCP become. Another consider-ation is that firms wishing to fol-low the eCP approach are advised to request and hold meetings with the agency to discuss the pro-posed approach and risk manage-ment plan and agree on scope, strategy, and submission require-ments. Although this can be time consuming at the beginning of this approach, the benefits can be reaped immediately once the eCP is approved. Additional prod-ucts can subsequently be trans-ferred without submitting prior approval supplements and wait-ing for FDA approval for market release. In addition, the preap-proval facility inspection can be waived based on licensure and cGMP compliance status. The eCP approach helps to iden- tify the various risks across the subject manufacturing sites and to develop a quality risk management plan with site-dependent versus site-independent risks. Such a plan s h o ul d be an in t e gral part o f th e quality system and address risks from environmental, personnel, material, equipment, measure-ments, and methods. There are multiple considerations to be inte-gra t ed in t o an eCP . Th e a u th o rs present some factors that are rel-evant to drug substance manufac-ture as examples. Equipment and layout of a pro- duction facility should be reviewed to address multiproduct or multi-host facility aspects for drug sub-stance manufacturing operations, as risks will vary significantly. If con-tainm en t is a co n cern , i t s h o ul d be appropriately addressed when intro-ducing a product to another facility. Additionally, supplier and raw mate-rial concerns can impact the risk assessment considerably. The accept-a b ili ty o f ris k by a firm ma y vary depending on whether it uses man-ufacturing sites within its network or contract manufacturing facilities. When contract facilities are used, a well-written and enforced quality agreement is cruical. Embedded in the site transfer may be changes to the manu-facturing process resulting from facility equipment and layout (i.e., fit) or continuous improve-ment considerations. These changes may affect controls for There is a need to review changes in an efficient manner and reduce the number of postmarketing submissions to the agency.

When scale-up of the process is part of a site-transfer eCP, comparability process and cri t eria s h o ul d be w ell d efin ed , along with control parameters and strategy to ensure prod-uct quality and safety. Based on the risk assessment, existing validation studies may be used or new validation studies may need to be performed. As with traditional comparability proto-cols, the comparability of prod-uct based on test method and acceptance criteria and technol-ogy transfer aspects should be p a r t o f t h e e C P . A s i n d i c a t e d in current guidance, change of the manufacturing site or addi-tion of a new site to an approved application is reported as a prior approval supplement and triggers a facility inspection. The site transfer eCP can address compli-ance risks leading to a waiver for the inspection. There are many opportuni- ties today to leverage all avail-able information relevant to compliance and cGMP require-ments as regulatory agen-cies work on harmonized guidance and inspection coop-eration (e.g., the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme). Consistency in risk manage-ment and change control opera-tions across sites and well defined thresholds for acceptable risks are helpful in understanding manage-ment of an eCP once approved. Following approval, other prod-ucts can be introduced with more regulatory flexibility when the principles outlined in the approved eCP are followed.

PRATIK JALURIA Not surprisingly, industries operating in a free mar k et t en d t o em ula t e an d implement successful practices from divergent industries. This tendency is particularly true for technology-based industries such as biopharmaceuticals and software development\u2014two industries that are customer-focused and rapidly changing. Although the term \"platform\" dates back hundreds of years, the con-cept of developing a platform or framework off of which subsequent products can be launched originated in software development. Current indus-try leaders in software development have imple-mented this concept with great success. Over the past decade or so, biopharmaceutical companies have applied platform processes to various aspects of their operations. The concept has gained consid-erable traction within the field of bioprocess devel-o p m en t as an in creas ing n um ber o f gr o u ps ha v e implemented it and begun touting its benefits in quick succession. However, as with any idea, there are benefits as well as disadvantages that need to be assessed p ri o r t o an d co n curren t wi th im p l e-mentation. TOUTING THE PLATFORM The central argument in favor of a platform pro-cess, particularly in the context of bioprocess development, is that it expedites project timelines. By leveraging similarities between new molecules, a platform process enables resources to be deployed efficiently, reducing costs while also shrinking timelines. Everything from cell-culture expan-sion steps to filter sizing can be grouped together to form a comprehensive, thaw-to-formulation platform process. Particularly in the context of pre-clinical and early-phase clinical production needs, platform processes allow for rapid development of molecules. Even for late-phase clinical produc- tion needs, a platform process provides a starting point for subsequent development, readying a process for regulatory approval and eventual commercialization. More specifically, platform processes also allow bioprocess development groups to focus on those aspects of the process that require greater evalu-ation or development such as viral clearance and bioreactor harvest criteria. For instance, viral clear-ance must be demonstrated under the conditions employed during purification steps to ensure the safety of the end product. Orthogonal steps capable of removing viral contaminants by alternate modes of action must be employed, with the performance of each step quantified. Because each molecule is different, with different physiochemical proper-ties such as its isoelectric point (pI), and purified under slightly different conditions (i.e., buffers, pH, and conductivity), viral clearance must be demonstrated routinely. Similarly, specific cell-culture conditions can degrade the desired product based on culture duration (i.e., temperature and pH), cell viability, and the onset of apoptosis. Determining how these and other factors affect product quality is vital to successful transfer and implementation of a GMP process. It is crucial to understand these operations because of their potential to affect release of the final product. Therefore, both operations need to be explored in detail. With a platform process in-hand, many non-critical operations can be ignored and run based on the platform, focusing instead on critical opera-tions such as the two described above.

Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Platform Processes ity to prioritize effectively while maintaining a high level of pro-cess understanding is another benefit of platform technology. Another realized benefit of employing platform processes is that it simplifies the complexity o f th e in t era cti o ns taking p la ce between groups inside and more importantly outside of the pro-cess development group. Groups such as quality assurance, qual-ity control, logistics/supply chain, and manufacturing can all benefit from process devel-opment's use of platform pro-cesses. For instance, vendors for everything from growth media to chromatography resins can be assessed once (audited and certi-fied by quality assurance) and relied upon routinely because multiple programs will use the same raw materials and consum-ables. Similarly, specifications defined by quality control and material numbers defined by logistics can be defined once and be used for multiple programs. Implementation of a platform process also espouses confi-dence in manufacturing groups because preparing and execut-ing batch records are simpli-fied. In other words, all of these groups external to process devel-opment benefit from standard-ized, well-defined workflows that have been previously tested and shown to be effective; a hallmark o f a tru e p l a tf o rm p r o c e s s . In fact, the better the platform, the more these desirable characteris-tics can be achieved. PITFALLS, REMORSE, AND THE PATH FORWARD Just as with any other benefi- cial procedure or method, there are complications and prob-lems that result from over-reli-ance of the singular platform approach. For instance, propo- nents of platform processes often argue technical knowledge can be acquired and developed by continually improving the plat-form. This notion is a fallacy as often platform improvement is discouraged due to the effect these changes would have on external groups already operat-ing in the platform framework. Furthermore, implementing sub-tle improvements become less and less likely as these potential changes require greater justifica-tion. Recognizing that innova-tion arises from a series of small, seemingly inconsequential steps, the inertia around modifying platform processes can lead to stagnation and inefficiencies over time. In addition, with a singular platform process in place, mol- ecules with \"platform friendly\" physical and/or chemical proper-ties may be favored over other molecules. That choice might not appear damaging, but the link between a molecule's manu-facturability and its efficacy is weak or nonexistent. So, fun-neling molecule after molecule through development based primarily on its ability to con-form seems ineffective and out-of-touch, thereby question-ing the validity of the system that spawned this result. Such a system is unable to self-cor-rect as the bias for conformity is difficult to eliminate. A trou-bling extension of this bias is that certain molecules are effec-tively killed if they do not fit the platform or require signifi-cant development. This action is appalling because it represents a true disservice to patients and the very business of biotech-nology. To terminate a pro-gram with potential life-saving properties because it does not fit the cookie-cutter mold is bey o n d e gre gi o us. Wh en d ev el-opment groups refuse to work outside of the platform environ-ment, their failure is everyone's failure. With the profound long-term effect platform processes and the mindset that goes hand-in-hand with its uninterrupted imple-mentation can have on biopro-cess development, a different approach is needed. An approach is needed that leverages the tech-nical knowledge and overall skill set not only to develop new processes, but also troubleshoot existing processes. Such exper-tise requires continued exposure to an ever-expanding assortment of unit operations, techniques, and methodologies. Think of it as a scientist's repertoire or tool-box that is continually updated and employed. Every method and every unit operation has to be mas t ered su ch tha t i t can be reworked and reconfigured as needed. Every set of conditions tested is another data point, and as data points are collected into a comprehensive database, deci-sions can be made for new pro-cesses. It is important to note that not all aspects of each unit Platform processes allow bioprocess development groups to focus on those aspects of the process that require greater evalu-ation or development.56 BioPharm International www.biopharminternational.com September 2012Special Section: Trends in BioPharma 2012 Platform Processes operation or method have to be identified upfront before imple-mentation. Such characteriza-tion comes over time, as certain parameters are locked down and others are varied to understand the design space and identify where the process can poten-tially fail. Instead, the focus can be on functionality and utility\u2014what purpose might a particular step play and how. For example, defining the expectations for a capture step (i.e., purity, aggrega-tion, and profile of impurities) can instantly exclude or high-light certain types of resin based on their performance. Applying this very notion systematically across all unit operations can identify weak spots that merit greater scrutiny while also pro-viding several possible avenues to explore concurrently. A key responsibility for devel- opment groups that can often be overlooked is troubleshoot-ing; assisting manufacturing and technical services groups in addressing unexpected issues. Troubleshooting by definition requires a systematic approach to identify the source of a par-ticular failure or potential prob-lem. Underlying that logical, s tru ctured a pp r oa ch is t echni-cal knowledge, without which troubleshooting cannot be accomplished. A modular plat-form approach would in effect, expose development groups to a whole assortment of operations and methods, thus enhancing their overall technical knowl-edge and ability to troubleshoot. For example, exploring multiple ways in which cell lines can be transfected and screened can lead to a better understanding of how particular cell lines behave and what triggers might disrupt productivity or product quality. Similarly , experience with multi-ple formulation buffers can lead to the development and imple-mentation of screening tools aimed at delivering the right for-mulation for a specific mode of administration, concentration, and stability. Working in a mod-ular framework essentially builds a layered, powerful database that can be employed to rapidly develop processes without forgo-ing actual development, as the singular platform approach does. CONCLUSIONS The benefits of developing and instituting platform processes are undeniable because the versatility of the platform drives cost-effec-tiveness and overall efficiencies, especially for routine operations. However, once established, a plat-form approach can be difficult to modulate as incremental changes are heavily scrutinized particu-larly by key stakeholders outside of development. As a result, a sin-gular platform technology can lead to stagnation if not routinely challenged and refined. An alter-native approach, one that has a longer timeframe in mind, is to develop expertise around many distinct unit operations that can be assembled into different com-binations. By pairing an under-standing of the capabilities and limitations of each unit opera-tion from seed train operations to ultrafiltration and chroma-tography, with platform evalua-tion techniques, new processes can be quickly constructed. By constructing a framework that is more modular in form than true platform technologies, a whole host of molecules can be produced, purified, and formu-lated rapidly without sacrificing efficiencies and process robust-ness. Monoclonal antibodies may be prevalent today, but that may not be true several years from now as technologies advance and the industry inches closer to personalized medicine demarked by the use of many different types of therapeu-tic molecules. Being ready for any molecule that comes out of research is not only prudent, but fundamentally a core responsi-bility shared by all development groups.

E: Images Boot Camp: Introduction How can one ensure that staff are fully competent, with the right degree of technical confidence to work in a highly regulated and scientifically chal-lenging GMP manufacturing environment? How can one optimize staff performance to increase productivity, minimize costly errors, and generate tangible returns to the business? And how can this be done in a cost-effective way while meeting quality standards in a rapid timeframe? These types of questions affect all bio- pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. Traditionally, to ensure the optimal perfor-mance at a manufacturing site, management teams have focused on the quality manage-ment of the product and its process. As a result, a wide variety of methodologies and practices have evolved, and a significant vari-able present at every site has often taken a lower priority: the development of the work-force (see Figure 1 ). A c o m m o n a p p r o a c h t o t r a i n i n g s t a f f involves the \"buddy\" system. Typically, this approach pairs a new hire with a more expe-rienced colleague who has responsibility for training the new team member. Although this approach has merits, it also has signifi-cant drawbacks and can result in an incon- sistent training process across an organization. The challenge of training staff for the biopharma industry has been particularly acute in Ireland, where the pharmaceuti-cal sector has experienced sig-nificant growth over many years. The sector accounts for 50% of Irish exports and generated a record \u20ac55 billion (approximately US $68 billion) in 2011. Thirteen out of the top 15 global pharma-ceutical companies have a manu-facturing presence in Ireland, which produce 5 of the top 12 global drug products, con- solidating Ireland's position as the largest net exporter of medicines in the world (1). Following extensive consultation with industry and academia, the Irish govern-ment decided to address this training chal-lenge by establishing the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT), which officially opened in Dublin in J un e 20 1 1 ( 2 ) . Be ginning in this issu e o f BioPharm International, NIBRT's experts will provide regular expertise and commentary on best practices for key bioprocessing steps (see page 62 for Ian Nelligan's perspective on upstream processing). Podcast interviews with NIBRT training experts will also appear online at BioPharmInternational.com/BasicTraining. THE TRAINING MODEL NIBRT provides a broad range of training and education programs to a wide variety of companies, including Merck Sharp Dohme, Amgen, Lilly, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Elanco, Genzyme, and Allergan. The organi-zation's approach is based on a Five Cs model, where the Cs represent: Competency-based learning, Customized courses, Certified pro-grams, Continuous professional development, and Cost effectiveness (see Figure 2 ). These components are described below. Competency-based learning Competency-based learning ensures that trainees have significant hands-on, practi-cal training experience in a GMP-simulated en vir o nm en t. This type o f training is typ i-cally not possible in an operational manu-facturing environment where the equipment is dedicated to production. The NIBRT build-ing, for example, where training is held, holds a 6500-m 2 state-of-the-art pilot-scale Training the Biopharma Industry Using a competency-based approach to effectively train biopharmaceutical industry staff.

The building includes upstream, downstream, fill-finish, and complete process and product bioanalytical characterization facilities. ISPE recognized the plant with a 2012 Facility of the Year award (3). Customized training Companies' training needs can be highly variable, making a one-size-fits-all approach inapplicable. All aspects of training, including design, development, and delivery, should be customized to meet the spe-cific needs of a company. NIBRT holds that whether a company is establishing a new facility and needs to rapidly hire and develop a new workforce or cross-skilling experienced staff, novel pedagogical methods that incorporate distance-learning tech-ni q u es s h o ul d be used t o minimize dis ru pti o n t o normal work practice. Certified programs To ensure the highest quality standard and effec-tiveness of the training, it is recommended that training programs be accredited by a nationally recognized educational body. NIBRT's programs are accredited by partners within the Irish education system, which was ranked 7th out of 134 countries surveyed by World Economic Forum in 2010 (4). Continuous professional development Effective training should not be viewed as a one-tim e ev en t , bu t ra th er as o ng o ing co n tin u o us per -sonal development that is an integral part of the organization's culture. Training solutions should have a modular, flexible structure that facilities the integration of training within the workplace. Cost-effectiveness Training programs should be benchmarked not only to ensure their cost-competitiveness but also to ensure the effectiveness of the learning outcomes. Where pos- sible, the quantification of training benefits should be documented. CONCLUSION Since it opened in June 2011, NIBRT has deliv-ered training programs to numerous global bio-pharmaceuitcal companies, including Big Pharma, with positive feedback (6, 7). To date, the Five Cs competency-based model has been well received by both the industry and the government. The organization looks forward to sharing its approach and what it has learned in the bioprocessing area with BioPharm International readers in the months ahead. REFERENCES 1.

NIBRT provides training, educational and research solutions for the international bio-processing industry in state-of-the-art facil-ities. Located in South Dublin, it is based on an innovative collaboration between the University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin City University, and the Institute of Technology Sligo (see introduc-tion to this series on page 58). THE UPSTREAM PROCESS BioPharm: Can you start by walking us through a brief description of what's involved in a typical upstream process for manufacturing a biologic-based product? Nelligan: A typical process lasts approxi- ma t el y 40 da ys , so i t' s q ui t e l ength y . Th e first 21 to 25 days involves growing the cells. Typically, each batch starts from cells stored in an ampoule. The cells are kept viable by being stored in liquid nitrogen in the lab-oratory. These cells are laid down by the research teams who first devel-oped the cells and processes for later production. For commercial production purposes, one needs to use a vessel in a size rang-ing from a 1000 L to 10,000 L. This means the starter culture must be grown in a series of pas-sages before inoculating these large production vessels. Typically, the process begins with a few milliliters of cells in an ampoule growing up over 21 da ys t o ev en tuall y in ocul a t e a 1000-L or 2000-L production vessel. These cells last approximately 12 days in the pro-duction vessel, their metabolism being swi t ch ed fr o m gr o wth t o a p r od u cti o n s ta t e by computer control of conditions. It is in this production stage that the cells make the targeted product (i.e., the drug substance) until it's ready to be harvested. At this point, one may have a few kilograms of monoclonal antibody (mAb), for example. SCALING UP BioPharm: When scaling up from a laboratory process to a production process, as you've described here, what considerations does the man ufa cturer n eed t o k eep in min d w h en developing an overall biologic process? In other words, how can a team best prepare for the scale-up stage? Nelligan: The process must be robust, first and foremost. Animal cells are very com-plex. The industry still struggles with iden-tifying the areas of variability. Even though computer-controlled vessels are used to con-trol the cells' metabolism very tightly, the quality of the product needs to be carefully checked before being dispositioned.

If the pro-cess is not robust and the drug substance product has not been fully characterized in the early development (or clinical trial) stages, undesired variability can arise when moving to large-scale manufacture. EQUIPMENT SELECTION BioPharm: Wi th re g ard t o eq ui p- ment, there is a trend right now towards disposable, or single-use, bioreactors when performing an upstream process. In your experience, why is the indus-try changing this preference for material? Nelligan: There are two aspects of this trend. One must keep in mind that biotechnol-ogy is a relatively new industry. We are approximately 10 years old, and technology is chang-ing very quickly. The produc-tivity of the cells has increased enormously over the past 10 years. With newer strains, the amount of drug substance has increased 10-fold compared with before. This increased productivity is leading to smaller and smaller manufacturing plants. Ten years ago, production was taking place in 10,000-L ves-sels, and nowadays, it is taking place in 1000-L vessels or less. At this smaller scale, there is now the possibility of moving to a disposable plant. A 1000-L vessel is equivalent to a cubic meter, so new disposable vessels can literally sit on a laboratory countertop. Cells can therefore be cultured in disposable bags rather than in large stainless- steel bioreactors, which was norm a decade ago. When using disposables, how- ever, there are concerns regard-ing extractables in the plastic bags which can be transferred to the product. This problem does not occur in a stainless-steel environment, which is more robust. Plastics can also be quite friable. Disposable bags are lim-ited in size because they cannot hold off pressure. At this smaller scale, there is now the possibility of moving to a disposable plant. Despite these disadvantages, these bags are becoming the norm in industry. Although dis-posables are more expensive than perhaps the industry would like, companies are willing to pay the extra cost because the bags also come pre-validated and presterilized, which saves time and resources on commission-ing and validation. As a result, plants can be established more quickly; a modern plant can be designed and up and running within three months when using disposable technology, rather than the two to three years that i t m a y t a k e w h e n b u i l d i n g a stainless-steel plant.WHAT'S TO COME BioPharm: Looking ahead 10 or 20 years, what do you think will be the standard bioreactor of choice\u2014a disposable, a stainless-steel, or perhaps a hybrid model? Nelligan: We are already see- ing hybrid models\u2014partial dis-posable and partial stainless steel. People are gaining more confidence with disposable sys-tems and favor the advantages they offer. For example, the first to market with a new product usually gets the lions share. If you have a new product that you want to get on the market quickly, the way to go is the dis-posable route. z The October issue of BioPharm International will feature a primer on downstream processing with Nelligan.

The expanded XS Technology Toolbox addresses the diversity of microbially derived proteins by providing complementary expression systems that quickly deliver simple, reliable, high-yielding cGMP processes. The company has added Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) , which presents an expression option for complex proteins as an alternative to the more commonly used Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression. As a host organism, P. pastoris offers the benefits of both protein secretion and lack of endotoxin production, allowing for simplified recovery and downstream processing. Lonza's XS Bacillus subtilis system has also been added as an option for the expression of monomeric protein products at expression levels up to 20 g/L. This high yield, combined with Lonza's patented fermentation protocols, allow for fast process development and scale-up to support early clinical testing.

The machine is intended for applications in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as in research laboratories, and is suitable for the sterilization of liquids in open, semiclosed, and closed containers. The unit is especially suited for sterilizing machine parts, filters, rubber stoppers, and other equipment. Rigid and porous loads, as well as machine cavities, can be sterilized using the ADV's steam- vacuum process. Its prevacuum steps ensure the elimination of air from the chamber, and heating and sterilizing is then achieved by saturated steam. The ADV combines equipment sterilization through its vacuum process with product sterilization via its steam-air mixture process. The sterilizer can be used for almost any product and is also suited for the development of new products.
