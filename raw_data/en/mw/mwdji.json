I know you're an immature drama addicted narcissist seeking online validation because you're a miserable creature to scared to take a chance in life. So I'm leaving you and by the way.... I'd rather be a dolphin Than a human, that's right Cuz dolphin life seems way funner And 98% of humanity today is brainwashed which is a total bummer And dolphins simply just have a blast wherever they go and most humans are scared from mainstream media's propaganda don't ya know And dolphins aren't addicted to social media and smartphones They don't need online validation they just want do flips and bone Dolphins aren't forced to wear pointless masks on their face They just cruise around enjoying each moment...humanity is a disgrace And dolphins don't have corrupt politicians ordering them around They have so much fun singing and swimming never wearing a frown And I know the reason....i know the cause of humanity's problems It's cause so few treat anything with respect in this narcissystem Is there a porpoise to this song? Yes there is It's to point out that most humans can't think for themselves or handle their biz I'd rather be a dolphin Than a human (that's right) But I don't wanna be a dolphin at Sea World Or one that's caught in the tuna nets | | 2. | | | | The NUDE Normal It is time for the nude normal Strip down to nothing and get formal Let's all reconnect with nature If everyone did this it'd be major Let's be normal Let's be formal Let's live on land And breathe out of a snorkel And be a dumbass Living under an occult spell And wear pointless CONvid masks All the way to hell And let's behave all the way to our graves Ignore the fact that we are all slaves And not speak up when those in power are corrupt And do what you're told And be a sheep, yup Let's stare at tvs and dumbphones And stay brainwashed so you're thoughts ain't your own And not have any fun when you're full grown And not understand no one really owns their homes And let's be obedient Because that's the ingredient So our owners can keep up with their greediness And force the wackscene and the stupid boosters Cock-a-doodle you've been duped goes the rooster And stay addicted to that social media Because those dopamine hits are really feeling ya And how's living that lie treating you? The truth's on it's way and it's long overdue It is time for the nude normal Strip down to nothing and get formal Let's all reconnect with nature If everyone did this it'd be major I'm Guadalajara Joe in case you didn't know In touch with the source side stage of the show Coming correct on society's face Trusting my intuition always Waking up each day with so much gratitude Working kind of hard to keep a good attitude Hot lemon water when I wake up Avoiding processed foods because they're poisonous, yup Then I make fresh celery juice Keeping inflammation hung on a noose Then do some yoga to stretch out the stress Lay under a tree so my mind ain't a mess Then I go for a jog because it provides a great mood So I can actually be a decent dude Then add fruits and veggie to my smoothie Then play outside at the beach because it's groovy Then make some art that is homemade Like this lo-fi song that will never get me paid But who even cares Because I get to share my soul with you And to me that is fair It is time for the nude normal Strip down to nothing and get formal Let's all reconnect with nature If everyone did this it'd be major And the universe would applaud And it's actually not that hard Because it's all in our heads And we need to have an abundance mindset instead So let's adopt it asap Or else the universe is going to keep giving our souls a slap LOL | | 3. | | | | Adios, Social Media Adios, Social Media, Adios Adios, Social Media, Adios Adios, Social Media, Adios I deleted it cuz it's toxic and gross I deleted my social media And now I feel so free No more dopamine hits Or CIA tracking me I found social media to be so wack Breeding so many narcissists Yup, that's a fact Now I just live in the moment Without looking back Now I can operate in real life and stay on track! And deleting it was such a terrific decision I found it to be an unhealthy and toxic addiction Welp That's what I had to say And if you still use it You should delete it today But a lot of my friends and family are still on it And I love them dearly in REAL LIFE, dog gone it Social media's so empty Not social at all It's an outdated scam Like us living on a fictional spinning ball Snap chat, adios Media, Adios Adios, Social Media, Adios I deleted all of it because it's toxic and gross Well actually I couldn't figure out how to delete MySpace And while I was in the schitter adios to Twitter | | 4. | | What are they spraying on us? Why are so few making a fuss? I guess cuz no one really even looks up Into the beautiful sky Whether it be day or night So few are asking about these weird lines? I look up all the time And witness clear skies That get bombarded by Planes spraying white lines They're military drones But few people know Cuz they are too prone To staring at their phones So many clear days Get cloudy after sprays The blue and sun go away no one even says a thing! And then at night When the stars and moon shine bright They spray us alright Which pollutes everything outside What are they spraying on us? Why are so few making a fuss? I guess cuz no one really even looks up Into the beautiful sky Whether it be day or night So few are asking about these weird lines? They're poisoning us To keep us sick Spraying heavy metals, Those soulless pricks They control the weather When they spray Aluminum, strontium and barium Hay! They convince everyone It's crimate change But it's weather modification Aka geoengineering Global warming is fake Time to be awake Stop being a fruitcake Fight for humanity's sake! What are they Spraying on Us? Why are so few making a fuss? I guess cuz no one really even looks up Into the beautiful sky Whether it be day or night So few are asking about these weird lines? I think we gotta starve the government funding of these spraying programs and let them know that we see through their climate change and globalwarming b.s. Real talk They spray you They spray me They spray us together Can't you see? | | 5. | | Here's some of the funders of the CDC They're all corrupt just follow the money They scripted this scamdemic with nothing but LIES!

And if you proudly wear your muzzle You're more confusing than a jigsaw puzzle So take them off especially the kids And just say NO to being scared Of a fake pandemic that's fueled by fear That was scripted in the 90's so let's all cheer For the Davos forum where they wrote this scam Too lazy to research? There I did it for you, Man! So stop wearing those masks Cuz you look just like an ass You're being mentally controlled Congrats! You're a MaskHole! Please Stop wearing those masks Cuz you look just like an ass You're being mentally controlled Congrats! You're a MaskHole! And if you wear a mask all alone in your car You're officially a total retard So take that mask and shove it up your ass Cuz you're obedience ain't a boarding pass Cuz These Masks are pointless They're for idiots They're a false security and that's about it I'm so sick of the lack of logic By so many dipchit and pompous pricks So many people are too far gone To understand what's really going on So I thought I'd make this funky song For those critical thinkers who truly know right from wrong Sooo Stop wearing those masks Cuz you look just like an ass You're being mentally controlled Congrats! You're a MaskHole! Please Stop wearing those masks Cuz you look just like an ass You're being mentally controlled Congrats! You're a MaskHole!

So take those masks off the kids' faces cuz the parents and teachers are being disgraces. | | 9. | | | | The SCAMdemic Ends When We're in World War 3 Why can't most people see I guess cuz they're too busy Obeying authority The war is quiet this time It's a battle on the mind They use so much propaganda That most can't recognize Most got dumbed down to perfection So that very few question The agenda that is rolling out Which is depopulation And they lie to you and me Say it's for our safety And I can see right through these criminals That are on your TV Disguised as protectors But they're actually molesters Who did I vote for? Myself and protesters! So tune out their B.S Go into nature lose the stress Stop following their mandates Let's get our freedoms back! This Scamdemic ends when People stop complying It's Time to understand Their agenda's depopulation They said only two weeks To slowly spread of our ass cheeks And people put the masks right on Now we're up shit's creek Seems like there's no end To how far the sheep will bend Blindly obeying To all this pointless nonsense Falling quickly for a Scam That took decades to plan Doesn't anyone do research On the murder of Cary Mullis , Man? The virus is a distraction From our sovereignty Infraction Now any exchanges that we make Are digital transactions The government ain't saving you (sorry) They renamed the flu and that's the truth If you trust corrupt puppets You've got Stockholm syndrome dudes There's surge and it's contagious (sarcastic) from another variant (sarcastic dork voice) Oh yeah? You're just parroting b.s. And that's apparent And This Scamdemic ends when People stop complying They're in the middle of creating A one-world surveillance government And I realize a lot of peeps Have families to feed And mortages and careers But humanity actually needs Everyone to disobey To mainstream news turn away Look up MK ULTRA mind control Conducted by the CIA Stay skeptical and not safe It's got 99% survival rate Eat way more fruits and veggies So the tyrants get irate So please stop complying To yourself you are lying Cuz the only way to free yourself Is focus on living not dying The sheep are so high On spoonfed lies Please trust yourself So real freedom survives To win this battle it is simple Recognize the swindle The science is corrupt Let's pop their plan like a pimple! SO many people are high on misinformation and then they censor the real information, and that's where we are. If you think a virus is scary wait until you find out what's really going on! | | 10. | | | | Corrupt as Phuck The Government corrupt as phuck Big Pharma are corrupt as phuck Drug Dealing Doctors corrupt as phuck Why can't people understand whats up? Fact Checkers and Censors corrupt as phuck Major Corporations corrupt as phuck Wall Street corrupt as phuck too Why can't people wake the phuck up, dudes? Well I don't know about you But I'm sick of being lied to And used and abused By psychopaths who never tell the truth They gotcha distracted with smartphones that's the tactic with entertainment that's wackness and scripted news that's anticlimactic I'm intuitive and healthy Rather spiritually wealthy Who truly wants sovereignty So I can live independently. In nature with God Far away from retards Who mask themselves with facades Existing comfortably within a fraud And These tyrants at the top Better fucking stop Waging silent wars on us With their criminal plots Cuz karma's gunna get them They're overflowing in sin And history repeats when? Again and again Yup! Mainstream media are corrupt as phuck Sellout entertainers corrupt as phuck The educational system corrupt as phuck Why can't people understand whats up The CIA are corrupt as phuck The CDC are corrupt as phuck The FDA are Corrupt as phuck Why can't people wake the phuck up? And this whole lazy slave system Is pissing me off Phuck technocracy Everybody got soft And Beta and weak Where's the guts to speak UP against the tyranny Too busy on Instagram or watching Disney? Getting high on processed food? So your health gets screwed Stop abusing your kids Heaven forbid Remove their muzzles And feed them fruits and vegetables Show them how to plant seeds So in the future they won't need To depend on this narcissystem That just wants to kill them And you and me and everybody It's time to flee from being unhealthy yup And speaking of wealth How about the FDA? I bought 2000 shares of the cure for CONvid AND AIDS Think it got approved? Think again dudes Cytodyn's Leronlimab got shorted Then rejected then defused It has zero side effects It passed all the tests In the trials at the clinics Could've saved millions of deaths And its such a shame That there's a hidden endgame To inoculate humanity Under the guise of being safe When really it's genocide Under the guise of a bunch of lies Surprise! You better detox, Cuz the government wants you dead you pompous cocks! Or has the Stockholm syndrome paralyzed you? Think you're safe think again fools You're all sitting ducks And that's what up Cuz that comfort bubble Is about to pop | | 11. | | A Lovely Plastic Solution There's a lot of talk about plastic. Like we can't get rid of it There's islands of it in the ocean It's all over the landfills and takes years to decompose But here's a solution There is a total solution To all this plastic pollution It's a mushroom called Pestalotiopsis microspora And it eats plastic It can clean the earth for ya Then humans can eat this mushroom That means world hunger can be solved too Not sure why not many people are discussing this issue Because a mushroom that eats plastic and you can eat the mushroom needs to be discussed more, dudes. So I thought I'd record it into song form So there's no more plastic and no more hunger Nature always has the solution for us Guadalajara Joe California Songwriter/Dancer [Streaming and ](https://bandcamp.com/help/downloading?from=tralbum_downloading)Download help [Bandcamp Daily](https://daily.bandcamp.com?utm_source=footer) "}
