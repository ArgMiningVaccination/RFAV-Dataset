Your appointment will include RBTI (Reams Biological Theory of Ionization) screening which is a urine and saliva review that is done in advance of your hour appointment.

A two-hour fasting of food, gum, and drink is required; water is acceptable up to 15 minutes prior to arrival. Your visit can include mind, body, and spirit discussions and progress on your healing journey. Bio feedback tools are available to review energy balances in the body with regards to supplements and/or food. These visits are great for intuitive dialogue. An intuitive scan can include, but not limited to, energy blocks limiting your full life fulfillment, energy disturbances in the body, spirit animal messengers, home scans, and/or messages from loved ones. More importantly, Divine spirit will provide you with the information you need at this time, and specifically for you. This scan can be done via phone or office visit. The BioGenesis System provides a completely non-invasive method for gaining valuable information about your body's vital functions. The primary objective of the screening is to disclose patterns of stress and provide feedback that will assist in developing a program to restore each system and meridian to balance. If you're out of state, no problem; call the office and we can coordinate a remote meeting. Scan includes imprint sent in person, or remote. The body has 7 core energy centers (chakras) and through daily life they can become blocked and out of balance. If we have a block in the energy flow of our chakras, this will lead to an imbalance and possibly to a mental-spiritual or physical dis-ease. Erika uses a quick natural approach with Divine Light energy to bring balance back. An educational handout regarding these energy centers will be provided. Ask about our JOURNEY TO HEALTH PACKAGE!
