Integrative and functional medicine looks at how exposure to natural and manufactured chemicals and elements can affect your health. Detoxification is a process by which you remove toxins and other harmful substances from your body to improve your physical, mental, and spiritual wellness. When your body functions at its best, the liver, lungs, kidneys, colon, blood, skin, and lymphatic systems effectively eliminate toxins absorbed through the skin, lungs, and digestive system. When your body is not functioning at its best, toxins can build up, overwhelm these systems, and cause significant health problems. Your personalized detoxification plan at ARA Integrative and Functional Medicine helps reset, stimulate, and boost the body's natural ability to filter out harmful substances from air, pesticides, food, medications, cosmetics, and manufactured products. What conditions can detoxification help to improve? - Joint and muscle pain - Metabolic disease - Brain fog - Fatigue - Headaches and migraines - Allergies - Digestive disorders and poor gut health - Autoimmune disease - Gastric reflux and gallbladder disease - Hormone imbalance Exposure to toxic substances can cause systemic, chronic inflammation that damages gut health, the brain, immune system, heart, lungs, and more.
