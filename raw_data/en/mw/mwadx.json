Price Foundation", "date": "2020-04-18", "cleaned_text": "[ Print post](javascript:window.print()) As a misguided response to the Coronavirus pandemic, some have suggested that if vaccines become available, they should be mandatory for all people. It has also been suggested that everyone should be required to obtain a \"digital certificate\" to display their health and vaccination status. Experimental vaccines are already in development and will be fast-tracked to licensure for global use. The vaccine developers have been given permission to rush their vaccines to market without testing in animals - and have also been given complete immunity if their vaccines cause harm. All previous coronavirus vaccines in vaccine trials have shown significant harmful side effects, and there is every reason to expect that a fast-tracked COVID vaccine would as well. Vaccine tracking systems have been used to harass those who have chosen to delay or decline vaccines in the past. With the fear surrounding COVID, it is likely that you will not be allowed to go to work, use public transportation, etc. if you are not vaccinated. People who cannot afford to stay home because of the loss of income (or who don't want to be trapped in their homes at the whim of the government) will be effectively forced to vaccinate, no matter what dangerous side effects they risk. We can address disease issues, including COVID, without forcing people to accept high-risk vaccinations (while letting the companies that produce them walk away with massive profits and no liability). Please act now! TAKE ACTION Contact your U.S. Senators and Representative and urge them to OPPOSE any legislation that would force vaccination or tracking. You can look up who represents you at: [https://contactingcongress.org](https://contactingcongress.org) Calls are more effective than emails, and only take a few minutes. Sample script: \"Hi, my name is ____ and I live in (town). I am calling to ask Senator (or Representative) ____ to OPPOSE any legislation that would mandate vaccinations or tracking devices for COVID-19. COVID vaccines are being fast-tracked and manufactures have been shielded from liability for any harm they may cause. People should not be forced to be vaccinated with a vaccine that could cause serious side effects, even death. And while I support reducing the restrictions on Americans' movements, that should not be limited to those people willing to be tracked by the government. I urge you to do everything in your power to prevent mandatory vaccination and tracking.\" Talking Points: Keep your call or email short! Pick the 2 or 3 talking points that are most important to you, and be sure to explain why this issue matters to you personally. - A healthy diet with lots of fat-soluble vitamins, preventive measures to boost people's immune systems, the use of intravenous Vitamin C and zinc, and other measures can reduce the severity of the disease without side effects, and without destroying people's civil rights. - 2006 Federal legislation removed all civil liability from pharmaceutical companies for injuries and deaths caused by vaccines and drugs manufactured in response to declared public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. - On April 10, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci announced that the government is considering issuing Americans certificates of immunity from the coronavirus. In other words, the government is considering creating two classes of citizens - those who can move freely and those who cannot. - On March 24, 2020, the Director of Division of Vital Statistics issued a COVID-19 memo informing doctors and coroners \"a newly-introduced ICD code has been implemented to accurately capture mortality data for Coronavirus Disease 2019 on death certificates.\" The memo stated, \" COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have or contributed to death.\" No test or proof is necessary to label a death as COVID-19. - Testing has been incredibly flawed for COVID-19, with reports of both false positives and false negatives. It is likely that many influenza or other respiratory illness patients are being counted as COVID-19 cases and deaths. - A coronavirus vaccine will likely not be safe or effective, based on previous failed attempts to create coronavirus vaccines. Currently the WHO, National Institutes of Health, universities, and global pharmaceutical corporations are in development of over 50 experimental COVID-19 vaccines, which will guarantee big profits. - Many of the new vaccines being created use DNA or mRNA technology which use a faster and less expensive technology. Neither DNA or mRNA vaccines have been tested in large-scale clinical trials. These new technology platforms have been used to develop experimental vaccines for SARS, MERS, and HIV, but so far, none have been proven effective and safe for humans. - Immunization information systems and vaccine tracking systems are already being used for a range of [interventions](http://www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccines/index.html), including [home visits,](https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/vaccination-programs-home-visits-increase-vaccination-rates) [reminder and recall systems](https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/vaccination-programs-client-reminder-and-recall-systems), which can be harassing for people who do not want these contacts. Any experimental vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be optional, and people's decision on whether or not to vaccinate should remain private.
