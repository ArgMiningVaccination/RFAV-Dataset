Educating students would come to a temporary halt as students would need to be assessed by healthcare workers for any physical ailments and for anyone that has never been vaccinated. Any students discovered to be symptomatic and possibly infected would need to be isolated and treated, and any students without immunity would need to be vaccinated. This would also be the case with businesses in that employees would need to be assessed as well, which would slow down productivity for the businesses. Hospitals would have to invest time into making sure all healthcare workers were immunized and getting immunizations to the ones that were not or send them home after making sure they were not infected. Special Importance of Measle Vaccination It has been a hot topic lately in the radio, television, and news about parents not getting their kids measle vaccination even though it is mandatory, causing other problems to parents that took their kids to get vaccination shot. Measle is highly contagious respiratory disease that is caused by a virus, it was eliminated in the 19th century but it came back and is widely spreading again, affecting children that are vaccinated and children who did not took the shot at school, which is causing worries to the parents. It is mandatory to get a measle vaccination, it is crucial for everyone to participate in order for the virus to be fully eliminated, and parents who are working will be rest assured to leave their son and daughter to the school's care. It is transmitted very easily through the air, when the person infected coughs or sneezes (Chang, 2015). Runny nose, fever, and the tell-tale rash are symptoms associated with this disease (Chang, 2015). Those particularly at risk include pregnant women, infants too young to have received immunization and those with a depressed immune system (Chang, 2015). Measles became a nationally recognized disease in 1912, with 6000 measles-related deaths in each year of that first decade (CDC, 2014). According to the CDC (2014) \"In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. It is estimated 3 to 4 million people in the United States were infected each year. Also each year an estimated 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 4,000 suffered encephalitis (swelling of the brain) from 2Measles, Mumps, and measles, mumps, and rubella. These diseases are highly contagious. Viruses cause all three of these illnesses, and they spread through the air. They can pass from person to person through coughing, sneezing, or just breathing.According to CDC, children are recommended to get two doses of MMR vaccine. For the best protection against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, children need to be vaccinated twice, once when they are 12-15 months old, and again when they are 4-6 years old. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination. CDC advises most adults born in 1957 or afterward who can't show that they've had all 3 diseases get an MMR vaccine, whether they had one as a child or not.MMRV is given by shot and may be given at the same time as other vaccines. The MMR vaccine is very safe, and it is effective at preventing The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that 145,700 deaths in 2013 were caused from measles globally (World Health Organization, 2015). Measles is a contagious disease that has been around for centuries (Measles, n.d.). The majority of the population that is affected by measles are young children (Measles, n.d.). A vaccine was developed for the prevention of measles and has decreased the rate of death by 75% (WHO, 2015). Advancements have been made to eliminate measles globally through proper vaccination; however, still many children go without vaccination against measles (Centers for Diesease Control and Prevention, 2015). The virus known as Measles There are many viruses today that at one time were a deadly disease, however because of advances in technology and vaccinations, we no longer give them a second thought. Prior to the discovery of a vaccination, the United States reported a total of over 50,000 cases of measles outbreaks each year with 450-500 cases resulting in death. (NCIRD) Since the disbursement of an effective vaccination, the measles has been almost eradicated in the United States; however it is still abundant in other countries around the world. (The college of physicians of Philadelphia) Is this something we think of when we are traveling? Is it possible for people to visit or immigrate to the United States carrying the disease with Relevance of the Research Problem (2012) For this research study the author searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011). Using a comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement. The study included five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case-control studies, five time-series trials, one case cross-over trial, two ecological studies, six self-controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts. In 1963 the first measles vaccine was licensed, but as it only contained killed rubeola virus, it was largely ineffective. Later on, in 1968, a vaccine with live, attenuated rubeola virus was licensed, and is still used for routine immunization of infants and children. Usually the vaccine is in combination with either mumps and rubella (MMR) or mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV). The recommended administration of this vaccine is in two doses; the first, between 12-15 months, and the second, between 4-6 years of age. If the first dose is administered before 12 months, the vaccine could fail due to the presence of maternal antibodies which can interfere with the infant immune response. While measles is a global issue, immunization has significantly decreased incidence in the U.S. and as a result the most cases come from either failure to immunize infants/children due to religion conflicts or other objections, or cases brought into the U.S. from other If you have ever had the flu, you know how contagious it can be. You would generally try to stay in bed and keep your sickness contained. The measles is extremely contagious, if single person contracts the disease, 90% of the people who are close to them, who are not immune, will also become infected with the measles. People of the United should get the measles vaccination because of how high the contagion rate is. If an outbreak were to break out over half the people you know would become infected! How does the measles affect you and your loved ones? First, I will explain the disease in depth, then I will tell you why you should get the vaccination, and finally I will tell you how to get the vaccination. It affects 90% of people who are exposed to it. Measles is the leading death of children. In the year of 2015 about 134,200 children died that's about 367 deaths every day or 15 deaths for every hour. But over the course years of 2000-2015 the MMR vaccination prevented death by an estimated 20.3 million, this was one of the best buys in public health. Scientists still haven't found any right treatments to kill the virus completely. It is still best to get a Vaccine to prevent getting measles and also practicing good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water often or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, not touching your eyes, mouth, or nose unless your hands are clean, covering your nose and mouth with you sneeze or cough with a tissue, and avoiding contact with people who are Getting the recommended vaccinations is essential for public health and safety, especially in this global world as vaccinations are an effective way of reducing and even eliminating diseases. \"Before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. Since the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, ongoing measles transmission was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000\" (Immunize For Good). The extreme reduction in cases in the US after the vaccine was distributed is evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the measles. Even if there is a slight risk associated with the MMR vaccine, the vaccine is still the safer choice when choosing to vaccinate one's child for both the child and for the population as a one vaccine when they newborn child, and the other when they between five to nineteen years. As a result, the children have perfect protection from the measles. On the other hand, if anyone does not take vaccines to prevent the disease, and he exposed the virus, no specific medicine is able to kill the virus. However, some precautions are able to relieve the signs and symptoms of the disease, and decrease the serious complications which they lead to death such as Bronchitis, Encephalitis and Pneumonia. For example, the child who non immunized and exposed the virus, should take a vaccine such as MMR and MMRV during 72 hours. Moreover, the child should take fever reducers, antibiotics which reduce the complications and vitamin A. All these precautions can reduce the risk, but they cannot eliminate the Success story of eradication processes have been reported in Finland and other part of Europe is several prospective studies. Widespread implementation of vaccine programs in the United States is reported to have led to greater than 99% decline in cases of Measles and Rubella and is reported that an estimated 52million cases of the disease, 17400 cases of mental retardation and 5,200 deaths were attributed to the first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination. Also an estimated 1.4 million deaths were adverted as a result of the immunization drive led by WHO and UNICEF between 1999 and 2004. Conversely, before the introduction of measles vaccination, an estimated 4 million Americans were diagnosed with measles with 48,000 hospitalization and 3,000 deaths. Also the outbreak of measles in the late 1980s and early 1990s was attributed to low immunization that resulted in 11,000 cases with 120 deaths3. Recent reported cases of measles in the United States are attributed to imported cases and unimmunized communities (i.e. Amish Measles (also known as rubeola or \"red measles\") is an acute, febrile viral infection that was a very familiar childhood infection world-wide until the introduction of an attenuated live-virus vaccine in the 1960's. Now it is rarely seen in the United States and the rest of the medically developed world, re-emerging usually only when and where there has been a lapse in routine immunization practices and the necessary high levels of vaccine coverage have dropped. On a global scale, prior to the measles vaccine, the effects of measles were devastating \u2014 millions died from measles each year in all parts of the world. However, global measles deaths are diminishing, decreased by 75% from an estimated 544,200 in 2000 to 145,700 in 2013 (Moss and Griffin, 2012; WHO, 2015 Feb). "}
