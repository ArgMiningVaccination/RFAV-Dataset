Such cost-effective interventions are already available and include methods for early detection of NCDs and their diagnoses using inexpensive technologies, non pharmacological and pharmacological approaches for modifica - tion of NCD risk factors and affordable medications for prevention and treatment of heart attacks and strokes, diabetes, cancer and asthma. These low technology interventions, if effectively delivered, can reap future savings in terms of reduced medical costs, improved quality of life and productivity. However, due to weak health systems, there are substantive gaps in their implementation particularly in LMIC. Efficient use of limited health care resources, sustainable health financing mechanisms, access to basic diagnostics and essential medicines and organized medical information and referral systems are imperative for provision of equitable care for people with and at risk of NCDs. They require long-term care that is proactive, patient centered, community based and sustainable. Such care can be deliv - ered equitably only through health systems based on primary health care (PHC). Further, two billion people in the world are living below the pov - erty line and poverty and NCDs are linked through many pathways. Although providing good quality care for the poor is an ethical impera - tive, due to weak health systems and inadequate health-care expendi - ture of many countries, the poor do not have access to services at all or receive substandard services. Furthermore, out-of-pocket expenditure is unacceptably high in many LMIC. Countries need to transform and regulate health systems for universal access and social protection. This transformation will take several years given the global financial status and wide disparities in domestic resources between countries. In the meantime, Ministries of Health (MoHs) need to take steps to improve health outcomes and to reduce rising health-care costs due to NCDs and their preventable complications. The WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Inter - ventions (WHO PEN) for primary care in low-resource settings is an innovative and action-oriented response to the above challenges. It is a prioritized set of cost-effective interventions that can be delivered to an acceptable quality of care, even in resource-poor settings. It will reinforce health system strengthening by contributing to the building blocks of the health system (table i, table ii). Cost effectiveness of the selected interventions will help to make limited resources go further 8 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsand the user-friendly nature of the tools that are been developed, will empower primary care physicians as well as allied health workers to contribute to NCD care (table iii). It should not be considered as yet another package of basic services but, rather, an important first step for integration of NCD into PHC and for reforms that need to cut across the established boundaries of the building blocks of national health systems. WHO PEN is the minimum standard for NCDs to strengthen national capacity to integrate and scale up care of heart disease, stroke, cardiovascular risk, diabetes, cancer, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings. Most importantly, it defines a minimum set of essential NCD interventions for any country that wishes to initiate a process of universal coverage reforms to ensure that health systems contribute to health equity, social justice, community solidarity and human rights. Why do we need these implementation tools? These tools of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Diseases Interventions (WHO PEN) support implementation of very cost effective interventions through an integrated approach. Implementation of WHO PEN is a key component of the objective 4 of the Global Action Plan. These tools will enable early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respira - tory diseases and cancer to prevent life threatening complications (e.g. heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure, amputations, blindness). Effective implementation of WHO PEN, combined with other very cost effective population-wide interventions, will help even resource constrained settings to attain the global voluntary targets related to reduction of premature mortality and prevention of heart attacks and strokes*. Equitable financing of interventions in WHO PEN can be a first step for addressing prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases within the universal health coverage agenda. * A 25% relative reduction in risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease * Prevention of heart attacks and strokes by providing treat - ment (including glycemic control) and counselling at least to 50% of eligible people (those with a 10 year cardiovascular risk equal to or above 30%) and reducing their cardiovas - cular risk.9 Table i: WHO PEN for primary care in low-resource settings overview* Goals To close the gap between what is needed and what is currently available to reduce the burden, health-care costs and human suffering due to major NCDs by achieving higher coverage of essential interventions in LMIC To achieve universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centred treatment To reduce the suffering and socioeconomic burden associated with major NCDs To protect poor and vulnerable populations from heart disease, stroke, hypertension cancer, diabetes, asthma and chronic respiratory disease To provide effective and affordable prevention and treatment through primary care To support early detection, community engagement and self-care Objectives Equity and efficiency objectivesImprove the efficiency of care of major NCD in primary care through: enhanced implementation of human rights standards; provision of cost effective interventions based on need rather than ability to pay; targeting limited resources to those who are most likely to benefit due to high risk; standardization of diagnostic and investigation procedures and drug prescription; formulation of referral criteria for further assessment or hospitalization; definition of parameters for planning and budget; selection of monitoring and evaluation indicators. Quality of care objectivesImprove the quality of care of major NCD in primary care through: cost effective case management; appropriate referral and follow-up; prevention, early detection and cost effective case management management of exacerbations and emergencies; follow-up of long-term treatment prescribed by the specialist. Health impact objectivesHave a beneficial impact on health through: reduction of tobacco consumption in NCD patients; reduction of the average delay in the diagnosis of NCD by the health services; reduction of the risk of heart attacks, strokes, amputations and kidney failure; reduction of case fatality of major NCDs; prevention of acute events and complications; prolongation of the duration of stable clinical periods for CVDs, diabetes, asthma and COPD patients. * Reference: World Health Organization Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings, World Health Organization, 2010.10 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsTable ii: Contribution of WHO PEN to Health System Building Blocks* Leadership/governance Assess needs and gaps and facilitate the use of available resources for prevention and control of NCDs efficiently and equitably Support government efforts to drive the agenda towards universal coverage.

Asthma is considered to be well controlled if the patient has: daytime asthma symptoms and uses a beta agonist two or fewer times per week; night time asthma symptoms two or fewer times per month; no or minimal limitation of daily activities; no severe exacerbation (i.e. requiring oral steroids or admission to hospital) within a month; a PEFR, if available, above 80% predicted. If any of these markers are exceeded, the patient is considered to have uncontrolled asthma. Increase or decrease treatment according to how well asthma is controlled using a stepwise approach Step 1. Inhaled salbutamol prn Step 2. Inhaled salbutamol prn plus low-dose inhaled beclometasone, starting with 100ug twice daily for adults and 100ug once or twice daily for childrenStep 3.

Moreover, these referral guidelines for five cancer sites belong to a broader set of guidelines for essential interventions for noncommuni - cable diseases (NCDs). Their intended use is for primary health-care physicians, nurses, and other health-care practitioners at Primary Health Care (PHC) in resource-constrained settings, where the majority of cancer cases are diagnosed in late stages. The primary objective of these guidelines is to guide primary care practitioners in the early identification of patients with signs and symptoms suspicious of breast and cervical cancer so they can be immediately referred to the next level of care for diagnosis and sub - sequent treatment, if cancer is confirmed . The application of these guidelines at PHC requires raising aware - ness on the early symptoms and signs of breast and cervical cancer among the general population and encouraging target women to seek prompt attention at PHC centres. It also requires adequate access to specialized diagnostic and treatment services for referral cases. Due to the brief nature of the guidelines, they can be easily and widely dis - seminated for day-to-day use by PHC practitioners. It is expected that the implementation of these guidelines will contribute to increasing the percentage of cases diagnosed in the early stages of disease in the short-term, as well as increasing survival rates and reducing mortal - ity from breast and cervical cancer in the medium- and long-term. In the case of cervical cancer, the guidelines target the detection of invasive cervical cancer in early clinical stages and are complementary to the objectives of the WHO guidelines titled Comprehensive cervi - cal cancer control \u2014 A guide to essential practice (C4GEP). As stated in C4GEP, organized population-based screening of women over 30 years of age is the key early detection strategy that can reduce the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer in a significant way. However, in those settings where cervical cancer screening is not yet available or is in its initial stages of development, prompt referral based on symptoms and signs is the only other method of diagnosing cervical cancer in earlier stages when treatment is more effective. It is also important to keep in mind that even in well-established cervical screening programmes there are women who will present with an invasive cancer that can be detected early through warning signs and symptoms. These are mainly women who do not receive screening, as well as women who, although regularly screened, may have a false negative result or develop an interval cancer. 33 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings These guidelines were developed according to the WHO process for guideline development. They include recommendations for referral to the next level of care and are based on the Grading of Recommenda - tions Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool, and the Guideline Development Group (GDG) considerations. Women aged 30 years and older have the highest risk of developing breast or cervical cancer, whereas these cancer types are compara - tively rare in women under this age (GLOBOCAN, 2008; Ferlay et al . 2010). Therefore, the GDG decided to provide, as appropriate, distinct recommendations according to the different age groups and ensure the focus is on women at risk. Otherwise there is a danger of a dramatic increase of false positives from women under 30 years of age with unnecessary overload of the health system. Most of the evidence for signs and symptoms was assessed as low quality (see Grade Tables in Annex I). However, based on GDG clinical considerations, and the high value placed by all GDG members in detect - ing cancer in earlier stages, the following are strong recommendations for referral of women with possible breast and cervical cancer: Breast cancer Women who report any breast symptoms at PHC should undergo physical examination of both breasts, both axillae, and the neck prior to referral. Women with a palpable breast lump, unilateral spontaneous nipple discharge (particularly bloody discharge) , or any change in the shape, consistency, or density of the breast, whether associated with other symptoms or risk factors, should be referred to a facility where diagnosis, staging, and treatment of breast cancer can be efficiently carried out as indicated below: Women aged 30 years and older with a breast lump, spontaneous unilateral nipple discharge (particularly bloody discharge), skin changes such as eczematous changes in or around the nipple or areola, skin tethering, and skin or nipple retraction should be referred for further investigations to rule out breast cancer Women under the age of 30 years with a breast lump should only be referred for further investigation if the lump enlarges or has other features associated with cancer (such as fixed or hard - ness or the presence of skin changes) or in whom there are other reasons for concern, such as a family history of breast cancer, former breast cancer, or prior therapeutic chest irradiation. Women with any other symptoms highly indicative of advanced breast cancer (such as a large lump in the breast, skin ulceration, 34 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsaxillary swelling, palpable axillary nodes, swelling in the neck, severe back pain) should also be referred to a specialized centre for diagnosis and appropriate care. Women found with no abnormalities upon physical examination should be taught breast awareness. This comprises educating women on breast cancer signs and symptoms, encouraging them to be aware of their normal breast and of any changes by periodic self-palpation, as well as empowering them to seek care promptly in case of any future breast abnormalities. Cervical cancer Women who report at PHC any gynaecological sign or symptom sus - picious of early cervical cancer (such as abnormal vaginal bleeding,1 persistent, foul-smelling discharge, or pain during vaginal inter - course) should, where possible, undergo a speculum examination. The following important issues should be taken into consideration: In women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, with persistent, foul- smelling discharge, or experiencing pain during vaginal inter - course, the presence of a cervical growth or ulceration should prompt immediate referral for diagnostic confirmation and man - agement without manipulation because of the significant risk of bleeding, which may be difficult to control. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, with persistent, foul-smelling discharge, or experiencing pain during vaginal inter - course, without clinically detected cervical growth or ulcer - ation , are likely to have a non-malignant condition, particularly if they are under 30 years old. These women should be treated as appropriate2 and be referred to a specialist to rule out cervical cancer only if the condition persists or has worsened at the time of a follow-up visit. In making a recommendation for further investigation, it should be emphasized that the likeliest possibility is that vaginal bleed - ing, persistent, foul-smelling discharge, or pain during vaginal intercourse with or without clinically detected cervical growth or ulceration are not caused by a cancer. However, it is important to undergo further investigation because, in the event that cancer is 1 Abnormal vaginal bleeding includes occurrences after coitus, between menstrual periods, or after menopause. 2 For further information, consult the following WHO guidelines: WHO Guidelines for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections (WHO 2003) and Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors (WHO 2000).35 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings diagnosed, the treatment outcome is much better when the cancer is detected early and treated properly. This is particularly relevant in women 30 years and older who are at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Women with any signs or symptoms associated with advanced cervi - cal cancer (such as severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe back pain, neck swelling, or symptoms of urethral and rectal fistula) should also be referred to a specialized centre for confirma - tion diagnosis and appropriate care.36 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsIntroduction The Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncom - municable Diseases (NCDs) 2013-2020, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2013, (WHO, 2013) calls upon WHO to provide techni - cal guidance to countries for the integration into their health systems of cost-effective interventions against major NCDs. This includes the early detection of cancer. In low-resource settings where the major - ity of patients present in late stages, there is a general lack of early detection programmes. Early detection comprises two strategies: screening and early diag - nosis . Screening is the systematic application of a screening test for a specific cancer in asymptomatic population. Early diagnosis (also known as downstaging) is based on improved public and professional awareness (particularly at the PHC level) of signs and symptoms associ - ated with cancer, improved health-care seeking behaviour, and prompt clinical assessment and early referral of suspected cancer cases such that appropriate diagnostic investigations and treatment can be rap - idly instituted leading to improved survival outcomes with minimal morbidity and cost. In low-resource settings, more than 80% of breast and cervical can - cers are diagnosed in locally advanced stages or with distant metas - tases. Therefore, in countries that have very limited health system capacity, the overall 5-year survival rate is dismally low, with a range between 10 to 40%. On the other hand, the 5-year survival rate for early, localized breast and cervical cancers exceeds 80% in settings where basic treatment is available and accessible (Ferlay et al . 2010; Sankaranarayanan et al. 2010 and 2011). Thus, early diagnosis of cancer is initially a very suitable and affordable strategy for early detection and is complementary to screening strategies, when avail - able. Screening is a much more complex public health undertaking than early diagnosis and can be cost-effective when the adequate health system capacity has been achieved and screening coverage has reached over 70% of the target group (WHO, 2007). The Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low resource settings are part of a broader set of guidelines for essential interventions for NCDs targeting pri - mary health-care providers, such as physicians, nurses, and other health-care practitioners, at PHC facilities in resource-constrained settings (WHO, 2011). Early stages of breast and cervical cancer can be more effectively treated than those in advanced stages, through the use of more affordable and less aggressive therapeutic options with fewer side effects, complications and, as a result, enhanced quality 37 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings of life. The survival and mortality outcomes for breast and cervical cancer improved significantly in developed countries much before the introduction of organized screening thanks to improved awareness, clinical diagnosis, and adequate treatment in health services (Sparen et al. 1995; Ponten et al . 1995; Lim et al . 2009). The lack of awareness among PHC practitioners is a major factor resulting in delayed referral and detection of disease in advanced stages (Thongsuksai et al . 2000, Clegg-Lampley et al . 2009, Vandborg et al. 2011). Therefore, these guidelines are aimed at improving the skills of PHC providers in suspecting possible breast and cervical cancer followed by immediate referral of cases with clinical charac - teristics consistent with the possibility of cancer to a secondary or tertiary care facility. This is fundamental to an early detection strategy aimed at earlier clinical diagnosis. The current guidelines assume that there is enough capacity in health services to provide adequate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. Due to the fact that cancer treatment is provided only if diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, the benefits of referring symptomatic women for further investigations outweigh the harms that might result from unnecessary diagnostic tests done in false positive cases. Evidence- based guidelines for referral of patients with suspected cancer at the PHC level have so far not been developed by WHO or by any low- or middle-income country with a wide participation by different stake - holders. A systematic review of the symptoms, signs, and risk factors associated with early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer provides a valuable basis on which to formulate pragmatic, easy-to-use guide - lines for primary care practitioners. In the case of cervical cancer, the guidelines target the detection of invasive cervical cancer in early clinical stages and are, therefore, complementary to the objectives of Comprehensive cervical cancer control \u2014 A guide to essential practice (C4GEP). As stated in C4GEP, organized population-based screening of women over 30 years of age is the key early detection strategy that can reduce the incidence and mortality of invasive cervical cancer in a significant way. However, in those settings where cervical cancer screening is not yet available or is in its initial stages of development, prompt referral based on symptoms and signs is the only other method of diagnosing cervi - cal cancer in earlier stages when treatment is more effective. It is also important to keep in mind that even in well-established cervical screening programmes there are women who will present with an invasive cancer that can be detected early through warning signs and symptoms. These are mainly women who do not attend screening, as well as women who, although regularly screened, may have a false negative result or develop an interval cancer. 38 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsThese guidelines may be used as a resource for self-education of PHC practitioners in low-resource countries to improve their aware - ness of symptoms and signs of breast and cervical cancers and to empower them to promptly refer suspected cancer cases leading to early detection in routine health-care services. Countries may also use these guidelines as part of national cancer control programmes to reduce the burden of breast and cervical cancer. Countries may adopt the guidelines as such or modify them to suit their local needs. While implementing the guidelines, countries should be encouraged to develop a set of evaluation measures to assess the impact of the guidelines. Alternatively, countries may implement the guidelines in carefully designed pilot demonstration programmes or operational research projects covering specified target areas thereby permitting accurate evaluation of the feasibility and the outcomes. This will better inform broader, nationwide scaling up of breast and cervical cancer early detection services. Such operational research programmes will be very useful in filling knowledge gaps in the implementation of affordable public health interventions to improve breast and cervical cancer control in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the guidelines can be incorporated in medical, nursing, and health worker training curricula.39 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings Objectives, scope, and methods The objective of this guideline is to assist primary care practitioners in the early identification of patients with signs and symptoms sus - picious of breast and cervical cancer so they can be referred to the next level of care for diagnosis and subsequent treatment, if cancer is confirmed . The initial scope of the original cancer guidelines, as agreed by the Guideline Development Group (GDG), included breast, cervical, oral, prostate, and colorectal cancer in view of their high incidence in low- and middle-income countries and because they are particu - larly amenable to early detection and effective treatment. A review of systematic reviews of signs, symptoms, and risk factors for each of the cancer sites was performed and discussed at the first meeting of the GDG in February 2011. In view of the enormous amount of work that the review of five cancer sites involved, the GDG advised to focus initially on breast and cervical cancer, and subsequently on the remaining cancer sites. A second report3 was developed that was largely derived from reviews of reviews, because of the very large amount of available data. This review was confined to breast and cervical cancer and focused on three key elements: (1) clinical prediction rules for referring a woman with suspected cancer to specialized services; (2) systematic reviews of signs and symptoms; and (3) systematic reviews of risk factors which have been shown by meta-analyses to be associated with a relative risk or odds ratio above 2.0 for the particular cancer and that are relevant to consider in a low-resource primary health-care setting.4 Evidence profiles using the Grading of Recommendations Assess - ment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) were constructed for signs, symptoms, and risk factors as follows (see GRADE tables in Annex I): Breast cancer: Breast lump; bloody nipple discharge; previous history of breast cancer; family history of breast cancer; number of first degree relatives with breast cancer in women aged 40-49 years; age at diagnosis of first degree relatives with breast cancer in women aged 40-49 years; history of goiter; and surgically excised fibroadenoma. 3 Report on evidence review can be found at: http://www.who.int/cancer/publications/ en/index.html 4 For example, breast density has a RR >2 for breast cancer, however it requires access to mammography which is quite unlikely to happen at PHC in low-resource countries. Therefore, it was not included in the GRADE analysis.40 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings Cervical cancer: Post-coital bleeding; number of sexual partners; at first baby; human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV positive (by DNA test). Evidence profiles were not prepared for signs, symptoms, and risk factors where there was a lack of evidence or adequate information that could not be retrieved. This includes clinical prediction rules for which limited and inconclusive research was found for breast cancer, and no studies at all were identified for cervical cancer. Based on the evidence review, a core group of members of the GDG drafted the recommendations which were discussed by all members of the GDG via teleconference on two occasions and later agreed upon by email exchange. There were only minor disagreements in content that were discussed within the group and the final decision was based on what the majority of the GDG members agreed upon. The revised document was sent to four peer reviewers, three of whom provided feedback. The peer reviewers supported the guideline recommenda - tions and provided only minor comments that were incorporated by GDG as appropriate. In addition, an internal review process was carried out under the guidance of the GRC Secretariat, following a GRC request to ensuring consistency with other existing WHO guide - lines. Once the internal review was considered completed by the GRC Secretariat, a revised document was sent to GDG for final review and approval. There was general agreement by the GDG on the modifica - tions suggested by the internal review, excepting the removal of algo - rithms. The majority of GDG members thought the algorithms were useful and should be kept. The final version of the recommendations was approved by consensus. An update of the review was carried out following a request from GRC. The results of the review did not affect the recommendations previously agreed by the GDG. 41 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings Declaration of Interest All external participants, previous to their inclusion in the review groups, signed the WHO standard declaration of interest form and none of them disclosed any relevant interests. Format, dissemination and implementation These guidelines, subsidiary products in the form of leaflets or bro - chures, plus the results of the systematic reviews, will be available on the WHO website. They will also be disseminated in a printed format and will be available in at least three official languages. The guidelines can be adapted and implemented in low-income countries willing to improve cervical and breast cancer early detection in the context of integration of NCD essential interventions into primary care services. They will will be updated within the next 5 years as it is intended to evolve in response to new knowledge, evidence- based information, national needs and experience.It is advised that the application of these guidelines at the PHC level be complemented by raising awareness about breast and cervical cancer among target women and encour- aging them to seek prompt attention at PHC centres through public education programmes. Public health services should have adequate facilities and access to diagnostic and treatment services for referred cases. Although the main intention of the guidelines is to contribute to early diagnosis and curative treatment, an important proportion of women will still be picked up in late stages. Therefore, palliative care should be made available to women diagnosed with late stage cancer or women with progressive disease who do not respond to curative treatment. Figure 1 describes the breast and cervical cancer early diagnosis system with its main components in each level of care. 42 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsEvaluation WHO will work with countries to evaluate the impact of the guidelines by coordinating efforts and providing advice and practical support.5 It is expected that the implementation of these guidelines will contribute to increase the percentage of cases diagnosed in early stages in the short-term, as well as prolong survival and reduce mortality from breast and cervical cancer in the medium- and long-terms. The effect of the guidelines will be assessed initially in countries through process indicators, including number of low-resource coun - tries that: Adopt the guidelines as part of stand-alone breast and cervical cancer control programmes; Incorporate and implement guidelines through their national cancer control programmes or as part of the package of essential interven - tions for noncommunicable diseases; Develop further tools to implement the guidelines; Develop evaluation systems; and Incorporate the guidelines as part of medical, nursing, and health worker training curricula. Depending on resources, further assistance will be provided to coun - tries in order to monitor outcome indicators such as stage distribution, treatment completion rates, survival, and mortality. Countries should be encouraged to develop hospital-based and/or population-based information systems, including medical records departments and/ or cancer registries to provide the above-stated outcome measures. 5 For a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework see Cancer Control.

However, there is a general lack of research in this area, particularly prospec - tive studies involving long-term follow-up of people with different signs and symptoms. This affects the quantity and quality of the evidence. Moreover, randomized trials that evaluate the clinical predictive value of different signs and symptoms are neither feasi - ble nor ethically acceptable. The clinical predictive value of differ - ent signs and symptoms in the early diagnosis of cancer has been predominantly studied in the context of case series, which in the hierarchy of studies provides the lowest quality of evidence. However, clinical predictability based on symptoms, signs and clini - cal examination is the most important element leading to specific diagnostic algorithms and hence for deciding on referral of patients with suspected breast or cervical cancer to specialized services. Women aged 30 years and above have the highest risk of devel - oping breast or cervical cancer, whereas these cancer types are comparatively rare in women under this age (GLOBOCAN, 2008; Ferlay et al. 2010). Therefore, the GDG decided to provide distinct recommendations, as appropriate, according to the different age groups and ensure the focus is on women at risk. Otherwise there is a danger of a dramatic increase of false positives from women under 30 years of age with an unnecessary overload of the health system. The GDG concluded that the existence or absence of risk factors for breast and cervical cancer, in general, do not affect the decision of referral. For an important proportion of women presenting with signs and symptoms suspicious of breast or cervical cancer, specific risk factors may not be identified. Moreover, clinical prediction rules based on combinations of signs, symptoms, and risk factors are not more likely to be useful for deciding on referral than clinical signs and symptoms alone. In view that, in general, risk factors (see Annex II) do not influence the referral of breast or cervical cancer at PHC, GDG decided to not include risk factors in the formulation of the recommendations, except age for both cancers and relevant risk factors for breast can - cer (family history, former breast cancer, therapeutic chest irradia - tion) in women under 30 years of age presenting with a breast lump.45 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings In some cultures, women presenting with signs and symptoms related to breast or cervical cancer might require a female health- care practitioner to do their clinical assessment. Cancer is a life threatening and relatively rare disease. A large pro - portion of referred patients may not have the suspected cancer on further assessment. Thus, false positive referrals cannot be avoided, but with timely feedback from the referral level, and improved skills in clinical assessment false positive referrals may be reduced. The GDG concluded that the benefits of referring symptomatic women for diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer in earlier clini - cal stages clearly outweighs the harms associated with false posi - tive referrals. GDG also acknowledges the fact that false positive referrals predominantly lead to further diagnostic investigations and patient anxiety until diagnosis of cancer is excluded, but does not entail anti-cancer treatment, as this treatment is initiated only after cancer is confirmed. An optimal communication strategy is essential to inform women with suspected malignancy that the clinical assessment done at PHC does not constitute a diagnosis, and that there is the need for fur - ther investigation to rule out cancer. In talking with the patient, the health-care practitioner should ensure that the anxiety associated with referrals is kept at the lowest possible level. 46 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsReferral of women with suspected breast cancer What are the signs and symptoms in women presenting at PHC that could lead to referral of suspected breast cancer to specialized services? Breast lump GRADE evaluation: The positive predictive value (PPV) of breast lumps for breast cancer varied between 8.1 (95% CI: 6.3% to 10.3%) 15.2% to 37.1%) for a clinically-palpable lump. The quality of evidence from these studies was graded as low (see GRADE Table 1 in Annex I). Bloody nipple discharge GRADE evaluation:Meta-analyses produced estimates for the odds ratio of breast cancer associated with blood nipple discharge versus other discharge descrip - tions: bloody vs. The quality of the studies was graded low (see GRADE Table 1 in Annex) GDG considerations: Breast lump is a cardinal symptom and sign that may lead to a diagno - sis of breast cancer (Mahoney et al ., 1982; Aiello et al Obene-Yeboah et al ., 2008). Prompt referral of any women with a breast lump may lead to early diagnosis of breast cancer with improvement in treatment outcome. Breast lumps of 1 cm diameter or more are generally considered readily palpable by health-care work - ers, although breast lumps of 5 mm may be palpable (Mahoney et al., 1982; Reintgen et al ., 1993). Discrete lumps with a hard consistency, lumps with eczematous skin changes, lumps with skin tethering or nipple retraction lead - ing to indentation of the breast contour, breast lumps that enlarge, persistent breast lumps, and breast lumps associated with unilateral spontaneous nipple discharge, are highly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer (Mahoney et al ., 1982; Giess et al ., 1998; Dolan et al., 2010; Chen et al ., 2011). Unilateral spontaneous bloody discharge without a readily palpable breast lump may be associated with breast cancer (Montroni et al ., 2010; Chen et al ., 2011). 47 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings Whereas referral of women with small lumps may lead to the diag - nosis of \"early breast cancer\", the presence of a lump in the axilla, extensive nipple or skin retraction or tethering, lumps fixed to the skin or chest wall and skin changes such as thickened skin, peau d'orange, or ulceration may be associated with advanced breast cancer (Smith et al., 1976; Mahoney et al ., 1982; Halder et al 2001). Women with early breast cancer may develop symptoms such as a change in the consistency of one area in a breast (compared to the other breast), skin tethering or dimpling, or a change in the shape of the breast without necessarily presenting with a discrete lump (Bassett, 1985). Pain in the breast without palpable breast lumps or other symp - toms is unlikely to be associated with a diagnosis of breast cancer (Masroor et al., 2009; Smith et al ., al ., 2007; Obene-Yaboah et al ., 2008). Recommendations (See Figure 2) Based on the GRADE evaluation, the GDG clinical considerations, and the high value placed by all GDG members in detecting breast cancer in earlier stages, the following are strong recommendations for referral of women with possible breast cancer: Women who report any breast symptoms at PHC should undergo physical examination of both breasts, both axillae, and the neck prior to referral. Women with a palpable breast lump, unilateral spontaneous nip - ple discharge (particularly bloody discharge), or any change in the shape or consistency of the breast, whether or not associated with other symptoms or risk factors, should be referred to a facility where diagnosis, staging, and treatment of breast cancer can be efficiently carried out as indicated below: Women aged 30 years and above with a breast lump, unilateral spontaneous nipple discharge (particularly bloody discharge), skin changes such as eczematous changes in or around the nipple or areola, skin tethering, and skin or nipple retraction should be referred for further investigations to rule out breast cancer. Women under the age of 30 years with a breast lump should only be referred for further investigations if the lump enlarges or has other features associated with cancer (such as fixed or hardness or the presence of skin changes) or in whom there are other rea - sons for concern, such as a family history of breast cancer, former breast cancer or prior therapeutic chest irradiation. 48 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsWomen who present the following persistent and unexplained signs and symptoms should seek consultation at a PHC: a) Breast lump, or any change in the shape or consistency of the breast b) Breast lump that enlarges and/or is fixed and hard c) Other breast problems (i.e. eczematous skin changes, nipple retractation, peau d'orange, ulceration, unilateral nipple discharge - particularly bloody discharge -, lump in the axilla) with or without palpable lumpFigure 2: Assessment and referral of women with suspected breast cancer at primary health care ASSESS LIKELIHOOD FOR BREAST CANCER Assess signs and symptoms (i.e. history, intensity, duration, progression) Identify relevant breast cancer risk factors (such as age, family history, previous history of breast cancer, chest irradiation) Clinical examination of both breasts, axillae and neck Differential diagnosis: benign breast diseases (e.g. fibroadenoma, fibroadenosis, mastitis, abscess, etc.) Women < 30 years old Women 30 years old and above Presenting with a) Presenting with: a) b) or c)Presenting with: a) + relevant risk factors, or b) or c) Invite for follow-up visit after menstrual period Follow-up visit: if b) or c)Refer immediately to next level Note: Referral of women with small breast lumps may lead to diagnosis of \"early breast cancer\"49 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings Women with any other symptom highly indicative of advanced breast cancer (such as a large lump in the breast, skin ulceration, axillary swelling, palpable axillary nodes, swelling in the neck, severe back pain) should also be referred to a specialized centre for diagnosis and appropriate care. Women found with no abnormalities upon physical examination should be taught breast awareness. This comprises educating them on breast cancer signs and symptoms, encouraging them to be aware of their normal breast and of any changes by periodic self-palpation, as well as empowering them to seek care promptly in case of any future breast abnormalities. In making a recommendation to the patient for further investigation in specialized services, it should generally be emphasized that the likeliest possibility is that the lump is not a cancer. Benign breast dis - eases such as fibroadenoma, fibroadenosis, mastitis, abscess, benign cystic disease of the breast, and other rare diseases may also present with a lump in the breast. However, it is important to undergo further investigation because in the event cancer is diagnosed, treatment outcome is much better when the cancer is detected early and treated properly. 50 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsReferral of women with suspected cervical cancer What are the signs and symptoms in women presenting at PHC that could lead to referral of suspected cervical cancer to specialized services? Post-coital bleeding GRADE evaluation: One community study gave a relative risk for invasive carcinoma of 6.3 for bleeding on sexual intercourse (post-coital bleeding) compared to women without the symptom. A follow-up study of the same cohort of women found that those with post-coital bleeding and a negative screen had up to a 15-fold risk of late invasive cervical cancer compared to those without bleeding symptoms (but 93% of women who developed cervical cancer had not experienced post-coital bleeding). The quality of evidence was graded as very low (see GRADE Table 2 in Annex I). GDG considerations: Abnormal vaginal bleeding (bleeding that occurs after coitus, between menstrual periods, or after menopause) or persistent,6 foul-smelling discharge that may or may not be tinged with blood are the cardinal signs of cervical cancer (Shapley et al ., 2006; Sarkar et al ., 2010; Ikechebelu et al., 2010). These signs may be associated with early stages of invasive cervical cancer, particularly in women above the age of 30 years. However, abnormal vaginal bleeding in sexually active women is more frequently caused by abortion (in pre-menopausal women) and benign conditions such as cervical infections (including gonorrhoea and chlamydiae) ulceration due to cervical inflammatory disease, uterine polyps, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance. Similarly, persistent, foul smelling discharge may be associated with other conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vaginal candidiasis. Moreover, abnormal vaginal bleeding may sometimes be caused by other malignant conditions such as endometrial or vaginal cancer. Some women with cervical cancer may experience pain during vagi - nal intercourse The association of a palpable abdominal mass with persistent low back or abdominal pain is usually associated with advanced cervical cancer and should raise suspicion of this possibility. 6 That is, discharge that does not respond to syndromic treatment.51 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings Recommendations (See Figure 3) Based on the GRADE evaluation, the GDG clinical considerations, and the high value placed by all GDG members in detecting invasive cervi - cal cancer in earlier stages, the following are strong recommendations for referral of women with possible cervical cancer: Women who report any gynaecological sign or symptom suspicious of early cervical cancer (such as abnormal vaginal bleeding,7 or persistent, foul-smelling discharge, or pain during vaginal inter - course) should, where possible, undergo a speculum examination. The following important issues should be taken into consideration: In women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, with persistent, foul- smelling discharge, or experiencing pain during vaginal inter - course, the presence of a cervical growth or ulceration should prompt immediate referral for diagnostic confirmation and man - agement without manipulation because of the significant risk of bleeding, which may be difficult to control. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, with persistent, foul-smell - ing discharge, or experiencing pain during vaginal intercourse, without clinically detected cervical growth or ulceration , are likely to have a non-malignant condition, particularly if they are under 30 years of age. These women should be treated as appropri - ate8 and be referred to a specialist to rule out cervical cancer only if the condition persists or has worsened at the time of a follow-up visit. Women with any signs or symptoms associated with advanced cer - vical cancer (severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe back pain, neck swelling, or symptoms of urethral and rectal fistula) should also be referred to a specialized centre for confirmation diagnosis and appropriate care. In making a recommendation for further investigation, it should be emphasized that the likeliest possibility is that vaginal bleeding or foul-smelling discharge with or without clinically detected cervi - cal growth or ulceration are not caused by a cancer. However, it is important to undergo further investigation because, in the event that cancer is diagnosed, the treatment outcome is much better when the cancer is detected early and treated properly. This is particularly relevant in women 30 years and above who are at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. 7 Abnormal vaginal bleeding includes occurrences after coitus, between menstrual periods, or after menopause. 8 For further information consult the following WHO guidelines: WHO Guidelines for the Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections (WHO 2003) and Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors (WHO 2000, reprinted 2007).52 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsWomen who present the following persistent and unexplained signs and symptoms should seek consultation at a PHC: a) Abnormal vaginal bleeding (i.e. after coitus, between menstrual periods, post menopause) b) Foul-smelling discharge c) Pain during vaginal intercourse d) Any of the above associated with palpable abdominal mass with persistent low back or abdominal painFigure 3: Assessment and referral of women with suspected cervical cancer at primary health care ASSESS LIKELIHOOD FOR CER vICAL CANCER Assess signs and symptoms (i.e. history, intensity, duration, progression) Identify relevant risk factors: age (30 years old and above) Speculum examination Differential diagnosis: abortion in pre-menopausal women, infections (e.g. Chlamydiae, gonococcal, etc.), genital ulcers, cervical inflammation, uterine polyps, dysfunctional uterus hemorrhage, endometrial or vaginal cancer Women presenting with a) b) or c) Women presenting with d) Without clinically detected cervical growth or ulcerationWith clinical detected cervical growth or ulceration Follow obstetric and gynecological guidelines as appropriate Refer if condition is not manageable at PHC, persists or worsensRefer immediately to next level Note: Referral of women with a) b) or c) may lead to a diagnosis of \"early invasive cervical cancer\", particularly in women 30 years old and above .53 Guidelines for referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at primary health care in low-resource settings See CD for: Acknowledgements Web-based resources Annex 1 Evidence assessment and Grade tables Annex 2 Evidence on risk factors, References List of contributors54 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsManagement of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings55 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Abbreviations AMSTAR Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews AQoL asthma-specific quality of life CFC chlorofluorocarbon CI confidence interval COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease CRD chronic respiratory disease CRQ Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire FEV1 forced expiratory volume in 1 second FVC forced expiratory vital capacity GINA Global Initiative for Asthma GRADE Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation HFA hydrofluoroalkane HIV human immunodeficiency virus HQ headquarters HRQol health-related quality of life IUATLD International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease kg kilogram LMIC low- and middle-income country MD mean dose MDI Headings mg disease PEF PEFR peak expiratory flow rate PICOT population/intervention/comparator/outcome/time prn pro re nata (as needed) QoL quality of life RCT randomized controlled trial RR relative risk SGRQ St George's Respiratory Questionnaire SMD standardized mean difference ug microgram WHO World Health Organization56 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsExecutive summary Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), particularly bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are major public health problems accounting for a considerable share of the disease burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2004, 6.8% of deaths in women and 6.9% in men in LMICs were caused by CRDs, according to the WHO Global burden of disease report: update 2004 . Prevention and control of CRDs need to be addressed through a public health approach, including the implementation of key interven - tions at a primary health care level. It is particularly important to give due consideration to the limited resources available in LMICs where the use of essential medicines and equipment and the availability of health workers need to be prioritized. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global Strategy for Prevention and Control of Noncommu - nicable diseases (WHO Global NCD Action Plan), endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2008, WHO is called upon to provide technical guidance to countries for the integration of cost-effective interventions against major NCDs in their health systems. This guideline is a tool that provides such assistance. The care offered at present to patients with CRDs is not always based on evidence or best practice and this is the first time WHO has produced a guideline for the management of asthma and COPD through a primary care approach in resource-limited settings. This guideline is designed for easy access and implementation in busy com - munity clinics and small hospitals and is intended to complement other evidence-based guidelines such as the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. These guidelines should be referred to if more information is required; for example, on classification of disease severity. The main purpose of this guideline is, therefore, to provide evi - dence-based recommendations on management of asthma and COPD in primary health care in low-resource settings. The target users are physicians and health workers. The main objectives are to reduce avoidable death and morbidity related to asthma and COPD and to improve health outcomes in resource-limited settings where man - agement facilities are limited in terms of availability of diagnostic facilities and medicines. The guideline is concerned with the management of asthma and COPD by:57 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings focusing at a primary health care level in low-resource settings; assisting the users who will be physicians and health workers in primary care, and staff in government health departments con - cerned with procuring drugs1; safeguarding affordability by organizing drug treatment around four major groups of medicines on the WHO Essential Medicines List (salbutamol, beclometasone, prednisolone, antibiotics) - other drugs are mentioned only if they have been shown to be helpful and if they are sometimes available and used in resource-poor countries, e.g. oral theophylline; assuring that all complicated or severe cases are referred to the next level of care. The strength of the recommendations for the management of asthma and COPD that are developed, summarized and presented in this guideline reflects the degree of confidence that the desirable effects of adherence to the recommendations outweigh the undesirable effects. As described in the guideline, the following factors were considered during the recommendation making process: (i) quality of evidence; (ii) uncertainty of balance between desirable and undesirable effects; (iii) variability in values and preferences of outcomes by different individu - als; and (iv) cost effectiveness. 1 See integrated protocols and other tools for Best Buys and WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease in CD, to facilitate guideline implementation in primary care)58 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRecommendations * Strength of recommendation/Quality of evidence Management of stable asthma REC 1: In order to determine the best management approach, asthma control should be assessed using severity and frequency of symptoms. (Particularly nocturnal symptoms, exercise induced wheezing, the use of beta agonists and absence from work/school due to symptoms, the frequency of exacerbations and peak expiratory flow (PEF) if available.) * (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence ) Annex 4.1; 4.2 REC 2: Inhaled corticosteroids (beclometasone) should be given to all patients with chronic persistent asthma. If their use needs to be prioritized in resource-constrained settings, the highest priority group should be those with life-threatening attacks and attacks requiring hospital admission where the use of a regular inhaled steroid is likely to save money by reducing hospital admissions. Patients with frequent exacerbations are also a high priority group, as are those with persis - tent troublesome symptoms, those using high doses of beta agonists and those losing time from work or school. Numerous studies have demonstrated that inhaled steroids reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function, although they vary in terms of dosage used, type of steroid and mode of delivery, includ - ing the use of a spacer. Low doses (e.g. beclometasone 100ug once or twice daily for children and 100ug or 200ug twice daily for adults) are adequate for most patients with mild or moderate asthma; patients with more severe asthma require higher doses. The lowest dose of beclometasone that controls symptoms should be determined for maintenance treatment. Any deterioration in symptom control should be treated with an increase in dose. A spacer should be used with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) to reduce candidiasis and increase drug deposition in the lung. Ensuring that low-cost, good quality generic preparations of inhaled beclometasone are readily available for all patients with persistent asthma is the highest priority. * (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence ) Annex 4.3; 4.4 REC 3: A stepwise approach to treatment is recommended: Step 1. Inhaled beta agonist (salbutamol) as required (prn) Step 2. Continue inhaled salbutamol and add inhaled beclo - metasone 100ug or 200ug twice daily, or 100ug once or twice daily in children59 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Step 3. Continue inhaled salbutamol prn and increase the dose of beclometasone to 200ug to 400ug twice daily Step 4. Add low-dose oral theophylline (assuming that long-act - ing beta agonists are not available), or increase dose of inhaled beclometasone Step 5. Add oral prednisolone in the lowest dose possible to control symptoms At each point it is important to check patients' adherence to their medications and that their inhaler technique is correct. For patients requiring regular prednisolone referral to a specialised centre should be considered.* Annex 7 Management of exacerbation of asthma REC 1: Oral prednisolone should be given for all acute exacerbations of asthma. For adults, a dose of 30-40mg daily is appropriate, while for children (<16 years) a dose of 1mg per kg daily has fewer adverse effects on behaviour than 2mg per kg, so a dose of 1mg per kg (up to 30mg daily) is recommended. Patients should have easy access to oral corticosteroids for exacerbations. In children, prednisolone tablets can be crushed and given with sugar. The usual duration of treatment is three days for children and five days for adults though it may need to be extended if the patient has not recovered fully. * (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.6 REC 2: Inhaled salbutamol: higher doses of inhaled salbutamol should be given to all patients with acute severe exacerbations; salbutamol may be given by nebulizers or spacers (commercial or homemade). The evidence suggests no important advantages of nebulizers over spacers in children over the age of 2 (or adults) although these studies did not include patients with life-threatening asthma. Other considerations may be relevant in making the choice between nebulizers and spac - ers such as the availability of nebulizers, the need to prevent cross- infection and whether the patient will use a spacer at home. Steps must be taken to keep nebulizers and spacers clean (sterile) and to prevent transmission of infections. Following treatment with salbutamol, patients should have repeat clinical assessments at intervals (e.g. 15-20 minute intervals) to ensure that they are responding to treatment. Failure to respond requires further doses or more intensive treatment. Once the patients have recovered, their usual maintenance treat - ment should be reviewed and altered if indicated to prevent recurrent exacerbations. * (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.7; 4.8; 4.1560 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsREC 3: Oxygen: if available, oxygen should be administered to patients with acute severe asthma. This is in keeping with normal practice in high-resource settings where the decision to use oxygen is based on low oxygen saturation readings. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 4: Second-line drugs: if patients do not respond to salbutamol and prednisolone, then second-line drugs may need to be considered. If a nebulizer and ipratropium bromide are available and a second- line is required, nebulized ipratropium bromide is recom - mended for children with acute asthma. * (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 5: Intravenous magnesium: at present, there is insufficient evi - dence to recommend intravenous magnesium as a routine second-line drug. * (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 6: Intravenous salbutamol: on the basis of the balance between benefits and risks, intravenous salbutamol is NOT recommended for use as a second-line drug. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 7: Intravenous aminophylline: on the basis of the balance between benefits and risks, intravenous aminophylline is NOT recom - mended for routine use as a second-line drug. When taken in addition to beta agonists and steroids there is no significant benefit for adults and only marginal benefit for children. There is evidence of adverse effects for children and adults. The risks are seen as outweighing the benefits in settings where monitoring is not feasible. * (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Management of stable COPD REC 1: When given as required short-acting beta-agonists are effective in improving symptoms in patients with stable COPD. Patients should be prescribed beta agonists as required. There are no data from which to assess the optimum frequency of administration, or the effect of regular administration. Inhaled beta agonists are recommended rather than oral preparations because oral preparations have more pronounced undesirable effects that may be of particular relevance in view of common co-morbidities with COPD, e.g. arrhythmias in patients with coronary heart disease. * (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.11; 4.12 REC 2: Theophylline: as it is unlikely that blood levels can be moni - tored in resource-constrained settings, only low doses of theophylline 61 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings are recommended. Patients should be advised to stop treatment and consult a doctor if adverse effects are experienced. * (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.14 REC 3: Oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) are ineffective in stable COPD except possibly in high doses when there are important side effects. On the basis of the balance between benefits and risks, oral steroids are NOT recommended for use in stable COPD. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.13 REC 4: Inhaled steroids (beclometasone): when given in high doses there may be a small benefit from inhaled steroids; however, high doses are expensive for resource-poor countries and high doses have more adverse effects, including pneumonia. The risks are unknown in areas where the prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis are high. Since the benefit is modest, the risk/benefit ratio is much higher than it is for asthma. The use of inhaled steroids for patients with stable COPD therefore cannot be justified. NOT recommended.* (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 5: Ipratropium bromide: when short-acting beta agonists, short-term inhaled ipratropium bromide has small ben - efits with regard to reducing symptoms and improving lung function. Currently, ipratropium bromide preparations are more expensive than beta agonists and there are no data to assess risk versus benefits of regular use over longer periods to recommend long-term regular use of ipratropium bromide. NOT recommended.* (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.1262 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsManagement of exacerbation of COPD REC 1: Antibiotics should be given for COPD exacerbations. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.10 REC 2: Oral steroids: a short course of prednisolone is recommended for acute severe exacerbations of COPD (e.g. prednisolone 30-40mg for about seven days). * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.14 REC 3: Inhaled beta agonists: higher doses of inhaled salbutamol should be administered via a nebulizer or spacer. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) Annex 4.12 REC 4: Oxygen: if available, oxygen should be administered by a device that controls concentration to 24%-28%. * (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence ) REC 5: Intravenous aminophylline: based on the available evidence, intravenous aminophylline is NOT recommended for routine use in acute exacerbations of COPD. Although there are data from only four studies, these show little evidence of benefit; any beneficial effect is likely to be small and is likely to be outweighed by potential adverse effects.* (Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence )63 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings The summaries of the considerations of benefits/risks, values, cost and feasibility for the recommendations listed in the following table were discussed by the guideline expert panel based on the experience of its members, consideration of the systematic reviews, moderated discussion and consensus. Recommendation Benefits/risks; values and acceptability; cost; feasibility Management of stable asthma REC 1 Standard diagnostic recommendations to assess asthma control should be used in accordance with standard clinical practices, as agreed by the guideline expert panel members. REC 2 Benefits:Highly effective treatment for control of stable asthma as well as significant reduction of exacerbations and improvement of lung function. Risks: Risks of side effects are minimal since only the lowest dose that controls symptoms is recommended for maintenance treatment. A spacer should be used with an MDI to reduce candidiasis with beclometasone and increase drug deposition in the lung. values and acceptability: Numerous studies have demonstrated that inhaled steroids reduce asthma exacerbations and improve lung function, although they vary in terms of dosage used, type of steroid and mode of delivery, including the use of a spacer. Cost: The regular use of inhaled steroids is likely to save money by reducing hospital admissions of patients with life-threatening attacks and frequent exacerbations. Low-cost, good quality generic preparations of inhaled steroids are recommended. Feasibility: Particularly recommended in resource-constrained settings where access to medical care is often restricted. REC 3 A stepwise approach is a commonly accepted way of managing asthma patients and basically comprises all the other treatment recommendations, as agreed by the guideline expert panel members. Management of exacerbation of asthma REC 1 Benefits/risks:Benefits far outweigh the risks. For all acute exacerbations of asthma, short-term courses of oral steroids in the recommended doses are effective and carry minimal risk of side effects, e.g. weight gain, fluid retention, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar. values and acceptability: The efficiency in acute exacerbations of asthma is demonstrated in numerous studies. In the recommended doses, a significant benefit is derived with little risk of side effects. Cost: Affordable for resource-constrained settings. Feasibility: There should be easy access to oral corticosteroids for patients with exacerbations of asthma. 64 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRecommendation Benefits/risks; values and acceptability; cost; feasibility REC 2 Benefits/risks: Effective for improving lung function in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. For short-term administration of high doses, benefits outweigh the risk of potential side effects. Generally, the evidence suggests no important advantages of nebulizers over spacers. values and acceptability: Based on the severity of asthma exacerbations, prompt treatment can be vital. Following treatment with salbutamol, the patient should have repeated clinical assessments at intervals (e.g. 15-20 minute intervals) to ensure that they are responding to treatment. Failure to respond requires further doses or more intensive treatment. Cost: There are no data available directly assessing the cost effectiveness, although, the cost is lower where good quality generic preparations are available. Feasibility: Higher doses of inhaled beta agonists should be given to all patients with acute severe exacerbations where available. REC 3 Benefits/risks:In the absence of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in asthma, the recommendation is based on observational evidence and strong consensus belief that oxygen is beneficial. values and acceptability: If oxygen is available, it should be administered to all patients with acute severe asthma in keeping with normal practice in high-resource settings where the decision to use oxygen is based on low oxygen saturation readings (pulse oximetry). Cost: Short-term use in exacerbations as recommended should be affordable. REC 4 If a nebulizer and ipratropium bromide are available and a second-line treatment is required, adding ipratropium bromide can be recommended for children with acute asthma but ONLY as a second-line treatment. Side effects are rare; paradoxical bronchoconstriction is a recognised though rare problem. Cost: There are no data available directly assessing the cost effectiveness, although the cost is lower where good quality generic preparations are available. REC 5 Negative recommendation. At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend intravenous magnesium as a routine second-line drug and is NOT recommended. However, if it is available, it may be worth trying if the patient continues to deteriorate despite other recommended treatment. REC 6 Negative recommendation. On the basis of the balance between benefits and risks, intravenous salbutamol is NOT recommended for use as a second-line drug. REC 7 Negative recommendation. On the basis of the balance between benefits and risks and because the risks outweigh the benefits in settings where monitoring of blood drug levels is not feasible, intravenous aminophylline is NOT recommended for routine use as a second-line drug.65 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Recommendation Benefits/risks; values and acceptability; cost; feasibility Management of stable COPD REC 1 Benefits/risks: When given as required beta agonists are effective in improving symptoms in patients with COPD. The effect of regular administration is unknown. values and acceptability: Inhaled beta agonists are recommended rather than oral preparations because oral preparations have more pronounced undesirable effects that may be of particular relevance in view of common co-morbidities with COPD, e.g. arrhythmias in patients with coronary heart disease. Cost: There are no data available directly assessing the cost effectiveness, although the cost is lower where good quality generic preparations are available. It is feasible with an MDI. REC 2 Benefits/risks:Theophylline can cause serious adverse effects, particularly if therapeutic blood concentrations are exceeded. Only low-dose slow-release theophylline can be recommended as being relatively safe and providing some efficacy. values and acceptability: Low-dose, slow-release oral theophylline can be effective and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of stable COPD. Cost: No data available. Feasibility: As it is unlikely that blood levels can be monitored in resource-constrained settings, only low doses of theophylline are recommended. Patients should be advised to stop treatment and consult a doctor if adverse effects are experienced. REC 3 Negative recommendation. Oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) are ineffective in stable COPD except possibly in high doses when there are important side effects. On the basis of the balance between benefits and risks, oral steroids are NOT recommended for use in stable COPD. REC 4 Negative recommendation. When given in high doses, there may be a small benefit from inhaled steroids. However, high doses have more adverse effects and are more expensive, while any benefit is small. Their use for patients with stable COPD cannot be justified when resources are limited. REC 5 Negative recommendation. Compared to regular short-acting beta agonists, short-term inhaled ipratropium bromide has small benefits with regard to reducing symptoms and improving lung function. Currently, ipratropium bromide preparations are more expensive than beta agonists and there are no data to assess risk versus benefits of regular use over longer periods to recommend long-term regular use of ipratropium bromide, thus they are NOT recommended. 66 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRecommendation Benefits/risks; values and acceptability; cost; feasibility Management of exacerbation of COPD REC 1 Benefits/risks: Since benefits significantly outweigh side effects, antibiotics should be given for all COPD exacerbations with purulent sputum and signs of systemic infection. values and acceptability: Antibiotics are commonly prescribed empirically. Which antibiotic should be prescribed needs to be decided locally according to likely organisms, cost and availability. Cost: The cost depends on the antibiotic used. REC 2 Benefits/risks:Benefits usually outweigh the risks. Short-term courses of oral steroids in the doses recommended are of benefit for acute exacerbations of COPD and usually have few side effects. values and acceptability: A short course of oral steroids is beneficial and with the doses recommended is associated with minimum risk. However, it is important to weigh potential benefits against side effects for each patient. Cost: Affordable for resource-constrained settings. Feasibility: There should be easy access for patients with exacerbations of COPD. REC 3 Benefits/risks:Effective for improving lung function in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. For short-term administration for exacerbations, the benefits of high doses outweigh the risk of potential side effects. The evidence suggests no important advantages of nebulizers over spacers. Cost: There are no data available directly assessing the cost effectiveness, although the cost is lower where good quality generic preparations are available. Feasibility: Higher doses of inhaled beta agonists should be given to all patients with acute severe exacerbations of COPD where available. Administration either by MDI and spacer or by nebulization is acceptable. REC 4 Benefits/risks:This recommendation is based on observational evidence and strong consensus belief that oxygen is beneficial. High concentrations of supplemental oxygen can lead to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and respiratory acidosis for some people with severe COPD. It is very important, therefore, that when oxygen is administered it is given in a low concentration (24%-28%) using a controlled oxygen delivery device. Patients clearly should not smoke if using or close to an oxygen supply. values and acceptability: If oxygen is available, it should be administered for exacerbations of COPD, as long as a low concentration can be given as prescribed. Cost: Short-term use in exacerbations as recommended should be affordable.67 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Recommendation Benefits/risks; values and acceptability; cost; feasibility REC 5 Negative recommendation. Based on the available evidence, intravenous aminophylline is NOT recommended for routine use in acute exacerbations of COPD. Although there are data from only four studies, they show little evidence of benefit; thus any beneficial effect is likely to be small and the risks outweigh benefits.68 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings Methodology used to prepare the guideline The WHO Guideline for Management of Asthma and COPD through a Primary Care Approach in Resource-constrained Settings was pre - pared according to the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. The scope in the format of PICOT questions was defined by WHO and circulated to the guideline expert panel members for comments in advance of the guideline expert panel meeting (Annex 3). The Cochrane Airways Group was consulted to design the search strategy for the finalized scoping questions. A methodologist was contracted to assess the quality of evidence using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and to prepare evi - dence summaries according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The AMSTAR instrument is a validated tool for critically appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. It consists of an 11-item questionnaire with each item receiving a score of 1 if the specific criterion was met or a score of 0 if the information was not reported or was unclear or the criterion was not applicable. After applying AMSTAR, the review that scored the highest was selected. Systematic reviews were assessed rather than single studies. The evidence was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. In this system evidence is classified as high, moderate, low or very low and is defined as follows: High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Factors that were considered in classifying the evidence were: (i) the study design and rigour of its execution; (ii) the consistency of results and how well the evidence can be directly applied to patients; (iii) interventions; (iv) outcomes; and (v) comparator. Other important factors were whether the data were sparse or imprecise and whether there was potential for reporting bias. The recommendations were drafted according to the GRADE methodology for assessing the quality of evidence and strength of 69 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings recommendations. The guideline expert panel, comprising clinical experts and scientists in the area of CRDs, guideline methodology, research, pharmacology and policy-making, was convened on 20-21 December 2010 at WHO headquarters in Geneva (see Annex 1 for the list of participants). The meeting was preceded by several telecon - ference discussions and e-mail consultations. The priority questions and scope of the guideline were discussed and finalized based on the comments provided by the expert panel members during these discussions preceding the meeting. The guideline expert panel members were involved in the following: advising on the priority of questions and scope of the guideline; advising on the choice of important outcomes for decision-making; commenting on the evidence used to inform the guideline; advising on the interpretation of the evidence, with explicit consid - eration of the overall balance of risks and benefits of each particular intervention for asthma and COPD patients; formulating recommendations, taking into account the scope of the guideline, its target audience and resource-constrained settings. At the guideline expert panel meeting, the members were asked to identify critical clinical outcomes for the purposes of making the recommendations. The expert panel reviewed the available evidence summaries and made recommendations. All recommendations were based on consensus and in accordance with the assessed evidence. All declarations of interests of the guideline expert panel members were reviewed before the guideline expert panel meeting (Annex 2). None of the members declared any potential conflict of interests rel - evant to the discussion and recommendations, either personal or insti - tutional. The GRADE tables (Annex 4) were prepared by the members of the guideline expert panel and the methodologist. Formulating the recommendations included explicit consideration of the quality of evidence, benefits, harms, burdens, costs and values, and preferences. Recommendations were classified as strong or weak, as recommended in the GRADE methodology. For each recommendation, the final agreement was based on group consensus by the guideline expert panel members using a combina - tion of the following factors: evidence balanced for benefits/risks of the intervention; costs, values and feasibility of each particular intervention in resource-constrained settings; quality of evidence itself (high, moderate, low, very low);70 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings preferences of the group based on clinical experience of the expert panel members. Each recommendation was formulated only when full consensus was reached among the expert panel members based on all of the above- mentioned points. As a result, each recommendation was classified either as strong or weak according to the GRADE methodology. Strong recommendations can be interpreted as: most individuals should receive the intervention; most well-informed individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; could unequivocally be used for policy-making. Weak recommendations can be interpreted as: majority of well-informed individuals would want the suggested course of action, but an appreciable proportion would not; widely varying values and preferences; policy-making will require extensive debates and involvement of many stakeholders. After the guideline expert panel meeting, the WHO Secretariat revised the draft guideline according to the recommendations from the guideline expert panel. Comments are reviewed by the WHO Sec - retariat and are being incorporated into the final version. Identification of important outcomes Summaries of the best available evidence were prepared to inform scoping questions. A list of potential outcomes to be considered by the guideline expert panel was developed both for asthma and COPD scop - ing questions. The panel members ranked these outcomes and were requested to identify any relevant critical outcomes not included on the list. The panel members were also asked to identify which outcomes they felt were critical, important but not critical, and not important. The panel members were then asked to score the outcomes, using numbers corresponding to the GRADE importance of outcomes where 7-9 indicated the outcome was critical for a decision, 4-6 indicated it was important, and 1-3 indicated it was not important. Both the average scores for each outcome and the range of scores were consid - ered. The individual scores were discussed and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Outcomes were included roughly in order of their relative importance in the GRADE tables (Annex 4).71 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Outcomes (asthma) Outcomes (COPD) Mortality Mortality Quality of life (QoL) Quality of life (QoL) Mechanical ventilation Breathlessness Cough Cough Wheeze Wheeze Dyspnoea Sputum production Distance walked Distance walked adverse events PEFR PEFR FEV1 FEV1 FVC FVC Search strategy, selection criteria, data collection and judgement The search strategy was to identify systematic reviews relevant to the scoping questions. Once systematic reviews were identified, searches were also conducted for RCTs in order to identify any additional trials not included in the reviews. Summaries of all identified systematic reviews were shared with members of the guideline expert panel before the December 2011 meeting. For systematic reviews, an advanced search with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was conducted. The comprehensive search strate - gies designed by the Cochrane Airways Group based on approved PICOT questions are described in Annex 5 (in addition, the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma and COPD registers of RCTs were searched). The limits that were applied to the search included: published in the last 10 years; human being only; English language; systematic reviews. As a result of the AMSTAR quality assessment of the found system - atic reviews, nine systematic reviews for asthma and 14 systematic reviews for COPD PICOT questions were selected (Annex 6). Evidence profiles based on the systematic reviews were created using the GRADE methodology (Annex 4). Using this approach, assessments of the quality of evidence for each important outcome took into account the study design, limitations of the studies, con - sistency of the evidence across studies, directness of the evidence with respect to the populations, interventions and settings, and the precision of the summary estimate of effect. If there were several relevant systematic reviews, the most recent one of the highest qual - ity was used. The GRADE evidence profiles have been prepared with footnotes that explain the judgements that were made. 72 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsIn the majority of cases, the quality of evidence for various outcomes ranged from very low quality to moderate quality . The primary reason for this is a lack of availability of evidence for the setting for which the recommendations were made, i.e. patient population from LMICs. In all cases, the quality of evidence was downgraded due to indirectness. The draft recommendations have been sent for external peer review, which are analysed by WHO. The peer reviewers were asked to com - ment primarily on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the inter - pretation of the evidence base supporting the recommendations in the guideline. The document received positive appraisal; however, the comments of peer reviewers are then sent to the guideline expert panel members for their consideration and discussion. Based on the com - ments received, the WHO writing team will produce the final product. Comments and suggestions from peer reviewers will be addressed to the responsible officer for reply. Responses will be documented and made available upon request. The summary of peer reviewer com - ments from four independent experts with no conflict of interest is presented below; the full text is available upon request. All peer reviewers were asked to submit a signed WHO Declara - tion of Interests form. Where interest was declared, legal advice was sought on whether the expert would be eligible for reviewing the document (Annex 2). The guideline development group is grateful to these reviewers for their contribution to the guideline. Major comments of peer reviewers: The guideline is focused mainly on treatment and does not address the issue of non-drug prevention such as tobacco or overweight control. Advice regarding these risk factors would be beneficial. (Response: provided in the treatment flowcharts .) Advice on patient education and establishing a partnership \"physi - cian-patient\" is important to mention. ( Response: provided in the treatment flowcharts .) Inhaled corticosteroids should include any other inhaled corticoster - oids and not only beclometasone. ( Response: see summary decision- making tables .) Regarding stable COPD recommendations 1 and 4: the lack of stud - ies for short-acting beta agonists >8 weeks appears to be the issue regarding the inability to recommend them regularly. It should be stated that there are no trials - it is not that the trials exist and demonstrate that there is no effect. The search is only up to 2002; in view of the importance of this and the probability of long-term benefits as described for trials >8 weeks, the guideline should make a clear interpretative comment about likely long-term benefits for 73 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings symptoms and lung function. ( Response: see summary decision- making tables .) It is planned initially to introduce the guideline (English printed ver - sion as well as an electronic version on the WHO web site) at regional and subregional workshops that will be organized with country sup - port in close consultation with regional WHO representatives. Imple - menting partners will be invited to these workshops for wider incor - poration. The indicators used to evaluate the impact of interventions will be discussed and selected at the workshops. WHO headquarters will provide technical support at the country level for local adaptation of the guideline. Staff from headquarters and regional and country offices will be familiarized with the guideline in order to assist the countries. It is expected that this guideline will be reviewed in 2016.74 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAnnex 3.

If uncertainty exists, the following fea - tures make a diagnosis of asthma more likely: previous diagnosis of asthma; symptoms since childhood or early adulthood; history of hayfever, eczema; intermittent symptoms with asymptomatic periods in between; symptoms worse at night or early morning; symptoms triggered by respiratory infection, exercise, weather changes or stress; symptoms respond to salbutamol. Measuring PEF before and 15 minutes after two puffs of salbutamol may also help. If the PEF improves by 20%, a diagnosis of asthma is very probable. However, in practice, most patients with asthma have a smaller response to salbutamol. Assess asthma control Asthma is considered to be well controlled if the patient has: no more than two occasions a week when asthma symptoms occur and require a beta-agonist; asthma symptoms on no more than two nights a month; no or minimal limitation of daily activities; no severe exacerbation (i.e. requiring oral steroids or admission to hospital) within a month; a PEF, if available, above 80% predicted. If any of these markers is exceeded, the patient is considered to have uncontrolled asthma.81 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings Treatment Treatment should be increased or decreased according to how well asthma is controlled and by using the stepwise approach described below. It is useful to start initially with a high step to achieve control and to show the patient that treatment can help, and then reduce the dose to the lowest dose to maintain control. Doses of beclometasone refer to those from an HFA fine dose inhaler; for equivalent doses from other inhalers, the dose may need to be doubled. Stepwise approach Step 1. Inhaled salbutamol prn Step 2. Inhaled salbutamol prn plus low-dose inhaled beclometasone, starting with 100ug twice daily for adults and 100ug once or twice daily for children Step 3. Same as step 2, but give higher doses of inhaled beclometa - sone, 200ug or 400ug twice daily Step 4. Add low-dose oral theophylline to Step 3 treatment (assuming long-acting beta agonists and leukotriene antagonists are not available) Step 5. Add oral prednisolone, but in the lowest dose possible to control symptoms (nearly always less than 10mg daily) At each step, check the patient's adherence to treatment and observe their inhaler technique. A spacer normally should be used with MDIs since they increase drug deposition and reduce oral candidiasis with inhaled steroids. Inhaled beclometasone should be available for all patients with per - sistent asthma, but if supplies are limited priority should be given to patients with life-threatening attacks and/or frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization and those losing time from work or school. Review asthma control Patients with other than very mild asthma should have regular reviews every three or six months and more frequently when treatment has been changed or asthma is not well controlled. This should always include observation of inhaler technique. Referral for specialist advice should, depending on facilities avail - able, be considered: when asthma remains poorly controlled; when the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain; when regular oral prednisolone is required to maintain control. 82 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAdvice to patients and families Regarding prevention: avoid cigarette smoke and trigger factors for asthma, if known; avoid dusty and smoke-filled rooms; reduce dust as far as possible by using damp cloths to clean furniture, sprinkling the floor with water before sweeping, cleaning blades of fans regularly and minimizing soft toys in the sleeping area; It may help to eliminate cockroaches from the house (when the patient is away) and shake and expose mattresses, pillows, blankets, etc. to sunlight. Regarding treatment, ensure that the patient or parent: knows what to do if asthma deteriorates; understands the benefit from using inhalers rather than tablets, and why adding a spacer is helpful; is aware that inhaled steroids take several days or even weeks to be fully effective. Management of exacerbation of asthma Assess severity Assess the severity of asthma by analysing symptoms (ability to com - plete sentences), signs (e.g. heart rate) and PEF and oxygen saturation, if equipment is available. Treatment First-line treatment: prednisolone 30-40mg for five days for adults and 1mg per kg for three days for children, or longer, if necessary, until they have recovered; salbutamol in high doses by MDI and spacer (e.g. four puffs every 20 minutes for one hour) or by nebulizer; oxygen, if available, and if oxygen saturation levels are low (below 90%). Reassess at intervals depending on severity. Second-line treatment - to be considered if the patient is not respond - ing to first-line treatment: Increase frequency of dosing via an MDI and spacer or by nebulizer, or give salbutamol by continuous nebulization at 5-10mg per hour, if appropriate nebulizer available; 83 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings for children, nebulized ipratropium, if available, can be added to nebulized salbutamol. Although the evidence for benefits from intravenous magnesium, intravenous salbutamol and intravenous aminophylline is poor, they may be worth trying, if available, when the patient has not responded to standard treatment and is at risk of dying from asthma. Diagnosis and management of COPD Stable COPD Diagnosis Both asthma and COPD can present with cough, difficult breathing, tight chest and/or wheezing. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, the following features favour COPD: previous diagnosis of COPD; history of heavy smoking, i.e. >20 cigarettes per day for >15 years; history of heavy and prolonged exposure to burning fossil fuels in an enclosed space, or high exposure to dust in an occupational setting; symptoms started in middle age or later (usually after age 40); symptoms worsened slowly over a long period of time; long history of daily or frequent cough and sputum production often starting before shortness of breath; symptoms that are persistent with little day-to-day variation. Measuring PEF before and 15 minutes after two puffs of salbutamol may also help. If the PEF improves by 20%, a diagnosis of asthma is very probable. A small response makes COPD more likely although a small response often occurs in asthma. Assessing severity Assess severity by symptoms (i.e. as moderate if breathless with nor - mal activity and as severe if breathless at rest), and by PEF and oxygen saturation, if possible. Treatment inhaled salbutamol, two puffs as required, up to four times daily; if symptoms are still troublesome, consider low-dose oral theophylline; if ipratropium inhalers are available, they can be used instead of, or added to, salbutamol, but they are more expensive.84 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAdvice to patient and family ensure they understand that smoking and indoor air pollution are the major risk factors for COPD. Patients with COPD must stop smok - ing and avoid dust and tobacco smoke; keep the area where meals are cooked well ventilated by opening windows and doors; cook with wood or carbon outside the house, if possible, or build an oven in the kitchen with a chimney that vents the smoke outside; stop working in areas with occupational dust or high air pollution - using a mask may help, but it needs to have an appropriate design and provide adequate respiratory protection. Exacerbation of COPD Management Antibiotics should be given for all exacerbations with evidence of infection. For severe exacerbations, give oral prednisolone 30-40mg for around seven days. Give high doses of inhaled salbutamol by nebulizer or MDI with spacer. oxygen, if available, should be given by a mask that limits the con - centration to 24% or 28%.85 Management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary health care in low-resource settings See CD for: GRADE tables Search strategies References Members of the Guideline Development Group86 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsDiagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings87 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Executive Summary The primary goal of the guideline is to improve the quality of care and the outcome in people with type 2 diabetes in low-resource settings. It recommends a set of basic interventions to integrate management of diabetes into primary health care. It will serve as basis for devel - opment of simple algorithms for use by health care staff in primary care in low-resource settings, to reduce the risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. The guideline was developed by a group of external and WHO experts, following the WHO process of guideline development. GRADE methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence and decide the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations Point of care devices can be used in diagnosing diabetes if labora - tory services are not available. Quality of evidence: not graded Strength of recommendation: strong Advise overweight patients to reduce weight by reducing their food intake. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: conditional Advise all patients to give preference to low glycaemic-index foods (beans, lentils, oats and unsweetened fruit) as the source of carbo - hydrates in their diet. Quality of evidence: moderate Strength of recommendation: conditional Advise all patients to practice regular daily physical activity appro - priate for their physical capabilities (e.g walking). Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: conditional Metformin can be used as a first-line oral hypoglycaemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not controlled by diet only and who do not have renal insufficiency, liver disease or hypoxia. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong Give sulfonylurea to patients who have contraindications to met - formin or in whom metformin does not improve glycaemic control. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong88 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings Give a statin to all patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40 years. Quality of evidence: moderate Strength of recommendation: conditional The target value for diastolic blood pressure in diabetic patients is 80mmHg. Quality of evidence: moderate Strength of recommendation: strong The target value for systolic blood pressure in diabetic patients is <130mmHg Quality of evidence: low Strength of recommendation: weak Low-dose thiazides (12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent) or ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment of hyper - tension in diabetic patients. They can be combined. Quality of evidence: very low for thiazides, low for ACE inhibitors Strength of recommendation: strong Beta blockers are not recommended for initial management of hyper - tension in diabetic patients, but can be used if thiazides or ACE inhibitors are unavailable or contraindicated. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong Give patients health education of patients on foot hygiene, nail cut - ting, treatment of calluses, appropriate footwear. Quality of evidence: low Strength of recommendation: strong Educate health care workers on assessment of feet at risk of ulcers using simple methods (inspection, pin-prick sensation) Quality of evidence: low Strength of recommendation: strong Persons with type 2 diabetes should be screened for diabetic retin - opathy by an ophthalmologist when diabetes is diagnosed and every two years thereafter, or as recommended by the ophthalmologist. Quality of evidence: low Strength of recommendation: conditional Unconscious diabetic patients on hypoglycaemic agents and/or blood glucose 2.8 should be given hypertonic glucose intravenously. Food should be provided as soon as the patient can ingest food safely. Quality of evidence: strong Strength of recommendation: strong 89 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Unconscious diabetic patients on hypoglycaemic agents and/or blood glucose 2.8 mmol/L administer intravenously 20 to 50ml of 50% glucose (dextrose) over 1 to 3 minutes. If not available, substitute with any hypertonic glucose solution. Food should be provided as soon as the patient can ingest food safely. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong If blood glucose 18 mmol (refer to hospital with i.v. drip 0.9% NaCl 1 litre in 2 hours, continue at 1 litre every 4 hours until hospital. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong These recommendations will be the basis for developing simple treatment algorithms for training primary care staff on integrated management of NCDs in low resource-settings. 90 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsBackground The implementation plan of the Global Strategy for Prevention and Con - trol of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2008. The objective 2 of this NCD Action Plan highlights the need to establish national policies and plans for NCD prevention and control ( 1). As one of the key components of this objec - tive, WHO is called upon to \"provide technical guidance to countries in integrating cost-effective interventions against major NCDs into their health systems\". Furthermore, the Action Plan proposes that Member States \"implement and monitor cost-effective approaches for the early detection of cancers, diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors\" and \"establish standards of health care for common con - ditions like CVD, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases integrating when ever feasible their management into PHC\". Although there are several national and international guidelines on diabetes management, they are too complex for application in primary care in low-resource settings. The Global status report on noncom - municable diseases 2010 highlights the need for countries to integrate NCD prevention and management into primary health care even in low resource settings (2). WHO has identified an essential package of cost-effective interventions with high impact, feasible for application in resource-poor settings (3). 91 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Objectives and target audience The primary goal of the guideline is to improve the quality of care and the outcome in people with type 2 diabetes in low-resource settings. The guideline provides a basis for development of simple algorithms for management of diabetes with essential medicines and technology available in first-contact health services in low-resource settings. It recommends a set of basic interventions to integrate management of diabetes into primary health care. The recommendations are limited to patients with type 2 diabetes, as the more complex management of type 1 diabetes requires more specialized care. The target users are health care professionals responsible for devel - oping diabetes treatment protocols which will be used by health care staff in primary care units in low-resource settings. A guideline development group was constituted, which included external experts and WHO staff (see CD). Funding and declarations of interest This work was funded by WHO funds. Every member of the guideline development group and the peer reviewers (see CD for list of peer reviewers), completed a standard WHO declaration of interest forms (see CD).92 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsMethodology and process Scope of the guideline The guideline development group used the GRADE methodology to formulate relevant questions on diabetes diagnosis and management in primary health care a low-resource context and identify important outcomes related to diabetes diagnosis and management ( 4). There were 12 questions to cover these domains: Use of point-of-care devices (glucose meters) in diagnosing diabetes Lifestyle management of diabetes Use of medicines from the essential medicines list in managing hyperglycaemia Use of medicines from the essential medicines list in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy (antihy - pertensive medication, statins) Screening for diabetic retinopathy for prevention of blindness Interventions to prevent foot ulcers/amputation Interventions in diabetes-related emergencies The questions and outcomes identified as critical or important were peer reviewed and modified by 4 external experts. The outcomes are presented in the GRADE Tables. Identification and generation of evidence The following databases were searched for systematic reviews pub - lished up to December 2010: Medline/Pubmed Embase DARE Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Identified systematic reviews were considered suitable if they were up-to-date in 2008 or later, and if they scored 8 or more on the 11-point AMSTAR tool for assessing the quality of systematic reviews ( 5). If more than one acceptable systematic review was identified, the most recent one was used, unless data on one or more outcomes of interest were available only in the earlier review. The outcomes in the scoping questions matched those defined in the systematic reviews, with very few exceptions.93 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Systematic reviews of acceptable quality but published or updated before 2008 were updated using the same search strategy and study inclusion criteria as the original review and re-running the meta- analysis including the newly identified study/studies, if any (Table 1). Where no suitable systematic reviews were identified in the literature search, they were commissioned from Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA and Health Management and Policy, and VA Center for Practice Management and Outcomes Research at the University of Michigan, An Arbor, Michigan, USA. Systematic reviews were not com - missioned for interventions where no RCTs or observational studies were conducted and for interventions for which the group concluded that currently recognized treatment effects are unlikely to be con - fused with other effects or biases (e.g. administration of glucose in hypoglycaemia). The identified and commissioned systematic reviews were used for assessing the quality of the evidence and summarizing the findings in GRADE tables. GRADE tables were not prepared for case series or reports, nor studies of laboratory analytical equivalence. Existing evidence-based guidelines for diabetes prevention, diag - nosis and management were reviewed (NICE ( 6), Canadian Diabetes Association ( 7), American Diabetes Association ( 8), Scottish Intercol - legiate Guidelines Network ( 9)), as well as the international guideline developed by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) for prevention and management of type 2 diabetes ( 10). These guidelines contain a broad range of interventions, and, with the exception of the IDF guideline, appropriate for a high-resource setting. However, some of the interventions are feasible in low-resource settings and were considered for this guideline. Formulation of recommendations The recommendations were formulated by the WHO secretariat and discussed at a group meeting. They are based on the GRADE evidence tables which also include assessment of the risk of serious side-effects of treatment. The group gave special consideration to the feasibility of the guideline implementation in low-resource settings. Consensus was a priori defined as agreement of at least 4 group members (majority). Any strong disagreements would have been reported in this document, but consensus was reached on every recommendation and there was no need for voting.94 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRisks and benefits The alternative for most of the recommendations in low-resource set - tings in primary care is usually no intervention. The consequences of untreated type 2 diabetes have been inferred from trials data on patients that did not achieve improvement in established risk factors for complications, and there is no doubt that diabetes substantially increases the risk of premature mortality, limb amputation, blindness and kidney failure ( 11). There are no data on individual diabetic patient values and prefer - ences in low resource settings, and they could vary between popu - lations. However, the group agreed that early death, heart attacks, strokes, limb amputation, blindness, kidney failure would generally be perceived as important outcomes to be avoided. Overall, although there is some doubt over precision in some interventions, the recom - mended interventions potentially decrease the risk of these outcomes by 10-40% which was judged to be a treatment effect of relevant size. Furthermore, the interventions have been in widespread use for many years and potential harm of treatment was judged to be acceptable when contrasted with the benefits. More detailed consideration of risks and harms can be found in Annex 2. Strength of recommendations For recommendations developed by the GRADE process the strength of the recommendation was based on the quality of evidence, bal - ance between desirable and undesirable effects and cost. The values and preferences are those of the group members as data on the dia - betic population in low-resource settings area scarce and likely differ between cultures. Strong: Moderate or high quality evidence of effectiveness for at least one critical outcome, desirable effects judged to outbalance the unde - sirable or very low quality evidence on undesirable effects; low cost and feasibility in low-resource settings; can be adopted as policy in most settings. Weak/conditional: low or very low quality evidence of effectiveness for all critical outcomes, small benefits or harms judged to dominate over benefits, questionable feasibility, lack of follow-up interventions at higher levels of health care. Peer review The draft document was sent to 6 peer reviewers (see CD). There was general agreement on the recommendations, but some modifi - cations were suggested. Treatment with sulfonylurea was added at the reviewers' request. The guideline development group accepted 95 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings the suggestion of one reviewer to draw attention to medication that has known unfavourable interaction with antiretroviral treatment because the guideline is likely to be used in populations with a high prevalence of HIV infection and antiretroviral treatment. Two review - ers had serious reservation over the feasibility of statin treatment initiated at the primary care level, and this is reflected in the weak strength of the recommendation. Use of insulin was also suggested by some peer reviewers for inclusion, but was not included because of general unavailability of insulin in primary care in low-resource settings. While there was general agreement that insulin should be available in primary care for people already on insulin treatment, the guideline group agree that initiating insulin treatment would be too complex for most primary care settings. Some reviewers suggested recommending aspirin for primary pre - vention of cardiovascular disease, but the group agreed that this rec - ommendation is insufficiently supported by evidence and that potential harm was not negligible, so it was not included.96 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAdaptation and implementation WHO will provide technical assistance to national guideline expert groups in developing simple management algorithms based on the guideline (see integrated protocols and other tools for Best Buys and WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease in CD, to facili - tate guideline implementation in primary care). Workshops for train - ing primary health care teams and policy makers on the use of the management protocols will be conducted in every low-income country that decides to integrate NCD prevention and management into pri - mary care services. The proposed interventions present a minimum for improving diabetes care at the primary care level and should be applicable in all countries. However, the treatment protocols based on the guideline might nevertheless need to be specific to the local situation, depending on the availability of technology and medication. Update The guideline will be updated in 2016, unless made seriously obsolete earlier by breakthrough research. Format and dissemination The guidelines will be printed and available in pdf format on the WHO website. It will also be disseminated through ministries of health to all participants of workshops that will be organized for training primary care staff on the use of management protocols based on the guideline. 97 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Impact and quality of the guideline Initially, the effect of the guidelines will be assessed through process indicators by the ministries of health and technical help from WHO (e.g. number of low-income countries that introduce diabetes man - agement at the primary care level, people with diabetes diagnosed in primary care, number of referrals for fundus examination, availability of essential medication at primary care level). Countries will also be given technical assistance to monitor disease outcomes and indicators, depending on availability of resources for NCD surveillance ( e.g. proportion of diabetic patients with adequate glycaemic control, incidence of acute complications, rates of limb amputations, etc.).98 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRecommendations and evidence A. Diagnosing diabetes Diabetes is diagnosed by laboratory measurement of plasma glucose in a blood sample. Diagnostic cut-off values are presented in Table 1 (12). Fasting capillary glucose is likely to be the most feasible mea - surement in low-resource settings. The guideline development group agreed that all people 40+ years old should have the following measurements: waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting or random plasma glucose, urine protein, urine ketones in newly diagnosed diabetes, plasma cholesterol if the test is available and testing of foot pulses and sensation if known to have diabetes. Table 2. Current WHO recommendations for the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and intermediate hyperglycaemia Diabetes Fasting plasma glucose 2-h plasma glucose*7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl)or 11.1mmol/l (200mg/dl) Impaired glucose*<7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl)and 7.8 and <11.1mmol/l (140mg/dl and 200mg/dl) Fasting Glucose (IFG) Fasting plasma 2-h plasma glucose*# 6.1 to to <7.8mmol/l * Venous plasma glucose 2-h after ingestion of 75g oral glucose load # If 2-h plasma glucose is not measured, status is uncertain as diabetes or IGT cannot be excluded In first-contact health services in low-resource setting laboratory measurement of plasma glucose is not available and patients need to be referred to the next level of care for diagnosis. This is often impractical and costly. The guideline panel considered the use of hand-held devices that measure blood glucose in a capillary blood sample. These devices are currently widely used for self-monitoring of glycaemia in persons with diagnosed diabetes, but are not routinely used for diagnosing diabetes.99 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Question: Can point-of-care devices be used for diagnosing diabetes in the absence of laboratory facilities? Recommendation 1. Point of care devices can be used in diagnosing diabetes if labora - tory services are not available. Quality of evidence: not gradedStrength of recommendation: strong A systematic review evaluating diagnostic accuracy of hand-held devices is the basis for this recommendation (SEE: Systematic review Echouffo Tcheugui JB et al). Two kinds of studies were identified - studies of analytical accuracy and epidemiologic studies of diagnostic performance. Results obtained by hand-held devices showed good agreement with those obtained by laboratory methods on the same sample, but the level of analytical accuracy varied with respect to standards defined by several professional organisations, and there is no single set of assessment criteria. The epidemiological studies were not suitable to answer the question on the sensitivity and the specificity of measurement by hand-held devices in diagnosing diabetes because none of the studies compared blood glucose values obtained by 2 methods in the same blood sample. Therefore, a GRADE table for the evidence was not produced. The rec - ommendation is based on studies of accuracy of biochemical methods used by currently available point of care devices.. B. Glycaemic control Lowering of plasma glucose towards normal values relieves symptoms of hyperglycaemia and has a beneficial effect on macrovascular and microvascular complications. The evidence on improved cardiovascular outcome comes from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials designed to estimate the effects of more intensive glucose control compared to less intensive control on the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 14). Various pharmacologic agents were used to lower plasma glucose in these studies. There is evidence of moderate quality that lowering glycaemia has a modest beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk (9% reduction).This is supported by the follow-up of the UKPDS participants 10 years after the study was closed ( 15). No effect on overall mortality was shown. The evidence for beneficial effect of glucose lowering on microvascu - lar complications come from several RCTs. The Diabetes Control and 100 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsComplications Trial (DCCT) has shown that better glycaemic control reduces the risk of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes ( 16) and subsequent epidemiological follow-up of the trial cohort suggests that the risk of macrovascular complications is reduced as well by intensive glucose control ( 17). In the ADVANCE trial major microvas - cular outcomes (new or worsening retinopathy or nephropathy) were reduced by 14% in the intensively treated group ( 18). The VADT trial did not find a reduction of macrovascular and micro - vascular complications with intensive glucose control, but found a slower progression of albuminuria in the intensively treated group (19). The UKPDS found a 25% relative risk reduction in aggregate microvascular endpoints in the intensively treated group ( 20). The guideline development group consensus was that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and urine ketones 2+ or with newly diag - nosed diabetes in lean persons <30 years should be referred to a higher level of care. Advice on diet and physical activity The majority of persons with Type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, which further increases their risk of macrovascular and micro - vascular complications through worsening of hyperglycaemia, hyper - lipidaemia and hypertension. ( 21) Questions: Does advice on diet and physical activity improve outcomes in diabetic patients? Does low glycaemic-index food improve outcomes in diabetic patients? Recommendations 1. Advise overweight patients to reduce weight by reducing their food intake. Quality of evidence: very lowStrength of recommendation: conditional 2. Advise all patients to give preference to low glycaemic-index foods ( beans, lentils, oats and unsweetened fruit) as the source of carbohydrates in their diet. Quality of evidence: moderateStrength of recommendation: conditional 3. Advise all patients to practice regular daily physical activity appropriate for their physical capabilities (e.g walking). Quality of evidence: very lowStrength of recommendation: conditional101 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings There is strong evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in persons at high risk by repeated counselling on weight- loss and increasing physical activity. The evidence on what dietary advice is effective once type 2 diabetes is diagnosed is less clear. The evidence on important outcomes is either very low (glycaemic control, intentional weight loss) or not available (risk of chronic complications and quality of life). The evidence for these recommendations comes from a Cochrane review of randomised trials that compared different dietary advice and approaches ( 22). Very little data could be integrated with a meta- analysis and none of the studies examined long-term outcomes. There is some indication that better glycaemic control, as measured by gly - cated haemoglobin (HbA1c) could be achieved when dietary advice is combined with advice on exercise. None of the trials included in the Cochrane review had a control group which received no advice at all, which is the current reality in most low-resource settings. Despite the low quality of the evidence, advice on diet and physical activity is recommended as the intervention is deemed feasible, is low-cost, has a low risk of adverse events and not been proven to be ineffective by high quality evidence. The recommendation on favouring foods with a low glycaemic index is based on a systematic review that found a favourable effect of such a diet on glycaemic control ( 23). However, no studies were conducted in low-resource settings and the concept of the glycaemic index might be too complex for this diet to be feasible in areas of low literacy and basic health services. Diabetes is a progressive illness. Introduction of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) will often be necessary in patients on diet treatment only, and the dosage further increased to improve glycamic control. In studies of where intensive glycaemic control was compared with less intensive control in patients with type 2 diabetes, there was no glycaemic control threshold effect for complications. However, it was shown that patients who achieved HbA1c values of 7% or below had a significantly lower risk of microvascular complications than did less intensively treated patients who achieved a higher mean HbA1c value (7.9-9.4%) ( 18;19;24). An HbA1c value of approximately 7% is associated with fasting plasma glucose concentration of approximately 6.5mmol/l ( 25). Metformin Question: Can metformin be used as oral hypoglycaemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes? 102 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsRecommendation 1. Metformin can be used as a first-line oral hypoglycaemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not controlled by diet only and who do not have renal insufficiency, liver disease or hypoxia. Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong The evidence for this recommendation comes from a Cochrane review of randomised-controlled trials (RCT) ( 26). The daily dose of metfor - min was 1-3g and titrated clinically. The results for the comparison between metformin and diet or metformin and placebo were presented and analysed separately for the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) ( 27) because of its considerably longer follow-up and differences in reporting primary outcomes compared to the other included trials that compared metformin to diet or placebo. Only a small number of studies reported patient-important outcomes such as death, major morbid events (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction, amputation, blindness, renal failure) and quality of life. The majority of studies reported surrogate outcomes that indicate increased risk for important outcomes (e.g. HbA1c, cholesterol, retinopathy or nephropa - thy progression) or laboratory outcomes (e.g. C-peptide levels). The data on morbidity and mortality come largely from the UKPDS. Data on lactic acidosis, a serious side-effect of fenformin use and by analogy feared to be caused by metformin as well come from a Cochrane review of RCTs and observational studies (28). It provides high quality evidence that the risk of this complication is low and not higher than with other hypoglycaemic agents. However, although 97% of the studies included in the systematic review did include patients with at least one of the standard contraindications for metformin ( renal insufficiency, cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, pulmonary disease), the review was not able to quantitatively assess the safety of metformin treatment in the presence of each of these hypoxic co-conditions. More research on the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin use in these particular populations is needed. If in doubt over the presence of contraindications, the patient should be referred to the next level of care. Metformin should be discontinued during acute severe illness such as pneumonia, severe infection, dehydration, myocardial infarction and the patient referred to the next level of care. Metformin vs diet only One arm of UKPDS (UKPDS 34) allocated overweight and obese patients to either metformin or diet only ( 27). Patients allocated to metfor - min had a significantly lower risk of any diabetes-related death and 103 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings macrovascular and 0.60- 0.90). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in patients in the metformin arm of the trial ( RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.93). The only other RCT that compared metformin to diet only and reported morbid - ity and mortality found a higher but statistically nonsignifant risk of ischaemic heart disease in patients treated with metformin (RR 3.0, 95% CI 0.13-71.92) ( 29). Three haemoglobin (HbA1c) ( 27;29;30). Metformin-treated patients had a (Standardised mean difference -1.06, 95% CI -1.89 to -0.22). Data on adverse events was available only for hypoglycaemia which was recorded in two RCTs and the risk was found to be increased. Metformin vs placebo Six RCTs recorded adverse events (hypoglycaemia, diarrhoea, gas - trointestinal disturbances). Diarrhoea was found to be more frequent with metformin than with placebo, but was not life-threatening. Hypo - glycaemia and gastrointestinal does not appear to be more frequent with metformin. Overall, this recommendation is based on moderate quality evi - dence that metformin lowers blood glucose, as measured by HbA1c. The evidence on other, potential, beneficial effects of metformin on long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications is of low or very low quality, or not available. Sulfonylureas Question: Can sulfonylurea be used as first-line oral hypoglycaemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes? Recommendation 1. Give a sulfonylurea to patients who have contraindications to metformin, or in whom metformin does not improve glycaemic control. Quality of evidence: very lowStrength of recommendation: strong This recommendation is derived from a systematic reviews of RCTs that compared effectiveness and safety of metformin and sulfonyl - ureas ( 31). There were 17 trials that compared glycaemic control and overall metformin and sulfonylureas were shown to perform similarly in lowering HbA1c. The evidence on similar levels of glycaemic control (HbA1c) achieved with metformin and sulfonylureas is of high quality.104 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsThere are fewer trials that compared metformin and sulfonylurea and examined important long-term outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications. The systematic review did not pool the results for some of the outcomes because of substantial methodological diversity (e.g. different dosage and definitions of out - comes), or lack of trial data to combine. Five RCTs reported on all-cause mortality and found a small effect that favours metformin ( 32-36 ), but the evidence is of low quality. Two RCTs reported on cardiovascular outcomes, but they were not a primary outcome in either ( 33;37). The evidence of low quality does not favour either drug. No RCT evaluated the progression of retinopathy. One RCT examined the effect of metformin and sulfonylurea on the glomerular filtration rate and progression of microabluminuria, but did not compare the two treatment groups directly ( 38). There is high quality evidence from nine RCTs that the risk of hypogly - caemia is higher with sulfonylureas than with metformin ( 32;34;39-45 ). Table 2: Sulfonylureas used in clinical trials included in the systematic review (31) Sulfonylurea Daily dosage (mg) Duration of action Glibenclamide 2.5-15 Intermediate to long Glipizide 2.5-20 Short to Short to First generation sulfonylureas (tolbutamide, chlorpropamide) were not included in the systematic review. Glibenclamide is a second generation sulfonylurea and the only sul - fonylurea on the WHO Essential Medicine List. Thus it is most likely to be available in low-resource settings. As precaution against severe hypoglycaemia, glibenclamide should be started with a small dose of 2.5-5 mg once daily with breakfast, and adjusted according to response to a maximum of 15 mg daily ( 46). The guideline development group consensus was that patients with fasting plasma glucose >14 mmol/l despite maximal doses of met - formin and sulfonylurea should be referred to the next level of care.105 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings C. Reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy Nephropathy Morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) are two to five times higher in persons with diabetes compared to people without diabetes ( 47), and diabetes confers about a two-fold excess risk for a wide range of vascular diseases, independently from other conventional risk factors ( 48). Treatment recommendations are based on the level of CVD risk as estimated by the WHO CVD risk-assessment tool ( 49). Diabetic nephropathy occurs in about 25% of people with type 2 diabetes ( 50), and a substantial proportion progresses to end-stage renal disease ( 51). Statins Question: Should statins be given to patients with type 2 diabetes for primary prevention of CVD? Statins (3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been found to reduce CVD risk in persons at high risk. A recent meta-analysis combining the results of 76 random - ized trials of statins in primary and secondary prevention of CVD concluded that statins have a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality, revascularisation, risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, and cause relatively mild adverse events ( 52). Much of statins' therapeutic effect is believed to come from its lowering of low-density lipoprotein, but there is some evidence of other, possibly lipid-independent, beneficial effects on blood vessels ( 53). Recommendation 1. Give a statin to all patients with type 2 diabetes aged 40 years.Quality of evidence: moderateStrength of recommendation: conditional106 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsTable 3. Statins used in clinical trials with diabetic patients included in the systematic review (54) Statin Daily dosage (mg) receiving protease inhibitors or ritonavir ( 55;56). Despite the availability of generic statins, their cost could still make their availability in low-resource settings uncertain, or their introduc - tion into primary health care could reduce the population coverage by more affordable essential medication such as antihypertensives and metformin. Therefore, the recommendation is conditional on avail - ability of resources for statins, after complete coverage by metformin, sulfonylureas and antihypertensives. The evidence for this recommendation comes from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of statins in the primary prevention of CVD in people without established cardiovascular disease but with CVD risk factors, one of which is diabetes ( 54). The meta-analysis was conducted for major patient-important outcomes such as total mortal - ity, major coronary heart disease events, stroke and serious adverse events such as cancer and did not include studies with surrogate outcomes such as vascular changes. The meta-analysis included large trials that included diabetic patients only (CARDS) ( 57), ASPEN ( 58), HPS ( 59), and data from a large diabetic subgroup of the ASCOT-LLA study, a trial of statins in people with different CVD risk factors such as hypecholesterolaemia, hypertension and high LDL- cholesterol ( 60). There were two trials with diabetic patients only that reported all cause mortality, one reported a statistically insignificant reduction (CARDS), while the other reported a non-significant increase (ASPEN). All the trials included patients aged 40 years and older, predominantly male and of European origin, although some ethnic groups were also included. Trials which reported the outcome of major coronary events in diabetic patients showed a 17- 36% reduction in the odds in people receiving statins (CARDS, ASCOT-LLA, HPS). Separate synthesis was not presented for people with diabetes, but the meta-regression anal - ysis found no heterogeneity of statin effect in subgroups dichotomised by sex, age and presence of diabetes ( 54). A subsequent meta-analysis 107 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings of controlled trials of statins in both primary and secondary pre - vention of CVD confirmed the findings that statins offer benefits in people at high risk of CVD, including people with diabetes and that the effect of several currently available statins was similar ( 61). The meta-analysis also demonstrated an increased risk of elevated liver enzymes but not an increased risk of important clinical events, except for an increased risk for diabetes ( 52). However, if available, liver function laboratory testing should be performed before introducing statin treatment. In the GRADE evidence profile pooled data from studies conducted on diabetic patients without cardiovascular disease provide moder - ate quality evidence that administration of statins to people with diabetes reduces mortality, the risk of coronary events and stroke and is unlikely to substantially affect the short-term risk of cancer and death due to all causes. Antihypertensive treatment Blood pressure lowering in diabetic patients reduces the risk of micro - vascular and macrovascular complications (11;62;63). Question: What are the target blood pressure targets to improve out - comes in patients with type 2 diabetes? Recommendations Target blood pressure values 1. The target value for diastolic blood pressure in diabetic patients is 80mmHg.Quality of evidence: moderate Strength of recommendation: strong 2. The target value for systolic blood pressure in diabetic patients is <130mmHg Quality of evidence: low Strength of recommendation: weak The evidence for the recommended target for diastolic blood pres - sure comes from two randomized controlled trials. The diabetes arm of the Hypertension Optimal treatment (HOT) Trial showed clinically important reductions in cardiovascular mortality and major cardio - vascular events in the group with diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg, compared to those with 90 mmHg. ( 64). The UKPDS found a reduc - tion in progression of microvascular disease, risk of stroke and risk of any diabetes related end-point in the group assigned to tight blood pressure control which achieved a mean diastolic blood pressure of 82 mmHg. ( 65). The GRADE table shows a meta-analysis of the study 108 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsresults which provides high quality evidence that tighter diastolic blood pressure control reduces overall mortality, and moderate qual - ity evidence that it reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and progression of microvascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. The recommended target of <130 mmHg for systolic blood pressure is based on evidence from two randomized controlled trials ( 66;67) and one prospective cohort study ( 62). The recommendation is based on moderate quality evidence that systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg offers some protection against stroke. The evidence on the beneficial effect of blood pressure <130mmHg on mortality and myocardial infarction is of low quality. In an epidemiological analysis of the UKPDS trial, lowest risk of death, coronary heard disease and microvascular complications was observed in study participants with a systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg ( 62). In the normotensive Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) randomized controlled trial the participants in the moderate treatment arm achieved mean systolic blood pressure of 137 mmHg and those in the intensive treatment arm achieved 128 mmHg. The primary outcome was creatinine clear - ance and no difference between the two treatment arms was seen in this outcome. However, there was statistically significant reduc - tion in risk of retinopathy progression and stroke ( 67). The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a randomized trial designed to test the effect of a target systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg on major cardiovascular events. The mean systolic blood pressure was119.3 mmHg in the intensive intervention group and 133.5 mmHg in the standard treatment group. No significant difference between the two intervention groups was found in all-cause death rates, nor in a composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or death from cardiovascular causes. The intensive treatment group had a significantly lower risk of stroke ( 66). Serious events that necessitated hospitalization, are life-threatening or cause permanent disability were recorded. The intensively treated group had a higher incidence of hypotension, bradycardia or arrhythmia and hyperkalaemia, but the absolute risk of these adverse events was low ( 68). In the HOT study systolic blood pressure was consistently underestimated in the measurement and it is therefore difficult to use the data. In the UKPDS, the mean systolic blood pressure in the group with tight blood pressure control was 144 mmHg, and 154 mmHg in the group with less tight control. ( 69) The guideline development group consensus was that patients with diabetes proteinuria or blood pressure >130/80 mmHg despite treat - ment with 2 or 3 blood pressure lowering agents should be referred to the next level of care.109 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings Choice of be used to improve outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension? Recommendations 1. Low-dose thiazides (12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent) or ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. They can be combined. Quality of evidence: very low for thiazides, low for ACE inhibitors Strength of recommendation: strong 2. Beta blockers are not recommended for initial management of hypertension in diabetic patients, but can be used if thiazides or ACE inhibitors are unavailable or contraindicated.Quality of evidence: very low Strength of recommendation: strong Table 4. Antihypertensive agents used in clinical trials included in systematic reviews (70;71) Agent Daily dosage (mg) Thiazides hydrochlorothiazidechlorthiazidetrichlormethiazide12.5-25500-10001-4mg ACE inhibitorsenalaprillisinoprilramiprilcaptoprilcilazaprilfosinopriltrandolaprilperinodopril5-4010-202.5-2050-1002.5-1020-402-42-4 Beta-blockersatenololpropranolol50-1002-4 The evidence for these recommendations comes from a Cochrane review of randomized placebo- or untreated group - controlled trials of at least one year duration ( 70), and is supported by the results of a RCT not included in the review ( 72). The Cochrane review did not separately analyse data from diabetic patients, but some of the included trials were on diabetic patients only and diabetes was not an exclusion criterion in any of the RCTS included in the meta-analysis. The recommenda - tions are graded as \"strong\" because the moderate quality evidence 110 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsis supplemented by a trial not included in the review because it was a head-to-head comparison of thiazides and ACE inhibitors and showed no significant difference between these two drug groups in the incidence of coronary heart disease. ( 72) There is moderate quality evidence that beta-blockers compared to placebo did not reduce all-cause mortality nor coronary heart disease, but did reduce the risk of stroke. Thus pri - ority is given to low-dose thiazides and ACE inhibitors. In a Cochrane review of the effect of blood pressure lowering agents on pregression of renal complications, ACE inhibitors have additionally been shown to reduce the progression to microalbuminuria in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients ( 71), but this effect has not been examined for thiazides. Although the risk of adverse events was significantly higher with these antihypertensive agents than with placebo, the adverse events were judged to be relatively mild. The choice of antihypertensive medication in low-resource settings is likely to be influenced by local availability and cost. Priority should be given to thiazides and ACE inhibitors. D. Prevention of lower limb amputations Diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputa - tions ( 73). The lifetime risk of developing foot ulcers in persons with diabetes is about 15% ( 74). These lesions may become infected and ultimately result in amputation because of gangrene. Question: Does multifactorial intervention with educating patients on foot care and education of health staff to asses risk of foot ulcers reduce the incidence of foot ulcers in patients with type 2 diabetes? Recommendations 1. Give patients health education on foot hygiene, nail cutting, treat - ment of calluses, appropriate footwear. Quality of evidence: lowStrength of recommendation: strong 2. Educate health care workers on assessment of feet at risk of ulcers using simple methods (inspection, pin-prick sensation). Quality of evidence: lowStrength of recommendation: strong A high value is placed on avoiding lower limb gangrene and need for amputation. The evidence used in formulating these recommendations comes from a systematic review ( 75). The review included individual and clus - ter-randomized clinical trials of combined interventions that included at least two levels of care (the patient, the health care provider, the 111 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings health care system). Due to heterogeneity between studies in study interventions, control interventions and health care settings, no syn - thesis of outcome data was attempted. The recommendations are supported by low quality evidence from 5 RCTs, none of them conducted in low-resource settings. The recom - mended interventions were judged to be feasible and low-cost, and are recommended despite the lack of evidence of their effectiveness, as the evidence of no effect was also of low quality. The guideline group judged that the evidence of no effect was insufficient and that research is recommended to increase the body of evidence, particu - larly in low-resource settings. The guideline development group consensus was that patients with severe foot infection and/or foot ulcers should be referred to the next level of care. E. Prevention of blindness Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss worldwide ( 76). The disease evolves through recognizable stages in its progression to blindness, is an important public health problem and there are effective and accepted screening tests. Timely laser photocoagulation therapy can prevent progression of vision loss ( 77). Question: What is the recommended frequency of screening for retinopa - thy to reduce the incidence of vision loss in type 2 diabetic patients by at least 50%? Recommendation 1. Persons with type 2 diabetes should be screened for diabetic retinopathy by an ophthalmologist when diabetes is diagnosed and every two years thereafter, or as recommended by the ophthalmologist. Quality of evidence: lowStrength of recommendation: conditional This recommendation is based on data from developed countries which show that a substantial proportion of newly diagnosed diabetic patients already have diabetic retinopathy ( 78). The recommended frequency of screening is based on a systematic review of cohort stud - ies, modelling and cost-effectiveness analyses (see systematic review by Echouffo Tcheugui) that examined the effect of different screening intervals on risk of vision loss and costs. The studies were too hetero - geneous for quantitative synthesis, and the recommended screening 112 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsinterval ranged from one to four years. A one-year screening interval is unlikely to be feasible in low-resource settings. Authors of studies that compared a 2-year interval with a 1-year interval are largely in agreement that a 2-year interval is acceptable as the risk of missing sight-threatening retinopathy is low. The largest cohort study, conducted in the United Kingdom and following 20,778 diabetic patients for 17 years found an odds ratio of 0.93 ( 95%CI: 0.82-1.05) when comparing incidence of sight-threatening retinopathy in patients screened every 1 year to the incidence in patients screened every 2 years ( 79). An interval of more than 24 months was associated with an increased risk (OR=1.56, 95% CI: 1.14-1.75) However, all the cohort studies were conducted in developed countries. Unfortunately, many low-resource settings do not have the laser equipment for photocoagulation of retinal/macular lesions for treating sight-threatening retinopathy, hence the weak/conditional recommendation. The guideline development group consensus was that diabetic patients with recent deterioration of vision or no retinal exam in 2 years should be referred to the next level of care. F. Severe hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) is a frequent complication in diabetic patients receiving medication to lower blood glucose, par - ticularly sulfonylurea and insulin. The brain requires a continuous supply of glucose and this is dependent on arterial plasma glucose concentrations ( 80). Severe hypoglycaemia is defined as hypoglycae - mia where the patient is unable to self-treat ( 81). It can cause loss of consciousness and coma, lead to neuronal death and is potentially life-threatening ( 82). The functional brain failure caused by hypogly - caemia is corrected after blood glucose concentration is raised. This can be accomplished by ingestion of carbohydrates, if that is feasible or parenteral glucose if not feasible. Question: What is the recommended intervention in severe hypoglycaemia? Recommendations 1. Unconscious diabetic patients on hypoglycaemic agents and/or blood glucose 2.8 should be given hypertonic glucose intrave - nously. Food should be provided as soon as the patient can ingest food safely. Quality of evidence: strongStrength of recommendation: strong113 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings 2. Unconscious diabetic patients on hypoglycaemic agents and/or blood glucose 2.8 mmol/L administer intravenously 20 to 50ml of 50% glucose (dextrose) over 1 to 3 minutes. If not available, substitute with any hypertonic glucose solution. Food should be provided as soon as the patient can ingest food safely.Quality of evidence: very lowStrength of recommendation: strong The evidence for this recommendation is derived from animal stud - ies, clinical observations and case reports ( 83;84). Although there are no RCTs or observational studies to support this recommendation, the group concluded that there is vast clinical experience that shows a very strong effect of oral or parenteral glucose administration to justify the strength of the recommendation ( 81). Parenteral therapy is necessary when the patient is unable or unwilling to ingest glucose or sucrose orally. However, evidence on the recommended oral or parenteral dosage and frequency is of very low quality, as the effects of various doses have not been investigated systematically. G. Hyperglycaemic emergencies Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state are life-threatening conditions with somewhat different features that require treatment in hospital by experienced staff. Even there, the case-fatality rate can be quite high ( 85). Both conditions are char - acterised by fluid and electrolyte depletion and hyperglycaemia. In a primary care setting it will usually not be possible to diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis, but it should be suspected in patients with extreme hyperglycaemia. Hyperglycaemia slows gastric emptying, therefore oral rehydration might not be effective, even in patients who are notvomiting ( 86). Question: What is the optimal fluid replacement regimen in persons with extreme hyperglycaemia? Recommendation 1. If blood glucose 18 mmol(l refer to hospital with i.v. drip 0.9% NaCl 1 litre in 2 hours, continue at 1 litre every 4 hours until hospital. Quality of evidence: very lowStrength of recommendation: strong A separate GRADE table was not prepared for this recommenda - tion. While it is reasonable to attempt rehydration in hyperglycaemic dehydrated individuals suspected of having diabetic ketoacidosis, the 114 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsrate and quantity of fluid in hyperglycaemia have not been extensively investigated. The recommendation is based on early physiological studies and one randomized clinical trial that compared two rates of physiologic saline infusion on a small sample of patients and favours a slower rate of infusion in achieving electrolyte balance and rehydra - tion in patients without extreme volume deficit ( 87).115 Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in primary health care in low-resource settings See CD for: Systematic reviews and GRADE tables, Benefits and harms of recommendations Members of the guideline development group 116 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsPrevention of Cardiovascular Disease Pocket Aid for Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk 117 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and pre - mature death throughout the world. The underlying pathology is ath - erosclerosis, which develops over many years and is usually advanced by the time symptoms occur, generally in middle age. Acute coronary events (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular events (strokes) frequently occur suddenly, and are often fatal before medical care can be given. Risk factor modification can reduce clinical events and premature death in people with established cardiovascular disease as well as in those who are at high cardiovascular risk due to one or more risk factors. This pocket aid provide evidence-based guidance on how to reduce the incidence of first and recurrent clinical events due to coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and peripheral vascular disease in two categories of people. They include; 1. People with risk factors who have not yet developed clinically mani - fest cardiovascular disease (primary prevention).1 2. People with established CHD, CeVD or peripheral vascular disease (secondary prevention). 2 The accompanying World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) risk prediction charts (see CD and table 1) enable the estimation of total cardiovascular risk of people in the first category. Part 1 document provides guidance on which specific preventive actions to initiate, and with what degree of intensity. People in the second category have high cardiovascular risk and need intensive lifestyle interventions and appropriate drug therapy as elaborated in Part II of this document. Risk stratification using risk charts is not required for making treatment decisions in them. Target audience This pocket aid can be used by physicians and non-physician health workers, at all levels of health care including primary care. Hyperten - sion, diabetes or established cardiovascular disease may be used as entry points for implementation. 1 World Health Organization. Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease.

Once the condition of the above categories of people is assessed and stabilized, they can be followed up in a primary care facility based on the guidance provided. They will need periodic reassessments in speciality care.120 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAssessing and managing cardiovascular risk in people with risk factors who have not yet developed clinically manifest cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) When can the decision be made to give drugs even before grading the cardiovascular risk? Some individuals are at high cardiovascular risk because they have established cardiovascular disease or very high levels of individual risk factors. All of them need intensive lifestyle interventions and appropriate drug therapy4,5. They include people: with established cardiovascular disease without established CVD who have a total cholesterol 8 mmol/l (320 mg/dl) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol TC/HDL-C cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol) ratio >8 without established CVD who have persistent raised blood pressure (>160-170/100-105 mmHg) with type 1 or 2 diabetes, with overt nephropathy or other signifi - cant renal disease with renal failure or renal impairment. Instructions for using WHO/ISH risk prediction charts The WHO/ISH risk prediction charts indicate 10-year risk of a fatal or non-fatal major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke), according to age, sex, blood pressure, smoking status, total blood cholesterol and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus for 14 WHO epidemiological sub-regions. There are two sets of charts. One set (14 charts) can be used in settings where blood cholesterol can be measured. The other set (14 charts) is for settings in which blood cholesterol cannot be measured. 4 World Health Organization . Prevention of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in low and middle income populations. Evidence-based recommendations for policy makers and health professionals. Geneva, 2003. 5 World Health Organization. Avoiding heart attacks and strokes. Don't be a victim protect yourself. Geneva 2005 .121 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease These are less accurate. Both sets are available in colour and shades of black on a compact disc. Each chart can only be used in countries of the specific WHO epi - demiological sub-region as shown in table 1. The charts provide approximate estimates of CVD risk in people who do not have established coronary heart disease, stroke or other atherosclerotic disease. They are useful as tools to help identify those at high cardiovascular risk, and to motivate patients, particularly to change behaviour and, when appropriate, to take antihypertensive, lipid-lowering drugs and aspirin. How do you use the charts to assess cardiovascular risk? (see figure 1) First make sure that you select the appropriate charts using infor - mation in table 1. If blood cholesterol cannot be measured due to resource limitations, the mean cholesterol value for the population can be used. Before applying the chart to estimate the 10 year cardiovascular risk of an individual, the following information is necessary: Presence or absence of diabetes6 Gender Smoker or non-smoker7 Age Systolic blood pressure (SBP)8 Total blood cholesterol9 (if in mg/dl divide by 38 to convert to mmol/l). 6 A person who has diabetes is defined as someone taking insulin or oral hypogly - caemic drugs, or with a fasting plasma glucose concentration above 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or a postprandial (approximately 2 hours after a main meal) plasma glucose concentration above 11.0 mmol/l (200 mg/l)on two separate occasions). For very low resource settings urine sugar test may be used to screen for diabetes if blood glucose assay is not feasible. If urine sugar test is positive a confirmatory blood glucose test need to be arranged to diagnose diabetes mellitus. 7 All current smokers and those who quit smoking less than 1 year before the assess - ment are considered smokers for assessing cardiovascular risk. 8 Systolic blood pressure, taken as the mean of two readings on each of two occasions, is sufficient for assessing risk but not for establishing a pretreatment baseline. 9 The mean of two non-fasting measurements of serum cholesterol by dry chemistry, or one non-fasting laboratory measurement, is sufficient for assessing risk. 122 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsOnce the above information is available proceed to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk as follows: Step 1 Select the appropriate chart depending on the presence or absence of diabetes Step 2 Select male or female tables Step 3 Select smoker or non smoker boxes Step 4 Select age group box (if age is 50-59 years select 50, if 60-69 years select 60 etc) Step 5 Within this box find the nearest cell where the individuals sys - tolic blood pressure (mm Hg) and total blood cholesterol level (mmol/l) cross. The colour of this cell determines the 10 year cardiovascular risk. Practice points Please note that CVD risk may be higher than indicated by the charts in the presence of the following: already on antihypertensive therapy premature menopause approaching the next age category or systolic blood pressure category obesity (including central obesity) sedentary lifestyle family history of premature CHD or stroke in first degree relative (male < 55 years, female < 65 years) raised triglyceride level (>2.0 mmol/l or 180 mg/dl) low HDL cholesterol level (< 1 mmol/l or 40mg/dl in males, < 1.3 mmol/l or 50 mg/dl in females) raised levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, apoli - poprotein B or Lp(a), or fasting glycaemia, or impaired glucose tolerance microalbuminuria (increases the 5-year risk of diabetics by about 5%) raised pulse rate socioeconomic deprivation.123 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Table 1.

Self-care strategies include both self-care and self-management by the individual. Inherent in the concept is the recognition that whatever factors and processes may determine behaviour, and whether or not self-care is effective and interfaces appropriately with professional care, it is the individual person that acts (or does not act) to preserve health or respond to symptoms. Self-care involves the entire body of health decisions that individu - als make for themselves and their families to maintain physical and mental well-being. Self-care includes a variety of strategies such as staying fit and healthy, both physically and mentally, avoiding hazards such as smoking and improved management of long-term health con - ditions. To achieve these strategies, self-care also includes elements of self-monitoring, self-management and self-medication. In addition, self-care practices in many different societies represent a wide spec - trum of options such as using body massage, religious and cultural rituals, and various ceremonies. Thus self-care also includes managing or minimising the way a chronic condition limits an individual's life. There is growing recognition that all countries face problems with an ageing population and an increase in NCDs accounting for substan - tial morbidity and increased medical costs. Whilst self-care should not be used to replace the basic components of essential health care, it may offer an approach for countries to optimize management of NCDs and aid well-being. Although self-care interventions have been integrated into various disease management programs, the evidence on the effectiveness of various interventions and the mode of their implementation have not been synthesized. This guideline provides evidence based recommendations in relation to major noncommuni - cable diseases as highlighted in the NCD Global Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2008..Determining which self-care strategies are underpinned by evidence of effectiveness and gaining an understanding of the barriers to implementation will aid effective delivery of health care for NCDs. 131 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease Guidance on self-care interventions aimed at four shared risk factors - tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and the harmful use of alcohol are addressed in the 2008-2013 action plan for the global strategy for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. To capture the various components of self-care interventions and various modes of their delivery, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) identified nine questions for the development of the self-care in NCDs recommendations. A search strategy was used to initially retrieve evidence of effectiveness from systematic reviews relevant to self-care and NCDs, and each eligible review was rated using the AMSTAR tool.. For all systematic reviews that were included, we searched for clinical trials that were specifically undertaken in LMIC. We used the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence and deciding the strength of the recommendations. The quality of the evidence presented in the reviews for critical and important outcomes was graded as: high, moderate, low or very low. The strength of a rec - ommendation (strong, weak) takes into account the overall quality of the evidence and the uncertainly about the target population's values and preferences. It reflects the degree of confidence that the benefits outweigh the harms and and the degree to which the intervention has been tested and/or is relevant to LMIC settings in terms of feasibility and resource implications. Many of the self-care interventions in NCDs identified in the 9 ques - tions are enthusiastically advocated, applied and supported by policy makers, health workers, the educational system and nongovernmen - tal organizations. Many have wide appeal to the general public and patients themselves, and will continue to be applied or demanded. However, very few of those interventions are based on high or moder - ate quality evidence of their effectiveness, thus strong recommenda - tions in their favour was judged to be inappropriate. On the other hand, there is similar lack of high or moderate quality evidence of no effectiveness, accompanied by considerable uncertainty over harms outweighing benefits. Thus strong recommendations against their use were also felt to be inappropriate, given their popularity and intui - tive appeal. This guideline could help re-prioritize on-going self-care interventions, favouring those with a stronger evidence base. It will hopefully spur research activities to provide more evidence on key questions. Currently there remains the need to identify pragmatic, low cost, feasible interventions underpinned by high quality evidence, particu - larly in LMIC settings. There is also a requirement to identify the most cost effective and effective individual components and combinations of interventions for self-care in these settings. The guideline gives some recommendations on future research.132 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsQuestions 1. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care strate - gies targeted at the community and/or support networks rather than the individual improve outcomes? Definition: Self-care strategies for NCDs targeted at the community are designed to be delivered beyond health care institutions either by the health care system or by the local community through its members, trained or untrained, paid or unpaid. Self-care interven - tions delivered through community action can be complementary to conventional health care or stand-alone programmes. 2. In patients with non-communicable diseases do lay led self- management patient programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Lay led self-management education programmes are highly structured programmes for people with NCDs which are pri - marily educational, and address self-care of the disease with the majority of course content delivered by lay individuals. 3. In patients with non-communicable diseases do online resources for self-care improve outcomes? Definition: Online resources for self-care include: health information, interactive health communication applications (web based informa - tion packages that can combine health information with at least one component of support, decision support or behaviour change support). 4. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-monitoring devices improve outcomes? Definition: On-going management of NCDs often involves monitor - ing of a biochemical or physical measure (e.g. blood pressure, blood glucose, peak flow). Whilst these measures can be undertaken in the clinic setting they may be self-monitored in the home setting by the patient or within the community and the results communicated to a health professional for on-going management. 5. In patients with non-communicable diseases do mobile telephone and/or telemonitoring interventions targeted at self-care improve outcomes? Definition: Telemonitoring involves remotely monitoring patients who are not in the same location as the health care provider. Monitoring devices will transmit information on symptoms and/or vital signs via the telephone to a remote monitoring service provider and/or to their health care provider. Telemedicine is a broader concept that includes patient consultations using telecommunications.133 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease 6. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-treatment interventions improve outcomes? Definition: Self-treatment intervention includes self-monitoring and adjustment of dosage of medicines by the individual based on a pre- specified action plan agreed jointly by a health care practitioner / worker and the patient. A situation can occur in NCD management in which the patient could or will alter the doses and/or frequency of the treatment depending upon the change in the nature, sever - ity of symptoms and/or biochemical markers of a disease under the guidance of a professional health care provider (e.g. physician) with treatment recommendation. 7. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care educa - tion/information programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Education is the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction about a specific aspect of disease whilst information is the knowledge communicated about a particular aspect of a disease. 8. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care reha - bilitation programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Rehabilitation therapy aims to improve function that has been lost or diminished by disease. Rehabilitation programmes may incorporate exercise and/or information after an event such as a myocardial infarction. 9. In patients with non-communicable diseases do interventions targeted at adherence improve outcomes? Definition: Patient adherence has been defined as the extent to which a person's behaviour - taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes - corresponds with agreed recommenda - tions from a health care provider.134 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsNo. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 1. In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care strategies targeted at the community and/or support networks rather than the individual improve outcomes? 1.1 Community interventions can complement primary health care. Structured training for community workers should be undertaken to aid the detection and on-going management for NCDs.Weak Very low R1 Research is needed to identify pragmatic community based interventions for self-care of NCDs in LMIC. Community programmes should be evaluated for their coverage, generalisability, impact and cost effectiveness. 2. In patients with non-communicable diseases do lay led self- management patient programmes improve outcomes? 2.1 The use of highly structured lay led self-management patient programmes for self-care in NCDs is not recommended at the present time for LMIC.Weak Very low R2 Research is needed to evaluate lay led self-management programmes in LMIC, ideally with identification of the active components of such programmes and their feasibility in low resource settings. 3. In patients with non-communicable diseases do online resources for self-care improve outcomes? 3.1 Health care organisations should provide access to user-friendly, valid and reliable online information targeted at NCDs and their management.

Self-care implementation strategies should reflect the complexity and co-existence of NCDs, aim to avoid verti - cal programmes and focus on an integrated health care strategy. Self-care should reflect the diversity of health care systems, their context and be sensitive to the resources available. Although self-care interventions have been integrated into various disease management programs,the evidence on the effectiveness of various interventions and the mode of their implementation have not been synthesized. The NCD Global Action Plan endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 20081 highlighted the need for a guideline on self-care that provides evidence based recommendations in relation to major noncommuni - cable diseases. Determining which self-care strategies are underpinned by evidence of effectiveness and gaining an understanding of the barriers to imple - mentation will aid effective delivery of health care for NCDs. \"Self-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, and maintain health and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a health- care provider.\"3 Self-care strategies therefore include both self-care and self-man - agement by the individual. Inherent in the concept is the recognition that whatever factors and processes may determine behavior, and whether or not self-care is effective and interfaces appropriately with 1 World Health Organization. 2008-2013 Action plan for the global strategy for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases . http://www.who.int/nmh/ publications/9789241597418/en/ 2 World Health Organization, Global status report on noncommunicable diseases ,\" World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 2010. 3 World Health Organisation. 2009. \"Self-care in the Context of Primary Health Care\" . Report of the Regional Consultation, Bangkok, Thailand.137 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease professional care, it is the individual person that acts (or does not act) to preserve health or respond to symptoms.4 Self-care involves all health decisions that individuals make for them - selves and their families to maintain physical and mental well-being. Self-care strategies include a variety of strategies such as staying fit and healthy, both physically and mentally, avoiding hazards such as smoking and improved management of long-term health conditions. To achieve these strategies, self-care also includes elements of self- monitoring, self-management and self-medication. Self-care practices in many different societies may represent a wide spectrum of options such as using body massage, religious and cul - tural rituals. Thus self-care also includes managing or minimising the way a chronic condition limits an individual's life in their own social-cultural context. A broader framework for self-care emphasizes the behavioural and cognitive dimensions. This would then encompass an individual's behaviour towards symptom recognition and evaluation, and decisions to treat by a selection of self-determined actions or to seek appropriate advice regarding subsequent management decisions. The target audience for this guideline are health care policy mak - ers and health workers, but it will also be useful to researchers and relevant non-governmental organizations. The update of the guideline is planned in 5-7 years. Given the num - ber of different interventions and critical/important outcomes, it is unlikely that the evidence base of high or moderate quality will increase earlier, The guideline was funded by WHO funds. No funds from commercial sources were used. Within WHO activities on improving the management of chronic NCDs at the primary care, regional and country level will be con - ducted. Workshops will be held to adapt the guideline to local priori - ties and assist its implementation. 4 Dean K, Kickbusch I (1995). \"Health related behaviour in health promotion: utilizing the concept of self care\".

We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence in the most relevant and/or recent reviews.6 Several systematic reviews used the standardized mean difference(SMD), as the summary statistic for absolute effect in meta-analysis when the studies all assess the same outcome but measure it in a variety of ways. The standardized mean difference expresses the size of the intervention effect in each study relative to the variability observed in that study: SMD = Difference in mean outcome between groups Standard deviation of outcome amon participants Thus studies for which the difference in means is the same propor - tion of the standard deviation will have the same SMD, regardless of the actual scales used to make the measurements.7 6 Guyatt GH, Oxman AD, Sch\u00fcnemann HJ, Tugwell P, Knotterus A.

Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease Outcomes In the full summary GRADE tables (Appendix 4), we presented the effects of interventions on one or more of the following outcomes: Primary outcomes Mortality Clinical complications and/or disease progression Surrogate outcomes that correlate with clinical complications and/ or disease progression (e.g. blood pressure) Adherence to treatment Secondary outcomes In addition we presented information for the following secondary outcomes: Health Related Quality of Life Psychosocial outcomes Hospitalisation and/or health care utilization Cost effectiveness, cost impact, cost savings Harms of self-care interventions Self-efficacy, knowledge and patient empowerment See Appendix 1 for GRADE ranking of importance of outcomes.142 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsFormulation of recommendations The Guideline Development Group (Appendix 3) met twice: once to develop the questions for which recommendations were required and once to review the evidence synthesised and formulate the recommendations. The recommendations were drafted by the co-chairs of the GDG and the WHO Secretariat. They were then presented and discussed at a meeting of the GDG. They are based on the GRADE evidence tables and the evidence-to-recommendation framework presented for each recommendation in Annex 5. The group gave special consideration to the feasibility of the guideline implementation in low resource settings. Consensus was a priori defined as agreement of the simple majority, without strong objections from the minority. Consensus was reached on every recommendation and there was no need for voting. Each recommendation was graded as strong when there was con - fidence that the benefits clearly outweigh the harms (for recommen - dations to use the intervention), or that harms clearly outweigh the benefits (for recommendations against the intervention). A weak rec - ommendation for an intervention was given when the benefits probably outweigh the harms, but there was considerable uncertainty about the trade-offs, typically due to lack of data. A weak recommenda - tion against an intervention was given when there was considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of benefits and harms. 143 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease Peer review The draft guideline was reviewed by 5 external experts (Appendix 3). The reviewers had a few requests for clarification, but no objections to the recommendations. One reviewer expressed concern that the local decisions on the implementation of the guidelines would not be easy, given that most recommendations were weak for or weak against the intervention. This reviewer questioned the use of GRADE given the general paucity of good quality research, and proposed an alternative method for arriving at the recommendations, but this was not accepted by the GDG. Declarations of Interest All the members of the Guideline Development Group, the Systematic Review Group, Observers and Guideline reviewers completed the stan - dard WHO Declaration of Interest Form. Interest was declared on the WHO forms by the following persons and disclosed orally at the meetings: Dr William Summerskill is employed by Elsevier, a publisher of sev - eral medical journals, as an editor of The Lancet. The GDG approved his participation in the Systematic Review Group. Dr Richard Chapman had been emplyed by IMS (Intercontinental Medical Statistics) Health. He conducted health economics and out - comes research. His employment ceased 3 months before his engage - ment in the GDG. The WHO secretariat decided that this did not constitute conflict of interest and that Dr Chapman can participate at all stages of guideline development. No other participant declared conflict or potential conflict of interest. All members of the Guideline Development Group participated fully in the discussions and formulation of the recommendations.144 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsResults We identified 1,260 potential systematic reviews from the searches. After initial screening we retrieved 298 full-text articles to be assessed for eligibility. Studies were excluded at this stage if they fulfilled one or more of the following conditions: not self-care, not NCDs, not a systematic review or had no clinical outcomes (n=106). The remaining 192 articles were assessed for quality. Full data extractions were performed for the 88 studies (excluding updated/ duplicate studies) fulfilling questions 3 and 7 of the AMSTAR checklist. Two further reviews were identified by experts and an additional ten reviews were identified when the search was updated in March 2013 giving a total of 100 reviews.1-100 GRADE tables were provided for studies that were the most recent and relevant. We also identified 87 lower quality reviews.101-187 The results are presented below for each of the nine questions. Question 1: In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care strategies targeted at the community and/or support networks rather than the individual improve outcomes? Definition: Self-care strategies for NCDs targeted at the community are designed to be delivered beyond health care institutions either by the health care system or by the local community through its members, trained or untrained, paid or unpaid. Self-care interventions delivered through community action can be complementary to conventional health care or stand-alone programmes. Summary of evidence We identified seven systematic reviews of trials of interventions focused on support groups or family members. 17 24 45 53 59 76 92 One systematic review examined the role of peer support, includ - ing one-to-one sessions, self-help or support groups, online computer mediated groups, or peer support within an educational environment for individuals with heart disease, compared with usual care. The six included trials were heterogeneous in intervention and outcomes mea - sured. The trials demonstrated some positive effects of peer support for individuals with heart disease, including higher levels of self-efficacy, improved activity, reduced pain, and fewer emergency room visits. However, the trials had methodological problems: allocation conceal - ment was only clear in one study and high attrition occurred in three.76145 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease In a systematic review of various types of social support amongst patients with diabetes, the interventions in the four trials were highly varied and meta-analysis was not possible. One trial showed limited evidence of reduction in HbA1c with patient group consultations to the physician. There was no evidence of improved diabetes control by support from the spouse or by family and friends.92 A further systematic review examined the role of interventions involv - ing the family in the treatment of adult patients with chronic physical diseases, on the assumption that families can be highly influential on an individual's self-care. Interventions were either psychoeducational, about the disease and its treatments, or focused on improving relation - ships within the family, so as to facilitate problem solving and reduce illness related stress. The comparison was groups undergoing usual care, which in some cases included additional education or counsel - ling at the request of the patient. In 52 RCTs, there was considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, disease types studied, outcomes and time frames. There was some evidence of benefit for family based interventions: mean overall effect sizes were 0.32 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.45) for the patients' physical health, 0.28 (0.12 to 0.43) for the patients' mental health, and 0.35 (0.05 to 0.66) for the family members' health.45 A systematic review of interventions to support caregivers amongst families of those with terminal illness showed some evidence of benefit of psychosocial interventions.53 However, trials had high heteroge - neity in terms of their design and outcomes and no meta-analysis was performed. Only one of five trials demonstrated no benefit, and the others reported improved carer perceptions of their situation or improved quality of life. One systematic review examined non-pharmacological interven - tions for the caregivers of stroke survivors focussing on what kinds of services could help. Eight RCTs were identified, with substantial variation in their design and statistical heterogeneity prevented pool - ing of results. Interventions included information provision, training for caring, others were psychosocial, aiming to raise resilience and promote well-being in the carers. Two studies using a support and information intervention provided data on the Caregivers Strain Index: pooling these gave a SMD -0.29 (95% CI -0.86 to 0.27) tion, but with substantial heterogeneity (I2=61%). Data were pooled from two other studies on the outcome stress/burden of caregivers, intervention versus comparator SMD was 0.01 (-0.34 to 0.36) with no significant heterogeneity (I2=0%). 59 We found seven lower quality reviews in the following disease areas: CVD, diabetes and combined chronic diseases including CVD and cancer.116 136 148 157 159 163 166 In hypertension, a community health worker did not improve blood pressure (BP) control when compared with usual 146 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingscare. Interventions aimed at couples had small significant effects on patient depressive symptoms on a number of chronic diseases includ - ing cancer and CVD. In conclusion, community support and family involvement are oppor - tunities to strengthen knowledge, self-efficacy and build capacity to deliver self-care across a range of chronic diseases. In some settings, these may offer the main route to providing structured support for self-care, where other forms of health delivery are lacking. Anecdotal evidence suggests that chronic disease programmes involving the community are widespread. However, there is little randomised trial evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions. Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 1.1 Community interventions can complement primary health care. Structured training for community workers should be undertaken to aid the detection and on-going management for NCDs.Weak Very low Research recommendations R1 Research is needed to identify pragmatic community based interventions for self-care of NCDs in LMIC. Community programmes should be evaluated for their coverage, generalisability, impact and cost effectiveness. GRADE tables for question 1 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation table is presented in Appendix 5. Question 2: In patients with non-communicable diseases do lay led self-management patient programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Lay led self-management education programmes are highly structured programmes for people with NCDs which are primarily educational, and address self-care of the disease with the majority of course content delivered by lay individuals. Summary of evidence Three systematic reviews were identified which examined trials relat - ing to lay led self-management programmes in self-care.26 39 65 Within these, one trial was performed within LMIC. One systematic review examined evidence of one-to-one volunteer support among women with breast cancer, compared with usual care, or cancer nurse support, or psychopharmacological treatment. The review presented limited, poor quality evidence to show any benefit of such peer support programmes among those with breast cancer.65147 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease In a systematic review of peer support telephone calls for patients with a variety of health problems meta-analysis was not performed. Peer support telephone calls were found to improve uptake of mam - mograms in women > 40 years. For myocardial infarction patients, peer support telephone calls were found to improve diet at six months (54% intervention versus 44% usual care (p = 0.03)) but no differences in outcomes were found in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.26 One review examined the evidence on lay led self-management patient programmes across a range of disease conditions. This directly aimed to evaluate the benefits of structured, manualized, lay led self-man - agement programmes among 17 trials randomising 7,442 study partici - pants with long-term health conditions, including arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, chronic pain and other diagnoses. In these trials the comparison was usual care which typically incorporated standard education materials and in some trials, the offer of the lay led course once the trial was completed. The follow-up period for most of these studies was three to six months. Improvement in terms of pain, dis - ability, fatigue and exercise were small and not clinically important.39 In conclusion, the use of lay (peer) led self-management disease pro - grammes has grown based on utilising the knowledge and commitment of individuals who have chronic disease to educate and support others with chronic disease. Lay led programmes may help support individuals to take more responsibility for their own health. In regions with highly developed health care systems, lay led programmes may support a shift towards a more partnership model of health care; in areas with little health care coverage they may provide an essential basis for self-care. We found no lower quality reviews on this topic. Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 2.1 The use of highly structured lay led self-management patient programmes for self-care in NCDs is not recommended at the present time for LMIC.Weak Very low Research recommendations R2 Research is needed to evaluate lay led self-management programmes in LMIC, ideally with identification of the active components of such programmes and their feasibility in low resource settings. GRADE tables for question 2 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation table is presented in Appendix 5.148 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsQuestion 3: In patients with non-communicable diseases do online resources for self-care improve outcomes? Definition: Online resources for self-care include: health information, interactive health communication applications (web based informa - tion packages that can combine health information with at least one component of support, decision support or behaviour change support). Summary of evidence We obtained data from three systematic reviews evaluating evidence on online resources in self-care. One focused on diabetes84 and the other two included studies of a range of chronic diseases including CVD, diabetes and respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary) dis - ease.35 73 One review examined the evidence for web based interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes. The evidence was generally poor quality and the authors reported that goal-setting, personalised coach - ing, interactive feedback and online peer support groups were some of the successful approaches which were applied in e-interventions to manage type 2 diabetes. There was no pooled analysis and the effects on clinically relevant outcomes were limited.84 One review examined the evidence on interactive health communi - cations applications (IHCAs) which are web based information pack - ages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. Interventions could be a game or information website. IHCAs had a signi ficant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46, 95% CI to 0.69), social support 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18, 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest that IHCAs might have a positive effect on self-ef ficacy (SMD 0.24, 0.00 to 0.48). It was not possible to determine the effects on emotional or economic outcomes and there was considerable heterogeneity amongst outcomes. 73 A systematic review of e-health (monitoring, treatment instructions, self-management training and general information and communica - tion between patient and caregiver), or e-health in addition to usual care found most studies showed small to moderate positive effects on health outcomes. Due to the different study populations that were included and differences in the way that e-health interventions were delivered (instead of usual care or in addition to usual care), results could not be combined and meta-analysis was not performed. How - ever, not all outcomes improved, and in some measures, comparable effect sizes were seen in the intervention and control group. 35 149 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease In conclusion, accessing health information online has become wide - spread in developed regions. Health care providers may provide medi - cal information, but content provided by pharmaceutical companies and businesses promoting herbal or complementary preparations is also commonly accessed. Internet accessibility, although extensive, is not uniform worldwide, with some regions having low access and some regions experiencing government control over access. Literacy and language barriers make internet resources inaccessible to some groups. We found ten reviews deemed to be lower quality.103 104 109 117 121 131 149 158 170 176 Within these, cardiovascular disease home based secondary programmes and remote patient monitoring seemed to improve qual - ity of life and reduced hospitalisations. One review of telemonitoring in heart failure reported modest improvements in quality of life and decreased hospitalisations. In hypertension, computer based interven - tions had no effects. In diabetes, web based educational tools showed small improvements in clinically relevant outcomes and enhanced patient-provider communication. There was some evidence that a simple pocket sized insulin dosage computer reduces hypoglycaemic events and insulin doses. Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 3.1 Health care organisations should provide access to user-friendly, valid and reliable online information targeted at NCDs and their management. Online resources could provide some benefit.Weak Very low Research recommendations R3 Research is needed to evaluate interactive health care web resources, particularly in LMIC settings. GRADE tables for question 3 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation table is presented in Appendix 5. Question 4: In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-monitoring devices improve outcomes? Definition: On-going management of NCDs often involves monitor - ing of a biochemical or physical measure (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose, peak flow etc.). Whilst these measures can be undertaken in the clinic setting they may be self-monitored in the home setting by the patient or within the community and the results communicated to a health professional for subsequent management. 150 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsSummary of evidence We found 22 systematic reviews on oral anticoagulation, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes (types 1 and 2) and asthma.1 8 11 14 16 19-22 37 40 43 47 49 51 67 78 81 85 87 94 98 We found no reviews on self-monitoring in cancer. A review on self-monitoring and self-management of oral antico - agulation reported the combined interventions produced significant clinical benefits. Self-monitoring alone (7 trials, 1027 participants) significantly reduced major haemorrhages (RR 0.56. 0.35 to 0.91) but not thromboembolic events (RR 0.57, 0.32 to 1.00), nor mortality (RR 0.84, 0.50 to 1.41). 40 The self-management studies are reviewed under Question 6. A systematic review of RCTs that looked at multidisciplinary interven - tions among participants with heart failure, some of which included home monitoring, was identified. Overall, multidisciplinary interven - tions reduced all-cause admission (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95). All- cause mortality was also reduced (RR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.92) and heart failure admission (RR 0.70, 0.61 to 0.81). In relation to self-monitoring, data could not be isolated from the overall data presented in the review.49 A review of 25 trials of self-monitoring in hypertension, compared with usual care found systolic BP and diastolic BP were significantly reduced with self-monitoring: WMD 3.82 mmHg (95% CI, 5.61 to 2.03) for systolic and 1.45 mmHg (1.95 to 0.94) for diastolic. The likelihood of meeting BP targets was increased (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16). This substantial evidence indicates that at a population level, self-monitoring in hypertension may give rise to small but clinically important reductions in blood pressure. 11 One review looked at the role of continuous blood glucose monitoring via a wire-type glucose sensor implanted in the subcutaneous tissue to monitor the glucose concentration of interstitial fluid in people with diabetes compared with conventional self-monitoring. Comparing the continuous monitor group with the standard self-monitoring of blood glucose, the mean difference in HbA1c was -0.30% (95% CI -0.43 to -0.17). Again, the difference is statistically significant but not clinically meaningful, although in this case the direction of effect supported the use of continuous monitors rather than standard self-monitoring.78 A pooled analysis of individual patient data from six randomised trials of self-monitoring of blood glucose in people with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes found at six months follow-up, mean HbA1c was reduced in the self-monitoring group compared with the usual care group -2.7 (95% CI -3.9 to -1.6). At one year, it was -2.5 (-4.1 to -0.9). This high quality evidence showed that self-monitoring of blood glucose levels among patients with type 2 diabetes produces a statisti - cally significant but not clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c.37 151 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease We found fourteen lower quality reviews in the following areas: CVD (10), diabetes (4).102 119 123 129 134 139 150 161 167 168 179 181 182 184 In conclusion, self-monitoring of symptoms, body weight or other health indicators and communication of this information to a health care professional for medical guidance is currently undertaken across a wide variety of NCDs. Several devices to support this have been marketed, including blood pressure monitors, blood or urine glucose monitors and oral anticoagulation monitors. Self-monitoring offers the opportunity for more frequent data collection about an individual's condition, potentially more convenient to the individual than visits to a health centre and at lower cost overall, particularly if there is a large distance to a clinical facility. Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 4.1 Self-measurement to monitor blood pressure is recommended for the management of hypertension in appropriate patients where the affordability of the technology has been established.Strong Low 4.2 Self-monitoring of blood coagulation is recommended for appropriate patients treated with oral anticoagulation agents, where the affordability of the technology has been established. Weak Moderate 4.3 The use of self-monitoring of blood glucose in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes not on insulin is not recommended at the present time because there is insufficient evidence to support such a recommendation.Weak Moderate 4.4 People with type 1 and type 2 diabetes on insulin should be offered self-monitoring of blood glucose based on individual clinical need.Weak Low Research recommendations R4 Research is needed to evaluate the impact of self-monitoring, including assessment of the cost-effectiveness in LMIC. GRADE tables for question 4 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation tables are presented in Appendix 5. Question 5: In patients with non-communicable diseases do mobile telephone and/or telemonitoring interventions targeted at self-care improve outcomes? Definition: Telemonitoring involves remotely monitoring patients who are not in the same location as the health care provider. Monitoring devices will transmit information on symptoms and/or vital signs via the telephone to a remote monitoring service provider and/or to their 152 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingshealth care provider. Telemedicine is a broader concept that includes patient consultations using telecommunications. Summary of evidence We extracted data from 14 systematic reviews on CVD (heart failure, hypertension and myocardial infarction), diabetes and respiratory disease (asthma and COPD). Among these, one trial was performed in a low or middle income country.1 4 9 26 27 36 49 55 61 69 70 80 85 93 We found no reviews on mobile telephone or telemonitoring interventions among participants with cancer. One trial was performed in LMIC. A review of multidisciplinary interventions among participants with chronic heart failure, some of which included telecare, found all-cause hospital admissions (RR 0.87, 95% 0.95), mortality (RR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.92) and heart failure admission (RR 0.70, 0.61 to 0.81) were all reduced. But it was difficult to identify the role of telemonitoring within these and the comparison groups were poorly described.49 One review, of 25 RCTs in chronic heart failure patients, reviewed structured telephone support (using simple technology) and telemoni - toring (digital/ broadband/satellite/wireless or (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.81) and structured telephone support also reported a non- significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.88, 0.76 to 1.01). Both inter - ventions reduced CHF related hospitalisations: telephone support 0.87) and telemonitoring (RR 0.79, 0.67 to 0.94). Several studies reported improvements in quality of life as well as reduced health care costs and acceptability to patients.55 A systematic review of 22 trials of home BP monitoring compared with clinic monitoring included five trials of telemonitoring. Overall results showed an improvement for systolic BP for home monitor - ing (-2.63mmHg, 95% CI to -1.02) and diastolic to -0.79). Reductions in home BP monitoring-based therapy were greater when telemonitoring was used (five trials) (SMD -3.20 mmHg, -4.66 to -1.73) compared to trials) (SMD -1.26 mmHg, -2.20 -0.31) for systolic BP but not for diastolic BP.1 A review of the role of telemedicine compared with usual care among participants with type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes on HbA1c control reported two trials used a mobile phone, most transmitted blood glucose data, self-management information and insulin dose, two transmitted blood glucose data and self-management information and one only transmitted blood glucose data. Half the studies used advanced signal processing and six displayed blood glucose data. Among nine RCTs there was no significant benefit of telemedicine for HbA1c (WMD -0.11, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.04). 36 153 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease A review of mobile phone interventions among individuals with type 1 or 2 diabetes reported most of the 22 included trials used a mobile phone short message service SMS to deliver blood glucose test results and self-management information among participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The overall result was a small reduction in HbA1c in the intervention group (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.33) over a median of 6 months follow-up. The effect of mobile phone interven - tion did not significantly differ by other participant characteristics or intervention strategies. 61 Six trials were included in a review of interventions incorporating tele-consultation, videoconferencing or videoconferencing combined with tele-consultation in the care of individuals with diabetes. There was little evidence of benefit of these interventions: HbA1c was not reduced with tele-consultation compared with usual care (WMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.24). There was no evidence of heterogeneity. The study also looked at patient satisfaction and other non-clinical out - comes. The benefits of videoconferencing were mainly related to its effects on socioeconomic factors such as education and cost reduc - tion, but also on monitoring disease. Additionally, videoconferencing seemed to maintain quality of care while producing cost savings. 93 A review of 24 studies of mhealth (mobile health technologies) inter - ventions in type 1 and 2 diabetes reported that studies were inconsis - tent, often of poor quality, which negated the evidence for effectiveness.4 A review of 21 studies looked at telecare interventions among par - ticipants with asthma compared with usual care or any other form of control. A range of technologies were included: telephone (n = 9); video conferencing (n = 2); internet (n = 2); other networked communica - tions (n= 6); Short Messaging Service (text) (n = 1); or a combination of text and internet (n = 1). Over a 12-month period, telecare resulted in a non-significant increase in the odds of emergency department visits (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.58) but, over the same period led to a significant reduction in hospitalisations (OR 0.21, 0.07 to 0.61). The effect size was more marked in those with more severe asthma: those managed predominantly in secondary care settings.69 Telemonitoring in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was anal - ysed in a review including six studies, two of which used control groups and two used a before and after design. Four of six studies reported a reduction in hospital admission, but only one of these was a RCT. 9 In a review of telehealthcare among participants with COPD the interventions were: video or telephone links with health care profes - sionals; internet based telecommunication with health care profes - sionals; wired and wireless telemetry for telemonitoring of spirometry (FEV1/FVC), respiratory rate, BP and O2 saturations. In two trials 154 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingstelehealthcare was associated with a non-significant increase in qual - ity of life (MD -6.57, 95% CI -13.62 to 0.48). Telehealthcare also showed significant reductions in emergency department attendances over a 12-month period (OR 0.27, 0.11 to 0.66) and admissions to hospital (OR 0.46, 0.33 to 0.65). There was no significant difference in deaths over the same period (OR 1.05, 0.63 to 1.75).70 In a review of peer support telephone calls for patients with a variety of health problems meta-analysis was not performed. Peer support telephone calls were found to improve uptake of mammograms in women > 40 years. For myocardial infarction patients peer support telephone calls were found to improve diet at six months (54% interven - tion versus 44% usual care, p = 0.03), but no differences in outcomes were found in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. 26 Evidence from 22 lower quality reviews suggested home based inter - ventions, including telephone based interventions, improved quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease. 106 114 123 127 128 137 140 141 144 145 149-152 156 158 162 169 171 173 174 183 In stroke, one review reported home based telerehabilitation showed promising results in improving the health of stroke patients. In COPD, telehealth (telemonitoring and telephone support) reduced rates of hospitalisation and emergency department visits. Eight reviews reported on combined cardiovascular conditions including CVD, heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyper - tension and one review also included respiratory disease (COPD and asthma), which commonly reported improved clinical outcomes. We found no reviews in cancer. In conclusion the expansion of the mobile telephone (cell phone) networks offers a potential route for communication with health care providers.

Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease Question 6: In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-treatment interventions improve outcomes? Definition: Self-treatment intervention includes self-monitoring and adjustment of dosage of medicines by the individual, based on a pre- specified action plan agreed jointly by a health care practitioner / worker and the patient. A situation can occur in NCD management in which the patient could or will alter the doses and/or frequency of the treatment depending upon the change in the nature sever - ity of symptoms and/or biochemical markers of a disease under the guidance of a professional health care provider (e.g. physician) with treatment recommendation. Summary of evidence We extracted data from 12 systematic reviews evaluating self- treatment intervention programmes in cardiovascular disease (oral anticoagulation, chronic heart failure), diabetes, respiratory disease (COPD and asthma), and combined chronic diseases. 8 20 22 30 34 40 41 58 71 79 82 96 We found no reviews of self-care treatment interventions in cancer. Self-management of oral anticoagulation, comprised of self-moni - toring and self- treatment, when compared with usual care showed significant reductions in thromboembolic events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.70) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.55, 0.36 to 0.84); there was no evidence of effect on major haemorrhage (RR 1.12, 0.78 to 1.61).40 In one review, of patients with heart failure, the self-treatment inter - vention groups involved patients who were educated about early rec - ognition of signs and symptoms of heart failure, the importance of pharmacological treatment adherence, daily weighing and changing lifestyle. Comparison was with usual care, or an education package. There was some evidence that self-management reduced all-cause hospital admissions and hospital admissions due to chronic heart failure. However, the trials were heterogeneous and mostly at high risk of bias.30 One review looked at studies testing interventions to increase type 2 diabetes patients' adherence to self-management in terms of require - ments in diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol. Some studies also looked at blood glucose monitoring. The interventions were classified as either educational or behavioural psychosocial interventions. The analysis showed a 0.36% (95% CI 0.21 to 0.51) improvement in glycaemic control. Most studies were assessed as having a high or unclear risk of bias.71 A further review in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes looked at disease management programmes which consisted of patient follow-up 156 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsthat included two or more of the following: patient education, coaching, monitoring, care coordination, and treatment adjustment by a disease manager. Comparison groups were somewhat heterogeneous with varying levels of education and health care worker contact. Among 41 RCTs (over 7,000 participants), disease management programmes resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.29). Programmes in which treatment adjustment was by a dis - ease manager resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c (SMD -0.60 versus -0.28).79 One systematic review examined interventions aiming to improve the delivery of asthma medications by self-management education. Self-management involved self-monitoring by peak expiratory flow or symptoms, together with regular medical review and a written action plan. These self-treatment educational interventions were compared with usual care, which varied between no intervention, education, self-monitoring or regular medical review but not written action plans. Self-management education reduced nocturnal asthma (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.79); hospitalisations (RR 0.64, 0.50 emergency room visits (RR 0.82, 0.73 to 0.94); unscheduled visits to the doctor (RR 0.68, 0.56 to 0.81). Measures of lung function were little changed: SMD for peak flow was 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29 and SMD for FEV1 0.10, -0.02 to 0.22. The trials included in this review were mostly at a high risk of bias.41 A further review of studies comparing asthma self-management using a written action plan based on peak flow expiratory flow with a plan based on symptoms showed no significant effects on emer - gency room visits, hospitalisation and days off work. This review also analysed three studies comparing the asthma self-management with self-adjustment of medications according to an individualised written action plan to medication adjustment by a doctor. For intervention versus control peak flow was improved (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.31) as well as FEV1 (SMD 0.10, -0.05 to 0.25). The evidence, based on studies at high or unclear risk of bias, suggests optimisation of asthma control can be achieved equally as well by self-adjustment with the aid of a written action plan or by regular medical review.82 A review of COPD self-management education interventions found hospital admissions were reduced (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.89), which translates, in patients with a moderate risk of exacerbation into a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10 (6 to 35) and a NNT of 24 (16 to 80) for patients at low risk. 34 In a systematic review of actions plans with minimal or no education for COPD, the action plans gave guidance on self-initiated interventions including medication modification. The use of action plans did not reduce hospitalisation, emergency room visits and increased the use 157 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease of oral corticosteroids over 12 months (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.35). Antibiotic use over 12 months was also increased (MD 0.78, -0.24 to 1.79). There was also no significant difference in knowledge about self-management for exacerbations.96 There were five lower quality reviews.137 138 146 147 167 In oral anticoagu - lation self-management results were consistent with other reviews. In heart failure, one review reported self-management interventions led to increased adherence to prescribed medical advice but with no improvement in functional capacity. In type 2 diabetes, there was low quality evidence that tracking systems for medication use may improve HbA1c.

The research should evaluate risks and benefits, outcomes, cost and quality of life and also acceptability and potential barriers. GRADE tables for question 6 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation tables are presented in Appendix 5. Question 7: In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care education/information programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Education is the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction about a specific aspect of disease whilst information is the knowledge communicated about a particular aspect of a disease. We extracted data from 35 systematic reviews in cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, hypertension and stroke), diabetes, 158 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsrespiratory disease (asthma and COPD), cancer and combined chronic diseases.2 5-7 10 15 24 29 31-34 38 42-44 50 52 54 57 60 62-64 68 74 75 77 88-90 94 97 99 100 One review of the impact of psychoeducation programmes among people with coronary heart disease comprised of interventions deliv - ered by trained health care professional, group or individual based, conducted in the home or community or as part of a cardiac rehabili - tation programme. The comparison was with exercise only, standard cardiac rehabilitation or medical care. Psychoeducational interven - tions produced a significant positive effect on physical activity levels over the medium term (six to 12 months) when compared with exercise and risk factor education (SMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.94). There was little change in smoking and dietary behaviour. The studies were mostly at high or unclear risk of bias.2 A review of psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation in patients with coronary heart disease found that there was a positive effect on abstinence (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.22). The interventions were either stand-alone smoking cessation interventions or ones which were included in more comprehensive rehabilitation programmes. They consisted of behavioural therapeutic interventions, phone sup - port and self-help material. Comparison was with usual care, which varied between studies. Long-term data on whether quitting smoking was maintained were not available.5 A systematic review investigated a range of psychological inter - ventions for coronary heart disease. There was little evidence that psychological interventions reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05). Psychological interventions in a smaller number of studies reporting cardiac mortality showed a small positive effect (RR 0.80, 0.64 to 1.00). Psychological interventions resulted in small to moderate improvements in depression (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.03).99 One systematic review focussed on the effects of information provi - sion among stroke patients (and their caregivers), including 21 RCTs of which nine included active information delivery interventions (lec - tures, home visits, or multi-component interventions) and 12 included only passive information provision (leaflets, in some cases tailored to the participant).38 Overall the risk of bias was moderately high and the high heterogeneity prevented pooling thus limiting the ability to draw conclusions. From subgroups of studies, there was mixed evidence as to whether anxiety or depression was reduced by information provi - sion, and no evidence of reduction in mortality. In a review of 17 studies of the evidence on interventions to increase self-efficacy among participants after stroke, which included four RCTs, the interventions were highly varied, and meta-analysis was 159 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease not performed. Four self-efficacy interventions were identified; the evidence for the effects of these interventions was inconclusive.57 A review of interventions to improve the control of BP among par - ticipants with hypertension included a range of interventions, some of which were educational interventions directed towards the patient. Trials were heterogeneous but appeared unlikely to be associated with large net reductions in BP by themselves (WMD systolic BP -0.57 mmHg, mmHg, 0.07 to 0.86).134 A review of dietary interventions in hypertensive patients showed that body weight and BP were reduced in patients assigned to weight loss diets as compared to controls. The interventions were dietary education and direction, such as advising caloric restrictions or reduc - tion in fat intake, and were compared with no interventions aiming to reduce body weight. Comparing intervention with control, body weight was reduced (WMD -3.98kg, 95% CI -4.79 to -3.17) over 6 months to three years. In addition, there was evidence that BP was reduced (WMD -4.5 mmHg, -7.2 to -1.8 mm mmHg, -4.8 to -1.5 mmHg).89 Systematic reviews of type 2 diabetes education or information pro - grammes demonstrated variable results and reported only modest reductions in clinically relevant outcomes. Most of the evidence avail - able for these reviews were derived from studies at high risk of bias. Group based educational interventions compared with usual care or remaining on the waiting list for the intervention, delivered modest reductions in HbA1c and reduced the need for diabetes medications. At four to six months follow-up, HbA1c was reduced by -1.35 (95% CI -1.93 to -0.78). At 12 to 14 follow-up, this reduction was -0.82 ( -0.99 to -0.65). There was also evidence of reduced need for diabetes medication, based on five RCTs with 654 participants.29 There was limited, inconsistent evidence that education on foot care could reduce foot ulceration or amputation. This systematic review examined 12 studies, of which three studies described the effect of foot care education compared with usual care, two studies examined the effect of tailored foot care educational needs compared with no intervention and seven studies described the effect of intensive versus brief educational interventions. The studies were too heterogeneous to allow meta-analysis, and the results were inconsistent and overall too limited to draw conclusions from. 31 A second review evaluating face-to-face education showed no improvement; however, in a subgroup analysis of patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels there was some evidence of modest benefit. In studies comparing individual face-to-face education to usual care, 160 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsindividual education did not significantly improve HBA1c (WMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.08) over 12 to 18 months. In this same review, a com - parison of individual education with group based education detected no difference in the effects of these interventions.33 Evidence for educational interventions among people with diabetic kidney disease was limited and inconclusive. The systematic review identified only two trials, with low to moderate methodological quality, and more data are needed.60 There was limited and inconclusive evidence on the effect of edu - cational interventions focussed on weight loss among type 2 diabe - tes patients: only modest weight loss was achieved, and comparison groups also often achieved weight loss. This systematic review identi - fied 22 RCTs of weight loss or weight control interventions, via dietary, physical activity or behavioural strategies, compared with either usual care, similar interventions at lower intensity, or any other weight loss or weight control intervention; thus, the comparisons were not con - sistent. Among 585 participants, any weight loss intervention led to a reduction WMD -1.72kg (95% CI -3.15 to -0.29) in weight, equivalent to 3.1% of average baseline body weight. Changes in HbA1c usually corresponded to changes in body weight and were not significant when between-group differences were examined.75 One review examined the impact of interventions aimed at improv - ing adherence to treatment recommendations. In nine studies HbA1c was improved (WMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.25). Most of the studies examined by the systematic reviews on this topic were at high or unclear risk of bias and sample sizes were frequently small.94 A review of limited asthma education found it did not significantly reduce hospitalisations (WMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.03) but did reduce emergency department visits (WMD -2.76, -4.34 to -1.18).42 A further review examined the evidence for mite control measures among people with house dust mite sensitive asthma. Thirty-seven trials assessed physical methods including mattress encasings (26 trials). Ten trials examined chemical methods and eight trials involved a combination of both. Compared with usual care, there was little evidence of benefit of the interventions. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of patients who improved (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27).44 In a review of trials of breathing exercises for participants with asthma five trials compared breathing retraining with no active control and two with asthma education control groups. Comparing intervention with control, rescue bronchodilator use was lower WMD -5.82 (95% CI -8.70 to FEV1 was no different WMD -0.19 (-0.70 to 0.31) and daily peak flow improved WMD 72 Litres (30.15 to 113.85). 161 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease Overall, benefits of breathing exercises were found in isolated outcome measures across single studies.50 In a review of studies of relaxation therapies among participants with asthma, the interventions included progressive relaxation, hypno - therapy or autogenic training. Comparison group interventions varied widely from assertiveness training, sitting quietly, placebo relaxation method and listening to relaxing music. Two of five RCTs reported benefits of progressive muscle relaxation or mental and muscular relaxation. One RCT investigating hypnotherapy, one of autogenic training, and two of biofeedback techniques revealed no therapeutic effects. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was poor. There was no evidence of benefit of psychological interventions among asthma patients from a review of 12 RCTs with 384 participants, which compared psychological interventions with some form of control intervention. No meta-analysis could be performed due to the diversity of interventions and the outcomes assessed and overall there was no evidence to show benefit of psychological interventions. 54 A systematic review of the role of COPD-specific patient education compared with usual care, the intervention amongst 10 RCTs included various education delivery methods and settings. No meta-analysis was possible due to study heterogeneity. Self-management education tended to reduce hospital admissions, and tended to decrease costs associated with GP visits, but overall, there was insufficient evidence that increased knowledge leads to better self-care in COPD.7 A further review of self-management education interventions for COPD patients found that the probability of hospital admissions was reduced with these interventions (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.89), which translated into a NNT of 10 (6 to 35) for patients with a moderate risk of exacerbation, and a NNT of 24 (16 to 80) for patients with a low risk of exacerbation.34 A systematic review of the provision of pain management of cancer patients was identified. Six studies gave estimates suggesting reduced pain in the intervention group: pain interference: for worst pain: (SMD 0.22, -0.20 to 0.64). It was not possible to isolate the results for studies targeting family/community from patients alone.24 Another review of educational interventions on cancer pain identified four RCTs using information, behavioural instructions via verbal, writ - ten or recorded audio-visual messages. Outcomes assessed included pain and pain intensity, quality of life scores such as functional status, perceived pain control, well-being and anxiety. The comparator was either usual care or a less intensive educational intervention such as a leaflet being given. These studies were heterogeneous in participant group, the type and delivery method of the intervention, outcome 162 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsassessment and all were at moderate risk of bias. There was very little consistent evidence of benefit of the educational interventions on pain or quality of life scores.62 A review of psychosocial interventions to reduce cancer pain, which pooled data from 37 RCTs, reported reductions in pain and interfer - ence by pain among those receiving the interventions. Interventions comprised skills training, cognitive-behavioural therapy, relaxation, hypnosis, and conditioning cues; the comparator was usually usual care. Study quality was typically low. For pain severity, the weighted average effect was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.46) and relative risk for pain interference was 0.40 (0.21 to 0.60) among the intervention compared with usual care.88 Limited, inconsistent evidence on self-management education among breast cancer patients suggested no benefit on quality of life or anxiety.74 A review of pelvic floor muscle training among men who have had radical prostatectomy, reported that one trial of 300 men found that training improved continence rates; men receiving biofeedback-enhanced training were more likely to achieve continence or have no continual leakage than those with no training within one to two months, but that the relative benefit increase was no longer significant after three to four months. Biofeedback enhanced pelvic floor muscle training was comparable to written or verbal pelvic floor muscle train - ing instruction. Extracorporeal magnetic innervation and electrical stimulation were found to be initially (within one to two months) more effective than pelvic floor muscle training in one trial, but there were no significant differences between groups at three or more months. 64 In chronic diseases, general advice and education interventions had limited effects. One review looked at studies of single risk factor inter - ventions to promote physical activity among patients with chronic diseases, compared with usual care. Three trials were identified: one looked at general practitioners' prescription; counselling by practice nurses; and distribution of an education leaflet. A second examined advice about becoming more active and an eight week follow-up includ - ing visits with the health care provider and two booster telephone calls from a counsellor in physical activity. The third looked at material and medical advice encouraging more physical activity and to man - age their hypertension better, supplemented with a self-help booklet. Two studies reported that the interventions evaluated had no effect on level of physical activity. One study reported a short-term increase in physical activity levels with use of an intensive intervention that was based on the theory of planned behaviour and integrated nurses into the general practitioner counselling process. 52 163 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease A further review investigated self-management education pro - grammes across a range of chronic diseases. Interventions involving face-to-face contact were associated with better outcomes. No other trial characteristics were associated with improved outcomes. Among diabetic patients, comparing education with usual care reduced HbA1c by 0.45% (95% CI 0.17 to 0.74), reduced systolic BP by 0.20mmHg (0.01 to 0.39), but did not significantly reduce diastolic BP (0.10 mmHG, -0.06 to 0.26 mmHg). Among participants with asthma, comparing education with usual care reduced asthma attacks: log rate ratio was 0.59 (95% CI 0.35-0.83). In a meta-regression, interventions involving face-to-face contact were associated with better outcomes; no other intervention characteristics were associated with improved outcomes.97 Thirty-six lower quality reviews were found in the following dis - ease areas: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease and cancer.101 105 107-113 115 118 120 122 124-126 129 130 132 133 135 142 143 153 155 157 160 164 165 175 176 178 180 185-187 Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 7.1 Group education programmes, rather than individual education, may offer a cost effective strategy to deliver education in LMIC. Weak Very low Research recommendations None GRADE tables for question 7 are presented in Appendix 4. The evidence-to-recommendation table is presented in Appendix 5. Question 8: In patients with non-communicable diseases do self-care rehabilitation programmes improve outcomes? Definition: Rehabilitation therapy aims to improve function that has been lost or diminished by disease. Rehabilitation programmes may incorporate exercise and/or information after an event such as a myo - cardial infarction. Rehabilitation is used among patients after interventions such as coronary angioplasty, heart surgery, or after stroke, in patients with chronic heart failure or respiratory problems. It consists of exercise training, usually combined with counselling and advice. The aim is to reduce the risk of future problems, help patients understand their condition, and help patients make lifestyle changes to support better health. Where the patient undertakes exercise by themself, this is self-care. As in all areas of self-care, the model is that health care 164 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsprofessionals deliver the education and training to the individual, and the individual may then take on more responsibility and autonomously perform the intervention. In practice, the ability of individuals to self- care during rehabilitation will vary and it will not be appropriate for all individuals. It is also essential that the programme be performed in the context of advice and support from health care professionals. The presented reviews examine various facets of these interventions. Summary of evidence We identified 13 reviews. 3 12 13 18 23 25 28 48 56 72 83 91 95 A review of home based rehabilitation versus centre based rehabili - tation reported across the 12 included trials. The components of the interventions varied. Home based was not better than centre based for systolic BP (WMD 0.58mmHg, 95% CI -3.29 to 4.44) and for total cholesterol (WMD -0.13mmol/L, -0.31 to 0.05). There was no differ - ence in mortality for home based versus centre based (RR 1.31, 0.65 to 2.66). 25 In terms of exercise based interventions either alone or as a compo - nent of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation, there was no significant difference in pooled mortality between groups in the 13 trials with less than one year follow-up.28 There was a non-significant a reduction in pooled mortality in the four trials with more than one year follow-up (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07). Home based exercise programmes comprising aerobic exercise with or without resistance exercise compared to usual care or usual activity among individuals with chronic heart failure,18 led to an increased six minute walking distance WMD 41 metres (95% CI 19 to 63) and peak VO2 WMD 2.71 ml/kg/min (0.7 to 4.7). Home based exercise did not significantly increase hospitalisation rates (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.92) more than usual activity. A review of the efficacy of physical fitness training for patients after stroke compared with no intervention, a non-exercise intervention or usual care reported trials were heterogeneous in outcomes, and in quality, and data pooling was difficult. There were no data on mortality or hospitalizations. Training involving walking had a positive effect with the mean maximum walking speed improving by 8.66 metres per minute, (95% CI 2.98 to 14.34). The effects were retained at the end of follow-up. Resistance training did not report sufficient data to assess its effects whilst the effects of physical training on mortality and disability were not clear.12 One review looked at the effectiveness of therapy based rehabilitation interventions delivered more than one year after stroke. There was insufficient evidence to form conclusions as to whether interventions 165 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease delivered more than one year after stroke could bring benefits to patients after stroke.3 One review investigated interventions specifically targeted at upper limb function among participants who had a stroke. Included studies each comprised a therapy programme with several treatment inter - ventions, involving various exercise and task performance. Primary outcomes were activities of daily living and functional movement of the upper limb as primary outcomes. Four RCTs including 166 participants were identified, comparing interventions with usual care or another intervention, and overall there was no evidence of improvement in the primary outcomes. Currently there are not enough data to support the use of home based therapy focussing on upper limb function, and more research is needed.23 In a review of 12 RCTs of pulmonary care rehabilitation in COPD, two RCTs and eight studies compared home based rehabilitation to standard care (no pulmonary rehabilitation); three studies compared home based rehabilitation to hospital care and one study made both comparisons. The methodological quality of the included studies was low to moderate and meta-analysis was not performed. Most studies showed increased quality of care and exercise capacity with home based pulmonary care rehabilitation compared with no pulmonary rehabilitation. There was no evidence of differences in outcomes for home based compared with hospital based rehabilitation. 95 Another recent review of pulmonary care rehabilitation among those with COPD focussed on those recently experiencing a hospital admis - sion for a COPD exacerbation. Nine RCTs compared an intervention delivered in the community with usual care and assessed hospital admissions, as well as mortality, health related quality of life and exercise capacity. There was good evidence from trials at moderate risk of bias that pulmonary care rehabilitation substantially reduced hospital admissions over six months (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.58), and mortality over a two year period (OR 0.28, 0.10 to 0.84).83 One review investigating the role of rehabilitation among participants who had previously completed treatment for cancer (not including the terminally ill or those under hospice care) was identified.72 The review focussed on whether exercise interventions could improve quality of life. 40 RCTs randomizing 3,694 participants were included, with an exercise intervention such as strength training, resistance train - ing, walking, cycling or yoga. These were compared to usual care or another, non-exercise, intervention, and health related quality of life was assessed using a variety of measures. The trials were heteroge - neous in design, exercise intervention and outcome measures and most were at high risk of bias. There was some weak evidence of benefit but the lack of consistency and wide confidence intervals means that 166 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsmore high quality data are needed before such interventions can be recommended.

Question 9: In patients with non-communicable diseases do interventions targeted at adherence improve outcomes? Definition: Patient adherence has been defined as the extent to which a person's behaviour - taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes - corresponds with agreed recommenda - tions from a health care provider. Summary of evidence Evidence was provided from five systematic reviews, three among participants with diabetes and three in combined chronic diseases.46 66 71 86 94 A review of studies testing interventions to increase the adherence of patients with type 2 diabetes to self-management requirements in diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol reported an improvement in HbA1c of PMD 0.36% (95% CI 0.21 to 0.51). Most studies were assessed as having a high or unclear risk of bias.71 Another review examined the impact of interventions aimed at improving adherence to treatment recommendations.94 In nine stud - ies HbA1c was reduced MD -0.49 (95% CI -0.73 to -0.25).167 III. Self-care of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease In a review of the role of reminder packaging in adherence to tak - ing medications, interventions included a reminder system for the day of the week or the time that the medication was to be taken, and formed part of the packaging. 66 Trials of reminders that were separate to the intervention (such as a mailed or SMS reminder) were excluded. Packaging aids were included irrespective of whether the medication required a prescription or not. Trials of over-the-counter medications or vitamin supplements were included. Injected, topical or inhaled medicines, and co-packaged or fixed-dose combinations were included, as long as the packaging included a reminder system. Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken: MD 0.11 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.17), BP, MD -5.89 mmHg (-6.70 to -5.09). (-1.01 mmHg, to (MD -0.72, -0.83 to -0.60). In one study, the presence of a reminder packaging aid was preferred by patients with low literacy levels. A further review reported a broad range of interventions targeted at improving adherence to medications.46 The majority of effective inter - ventions for chronic diseases were complex in nature. They included combinations of more convenient care, information, reminders, self- monitoring, reinforcement, counselling, family therapy, psychological therapy, crisis intervention, manual telephone follow-up, and sup - portive care. However, they did not lead to large improvement in adherence. This finding was confirmed by a second review.86 In one lower quality review a wide variety of strategies in chronic disease seemingly improve medication adherence, with no single strategy appearing to be the best.172 Recommendations No. Recommendation Strength of recommendationQuality of evidence 9.1 Strategies to improve adherence should form part of self-care for NCDs.

Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? Costing Tool - User Guide References: Scaling Up Action against Noncommunicable Diseases: How Much Will It Cost?, World Health Organization, 2011 Costing Tool - User Guide , World Health Organization, 2012170 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsSummary This paper describes a new financial planning tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assist low- and middle income-countries in scaling up a core set of interventions to tackle noncom - municable diseases (NCDs), such as heart disease and stroke, diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease. NCDs currently kill 36 million people per year, and the burden con - tinues to escalate, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These countries often lack resources and capacity to tackle these diseases, and therefore need to adopt an incremental approach as they move to address the gaps in NCD prevention and control. To prevent disability and death, it will be important to act on two levels - through population-wide measures to reduce exposure to risk factors such as tobacco use, and through interventions targeting individuals who already have NCDs or are at high risk for develop - ing them. A wide range of health interventions is available for both purposes. One challenge is to assess which interventions will bring the most benefit for the lowest cost - in other words, what are the 'best buys'. A further challenge is to assess the cost of their scaled-up implementation. The WHO tool aims to help countries make that assessment. It is a tool for financial planning (over the period 2011-2025) that can be used to forecast resource needs at national and sub-national levels. The tool can enhance traditional budgeting mechanisms in countries and provide new information to development agencies about the resources needed to tackle the growing burden of NCDs. The tool has been used to produce a 'price tag' for a combined set of population-based and individual-level 'best buy' NCD interventions that have been identified as priority actions by WHO. The average yearly cost for all low- and middle-income countries is estimated to be US$ 11.4 billion (an overall cost of US$ 170 billion over the period 2011-2025). The cost per head of population is low. It represents an annual investment of under US$ 1 in low-income countries, US$ 1.50 in lower middle-income countries; and US$ 3 in upper middle-income countries. Expressed as a proportion of current health spending, the cost of implementing such a package amounts to 4% in low-income countries, 2% in lower middle-income countries and less than 1% in upper middle-income countries. Population-based best buy interventions address tobacco and harm - ful alcohol use, as well as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity in 171 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? low- and middle-income countries. The cost for these approaches US$ 2 billion yearly. In low-income and lower middle-income countries, the median cost per head of population amounts to less than US$ 0.20 per year, while for upper-middle income countries the median value is close to US$ 0.50. These amounts represent less than 1% of total per capita spending on health. Individual-based best buy interventions are delivered in primary health care settings and include, for example, counselling and drug therapy for persons with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, plus measures to prevent cervical cancer. For these interventions the cost averages more than US$ 10 billion yearly. Over the scale-up period 2011-2025, the annual cost per head of population falls below US$ 1 in low-income countries, less than US$ 1.50 in lower-middle income countries and averages US$ 2.50 in upper-middle income countries. Note: It is important to mention that the tool used for this study required a number of data sources and assumptions to be made about which interventions are scaled up, at what pace and to what level of coverage. These may not coincide with a particular country's inten - tions or health system capacities and not all countries will agree with the various assumptions used to develop the estimates of costs of the interventions package reported in this document. However, the tool has been developed in such a way that it can be used by country investigators to estimate costs based on their specfic epidemiolgical, economic and political contexts as well as their policies and capacity of their national programmes in implementing the key prevention and control measures.172 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings1. Introduction 1.1 Policy context and rationale Concern is growing about the escalating global burden of noncom - municable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases. The concern is not just epidemiological but also economic. NCDs, which are often accompa - nied by long-standing disabilities, have a direct economic impact on households and communities, both through the uptake of health ser - vices and goods that diverts expenditure, but also on levels of income or labour productivity (Abegunde et al. 2007; WHO, 2005). Despite the scale of these adverse consequences, NCDs have been neglected in international health and development initiatives. UN A/64/265 resolution 'Prevention and control of noncommunicable dis - eases' (UN, 2010) provides a high-level political mandate to develop an international policy framework for the prevention and control of NCDs. Key to this strategy is the generation of evidence on effective interventions that are affordable for developing regions. There is growing evidence for and consensus about interventions that can tackle the leading NCDs and their underlying risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol (WHO, 2011a). On a population level, these measures include reducing consumption of tobacco, alcohol and salt; improving aware - ness of healthy lifestyles; increasing excise and tobacco taxes and enhancing regulation. Interventions for individuals focus on preven - tion and treatment e.g. primary and secondary prevention of heart disease and stroke, as well as early detection, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up for cancers, diabetes, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (WHO, 2010a). Part of the evidence for increasing investment and implementation of priority interventions is economic. Cost-effectiveness information can help identify which interventions offer greatest value for money. Many economic studies have been conducted on NCD prevention and control, but a large proportion of these studies are from high-income countries, making comparisons and generalization problematic. However, a small sub-set of comparative analyses have been carried out for low- and middle-income countries, mainly through the Disease Control Priori - ties project (www.dcp2.org) and WHO's CHOICE programme (www. who.int/choice), which provide a sufficient, if imperfect, evidence base for setting priorities in these contexts (see Appendix 1c). 173 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? Along with evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policy and treatment options, information is needed on their feasibil - ity, affordability and acceptability. Some work has been conducted on the costs of scaling up NCD interventions, such as population-based strategies to reduce tobacco use and dietary salt intake, plus combina - tion drug therapy for people at elevated risk of a cardiovascular event within the next 10 years (estimated for 23 large, low- and middle- income countries for the period 2006-2015) (Asaria al. 2007; Lim et al. 2007). Cost-effective NCD interventions have been proposed at a WHO meeting for individuals in resource-constrained settings (WHO 2010a). More recently, the Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010 provided concrete recommendations on cost-effective interventions that are affordable in all countries - actions that should be undertaken immediately to accelerate results in terms of lives saved, diseases prevented, and costs avoided (WHO, 2011a). Feasibility and costing studies have also been conducted using a primary health care approach in resource-constrained settings (Mendis et al. 2010; Soliman et al. 2010; Ndindjock et al. 2011; Mendis et al. 2011). What has been missing is a complete estimate of the costs of scaling up a core set of effective population-based and individual health-care interventions for NCDs and their major risk factors. This gap has rep - resented a serious impediment to resource mobilization and financial planning at global and national levels. The current study has been carried out with a view to addressing it. 1.2 Scope, purpose and objectives The aim was to develop a financial planning tool for scaling up delivery of a set of cost-effective population-based and individual-level health care interventions in low- and middle-income countries. This tool can be used to forecast financial resource needs at national or sub- national level and also to generate a price tag at global level. It will enhance traditional budgeting mechanisms in countries and provide information to development agencies and international institutions on the resources needed to address the growing burden of NCDs. The tool does not, however, assess the health impact or effects of interventions as a result of scaling-up, nor is it a cost-effectiveness evaluation tool. Initial development of the tool was a collaboration between the Non - communicable Disease and Mental Health (NMH) and Health Systems and Services (HSS) Clusters at WHO headquarters in Geneva. NMH holds the policy brief in this area and provided information for the intervention package and evidence-based protocols; HSS provided expertise in costing methods and tool development. Throughout this process, institutional partners were consulted to obtain country-level data and advice on the content and structure of the tool.174 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsThe impetus for this project is the UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs in September 2011. The deliverables are: Construction of a resource needs/costing tool Generation of a multi-country database containing values for all model parameters Documentation of methods and results, including an estimate of the cost of implementation of the NCD intervention package, based on the 'best buys' interventions recommended in WHO's Global Status report 2010. The tool requires a number of data sources. Assumptions have thus been made regarding the interventions being scaled up, pace of scale- up and level of coverage achieved. These may not coincide with a particular country's intentions or health system capacities. The tool has therefore been developed in such a way that it can be readily used by country investigators, and adapted to the specfic epidemiolgical, economic and political context.175 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? 2. Methods 2.1 Principles and practice of costing the scale-up of health services The NCD costing tool is based on a methodology used to derive global price tags for scaling up interventions related to the Millennium Devel - opment Goals (MDGs), including HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and child health (see for example Johns et al. 2007; Kiszewski et al. 2007; Stenberg et al. 2007). These methods have also been applied to NCDs and mental health (Asaria et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2007; Chisholm et al. 2007), including an estimation of the costs and effects of scaling up strategies to reduce tobacco use and dietary salt intake, plus combination drug therapy for individuals at elevated risk of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event. Principles underlying the methodology are summarized in Box 1. The purpose is to identify the actual budgetary resources needed to implement efficient policies, as opposed to assessment of the economic value of resources used in an intervention, which might also include resources that have no financial value, such as voluntary care. In short, the methods and purpose of a costing tool are not the same as those of a cost-effectiveness tool. Box 1. Costing principles Financial versus economic costing: Costs reflect actual expendi - tures that need to be mobilized - from a broadly defined health-sys - tem perspective. Financial costs incurred but not usually paid for by the health system, notably travel costs of patients and families, are not included. Costs such as travel time and lost productivity, which have an economic if not a financial value, were likewise excluded. Total versus incremental costing: The total cost for a given year is calculated for the entire population in need at the specified level of coverage, and is not adjusted for existing expenditures. For incremental costing, it is assumed that expenditure associated with current interventions continues to be made available. This means that only resources and expenditures required above cur - rent spending levels are included. 176 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsSeparate costing of variable and fixed costs: Variable costs, including treatment, depend on the number of patients in need and the projected level of coverage. By contrast, capital costs (e.g. equipment and buildings) do not vary with each patient treated. In addition, programme costs incurred above the level of service delivery, such as district or national training and supervision, were estimated, including assessment of the capacity of each country's current health system to manage and monitor scale-up. Use of country-specific data: Prices for 'non-traded' goods and need for services may vary greatly among countries, so country- specific data should be used to build costing estimates. The cost of scaling up an intervention can be determined by using the following parameters: population (of the country or region) prevalence and incidence (of the disease or risk factor in question) coverage (the proportion of population in need that is exposed to or receiving the intervention) resource quantities (needed to implement the intervention; e.g. human resources, medicines, equipment) prices or unit costs (for each resource item or entity; e.g. salaries, drug prices). Box 2. Example of how to estimate the cost of scaling-up an intervention A 20% rate of prevalence of smoking in an adult population of one million would yield a target population in need of 200 000 individu - als. All these individuals could benefit from a brief intervention offered in primary care that, say, costs US$1 per treated case to deliver. If coverage of the brief intervention was currently only 10%, the total annual cost for delivering the intervention would be US$20 000 (200 000 times US$1 times 10%); once scaled up to a higher desired level of coverage (such as 50%), the total cost will have increased five-fold to US$100 000. The difference between the current and target level of coverage gives the incremental cost of scaling-up the intervention (a total of US$80 000). Total or incremental costs can be divided by the total number of people in the population to give a cost per capita (in this instance, the annual cost per capita would rise from US$ 0.02 to US$ 0.10, an increment of US$0.08).177 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? Multiplication of the first two parameters (population times preva - lence) defines the population at risk or in need, while multiplication of the final two parameters (resource use times price) provides the cost per case treated or person exposed to the intervention. The remaining parameter, coverage, provides the main mechanism by which scale-up takes place over time. Box 2 illustrates how these different parameters contribute to estimating the costs of scaling up. Analytical steps require: definition of the intervention package estimation of the current intervention versus levels of need and coverage in the population calculation of the year-on-year resource costs required over a speci - fied period to reach desired coverage. The tool can produce estimates of total and incremental costs of scaled up provision, broken down by: category of intervention (e.g. population-wide interventions versus individual health-care interventions); cost category (e.g. human resources, physical capital) activity (e.g. regulation versus individual treatment) time (e.g. costs at five and 10 years). The tool will allow country users to change default values, timelines or scale-up patterns. As mentioned earlier, the purpose of the tool is to aid financial planning for scaling up interventions that have been prioritized: it is not a cost-effectiveness or priority-setting tool. 2.2 Selection of diseases, risk factors and intervention strategies Selection of diseases (and risk factors) A critical question to address in a costing exercise is its scope: which diseases, risk factors and interventions are to be included. The reference point adopted for this study is the 2008-2013 Action Plan for the WHO Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (WHO, 2008a), which focuses on four diseases: cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. These diseases are responsible for the majority of deaths caused by NCDs (Figure 1) and are largely caused by four shared behavioural risk factors: tobacco use, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet. Prevention of renal disease is included within the analytical framework through its link to CVD and 178 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsdiabetes, as is the prevention of alcoholic liver disease via reduction in harmful use of alcohol. By restricting analysis to these diseases and risk factors, other NCD conditions that account for a significant portion of the global burden of disease, such as other renal and liver diseases, gastrointestinal dis - eases, neurological diseases (other than stroke) and mental disorders, have been excluded. It will be important to bear this in mind when considering results. In the case of mental disorders, estimates of the cost of scaling up interventions have already been made for low- and middle-income resource settings (Chisholm et al. 2007). Figure 1. Distribution of global NCD by cause of death, both sexes (Source: WHO, 2008b) Selection of interventions for prioritized scale-up Many interventions exist for prevention and control of NCDs. Even the wealthiest countries, however, have to make choices about which of these are implemented, because resources for health are finite - and in most countries, very limited. A number of criteria inform these deci - sions, including the current and projected burden of diseases (or their underlying risk factors, such as tobacco use), the cost-effectiveness, fairness and feasibility of implementing interventions and political considerations1. 1 Cost-effectiveness summarizes the efficiency with which an intervention produces health outcomes. A 'highly cost-effective' intervention is defined as one that gen - erates an extra year of healthy life (equivalent to averting one disability-adjusted life year) for a cost that falls below the average annual income or gross domestic product (GDP) per person in the country or region in question.Other NCDs 16%Diabetes mellitus 3% Cardiovascular diseases 48% IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? In preparation for the 2011 UN High-level meeting on NCDs, WHO has identified a set of evidence-based 'best buy' interventions that meet these criteria (WHO, 2011a; WHO, 2011b). A best buy is a concept that extends beyond economic efficiency or cost-effectiveness. It is an intervention with compelling evidence for cost-effectiveness that is also feasible, low-cost and appropriate to implement within the constraints of the local health system. Interventions that do not meet all of these criteria - but which offer good value and have other attri - butes that recommend their use - can be characterized as 'good buys'. Policy-makers can consider best buys as a core set of interventions for priority scale-up, and good buys as an expanded set of interventions to be made available when resources allow. Appendices 1a and 1b provide summary tables of interventions identified as best buys after the application of priority-setting crite - ria (avoidable burden, cost-effectiveness, implementation cost and feasibility). Appendix 1c provides data sources used for populating the cost-effectiveness dimension. Table 1 provides a summary list of two categories of interventions: population-based measures address - ing NCD risk factors; and individual-based interventions addressing NCDs within the context of primary care. Table 1. Summary of interventions included in the core scaling-up costing scenario Core intervention set: Best buys Population-based interventions addressing NCD risk factors Tobacco use: Tax increases; smoke-free indoor workplaces and public places; health information and warnings about tobacco; bans on advertising and promotion Harmful alcohol use: Tax increases on alcoholic beverages; comprehensive restrictions and bans on alcohol marketing; restrictions on the availability of retailed alcohol Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity: Salt reduction through mass media campaigns and reduced salt content in processed foods; replacement of trans-fats with polyunsaturated fats; public awareness programme about diet and physical activity Individual-based Interventions addressing NCDs in primary care Cancer: Prevention of liver cancer through hepatitis B immunization; prevention of cervical cancer through screening (visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA]) and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions CVD and diabetes: Multi-drug therapy (including glycaemic control for diabetes mellitus) to individuals who have had a heart attack or stroke, and to persons with a high risk (> 30%) of a CVD event in the next 10 years; providing aspirin to people having an acute heart attack This set of NCD best buy interventions forms the basis of the cost analysis presented here. 180 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings2.3 Assessment of epidemiological need and intervention coverage Identification of the population in need Comparable country-specific estimates of the prevalence of tobacco use, obesity and insufficient physical inactivity were drawn from the Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010 (WHO, 2011a). Estimates of the prevalence of harmful alcohol use were derived by triangulating aggregate adult per capita consumption with multi-country survey data on the distribution of alcohol use (by age and sex), using a statistical model developed by Rehm et al. (2010). The prevalence of tobacco use, high blood pressure, raised choles - terol and raised blood glucose was also used to estimate - by age and sex - the proportion of the population at varying levels of total risk of experiencing a (fatal or non-fatal) CVD event during the next 10 years. WHO sub-regional values from the Comparative Risk Assessment study (WHO, 2009) were used to generate disaggregated estimates of risk exposure by age and sex, which are unavailable at country level. Rates of incidence or prevalence for CVD, diabetes, cancers and respiratory disorders were taken from WHO regional estimates produced by the Global Burden of Disease study (WHO, 2008b). Scale-up period and country selection The period of scaling up was set at 2011-2025, which is consistent with the set of targets indicators that are being drawn up for consideration by WHO Member States. The focus of analysis was on low- and middle- income countries but the tool can also be used in high-income countries. Analysis was carried out for 42 low- and middle-income countries (each with more than 20 million people). These account for 90% of the NCD burden in developing regions of the world, and 77% of the global NCD burden. The 42 countries were grouped by income, as shown in Table 2. Estimates of total costs for all low- and middle- income countries were approximated by multiplying results for the 42 countries - which account for 90% of the population in developing regions - by a factor of 1.11 (100% / 90%). Table 2. Low- and middle-income countries included in the analysis Low-income countries (13)Afghanistan; Bangladesh; C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; Democratic IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? Coverage levels and scale-up patterns To calculate the additional resources required to reach the 2025 target, current coverage rates need to be established. For most strategies and countries included in the analysis, intervention-specific data on current effective coverage are not available. What is known, however, is that current effective intervention coverage is very low. Even for tobacco control, analysis has demonstrated that - with the exception of monitoring - the world's population covered by demand reduction measures of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2008 was below 10% (WHO, 2011a). The exception to this is hepatitis B immunization, for which country- specific data collated by WHO and UNICEF indicate high levels of (third-dose) coverage (WHO, 2010b). In 33 of the 42 countries in this study, coverage already exceeds 80%. Accordingly, expenditures for this intervention do not pose an additional resource requirement - except in the few countries where coverage continues to fall below this high coverage level. For all other best buy individual interventions delivered in primary care settings, a default rate of 5% was adopted for current coverage. The target coverage level for these interventions was set at 80% for 2025. Individual countries may choose to adopt different target cov - erage levels when applying the model, depending on their policies, plans and resources. The pace at which countries are able to scale up services also dif - fers according to prevailing levels of infrastructure, human resource capacity and financial security as well as other competing priorities. Figure 2 illustrates three distinct patterns of scale-up, which were applied to countries as follows: exponential scale-up (used for low-income countries): after an ini - tial slow degree of health system development, coverage speeds up exponentially as the target year approaches s-curve scale-up (used for lower middle-income countries): after a brief period of slow expansion, coverage escalates at a linear rate front-growth scale-up (used for upper middle-income countries): this pattern assumes that much of the capacity to scale up is already in place, meaning that coverage can escalate rapidly within the short to medium term. For population-based measures (such as changes in fiscal policy, new regulations or mass media campaigns), a different approach was required. For these interventions, four stages of policy implementation were used to identify resource needs over time: planning stage (Year 1)182 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings policy development (Year 2) partial implementation (Years 3-5) full implementation (Year 6 onwards) For countries with low levels of policy implementation, it was assumed that all stages of policy implementation would need to take place; for the very few countries already operating at a high level, only the resource costs of sustaining full implementation were included. The current performance of countries with respect to tobacco control policy was assessed using data collated as part of the WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic (WHO, 2011c), which contains country- specific scores for each of the MPOWER package components (see Appendix 2a). Similarly for alcohol control policy, data were extracted from a recent global survey on alcohol and health (see Appendix 2b). For diet and physical activity, country-specific performance data were not available; given the very low levels of policy implementation for these two NCD risk factors, all countries were assumed to require all four stages of policy implementation. Figure 2. Patterns of intervention scale-up 2.4 Estimation of resource needs and unit costs For individual interventions delivered in primary-care settings, the resource components consist of human resources, medicines, labo - ratory services and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Estima - tion of the quantity of these resources needed is based on treatment guidelines and clinical protocols, in particular the WHO guidelines for assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and the PEN package guidance (WHO, 2007; WHO, 2010a; see Appendix 3 for the PEN protocol for the integrated management of hypertension and 183 IV.

Resource use profile for multi-drug therapy (individuals at >30% C vD risk) Screening stage: Primary care visits: one five-minute visit (all cases) Laboratory tests: urine sugar analysis (all cases); blood glucose, cholesterol, urinanalysis (30% of cases) Treatment stage: Primary care (counselling, risk assessment): four annual visits, five minutes each (all cases); four annual visits, 20 minutes each (all cases with diabetes) Medicines (daily dose, % cases): hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg, 95%), enalapril (20 mg, 50%), amlodipine (5 mg, 60%), simvastatin (15 mg, 100%) and where applicable, metformin (2000 mg, 100% of cases with diabetes; for the majority of cases, the actual dose required may vary between 1000-2000 mg per day). For population-based measures, a resource needs matrix was devel - oped, consisting of the four stages of policy development described earlier and six categories of resource use: human resources; training; meetings; mass media; supplies and equipment; and other resources. Box 4 illustrates activities that were considered necessary at differ - ent stages of policy development when identifying resource needs for certain tobacco control measures. Table 3 provides more generic examples of activity-based resources that were quantified. Box 4.

To derive compa - rable estimates of resource needs across interventions, a standardized country of 50 million people was assumed (split into 10 provinces of 185 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? 5 million and 10 districts of 0.5 million persons). An example of the human resource needs estimated for this population is provided in Appendix 4a (for smoke-free policies). These standardized estimates were adjusted to reflect the actual population size and administra - tive composition of each country (see Appendix 4b for an example of how human resource needs for smoke-free policies were calculated for an actual country with a population of 160 million split into seven provinces and 64 districts). The same process was used for the other resource categories. The cost of training and meetings was based on the frequency of meetings and workshops within a year, their average duration, the number of national and sub-national participants (plus associated support staff), and the size of the meeting venue. For mass media, TV and radio advertising, newspaper advertisements, wall posters and informa - tion leaflets were included. Estimates were based on the number and intensity of media slots, for example four, two-week series per year, each consisting of 10 one-minute TV and radio slots per week. Unit costs for resource items were taken from the WHO-CHOICE database (www.who.int/choice/costs), which contains country-specific estimates for primary care visits of different durations, salaries, per diem allowances (for training and meetings), media costs and con - sumable items, including fuel and office supplies. Generation of these estimates was based on an econometric analysis of a multinational dataset, using gross national income per capita (plus other explana - tory variables) to predict unit costs in different WHO Member States (for more information, see Adam et al. 2003; Johns et al. 2003, 2008). Drug prices were taken from the International Drug Price Indicator guide, with adjustments made for the cost of carriage, insurance and freight, as well as country distribution (multipliers taken from the WHO-CHOICE database). All prices are expressed in US dollars for 2008 (no account is taken of inflation). Resource-use profiles and unit cost values can be amended by coun - tries interested in applying the costing tool to their own contexts.186 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings3. Results 3.1 Cost of scaling up 'best buy' interventions for NCD risk factors Tobacco control The total annual cost of four population-based demand reduction best buy measures of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control - includ - ing overall programme management and media support - is projected to be US$0.6 billion for all low- and middle-income countries, or US$0.11 per capita (Table 4). The largest cost is related to media campaigns. Table 4.

After initial planning in Year 1, the annual cost does not vary appreciably over the remaining scale-up period; that is, a constant investment is needed, first to develop or reframe policies, and in later years to maintain a comprehensive level of enforcement.187 IV.

The greater variability around the typical (median) cost of implementation (see Figure 4) results from large underlying differences in the prevalence of alcohol use at popu - lation level; these interventions were not accounted for in countries with an adult prevalence of harmful alcohol use below 1%. Figure 4. Median cost per capita of scaling up alcohol control best buy interventions in low- and middle-income countries (US$ 2008) Improving diet and physical activity The cost of implementing three best buy interventions for unhealthy diet and physical inactivity is low (less than US$0.10 per person, or $435 million per year for all low- and middle-income countries; see Table 6). Again, the largest public health expenditure involved in implementing these strategies is mass media associated with general and salt-specific health promotion and awareness campaigns. Table 6.

Figure 5. Median cost per capita of scaling up diet and physical activity best buy interventions in low- and middle-income countries (US$ 2008) Combined estimates for cost of scaling up best buy interventions for NCD risk factors The total cost of resource requirements for all best buy intervention strategies for addressing tobacco and harmful alcohol use, as well as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity approaches US$2 billion per annum for low- and middle-income countries (Figure 6). After the planning phase in Year 1, costs do not vary substantially from year to year. The small elevations in years 2016 and 2021 reflect the cyclical 190 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsreplacement of office and other equipment, which are assumed to last five years. The higher cost in Year 2 (policy development stage) is due to initial training, legislation and health promotion efforts. Figure 6. Total estimated cost of scaling up best buy interventions for NCD risk factors in all low- and middle-income countries (US$ billion 2008) As shown in Figure 7, the median cost per capita in low- and lower- middle income countries amounts to less than US$0.20. For upper- middle income countries, the median cost is closer to US$0.50, excee - ing US$1 per capita in a few cases. Figure 7. Median cost per capita of scaling up best buy interventions for NCD risk factors in low- and middle-income countries (US$ 2008) 3.2 Cost of scaling up best buy interventions for NCDs As discussed earlier, the best buys in primary care identified for indi - vidual-based care of NCDs include: multi-drug therapy for people with more than 30% CVD risk, including those with diabetes, established ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular disease; aspirin for people with an acute heart attack; prevention of cervical cancer by screening and referral for treatment of precancerous lesions; and hepatitis B immuni - zation for the prevention of liver cancer. As mentioned before, hepatitis B immunization has already been scaled up in the large majority of countries, and does not therefore require additional resources to be made available, over and above what is already being committed. Estimated costs cover primary care outpatient visits for consultation, counselling and procedures, auxiliary care, medicines and diagnos - tic and therapeutic procedures. The drivers of these estimates are population growth projections and the projected increase in treatment coverage. The cumulative cost of scaling up these individual-level best buy interventions for all low- and middle-income countries is projected to be US$1 435 billion from 2011-2025. This amounts to an average of US$9.4 billion per annum, ranging from US$2 billion in 2011 to US$ 11.5 billion by 2025 (Figure 8). Figure 8.

Figure 9.

Figure 10. Mean estimated cost per capita of scaling up best buy interventions for NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (US$ 2008) Cardiovascular disease and diabetes The estimated cost of scaling up cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes best buys in all low- and middle-income countries is over US$120 billion, with the annual average being a little over US$8 bil - lion. This includes the cost of screening in primary care to detect individuals at risk of CVD, at a cost of US$3-5 per person screened. The cost of providing aspirin for people with acute heart attack at the primary care level (including visits, diagnostic tests and drugs, but excluding post-referral costs) ranges from US$13-15 per treated case (Table 7). By comparison, the annual cost per case of multi-drug therapy to those at high risk of a CVD event ranges from US$70 in low-income countries to US$105 in upper-middle countries. As shown in Figure 8, providing aspirin to individuals with acute heart attack represents by far the smallest component of cost through - out the scale-up period. The multi-drug therapy intervention becomes the largest element as treatment coverage rates increase from their currently low base to a target level of 80%. Cancer The estimated cost of scaling up the prevention of cervical cancer is US$11.3 billion for the period 2011-2015. Estimates include the cost of one-off screening among women aged between 35-45 years using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), and treatment of precancer - ous lesions using cryotherapy for screen-positive cases. The cost per case is shown in Table 7. Other screening tests and strategies are also available, such as screening women aged 25-49 every three years using VIA or a pap smear test. Such strategies would be expected to have higher costs but may be a preferred option, particularly in countries at higher income levels. Table 7.

This amounts to an annual per capita investment of under US$1 in low-income countries, US$1.50 in lower middle-income and US$3 in upper middle-income countries. A large share of these costs relates to the individual-based provision of multi-drug therapy for those with a high CVD risk. Population-based measures aimed at reducing exposure to risk factors for NCDs - tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity - account for a small fraction of the total price tag (approximately US$2 billion per annum). Likewise, the cost of NCD programme management, which includes central, provincial and district level staff as well as train - ing courses and media expenses, contributes very little to total cost estimates (US$0.5 billion per year). Figure 11. Total estimated cost of scaling up NCD best buy interventions in all low- and middle-income countries (US$ 2008) The budgetary implications associated with the implementation of this combined package in different income regions are summarized in Table 8. As a percentage of health-care spending in 2008, the aver - age annual cost of the package represents 4% in low-income coun - tries, 2% in lower middle-income countries and less than 1% in upper middle-income countries. The proportion changes with the year of scale-up; this is shown in Figure 12. Table 8.

These estimates include disease-specific costs for MDG-related condi - tions and also components of NCD-specific expenditure (medicines), as well as shared health system resources such as human resources and logistics. As a proportion of 2009 total cost estimates, the NCD best buy package described here amounts to approximately 2% (US$0.88 divided by US$44). Figure 12.

Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? 3.3 Total estimated cost of a best buy package for NCD prevention and control The combination of population-based and individual-based best buy interventions for NCDs and their underlying risk factors gives rise to a cumulative cost of US$170 billion over the period 2011-2025, at an average of US$ 11.4 billion per year (Figure 11). This amounts to an annual per capita investment of under US$1 in low-income countries, US$1.50 in lower middle-income and US$3 in upper middle-income countries.

Conclusion 4.1 Main findings This study is an initiative to estimate the resources needed to scale up a set of evidence-based intervention measures for NCD prevention and control. The analysis took as its reference point the 2008-2013 Action Plan for the WHO Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (WHO, 2008a) and focused on estimating the cost of scaling-up prioritized intervention strategies in low- and middle-income countries over a period of 15 years (2011-2025), by which time all interventions are expected to have reached their target level of coverage. The main finding of the study is that scaling up a set of best buy intervention across all low- and middle-income countries is estimated to cost approximately US$11.4 billion per year. This amount is equiva - lent to an annual investment of less than US$1 per person living in low-income countries, US$1.50 per person living in lower middle- income countries, and US$3 per person living in upper middle-income countries. Expressed as a proportion of current health care spending, the average annual cost of implementing such a package amounts to 4% in low-income countries, 2% in lower middle-income countries and less than 1% in upper middle-income countries. 4.2 Implications for health policy and resource allocation There are several ways to interpret these costs: From a public health perspective, an annual per capita investment of US$1-3 would appear to be a low price to pay for significantly reducing the enormous burden of disease from major NCDs and their underlying risk factors in lower-income countries. From an economic perspective, the sums involved in mounting a scaled up NCD response are very small compared with the mas - sive losses in gross national product or social welfare that would occur if no scaled up action and investment are taken - a scenario that takes into account anticipated trends in exposure to NCD risk factors as well as shifts in the size and structure of populations. An ongoing analysis undertaken for the UN High-Level Meeting on NCDs by the World Economic Forum and the Harvard School of Public Health has estimated that current losses in the national product of low- and middle-income countries over the same period 197 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? of 2011-2025 will run into trillions of dollars. Confronted with a loss of this magnitude, an annual outlay of US$10-12 billion appears to be a sensible investment. However, the finances required to scale up the NCD response rep - resent a new demand on health budgets, especially in relation to the very low levels of current expenditure on prevention and control of these diseases. While the potential budgetary impact on resources in upper middle-income countries is arguably low - less than a 1% increase for the best buy package - the impact in low-income coun - tries is anticipated to be greater (where the package would require a 4% increase in total health spending). It should be noted that governments generate substantial revenues from taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, which could serve as an appropri - ate source of programme funding for NCD prevention and control. Scale-up costs presented here can be compared with estimates for scaling up responses to other leading contributors to disease bur - den in low and lower-middle income countries , including HIV, TB, malaria and child health (Johns et al. 2007; Kiszewski et al. 2007; Stenberg et al. 2007). For the period 2006-2015, for example, esti - mated global resources needed per year amount to US$3.9-5.6 billion (US$0.73-1.03 per capita) for attaining universal coverage of mater - nal and newborn health services, and US$52.4 billion (US$0.47-1.46 per capita) for scaling up priority interventions in 75 countries for children under five years. When comparing these figures, however, it should be noted that baseline levels of MDG-related disease pro - gramme implementation are considerably higher. This means that the incremental cost of achieving coverage goals is diminished. By contrast, current levels of programme implementation or coverage for NCD control and prevention are comparatively low, meaning that the additional investment needed to reach a high level of coverage will be much more substantial. In addition, NCDs is an umbrella term that covers many preventable and treatable conditions (as opposed to a single disease). The overall implication of these perspectives is that while much can be done to address the needs of populations at risk of NCDs, there are significant financial challenges for lower-income countries. By identifying the costs associated with a set of best buy interventions, this analysis provides options for action that can be considered even in very low-resource settings, including a number of population-based preventive measures that are cheap to initiate and sustain (less than US$0.20 per capita in low- and lower-middle income countries). Imple - mentation of even this restricted set of measures, including tobacco control and salt reduction, will help to significantly reduce the escalat - ing macroeconomic consequences of NCDs in these countries.198 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settings4.3 Study limitations and uncertainties Financial modelling of the kind presented here inevitably requires a number of assumptions. Some of the main limitations are: As outlined in Section 2.1, estimating the cost of scaling up health interventions involves a method that has been repeatedly used and draws on core information domains. Many data variables, includ - ing population and prevalence estimates as well as target coverage, are well established. Other data domains, in particular current coverage, programme resource requirements and country-specific processes for drugs or locally produced goods and services, carry a greater degree of uncertainty, either because of lack of up-to- date information (e.g. coverage rates, by country and intervention) or potential measurement error (e.g. predicted salary levels or the cost per primary care visit). With respect to current coverage, the simplifying assumption was that coverage for individual-level interventions falls below 10% (a default level of 5% was used). Should current coverage levels be appreciably higher than this, the incremental costs of scaling-up would be that much less (meaning that the reported results are conservative). Regarding resources at programme level, including programme man - agement staffing levels, stakeholder meetings, training sessions and media - a standardized template and approach were used to avoid inconsistent costing across programmes; where available, estimates were compared with earlier cost-effectiveness or scaling-up studies that quantify these programme-level resources; many consultations were held with programme experts to generate realistic estimates of actual need at country level. Nevertheless, this is an area where there is little reported empirical evidence, meaning that values are largely based on expert opinion. Accordingly, this will represent a key area for country-level validation and contextualization. For unit costs of non-traded goods and services (including salaries and unit costs of primary care visits), we relied on the WHO-CHOICE costing database, which has country-specific predictions that have been updated to 2008 price levels. Again, actual prices in 2008 for a specific country may have differed (up or down) by a small margin; it is not expected that the net effect of this price uncertainty would change baseline results substantially; International medicine prices were adjusted for country-specific multipliers for transportation from border of entry to outlets. Data were not available for estimating the extent of mark-ups for medi - cines used in each country. 199 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? Costs of overcoming system-wide constraints, such as an inability to train and retain health professionals, are not addressed. A uni - fied costing tool (OneHealth) is being developed by a multi-agency working group that will accommodate these issues; an NCD module is to be incorporated into this health system planning tool (http:// www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/working_groups/ working_group_on_costing). The scope of the analysis was restricted to consideration of a set of core best buys for NCD control and prevention that has been identi - fied through an evidence-based process. However, countries may choose to add to or subtract from this list in accordance with local priorities; therefore, a wider set of intervention strategies has been incorporated into the tool for country use (e.g. tobacco cessation, brief advice for heavy drinkers, early detection of breast cancer). In addition, the economic and other evidence underpinning the selec - tion of the best buys is largely based on international and regional analyses and may not fit the circumstances of a particular country; for example, increased taxes on alcoholic beverages are not a highly cost-effective strategy in countries where consumption levels are low but the unrecorded (untaxed) proportion of this consumption is high (Anderson et al. 2009). A further limitation of the modelling is that cost estimates do not take into account the impact of preventive measures on subsequent disease rates, such as the impact of tobacco control measures on future rates of ischaemic heart disease or stroke; rather, disease rates have been assumed to be constant throughout the scale-up period. As a consequence, total costs of scale-up presented here might be expected to be overestimated; however, it is also the case that in countries with positive population growth, more people will be exposed to NCD risk factors (such as tobacco or harmful alcohol use), thus mitigating the extent of overestimation. Even in countries with zero population growth, increased life expectancy will increase the population at risk. Incorporation of these interactions requires the development and application of a sophisticated epidemiological model that includes all the major NCDs and their shared underlying risk factors. Such models, which typically require a microsimulation approach that will handle the many possible interactions that can occur with populations at risk, have been used in cost-effectiveness analyses (including for some of the interventions included in this study; Cecchini et al. 2010); they have also been used to assess the health effects of multi-drug therapy scale-up (Lim et al. 2007). However, it has not been possible within the time and funding constraints of this 2011 study to incorporate such modelling into the multi-intervention, year-on-year scaling-up scenarios used here. 200 Package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary health care in low-resource settingsAs a result, the analysis does not provide estimates of the health impacts associated with the combined implementation of the best buy strategies, in particular the number of premature deaths avoided as interventions are scaled-up. This information gap represents a key piece of analysis that would need to be undertaken to demonstrate the return on the large-scale investments indicated. Fortunately, earlier scaling-up analysis performed for tobacco control, salt reduction and multi-drug therapy - covering six of the 14 best buy interventions included here - has already demonstrated the enormous public health gain to be realized, namely, 32 million deaths over a 10-year period in 23 large developing countries (Asaria et al. 2007; Lim et al. 2007). Finally, while this study describes the cost of responding to the burden of NCDs, it does not determine who will pay. That is a question for countries to consider, depending on their income and resource availability, as well as their institutional and infrastructural capacity to scale-up interventions and services. As discussed in the 2010 World Health Report (WHO, 2010d), there are three general mechanisms by which governments can generate resources for health (including renewed action on NCDs): 1. By increasing or ensuring a fair share of government spending on health (in general, or on NCD control and prevention in particular), which is a political process that can be advanced through coordi - nated action from health ministries and civil society; 2. By identifying new or diversified sources of revenues for health, for example, a national health insurance levy on value-added tax or increased excise taxes on alcoholic beverages or tobacco products; 3. If applicable, by exhorting external donors to meet their inter - national commitments for official development assistance and to provide more predictable, long-term aid. 4.4 Next steps: country-level application and validation The primary use of the tool is ultimately directed at the national level. The tool has been developed to be used with widely accessible software (Microsoft Excel) and by country investigators responsible for NCD programme planning or development. It is envisaged that a process of country-level adaptation in selected WHO Member States will commence shortly after the UN High-level meeting on the pre - vention and control of NCDs in September 2011. This process will be beneficial to country users and to the developers, through evaluation of the tool. To optimize the flexibility and usefulness of the tool at national level, the set of interventions from which policy-makers and planners 201 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? can choose may need to go beyond the sub-set of best buys assessed here. Accordingly, resource-need profiles and cost estimates for other interventions have been integrated into the tool, to give countries a better sense of the resource implications associated with the delivery of a more comprehensive public health response to NCDs. However, given that implementation coverage of best buy strategies is still very modest in most low- and middle-income countries, it is expected that countries may first wish to focus on these best buy strategies before considering the broader financing and health system ramifications of an expanded package of care that can be delivered within primary care settings. A further step relates to the transfer of the tool's content into One - Health, which will take the costing analysis to the next level, since it will enable NCD scale-up to be considered within the constraints of broader health system planning at national level. As part of the development of this NCD module within OneHealth, special attention will need to be given to modelling of composite as well as disaggre - gated health gains brought about by intervention; such an analysis of health impacts provides the information required to assess the sizeable returns on investment generated through the scale-up of prioritized NCD control and prevention strategies.

User's notes The Costing Tool is intended to provide cost estimates for national scale-up of a set of priority interventions (best buys) for prevention and control of NCDs. This is a core set of interventions prioritized by WHO in 2011, based on cost effectiveness, impact and feasibility of implementation. The best buys comprise population-wide interventions and health system interventions targeting individuals (see page 12, Table 1 in the document Scaling Up Action against Noncommunicable Diseases: How Much Will It Cost?). The NCDs Costing Tool has a user-friendly format and is pre-filled with country-specific (WHO default) demographic data, epidemiologi - cal data, standardized assumptions for disease management based on the WHO protocols of the WHO Package of Essential NCD Interventions (WHO PEN) (for primary care in low-resource settings - the WHO PEN document, protocols and other tools are included on the compact disc) and costs of commodities, etc. The Costing Tool can be used without any additional country-specific data/information; however, the user has the option to amend some of the country-specific data/information (e.g. costs of commodities and human resources), if necessary. The Costing Tool provides the option to select specific interventions from NCD best buys, the mode of scale-up and the current and target coverage levels of interventions. Table 1 lists the information used in this tool. If necessary, the WHO default values and standard assumptions may be reviewed and adapted to country contexts. Users have the option to change default values presented in the tool to explore different 205 IV. Scaling up action against noncommunicable diseases: how much will it cost? options and sensitivities, but the assumptions preferably should be evidence-based country assumptions - and agreed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners - to make the overall exercise reasonable, acceptable and useful. Purpose of the Costing Tool The tool is intended for planning national scale-up of prevention and control of NCDs with a focus on best buy interventions for NCDs.
