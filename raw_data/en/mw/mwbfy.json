Researchers studied the prescription refill records of patients discharged with ischemic, or clot-caused, stroke from 24 hospitals who received new anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering medications between 2006 and 2015. These medications help prevent a subsequent stroke. A total of 48,746 patients refilled one of those medications, including 205,085 prescriptions for statins (136,722 by pharmacy and 68,363 by mail) and 50,483 prescriptions for anticoagulants (34,682 by pharmacy and 15,801 by mail). Researchers found: Future research should study the impact of mail-order pharmacy use on stroke prevention and vascular health after stroke, researchers said.
