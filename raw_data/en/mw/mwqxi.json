Relegated to the fringes of American medical and religious orthodoxy for most of the twentieth century in part because of its metaphysical philosophy, today chiropractic is mainstream: its offices can be found in strip malls; medical insurance plans cover adjustments; and, in a dramatic readjustment of traditional cultural alignments, conservative Christians embrace chiropractic as a God-given method of pain relief. - Type - Research Article - Information [Church History](/core/journals/church-history), [Volume 79](/core/journals/church-history/volume/7E7D2E49C38090BE8A8EA15F05BBF1EF), [Issue 1](/core/journals/church-history/issue/8EBA697BA5D07E1F3C2FCFFC54D5ADEF), March 2010 - 181 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 American Society of Church History 2010 References 1 Palmer, D.

After quoting a lengthy passage from Palmer that identifies the \"religion of chiropractic\" as belief in Universal Intelligence, \"segmented into as many parts as there are individual expressions of life,\" Wardwell summarily protests: \"If this is religion, it certainly is not Christian. Basically, D. D. did not consider chiropractic a religion\"; Wardwell's word choice suggests that Palmer's explicitly \"religious\" views did not strike Wardwell as \"Christian\" and that Wardwell considered theistic religions such as Christianity to be the only genuine religions. 16 Moore, Chiropractic in America, 23; Martin, \"Only Truly Scientific Method,\" 213. 17 Palmer, Chiropractor's Adjuster, 446, 642; Palmer, D.

Who's Who in Chiropractic (1980) includes 875 entries: no religious affiliation is listed for 310 (35.4%) of the individuals; Catholics number 103 (11.8%); Protestants account for 421 (48.1%); 23 (2.6%) are identified as Jewish; and 18 (2.1%) identify other religious backgrounds, including 1 self-described \"Unitarian Atheist\"; Gallagher, Harry, History of Chiropractic: A History of the Philosophy, Art and Science of Chiropractic and Chiropractors in Oklahoma (Guthrie, Okla.: William E.

The surveys were added to the registration packets distributed by the sponsoring organization to all conference participants. Each survey packet included a Study Information Sheet. The surveys were completed anonymously, but informants were given the option of completing a contact card if they wished to participate in a follow-up telephone interview. Demographic information collected through the survey indicated that participants represented diverse gender, age, racial/ethnic, educational, and income groups; most self-identified as Charismatic, Pentecostal, and/or evangelical Protestants or Catholics. 125 The telephone interviews followed a semi-structured format. I asked open-ended questions and listened to informants' answers without comment. Most respondents who mentioned receiving chiropractic treatments volunteered this information before I asked about it. I asked informants who did not initiate a discussion of chiropractic whether they had ever tried any form of alternative healthcare, and I reminded them of a few of the approaches listed in question nine of the survey, including chiropractic. This question in several instances elicited lengthy responses to which I listened without commentary. 126 Cherkin, Daniel C. and MacCornack, Frederick A., \"Patient Evaluations of Low Back Pain Care from Family Physicians and Chiropractors,\" Western Journal of Medicine l50, no. 3 (1989): 351 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Patient+Evaluations+of+Low+Back+Pain+Care+from+Family+Physicians+and+Chiropractors&author=Cherkin+Daniel+C.&author=MacCornack+Frederick+A.&publication+year=1989&journal=Western+Journal+of+Medicine&volume=l50). 127 The quotation is from question six of the post-conference survey; question fourteen of the post-conference survey provides the identical list of alternatives given by question nine of the pre-conference survey. 128 Cherkin and MacCornack, \"Patient Evaluations,\" 351; Kane, Robert, Olson, Donna, Leymaster, Craig, Woolley, F.

Stuart Moore argues, in Chiropractic in America, 141, chiropractors win a loyal clientele in part because of their willingness to spend time \"touching and listening, validating the often ambiguous pain associated with back ailments.\" 130 Having classified pain as morally evil, Charismatics tend to classify practices as bad or good depending upon whether they are perceived as exacerbating or alleviating pain. Interestingly, Charismatics are quick to denounce other \"nature cures,\" such as freemasonry (Albanese, Nature Religion, 56, 186; Whorton, Nature Cures, xii), that they blame for causing sickness; see, for example, Cassada, Barbara, Unto Death: Freemasonry Publishing, 1998), 8 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Unto+Death%3A+Freemasonry+%E2%80%A6+Freedom+in+Christ+or+Bondage+to+Lucifer%3F&author=Cassada+Barbara&publication+year=1998), in which Cassada lists diseases that she claims occur more frequently among Masonic families\u2014and explains that it was this discovery that made her aware of freemasonry's non-Christian religious beliefs. 131 Albanese, Republic of Mind and Spirit, 510. 132 Johnston, Politics of Healing, 4; see also Goldstein, Michael S., Alternative Health Care: Medicine, Miracle, or Mirage?
