These are easy entry points for viruses. - Wear a mask over your nose and mouth and do your best to maintain social distancing when in crowded public settings like schools, supermarkets, stores, churches, and businesses. - Be aware of current COVID-19 case counts in your area and adjust your activities accordingly. If community transmission is high, avoid high-risk activities and avoid in-person visits with vulnerable people (e.g., older adults, those with chronic conditions, those with serious illnesses, and unvaccinated groups). Use technology like video chatting, texts, calls, and social media to stay connected while keeping those most vulnerable safe. - If you suspect you may have been exposed or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, always call ahead to your family doctor, clinic, or emergency room for guidance.

Laurel Health has COVID-19 testing available at all sites. - If you feel sick, stay home. Staying home to rest when you feel ill reduces your likelihood of spreading illness to others and allows you to better recover. If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, or loss of taste/smell, call your doctor for guidance on testing and treatment. If you are experiencing severe symptoms, call 911. LAUREL HEALTH CENTER COVID-19 GUIDANCE: Have questions about COVID-19? We have answers.
