Our founder, Dr. Rudolf Steiner along with Dr. Ita Wegman, and a team of scientists created the first synergistic products orchestrated to reconnect the body with its natural rhythms. Today, Weleda is represented in over 50 countries on all five continents. The three main sites are still where Weleda's history began: in Arlesheim, near Basel in Switzerland; in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd near Stuttgart in Germany and in the French city of Huningue, Alsace. From these bases - and from our company branches the world over - Weleda produces hundreds of natural cosmetics and thousands of pharmaceuticals, still partly produced from medicinal plants of our own gardens. Responsible dealings with both nature and people have always formed part of our business, ever since Rudolf Steiner articulated his vision of a company completely at the service of human beings and the world as a whole. Whether it's through fair trade, biodynamic cultivation or the supportive development of our employees - sustainability is part of our roots. Natural Ingredients [Find out how we get from field "}
