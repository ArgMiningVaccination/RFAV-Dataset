Here is an easy to understand video that answers many questions you might have about viruses and in particular the SAR-COV-2 virus and vaccine. Scroll down to click on the video at the bottom of this post. My colleague Dr. Aaron Lee, DAOM, LAc interviews Dr. Mars Stone, PhD in molecular virology about viruses, vaccines and the SAR-COV-2 vaccine. Dr. Stone is a senior scientist at CORE Labs at the University of California San Francisco. She is currently working on multiple COVID projects to further understand the antibody response, mechanism of vaccine protection and rates of infection in our populations. Dr. Stone does a fantastic job of explaining these complex topics so that everyone will understand and can make informed decisions. Thank you to Dr. Lee and Dr. Stone for creating this video. Here are some of the highlights: - The Pfizer/Moderna Vaccine is a strand of mRNA that encodes for the spike protein that is specific to SARS-CoV-2; meaning that it would not cross-react to other proteins of the body. - The vaccine introduces mRNA into your cells, which in turn signals your body to manufacture this protein. When this protein is released from the cell, your body will produce antibodies to it. Now when you come into contact with the virus your immune system is primed and can quickly recognize and neutralize the virus. It will take 1-2 weeks after receiving the full dosage of the vaccine for your immune system to be completely activated. - Because it takes 1-2 weeks for your immune system to become completely activated it is important to continue to wear a mask to protect yourself and others. - The mRNA vaccine provides the blueprint for a protein. It is NOT living material and does not cause a CoV2 infection. The chills, fatigue, muscle and joint aches often felt after the vaccination are an indication your immune system is responding to the vaccine. - So far SARS-CoV-2 appears to not mutate as quickly as the flu virus. However, it is still unknown if booster shots or a yearly vaccination will be needed. - Dr. Stone discusses other ingredients in addition to mRNA of the Pfizer/Moderna Vaccine and how these nanoparticles assist in the process. - Because the vaccine has only been tested on healthy individuals, people who are immunocompromised or have major co-morbidities, should consult with their primary care medical doctor to determine if the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk. - One reason the vaccine was able to be produced so quickly was because so much previous research had been done to produce a vaccine for related Coronaviruses like MERS and SARS. - Many members of the scientific community from diverse disciplines collaborated to advance the knowledge in order to create this vaccine. Even with the promise of a vaccine much still needs to be learned because this vaccine is so new. Self care is essential. Continue to support your immune system with good quality sleep, healthy eating, supplements, exercise and of course acupuncture. Stay well, Dr. D "}
