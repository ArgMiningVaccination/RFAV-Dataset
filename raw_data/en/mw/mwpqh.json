While the exact cause of AD is still unclear, recent studies point to lifestyle, diet, environmental, and genetic factors as contributors to disease progression. The pharmaceutical approaches developed to date do not alter disease progression. More than two hundred promising drug candidates have failed clinical trials in the past decade, suggesting that the disease and its causes may be highly complex. Medicinal plants and herbal remedies are now gaining more interest as complementary and alternative interventions and are a valuable source for developing drug candidates for AD. Indeed, several scientific studies have described the use of various medicinal plants and their principal phytochemicals for the treatment of AD. This article reviews a subset of herbs for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cognitive-enhancing effects. Methods\u2014This article systematically reviews recent studies that have investigated the role of neuroprotective herbs and their bioactive compounds for dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and pre-Alzheimer's disease. PubMed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases of articles were collected, and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. Conclusions\u2014Medicinal plants have great potential as part of an overall program in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline associated with AD. It is hoped that these medicinal plants can be used in drug discovery programs for identifying safe and efficacious small molecules for AD.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-08", "cleaned_text": "etiology is incompletely understood, genetic factors account for the 5 to 10% of cases that are familial Alzheimer's, with the other 90 to 95% being sporadic. Being heterozygous or homozygous for the ApoE 4 allele significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Efforts to find a cure for AD have so far been disappointing, and the drugs currently available to treat the disease have limited effectiveness, especially if the disease is in its moderate-severe stage. [1](#B1-biomolecules-11-00543), [2](#B2-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [4](#B4-biomolecules-11-00543), [5](#B5-biomolecules-11-00543), [6](#B6-biomolecules-11-00543)]. However, the poor correlation of amyloid deposits with cognitive decline in the symptomatic phase of dementia may explain why drug targets to -amyloid have not succeeded to date [ [5](#B5-biomolecules-11-00543), [6](#B6-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [7](#B7-biomolecules-11-00543), [8](#B8-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Studies reveal that the mutated, aberrantly folded, and hyperphosphorylated tau is less efficient in sustaining microtubule growth and function, resulting in the destabilization of the microtubule network\u2014a hallmark of AD [ [9](#B9-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Attention is now on therapies targeted at tau due to failures in -amyloid clinical drug trials [ [7](#B7-biomolecules-11-00543), [8](#B8-biomolecules-11-00543), [10](#B10-biomolecules-11-00543)]. However, the recent failure of drugs targeting tau deposits suggests a lack of accurate understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AD [ [11](#B11-biomolecules-11-00543)]. This demonstrates the need to consider other pathophysiological entities underlying AD, including, but not limited to, autophagy, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metal ion toxicity, neurotransmitter excitotoxicity, gut dysbiosis, unfolded protein response, cholesterol metabolism, insulin/glucose dysregulation, and infections [ [12](#B12-biomolecules-11-00543)]. In the face of repeated failures of drug therapies targeting amyloid or tau and the large unmet need for safe and effective AD treatments, it is imperative to pursue alternative therapeutic strategies that address all the above-mentioned pathophysiological entities [ [13](#B13-biomolecules-11-00543), [14](#B14-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [15](#B15-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Included in this individualized, precision program are high-quality herbs or their bioactive compounds directed towards the specific needs of each patient as part of the overall protocol, and these have proven to be very effective. [16](#B16-biomolecules-11-00543), [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), [18](#B18-biomolecules-11-00543), [19](#B19-biomolecules-11-00543), [20](#B20-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Numerous plants and their constituents are recommended in traditional practices of medicine to enhance cognitive function and to alleviate other symptoms of AD, including poor cognition, memory loss, and depression. A single herb or a mixture of herbs is normally recommended depending upon the complexity of the condition. The rationale is that the bioactive principles present in the herb not only act synergistically but may also modulate the activity of other constituents from the same plant or other plant species [ [20](#B20-biomolecules-11-00543), [21](#B21-biomolecules-11-00543), [22](#B22-biomolecules-11-00543)]. This approach has been used in Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and Native Americans' system of medicine, where a single herb or a combination of two or more herbs is commonly prescribed for any specific disease [ [16](#B16-biomolecules-11-00543), [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), [18](#B18-biomolecules-11-00543), [19](#B19-biomolecules-11-00543), [23](#B23-biomolecules-11-00543)]. In this manuscript, we review a subset of herbs useful for AD based on their properties, functional characteristics, and mechanistic actions ( [Table 1](#biomolecules-11-00543-t001)). The rationale for choosing these herbs is (a) their long historical use in traditional practices of medicine for memory-related disorders including AD, (b) the identification of phytochemicals from these plant sources for their potential in AD therapy, (c) determination of the neuropharmacological activities of these herbs, and (d) pre-clinical or clinical studies to confirm their reputed cognitive-enhancing and anti-dementia effects. 1.1. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) [86](#B86-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Ashwagandha been shown to possess antioxidant activity, free radical scavenging activity, as well as an ability to support a healthy immune system [ [87](#B87-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Ashwagandha contains several bioactive compounds of great the extract ashwagandha triggered neurite outgrowth in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human neuroblastoma cells [ [29](#B29-biomolecules-11-00543)], and, in another study involving cultured rat cortical neurons, treatment with A peptide induced axonal and dendritic atrophy and loss of pre-and postsynaptic stimuli [ [92](#B92-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Subsequent treatment with withanolide A induced significant regeneration of both axons and dendrites and restored the pre- and post-synapses in the cultured cortical neurons. [93](#B93-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The in vivo ameliorative effects were maintained even after the discontinuation of the drug administration. Aqueous extracts of ashwagandha increased acetylcholine (ACh) content and choline acetyl transferase activity in rats, which might partly explain the cognition-enhancing and memory-improving effects [ [29](#B29-biomolecules-11-00543), [94](#B94-biomolecules-11-00543), [95](#B95-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Treatment with caused the upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, which enhanced the A clearance and reversed the AD pathology in middle-aged and old APP/PS1 mice [ [96](#B96-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [96](#B96-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using an AD model of Drosophila melanogaster, researchers noted that treatment with ashwagandha mitigated A toxicity and also promoted longevity [ [97](#B97-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Despite the extensive literature on the therapeutic effects of ashwagandha, there are limited data on its clinical use for cognitive impairment [ [98](#B98-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [99](#B99-biomolecules-11-00543)]. These studies lend credence to ashwagandha's role in enhancing memory and improving executive function in people with SCI or MCI. 1.2. Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) [34](#B34-biomolecules-11-00543), [36](#B36-biomolecules-11-00543)]. include saponins, bacopasides III, IV, V, bacosides A and B, bacosaponins A, B, C, D, E, and F, alkaloids, sterols, betulic acid, polyphenols, and sulfhydryl compounds, which may be responsible for the neuroprotective roles of the plant. Both in vitro and in vivo studies show that these phytochemicals have an antioxidant and free radical scavenging action by blocking lipid peroxidation in several areas of the brain [ [36](#B36-biomolecules-11-00543), [100](#B100-biomolecules-11-00543), [102](#B102-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Bm acts by reducing divalent metals, reactive oxygen species, decreasing the formation of lipid peroxides, effect of Bm in a rat model of AD, researchers tested an alcoholic extract of Bm at doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg for a period of 2 weeks before and 1 week after the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A). Spatial memory was tested using the Morris water maze (MWM), and the cholinergic neuron density was determined using histological techniques. The researchers showed that Bm extract improved the escape latency time in the MWM test and blocked the reduction of cholinergic neuron densities [ [35](#B35-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Another group reported the reversal of colchicine-induced cognitive deficits by a standardized extract of Bm. In addition to reversing colchicine-triggered cognitive impairment, the Bm extract also attenuated colchicine-induced oxidative damage by decreasing the protein carbonyl levels and restoring the activities of the antioxidant enzymes [ [107](#B107-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [37](#B37-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The results suggested the use of Bm in the treatment of age-associated memory impairment. [108](#B108-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The Attention d2 Test is a neuropsychological measure of selective and sustained attention and visual scanning speed. Assessment tests revealed that Sideritis extract combined with a low-dose Bm extract resulted in improvement in the d2 concentration test score [ [109](#B109-biomolecules-11-00543)]. A similar effect of Bm alone was observed only after repetitive dosing, suggesting that the long-term memory effects seen with repetitive dosing of Bm may be a promising therapeutic option for subjects suffering from MCI [ [109](#B109-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [110](#B110-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The observed sixty-day improvements in ADAS-cog and CDT were statistically significant as compared with baseline values. Memory is affected by several factors, including focus and attention, neurotransmitters, hormones, trophic factors, cyclic AMP, ion channels, protein transcription, synapse formation, and nutrients. Some of these processes can be modulated by Bm extract alone or in combination with other compounds. 1.3. Cat's Claw (Uncaria tomentosa) [38](#B38-biomolecules-11-00543), [39](#B39-biomolecules-11-00543)]. CC is known for its immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects and for its role as a free radical scavenger. Based on in vitro studies, the anti-inflammatory effect of CC is attributed to its ability to inhibit iNOS gene expression, nitrate formation, cell death, PGE2 production, and the activation of NF-B and TNF- [ [45](#B45-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-00543)]. CC extract also caused a significant reduction in astrocytosis and microgliosis, and it improved hippocampus-dependent memory. Some of the components in the CC extract crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and entered the parenchyma following intravenous injection [ [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [43](#B43-biomolecules-11-00543), [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-00543)]. CC extract not only prevented the formation and aggregation of A fibrils and tau protein paired helical filaments, but it also facilitated the disaggregation of preformed fibrils and tau protein tangles [ [43](#B43-biomolecules-11-00543), [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-00543)]. While proanthocyanidin B2 was identified as the primary phytochemical with plaque-and tangle-dissolving activity, other polyphenols present in the CC extract possess plaque-reducing activity [ [44](#B44-biomolecules-11-00543)]. 1.4. Ginkgo Biloba [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Gb extract has shown beneficial effects in treating Alzheimer's, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, tinnitus, and other age-associated conditions [ [49](#B49-biomolecules-11-00543), [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The suggested mechanisms of the Gb extract are its antioxidant effect, anti-platelet activating factor activity for vascular diseases, inhibition of -amyloid peptide aggregation in AD, and decreased expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor for stress alleviation [ [48](#B48-biomolecules-11-00543), [49](#B49-biomolecules-11-00543), [50](#B50-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [112](#B112-biomolecules-11-00543), [113](#B113-biomolecules-11-00543), [114](#B114-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Treatment with Gb extract enhanced memory retention in young and old rats and improved short-term memory in mice [ [49](#B49-biomolecules-11-00543), [115](#B115-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [116](#B116-biomolecules-11-00543), [117](#B117-biomolecules-11-00543), [118](#B118-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Gb extract also improves ADLs among AD individuals and is preferred over other AD medications because of its negligible adverse effects [ [119](#B119-biomolecules-11-00543), [120](#B120-biomolecules-11-00543)]. 1.5. Gotu Kola (Centella asiatica) [57](#B57-biomolecules-11-00543)]. This medicinal plant is used to strengthen the brain, heal skin issues, and promote liver and kidney health. Gk is considered a rejuvenating herb for nerve and brain cells as it is believed to promote intelligence and improve memory [ [54](#B54-biomolecules-11-00543), [55](#B55-biomolecules-11-00543), [56](#B56-biomolecules-11-00543), [57](#B57-biomolecules-11-00543)]. In vitro studies using derivatives (asiaticosides, asiatic acid, madecassoside, and madasiatic acid) showed that these compounds were capable of blocking H2O2-induced cell death, decreasing free radical concentration, and inhibiting -amyloid cell death, suggesting a potential role for Gk in the treatment and prevention of These benefits are attributed to the two principal constituents of Lm, namely hericenones and erinacines [ [127](#B127-biomolecules-11-00543), [128](#B128-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using several cell lines, researchers observed that treatment with Lm extract increased the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) [ [127](#B127-biomolecules-11-00543), [129](#B129-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Lm extract was able to stimulate neurite length in the presence of NGF both in cell lines and cultured neurons [ [62](#B62-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [61](#B61-biomolecules-11-00543), [62](#B62-biomolecules-11-00543), [63](#B63-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Lm extract also also improved increased the levels of acetylcholine and choline acetyltransferase in a mouse model of AD [ [130](#B130-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [131](#B131-biomolecules-11-00543)]. In another small, randomized study involving patients with mild AD, Lm extract improved scores on the activities of daily living (e.g., personal hygiene, dressing, preparing food, etc.) over 49 weeks [ [132](#B132-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Thus, the abovementioned pre-clinical and clinical results suggest that lion's mane is a well-tolerated and safe herb for the management of AD. 1.7. Saffron (Crocus sativus) [65](#B65-biomolecules-11-00543), [66](#B66-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The major component of safranal, a carboxaldehyde. In vitro and in vivo studies show that the phytochemicals present in saffron anthocyanins, and steroids, which are and glutamatergic signaling can by a group of nutraceuticals called racetams. Cp produces some similar effects to racetams. Cp modulates body's production of adrenaline and cortisol [ [69](#B69-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Cp is also recommended for mental stress and fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia [ [36](#B36-biomolecules-11-00543), Cp to neonatal rat pups resulted in improved retention and spatial learning performance. In addition, a significant increase in ACh content and activity was observed, which may be the basis for their improved learning and memory [ [140](#B140-biomolecules-11-00543), [141](#B141-biomolecules-11-00543), [142](#B142-biomolecules-11-00543)]. A significant increase in dendritic branching points and processes was observed in rats treated with Cp extract as compared to age-matched saline controls, suggesting that Cp improves learning and memory by stimulating dendritic arborization [ [143](#B143-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [144](#B144-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Despite the vast literature demonstrating the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic properties of Cp, the herb has not been evaluated clinically to test whether it can prevent dementia. 1.9. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) [80](#B80-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The active principal curcuminoid whose anti-inflammatory property is associated with reduced risk of AD [ [82](#B82-biomolecules-11-00543)]. In vitro studies revealed curcumin's ability to block lipid peroxidation and neutralize reactive oxygen species, which was several times more potent than vitamin E [ [145](#B145-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [77](#B77-biomolecules-11-00543), [78](#B78-biomolecules-11-00543), [146](#B146-biomolecules-11-00543), [147](#B147-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Curcumin also reduced inflammation, oxidative damage, and amyloid pathology in mouse models of AD [ [78](#B78-biomolecules-11-00543), [147](#B147-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Direct injection of curcumin into the brains not only blocked further development of plaque but also reduced the plaque levels [ [147](#B147-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using animal models of AD, several studies have reported improvement in cognitive function in the curcumin-treated group. Researchers attribute the improvement to curcumin's ability to lower A plaque levels as well as to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [ [148](#B148-biomolecules-11-00543), [149](#B149-biomolecules-11-00543), [150](#B150-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using an APP/PS1 double transgenic AD model, researchers examined the effect of two different doses of curcumin, including low (160 ppm) and high (1000 ppm), after administration for six months in the diet [ [151](#B151-biomolecules-11-00543)]. While there was a significant cognitive improvement at both doses compared to the untreated group, the higher dose of curcumin produced greater cognitive improvement. Additionally, curcumin reduced the A deposits, possibly by promoting autophagy. Owing to curcumin's low bioavailability, rapid gastrointestinal metabolism, and poor BBB penetration, several analogs of curcumin were tested for their bioavailability and for their effects on animal models of AD. While these derivatives produced different beneficial outcomes depending on the disease model, they were all better in improving cognitive function and reducing plaque pathology [ [85](#B85-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [84](#B84-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Metals such as copper, zinc, or iron may play a role in AD pathogenesis [ [152](#B152-biomolecules-11-00543)]. These metals are concentrated in the AD brain and trigger amyloid aggregation or oxidative neurotoxicity [ [153](#B153-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Curcumin forms strong complexes with metals and blocks metal-triggered A aggregation, toxicity, and inflammation [ [154](#B154-biomolecules-11-00543), [155](#B155-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [83](#B83-biomolecules-11-00543), [84](#B84-biomolecules-11-00543), [85](#B85-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Thus, improvements are needed, and future research should focus on ways to further increase curcumin's systemic bioavailability and improve its BBB permeability. 1.10. Triphala [71](#B71-biomolecules-11-00543), [72](#B72-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Research studies antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and antineoplastic In vitro studies suggest that triphala is a modulator of cytochrome P450 and combats degenerative and metabolic disorders, possibly by inhibiting lipid peroxide formation and scavenging free radicals [ [74](#B74-biomolecules-11-00543)]. All three fruits possess different bioactive compounds with different properties. [71](#B71-biomolecules-11-00543), [72](#B72-biomolecules-11-00543), [73](#B73-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Furthermore, neurodegeneration in fly models of Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, thereby revealing its broad therapeutic potential [ [156](#B156-biomolecules-11-00543), [157](#B157-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Bibhitaki contains tannins, ellagic acid, to have anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and antioxidant properties while also improving digestive disturbances [ [71](#B71-biomolecules-11-00543), [158](#B158-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Other bioactive compounds present in chebulinic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin, luteolin, and properties [ [159](#B159-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Triphala-derived polyphenols such as chebulinic acid are transformed by the human microbiota into bioactive metabolites such as urolithins [ [160](#B160-biomolecules-11-00543), [161](#B161-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Urolithins induce cellular autophagy and increase lifespan and inhibit muscle dysfunction in animal models of aging [ [162](#B162-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [163](#B163-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [164](#B164-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Larger double-blind, randomized controlled trials were carried out to test mouthwash formulations in people with periodontal diseases. Triphala extract mouth rinse was effective in reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, with no adverse effects [ [75](#B75-biomolecules-11-00543), [165](#B165-biomolecules-11-00543), [166](#B166-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [15](#B15-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Therefore, treatment with triphala represents one of the strategies to reduce the chronic activation of the innate immune system in AD. 2. Other Medicinal Plants for AD 3. Administration of Herbs [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), [167](#B167-biomolecules-11-00543), [168](#B168-biomolecules-11-00543), [169](#B169-biomolecules-11-00543), [170](#B170-biomolecules-11-00543), [171](#B171-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using this route of delivery, herbs in the form of dry powders or medicated oils are directly administered. Medicated oils may contain a mix of lipophilic and lipid-soluble molecules to ensure the synergistic interaction between different constituents in the herb. The benefits of INA include minimizing the side effects associated with systemic administration, avoidance of brain injury, and overcoming the need for implanting delivery devices [ [172](#B172-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Using this technique, researchers have treated memory losses in transgenic mouse models of AD [ [173](#B173-biomolecules-11-00543)]. While INA may be of great value, several contradictory findings in research studies limit its clinical value [ [173](#B173-biomolecules-11-00543), [174](#B174-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Though an attractive strategy in traditional medicinal systems for CNS conditions, there are not many clinical studies to support the use of INS for herbal delivery. [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), [175](#B175-biomolecules-11-00543), [176](#B176-biomolecules-11-00543), [177](#B177-biomolecules-11-00543), [178](#B178-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Yet another mode of administration is a transcranial application of medicated oils so that the herbal extracts in the oil are in contact with the cranium or the frontal regions of the brain [ [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), [179](#B179-biomolecules-11-00543), [180](#B180-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Recent studies point to the role of the endothelial cells lining the CNS capillaries in facilitating the entry of the solutes from the oil into the frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex [ [17](#B17-biomolecules-11-00543), and Future Directions [1](#B1-biomolecules-11-00543), [2](#B2-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Thus, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of AD. While many new approaches to symptomatic treatment and disease-modifying therapy are currently under development for AD, the final outcome of their development to the market is uncertain [ [1](#B1-biomolecules-11-00543), [2](#B2-biomolecules-11-00543), [182](#B182-biomolecules-11-00543), [183](#B183-biomolecules-11-00543)]. A significant shift from a mono-therapeutic approach to a comprehensive, individualized, multi-therapeutic approach, especially for chronic and complex diseases such as AD, may be effective [ [13](#B13-biomolecules-11-00543), [14](#B14-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [15](#B15-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The approach is personalized and targets suboptimal metabolic parameters. Optimizing these metabolic parameters has proven effective in several individuals with early AD or the pre-AD conditions, MCI or SCI. [184](#B184-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Herbs are more commonly prescribed in isolation, as a mix of several herbs, as is the case with triphala, or as an herbal extract. Administration of a single herb or a mixture of herbs allows for more efficacy, less non-specific toxicity, and, more importantly, it avoids drug resistance. Herbs have a long track record of safety and efficacy, which is most likely due to their multiple components and to the interactions of these different components with multiple physiological targets in the body [ [21](#B21-biomolecules-11-00543), [22](#B22-biomolecules-11-00543), [185](#B185-biomolecules-11-00543)]. The synergy between different constituents in the herb has been documented in several pharmacological activities [ [186](#B186-biomolecules-11-00543)]. Synergistic interactions include, among others, complementary mechanisms of action, such as immunomodulation, the reversal of resistance, and minimizing adverse effects. Thus, it is not surprising that a single herb or a mixture of herbs is preferred over an isolated compound or its derivative [ [21](#B21-biomolecules-11-00543), [22](#B22-biomolecules-11-00543), [185](#B185-biomolecules-11-00543), [187](#B187-biomolecules-11-00543)]. [188](#B188-biomolecules-11-00543), [189](#B189-biomolecules-11-00543)].
