In a former life we'd traditionally reach for cold and flu tablets to help stifle the sniffles, however there are some powerful natural cold remedies you - and your family - can turn to instead. Here naturopath and author [Anthia Koullouros](https://ovvioorganics.com.au) reveals her cold and flu fighting secrets. ELDERBERRY \"I like it because of its immune boosting power. It contains active ingredients like anthocyanins - a bioflavanoid that can soothe inflammation and irritation and also act as an expectorant - which is the soothing of air passages to soothe a cough,'' Anthia says. How to use it; Choose organic dried elderberries to make an infusion. Steep 1 teaspoon per cup of boiled water for 3-5 minutes and drink 3 times per day. MANUKA HONEY \"Sourced from New Zealand, Manuka honey has unique properties not found in ordinary honey. It is traditionally used as an anti-bacterial and is [proven to inhibit the development of strep throat](http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.053959-0),\"says Anthia. How to use it; In the same way you use regular honey - try it drizzled in lemon and hot water OLIVE LEAF EXTRACT \"Olive leaf extract is an immune- bolstering antioxidant that provides an extra boost in winter. The active ingredient is Oleuropein - a polyphenol compound which is one of the most powerful antioxidants around. Antioxidants help to reduce free-radical activity - which may be associated with a weaker immune system,'' says Anthia. \"Look for an olive leaf extract that is Australian made and fresh-picked to ensure it is as close to nature as possible.\" How to use it; Available in capsules or as an oil "}
