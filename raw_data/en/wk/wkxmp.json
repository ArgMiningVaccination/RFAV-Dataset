Integrative therapies may help Balance disorders affect people physically and emotionally, making it essential to find treatments that address both aspects. The following integrative approaches have been used alongside traditional treatments to manage chronic dizziness and the mental health issues that can arise from both. - Cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat various conditions, including anxiety and depression, which commonly occur alongside balance issues. This therapy aims to change the way people think about their health issues and give people the tools to better respond to problems. For example, \"I'll never be able to get this dizziness under control!\" can be replaced with, \"I now know what my triggers are, and I'm going to learn how to avoid them.\" The therapy also teaches ways to cope with stressful life situations, which can worsen these health problems. - Mindfulness \u2014 Stress is a known trigger for dizziness. \"Moving meditation\" exercises such as yoga, tai chi and Pilates may help improve balance and help with stress management through controlled breathing, relaxation and guided imagery. Yoga, for example, can help quiet the mind and reduce anxiety. Specific yoga poses for balance include the warrior, tree and triangle poses. People with balance issues should take precautions while practicing these exercises, ensuring that balancing aids \u2014 such as a chair or wall \u2014 are nearby. - Biofeedback \u2014 Biofeedback helps people adapt to a balance disorder. Movement follows a cycle: An action is started and performed, and any movement errors are detected. A biofeedback device gathers this information about the body, offering a snapshot of how it reacts to a specific movement. Using this information, a person with balance issues can make adjustments to help improve balance. - Coaching \u2014 Patient education is a key part of managing all aspects of balance dysfunction. As part of a comprehensive treatment plan, health care providers work to inform patients about their conditions, including abilities, limitations, and whether this may be a short-term or long-term problem. They provide coaching on how to perform balancing-improvement tasks and how to adapt or modify movements should the task or situation change. An evaluation to look at potential home hazards, such as poor lighting and slippery floor surfaces, may be recommended. Modifications such as adding brighter lighting, installing handrails, placing phones near floor level (in case of a fall), and selecting footwear that's less of a trip or slip hazard may be discussed.
