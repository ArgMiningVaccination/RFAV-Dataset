The column drew a wide range of responses, mostly in defence of homeopathy. A selection of the responses are being published in ThePrint's new section called Free Speak: \"Some people need scientific explanation for everything. When we are born we are given a name after some rituals, and also in marriage we perform some rituals. Do they have in scientific explanation?\" I have a one year old patient who got better in six months for his skin complaints...is this placebo effect? First learn about homeopathy, Sir. Some people need scientific explanation for everything. When we are born we are given a name after some rituals, and also in marriage we perform some rituals. Do they have in scientific explanation? Homeopathy is science, first go through it and then see yourself what it is actually. No offense to anybody. -SUSHANT. \"At the age of nine, a homeopathic doctor gave me one medicine for 30 days and I was cured.\" The article is excellent and quite unexpected coming from Mr Shekhar Gupta. My only disconnect is with homeopathy as described by him. I was born with an ear defect \u2014pus used to come. No allopathic treatment was available and having an operation was not a sureshot cure\u2014my grandfather was a surgeon and was an FRCS. I was not allowed to swim. At the age of nine, a homeopathic doctor gave me one medicine for 30 days and I was cured. Since then, some 55 years later, there has been no recurrence despite swimming extensively. Hence, I can never accept that homeopathy is all hocus pocus. -HIMANSHU RASTOGI \"It is not justified to brand homeopathy as just trash. I have first hand experience of certain homeopathic drugs on cattle. They do work and quite miraculously.\" It is not justified to brand homeopathy as just trash. I have first hand experience of certain homeopathic drugs on cattle. They do work and quite miraculously. Homeopathic medicines are very effective in mastitis. Allopathic medicines have failed in completely curing blood in milk and hardness of udder. Three veterinary doctors have failed. Homeopathic medicines, Phytolacca, Bryonia, Belladonna, Calcaeria fluoricum, Ipecac have completely cured the problem. One cow was being treated with allopathic medicine for certain pathogens. The cow developed acute constipation and lack of appetite. Treatment for 21 days failed to yield any result. Four doses of Nux Vomica 30 was administered hourly. By evening, the cow passed normal dung and its appetite was also restored. I have tried so many medicines myself and they work instantaneously on cattle. The most important thing is homeopathy cures without any simultaneous decrease in milk yield. In the rural areas, where there is lack of hygiene, we come across cases of scabies in small children. We had to use allopathic scabiol on the affected part and use a special soap costing over Rs 70. It took days, even weeks to get rid of the problem. Recently, I used the homeopathic Anthrakokila (probably 6th or the 12th level of potency). It was completely gone in a week. A miracle...I will have to wait and see if it works equally on other cases of scabies. What is equally important is homeopathic treatment is very cheap compared to allopathic treatment. -PRADEEP KUMAR \"Your article can end up killing few cardiac patients who are being successfully treated with homeopathy.\" Your article can end up killing few cardiac patients who are being successfully treated with homeopathy. The cause of death may be the shock of taking \"ineffectual treatment\"\u2014which was in fact proving to be effective for them. Also many would-be beneficiaries of the homeopathic treatment may get dissuaded by the sheer negativity in your article about homeopathy. Wouldn't you feel bad that would-be beneficiaries would lose the opportunity to get better by your negative publicity, which is founded on half-data? This article that you have written on homeopathy needs further positive data. If you are a seeker of truth, and I believe you are, then you need to invite cases of efficacy of homeopathy and judge from those responses. If you wish, I can send you such cases of men and animals which will provide evidence of the positive therapeutic effects of homeopathy. -DR. ABHAY CHEDA \"Try to experience homeopathy, because science still has to wait a couple of centuries to find an explanation.\" Cases treated with homeopathy, that have been documented so well, have found ridicule in minds like yours (but with medical degrees) and the explanation given is that it is because of a placebo effect, or natural regression, or even \"magic\" (this is a true comment by a well known neurologist). When diseases like psoriasis and vitiligo (incurable according to textbook medicine, which you may not know of) are seen to be cured by a homeopath, and labelled cured because of placebo effect or natural regression, then a fundamental question arises: are all those homeopaths that lucky? It takes only luck for all \"hypochondriacs\" (according to your article) to accumulate at homeopathy clinics. That scenario sounds absurd: it would to anyone. Many allopathic doctors (with good practice, and hatred towards homeopathy) have turned to homeopathy. Do you really think they are hysterical? Many surgeons use Thuja (homeopathic remedy) for warts, do you believe the treatment is placebo? Please stay well informed to have sound views. Try to experience homeopathy, because science still has to wait a couple of centuries to find an explanation. -DR. MOHINAZ KANDOLKAR \"Let the writer confine his thoughts to the main point of bullet trains.\" Why should the writer link the bullet train with homeopathy? Many a times it works wonders, though it may not cure it. Let the writer confine his thoughts to the main point of bullet trains. -VISHWANATH \"In the context of bullet trains, I remember these homeopathy lovers also protested in the name of the poor in mid-eighties when Rajiv government introduced coloured telecast in India!\" A delightful factual account of our mindless protest by professional protesters. Almost every protest against large projects has been done in the name of India's poor and how the money could be better spent for them rather in the project. But the masses, poor or rich rarely protest against such projects, thankfully. The best way the government should respond is to ignore such manufactured and motivated protests. Other big risk factor are PILs and their proponents. This class of professional protesters are more dangerous since they have the capacity to influence courts and delay the project or may even get the courts to order closure. In the context of bullet trains, I remember these homeopathy lovers also protested in the name of the poor in mid-eighties when Rajiv government introduced coloured telecast in India! -SMRUTI RANJAN DAS \"If only we give up patchy approaches and chase newer ideas, India's story can be something we all want to see.\" Outstanding piece...if only we give up patchy approaches and chase newer ideas, India's story can be something we all want to see. The funny thing is we expect transformational results after doing patchwork.Thinking-and-doing beings are abhorred and that is what stops us. -ASHWANI WINDLASS \"Was quite amused by your comments on homeopathy! There's now scientific evidence that placebos actually work.\" The Luddites in our Society have always opposed any major technological leap but this time a lot of it stems from personal angst against Modi, BJP, and perhaps RSS. I am still waiting, but I am sure the Bullet Train will soon get linked to demonetisation, Hindutva, and the insidious RSS agenda. I was quite amused by the comments on homeopathy! There's now scientific evidence that placebos actually work. For a nation of hypochondriacs the little pills are a God-sent or Dr Banerji-sent, but you have no idea how opiods have become the homeopathic pills for Americans (fellow hypochondriacs!) and the damage they are doing. Maybe a Bollywood producer should try 'Udta Amrika'. Finally, let me leave you with a small personal anecdote. I am as rational a person (a post graduate Engineer) as you'll find, I come from a family of doctors and grew up listening to homeopathy being routinely trashed. Some 20 years ago I suffered massively from acute heartburn. It was so bad I'd sit up most nights sipping cold milk. I was prescribed Zantac, surgery, and a whole lot of other treatments. Nothing worked. A colleague suggested I meet his father-in-law who was an amateur homeopath. Am sure you've guessed the rest of the story...my family has still not forgiven me for getting well! -SATISH KALRA Homeopathic effect was there from many years before independence Homeopathic effect was there from many years before independence and after, till now no one spoken or written against this. The people who take homeopathy as ideology take for instance Indira Gandhi ideology during 1970, that lady just divided one whole nation to many states then followed divide and rule, followed by rivers where each state wants their own water. As far as I remember, in 1973 or 1975 there was an offer from the Russian government to link all the rivers like they did for Volga river for Rs. 15000 crores only. But our lady Macbeth never allowed this to happen she did not want to improve Hindustan's great ideology. -KRISHNA Comments have been edited for clarity. "}
