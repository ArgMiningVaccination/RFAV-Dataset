Addiction can be an unending, agonizing struggle for the person using drugs; suffering is needlessly compounded when people cannot access evidence- based care or are subjected to discrimination. The consequences of drug use can have ripple effects that hurt families, potentially across generations, as well as friends and colleagues. Using drugs can endanger health and mental health and is especially harmful in early adolescence. Illicit drug markets are linked with violence and other forms of crime. Drugs can fuel and prolong conflict, and the destabilizing effects as well as the social and economic costs hinder sustainable development. The whole of the international community shares the same goals of protecting the health and welfare of people everywhere. But too often in the debate on drug policy approaches, we forget this basic and shared understanding, which is rooted in the fact that drug use for non-medical purposes is harmful. We all want our children and loved ones to be healthy, and we want neighbourhoods and countries to be safe. As policymakers, we can see that illicit drug cultivation offers no way out for impoverished communities in the long run, that the drug trade has environmental impacts, and that drug trafficking along with associated corruption and illicit flows undermine the rule of law and stability. Solutions to these shared threats and challenges to achieve our shared goals must also be shared and based on evidence. It is in this spirit that I am proud to present the World Drug Report 2022 from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. This is the first World Drug Report of the post-pandemic world. While countries continue to grapple with COVID-19 and its consequences, we have emerged from cycles of lockdowns to confront a \"new normal\" . And we have found that the world post-pandemic remains one in crisis, faced with multiple conflicts, a continuing climate emergency and threat of recession, even as the multilateral order is showing troubling signs of strain and fatigue. World drug challenges further complicate the picture. Cocaine production is at a record high, and seizures of amphetamine and methamphetamine have skyrocketed. Markets for these drugs are expanding to new and more vulnerable regions. Harmful patterns of drug use likely increased during the pandemic. More young people are using drugs compared with previous generations. People in need of treatment cannot get it, women most of all. Women account for over 40 percent of people using pharmaceutical drugs for non-medical purposes, and nearly one in two people using amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), but only one in five in treatment for ATS is a woman. 4 WORLD DRUG REPORT 20225EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, POLICY IMPLICATIONS | Preface1 In the face of these multiple crises, we need to show greater care. Care starts with evidence-based prevention and addressing perceptions and misperceptions of risk, including by taking a hard look at the messages our societies are sending to young people. UNODC research has shown that perceptions of cannabis harms have decreased in areas where the drug has been legalized. At the same time, the proportion of people with psychiatric disorders and suicides associated with regular cannabis use has increased, together with the number of hospitalizations. Some 40 per cent of countries reported cannabis as the drug related to the greatest number of drug use disorders. Whole-of-society approaches are needed to ensure that people, young people most of all, have the information and develop the resilience to make good choices and that they can access science-based treatment and services for drug use disorders, HIV and related diseases when they need it. There can be no effective prevention or treatment without recognition of the problem and the necessary funding to address the problem. Public resources are stretched to the limit by competing demands, but we cannot afford to let commitment wane. We need to promote compassion and better understanding.Care in crises means ensuring services and essential medicines for all, including people in emergencies and humanitarian settings; people left behind in the pandemic; and people facing barriers of stigma and discrimination. Care is also manifested in shared responsibility, and we need to renew international cooperation to sustainably reduce illicit crop cultivation and tackle the criminal groups trafficking drugs. The World Drug Report seeks to offer the data and insights to inform our joint efforts. This year's edition delves into the interplay between drugs and conflict, the impact of drugs on the environment and the effects of cannabis legalization, and identifies dynamics to watch, from the opiate market in light of developments in Afghanistan to dark web drug sales. I hope the report serves as a basis for effective responses, and generates the support we need to continue shedding light on different aspects of the world drug problem, and assisting Member States to take action and save lives.

Target responses more effectively by improving the evidence base on the short- and long-term impacts of measures such as forced and voluntary crop eradication. Direct law enforcement resources to target maritime and container trafficking. Increase technical assistance to enhance the capacity of law enforce - ment authorities to detect and interdict cocaine in Africa and Asia, in locations where cocaine trafficking may be relatively new or inter - diction capacities low. Promote and facilitate post-seizure backtracking investigations with improved international cooperation to identify and dismantle trans - national organized criminal groups involved in drug trafficking and related financial flows. Tackle demand by increasing investment in evidence-based preven - tion to improve awareness, particularly among youth, of the health harms posed by cocaine. Invest in health interventions, as well as research into treating cocaine dependence. THE MARKET FOR COCAINE IS BOOMING, WITH NEW RECORD HIGHS IN MANUFACTURE AND HIGH LEVELS OF USE Cocaine manufacture reached a record high in 2020. Trafficking of cocaine likely continued to increase in 2020 despite the pandemic as global cocaine seizures (unadjusted for purity) increased to a new record high of 1,424 tons. Trafficking by sea, mainly in shipping containers, is growing, account - ing for nearly 90 per cent of cocaine seized globally in 2021. Seizure data suggest that trafficking is expanding to other regions outside the two main markets, North America and Europe, with increased levels of trafficking to Africa and Asia. Multiple indicators point to an overall increase in cocaine use over the past decade and early indications suggest that use is rising again in 2021 after a decline during the pandemic.35SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL COCAINE SEIZURES IN TRANSIT REGIONS OR EMERGING COCAINE MARKETS: AFRICA AND ASIA, 2020-2021 CHINA INDIAALGERIA MALI ANGOLASAUDI ARABIA KashmirJAPAN CAMEROON ZIMBABWEGHANAVIET NAMHong Kong, China Macao, China UNITED OF TANZANIAUGANDANEPALTUNISIA C\u00d4TE D'IVOIRESENEGAL GAMBIA MALAYSIA BENINTAJIKISTAN JORDAN TOGOBANGLADESHGEORGIA SYRIAN ARAB REP.AZERBAIJAN SRI LANKA MALDIVESREPUBLIC OF KOREA SIERRA LEONEARMENIA ISRAEL UNITED ARAB EMIRATES GUINEA-BISSAUQATARLEBANON SEYCHELLES Cocaine seizures (kg) 2020-2021 1 >1 - 10 >10 - 100 >100 - 1,000 >1,000 - 8,200 Excluded from analysis /no data available The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations.

Expand gender-sensitive services for drug treatment and HIV prevention, treatment and care, following the UNODC/WHO International Standards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders and ensuring that women seeking to access services feel welcome. Provide such interventions to ensure that women feel and are safe and not stigmatized, can exercise their childcare responsibilities and are supported with regard to other social, economic or legal needs, have access to sexual and reproductive health care and can receive support to address trauma and comorbid mental health disorders, giving priority care to pregnant women. The large majority of people who use drugs continue to be men, but women make up more than 40 per cent of people who use ATS and who engage in non-medical use of pharmaceutical stimulants, phar - maceutical opioids, sedatives and tranquillizers. Women who use drugs tend to progress to drug use disorders faster than do men. The gender treatment gap remains a global problem and is particu - larly acute for women who use ATS. Almost one of every two past-year ATS users is a woman, but only one in five people in treatment for ATS disorders is a woman. Cannabis, the most used drug worldwide, is also used more by men than by women, but the gender gap is narrowing, notably in North America, where the level of use is particularly high.37WHILE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS ARE MEN, WOMEN USE SOME DRUG TYPES NEARLY AS MUCH AS MEN; AND WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN DRUG TREATMENT PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS BY SEX Africa Central sedatives and use of pharmaceutical stimulantsNon-medical use of pharmaceutical opioids/seven.tf/zero.tf/percent.lf /three.tf/zero.tf/percent.lf/four.tf/seven.tf/percent.lf/five.tf/three.tf/percent.lf/four.tf/nine.tf/percent.lfUsers of selected drug groups by sexFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS POLICY IMPLICATIONS38Develop national drug prevention systems that reach children as early as possible in their development and focus on building resilience in accordance with the UNODC/WHO International Standards on Drug Use Prevention, helping the children of today grow into the healthy adolescents of tomorrow. Reach out to and involve adolescents, disseminating prevention messages on social media and other online platforms to counter the use of these channels for promoting drug use and facilitating the illicit drug supply, in order to minimize drug-related harms and discourage consumption. Promote prevention and treatment options for young people who use drugs and young people with drug use disorders that are backed by evidence, including: >Mental health services for people with mental health disorders diagnosed at an early age, along with support to their families in managing the situation regarding such disorders, including through parenting skills training; >Screening, brief interventions and health services referral, main - streamed in the community and in education systems; >Family therapy. For children and youth that have been exposed to drugs at a very young age and/or are in particularly deprived circumstances, such as street children, provide educational opportunities, vocational skills training and other socioeconomic support.The majority of people being treated for drug use disorders in Africa and Latin America are under the age of 35. Young people aged 15-16 have a global annual prevalence of canna - bis use of 5.8 per cent, compared with 4.1 per cent of the population aged 15-64. Young people typically report a higher level of drug use than do adults, and in many countries drug use levels among young people are higher today than in past generations.YOUNG PEOPLE CONTINUE TO USE MORE DRUGS THAN ADULTS, AND HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF USE THAN IN PAST GENERATIONS39GLOBAL CANNABIS USE ACCORDING TO AGE AND GENDER Age /one.tf/five.tf-/one.tf/six.tf Age /one.tf/seven.tf-/two.tf/four.tf Age /two.tf/five.tf-/three.tf/four.tf Age /three.tf/five.tf-/six.tf/four.tf Age /one.tf/five.tf-/one.tf/six.tf Age /two.tf/five.tf-/three.tf/four.tf Age /three.tf/five.tf-/six.tf/four.tfFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS POLICY IMPLICATIONS40Provide more resources to increase access to evidence-based and voluntary services, in accordance with the UNODC/WHO Inter - national Standards for the Treatment of Drug Use Disorders. Integrate outreach, psychosocial, pharmacological, health-care and social support services to better protect the health of people who use drugs and people with drug use disorders and promote their recovery, while developing quality assurance mechanisms to pro - mote effectiveness, and ensure that services are humane and avoid punishment or stigmatization. To prevent opioid overdose deaths, promote opioid-assisted therapy, supporting recovery and preventing overdose, as well as the community-based provision of naloxone, allowing for the safe, on-the-spot management of opioid overdoses. Invest in research on the treatment of stimulant use disorders, while advancing the dissemination of psychosocial therapies that have been found to be effective, such as contingency management, cognitive behavioural therapy and family therapy. As more people are initiating the use of and regularly using canna - bis, and the costs of cannabis use to public health systems may be higher than generally assumed, develop a clear and comprehensive methodology to more accurately estimate the social costs of cannabis use and its impact on public health. In order to leave no one behind in the provision of drug-related health services, ensure that drug treatment services, as well as HIV prevention, treatment and care, for people who use drugs are available in prison settings. Opioids remain the most lethal drugs. In North America, fentanyls are driving overdose deaths to new record highs: 91,799 overdose deaths were recorded in the United States in 2020, and the provisional estimate for 2021 is 107,622 deaths. Canada reported a 95 per cent increase in opioid overdose deaths in the first year of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. While cannabis is rarely associated with direct drug-related mortal - ity, it accounts for a substantial share of global drug-related harm, due in large part to its high prevalence rates. Some 40 per cent of countries reported cannabis as the drug related to the greatest number of drug use disorders, and 33 per cent reported it as the main drug for those in drug treatment. Increases in cannabis use are posing new burdens to health- care systems. In Africa and some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the largest proportion of people in drug treatment are those seeking help for cannabis use disorders. As the potency of cannabis products has increased, together with regular and frequent cannabis use, cannabis use disorders and psy - chiatric comorbidities have also risen in Western Europe. Cannabis use accounted for 31 per cent of people who entered specialized drug treatment services in the European Union in 2019. But there are clear regional differences in the primary drug reported by people entering drug treatment: in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and in most of Asia, opioid use disorders were the leading cause for people in drug treatment; in most of Latin America, it was cocaine use disorders; and in East and South-East Asia and Australia and New Zealand, it was ATS, in particular methamphetamine.

Invest in research into the effects of cannabis use, especially the health consequences of the use of cannabis products with high THC content, including on youth, women and women during pregnancy. Address misperceptions of the risks of cannabis use through evi - dence-based prevention messages, targeting youth in particular. Prioritize public health and safety as commercial interests lobby to expand the market for legal cannabis. Draw from the lessons learned from the tobacco, alcohol and ultra-processed food industries, as well as the pharmaceutical industry and documented cases where the pursuit of commercial interests has targeted vulnerable or dis - advantaged groups, and competed with public health concerns.Cannabis legalization appears to have accelerated the upwards trends in reported daily use of the drug, with a pronounced increase in reported frequent use of high-potency products among young adults. In contrast, the prevalence of cannabis use among adolescents has not changed much. The proportion of people with psychiatric disorders and suicides associated with regular cannabis use has increased, as has the number of hospitalizations due to cannabis use disorders. Cannabis products have diversified, and average levels of THC in the various cannabis products have continued to increase, to levels up to 60 per cent in some markets. The growing influence and investments of large corporations, including those in the alcohol and tobacco sectors, is evident in the legal cannabis industry. Tax revenues from the legalized market have continued to rise. The illegal cannabis market is shrinking in some jurisdictions, but it continues to exist alongside legal markets. Legalization has led to a major reduction in the number and rates of arrest of people for cannabis-related offences. However, since possession of cannabis remains a criminal offence for minors, legal - ization has not led to a substantial reduction in youth arrest rates. EARLY INDICATIONS SUGGEST THAT CANNABIS LEGALIZATION HAS HAD A WIDE-RANGING IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY, MARKET DYNAMICS, COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPONSES 45EARLY INDICATIONS SUGGEST THAT CANNABIS LEGALIZATION HAS HAD A WIDE-RANGING IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY, MARKET DYNAMICS, COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPONSES IMPACT OF CANNABIS LEGALIZATIONIMPACT OF CANNABIS marketCrime ReplacementProducts FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS POLICY IMPLICATIONS46THE IMPACT OF DRUGS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL Mainstream the objective of \"do no harm to the environment\" in drug policy responses at the global, national and local levels to minimize their environmental impact and contribute directly or indirectly to the protection of the environment and biodiversity, and climate change mitigation. Develop new, dedicated international standards to support Member States and the international community in systematically integrating environmental protection into the design and monitoring of alter - native development programmes. Such standards can build on recent experience and existing tools, such as the FAO Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Gover - nance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security of 2012, the United Nations Guiding Princi - ples on Alternative Development of 2013 and the FAO environmental and social management guidelines of 2015. Guiding standards should seek to bring the environmental impact of the illicit cultivation of plant-based drugs into the broader debate about agricultural production. Alternative development programmes should balance environmental concerns with commercial, produc - tion-related objectives, considering choices between intensive agriculture and organic farming, land sparing and land sharing, and small- and large-scale farming. Specific complementary strategies that can be adopted in alterna - tive development programmes include carbon credit schemes, payment for environmental services and agroecology, approaches that can strengthen the environmental components of programmes while also bringing other benefits such as income generation and access to new markets. Adopt legal frameworks that encompass the environmentally respon - sible disposal of equipment and precursors and other chemicals used in the clandestine manufacture of drugs, and enhance the capacity of law enforcement authorities to safely handle and dispose of such materials, as well as to destroy seized drugs. Undertake targeted research to better understand the extent and dynamics of the links between drug trafficking and deforestation, including in relation to illicit cattle ranching and other money-laun - dering-related investment. The longer-term effects of drugs on biodiversity require closer examination, including to determine the effects of long-term or chronic exposure of wildlife to drugs, their metabolites or drug waste in wildlife ecosystems, as well as effects along the food chain, for example, the impacts on people who con - sume exposed fish.The impact of illicit drugs on the environment is not significant at the global level, but the effects can be significant in terms of the local, community or individual-level impact. Available studies suggest that drug supply chains have a large carbon footprint impact per quantity produced. For example, 1 kilogram of cocaine has a carbon footprint 30 times greater than 1 kilogram of cocoa beans. The carbon footprint of cannabis grown indoors is, mainly due to its energy use, an average of 16 to 100 times greater than that of out - door cannabis. Illicit drug crop cultivation often takes place in fragile ecosystems that have a protected status, such as national parks and forest reserves, and it can act as a driver or catalyst of deforestation. Defor - estation associated with illicit coca cultivation can be substantial. For some communities, the amount of drug waste produced during the manufacture of synthetic drugs can be substantial. The waste generated during the synthesis process of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA is between 5 and 30 times the volume of the end product. The use of pre-precursors and pre-pre-precursors increases the amount of waste. The dumping and discharge of waste created in drug manufacture can have an impact on the soil, water and air, with indirect effects on organisms, animals and the food chain. Cleaning of seized synthetic drug-related waste, storage sites or manufacturing laboratories is costly and can create risks for public safety. Some alternative development projects have included environmen - tal protection components, such as reforestation and agroforestry, while others have pioneered instruments such as carbon credits and schemes involving payment for environmental services. 47 Cultivation Alkaloid extractionAlkaloid puri/f_ication from coca pasteWaste disposal/two.lf/four.lf/percent.lf /one.lf/four.lf/percent.lf /two.lf/percent.lf /six.lf/zero.lf/percent.lf DISTRIBUTION OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF COCAINE PRODUCTION IN THE REGIONS OF CATATUMBO AND PUTUMAYO, COLOMBIA DISTRIBUTION OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF COCAINE PRODUCTION IN THE REGIONS OF CATATUMBO AND PUTUMAYO, COLOMBIAROUTES OF SYNTHETIC DRUG PRODUCTION WASTE TO THE ENVIRONMENT (Pre-)precursors, reaction mediaDrug production laboratory Drugs Transport/distribution Consumption Human excretion Wastewater treatment plant Surface water SedimentSoil GroundwaterSolid/ Liquid waste TransportationROUTES OF SYNTHETIC DRUG PRODUCTION WASTE TO THE ENVIRONMENTFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS POLICY IMPLICATIONS48Integrate drug policy approaches into conflict and peacebuilding responses, and when addressing crises and weak rule of law, to stop organized crime and other groups from exploiting conflict situations and prevent the illicit drug trade from contributing to violence and instability. Encourage more complex and deep investigation of transnational crimes, aimed at revealing and dismantling related financial flows, with a view to minimizing the potential for using the proceeds of illicit drug manufacture and trafficking to fuel conflicts. Monitor conflict situations for emerging drug threats: seizure data suggest that heroin trafficking through Ukraine, as well as amphet - amine manufacture in the country, had been increasing prior to the start of the war in February 2022. Continuing conflict may have dis - rupted and/or displaced these flows. Strengthen information-sharing and law enforcement capacity- building to prevent and counter challenges emerging from conflict situations, in neighbouring countries but also in areas that may serve as alternate drug trafficking routes.Illicit drug economies can flourish in situations of conflict and weak rule of law, and can, in turn, prolong or fuel conflict. Plant-based drugs such as cocaine and opiates have been used in the past by parties to finance conflict, for example, in Colombia and Afghanistan. Parties to a conflict have also used the illicit drug trade to generate income by levying \"taxes\" on the drug trade, for example, in the Sahel. Information from the Middle East and South-East Asia suggests that conflict situations can act as a magnet for the manufacture of syn - thetic drugs, which can be manufactured anywhere; this effect may be greater when the conflict area is near large consumer markets. The number of dismantled amphetamine laboratories in Ukraine rose from 17 in 2019 to 79 in 2020, the highest number of seized amphetamine laboratories reported in any country in 2020. The laboratories were likely to have been small, but the high number seized before the war indicates capacity to produce synthetic drugs in the country, which could expand as the conflict persists. Conflicts may also disrupt and shift drug trafficking routes, as seen during the Yugoslav wars with heroin trafficking routes through the Balkans (which remain among the key trafficking routes for opiates from Afghanistan), and more recently in Ukraine, where, accounts suggest, drug trafficking may have decreased since early 2022.ILLICIT DRUG ECONOMIES CAN FLOURISH IN SITUATIONS OF CONFLICT AND WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND CAN, IN TURN, PROLONG OR FUEL CONFLICT49WEAK RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO THE ILLICIT DRUG TRADE illicit drug economies /f_lourishparties to the con/f_lict bene/f_it by taxing the drug tradedrug tracking routes are distrupted existing plant-based drugs production is used to /f_inance the con/f_lictWEAK RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO THE ILLICIT DRUG TRADE con/f_lict acts as a \"magnet\" for the manufacture of synthetic drugs DYNAMICS TO WATCH DYNAMICS TO WATCH52 SOME EVIDENCE IS EMERGING ON THE LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF FORCED AND VOLUNTARY ERADICATION Data assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of different meth - ods of eradicating illicit drug crops remain scant. A matched difference-in-differences analysis to estimate the effects of forced and voluntary eradication on areas of coca cultivation in Colombia found the following: >Forced eradication resulted in an initial decrease in illicit drug crop cultivation due to the direct removal of coca bush. How - ever, subsequently, cultivation increased at a higher rate that in similar areas where no forced eradication took place. Over the next 10 years, the \"eradication gain\" - the gap in illicit drug crop cultivation between areas that underwent eradication and areas that did not - is projected to disappear altogether, sug - gesting that one-off forced eradication yields no long-term benefits. >Voluntary eradication , conducted in coordination with alternative development interventions, led to an initial increase in cultivation due to \"perverse incentive\" effects (as some farmers may believe that they need to illicitly cultivate coca bushes to participate in the project). But over time, illicit drug crop cultivation decreased at a greater rate in areas with voluntary eradication and alternative development than in areas without. The \"eradication gain\" is projected to continue increasing over the next decade. SOME EVIDENCE IS EMERGING ON THE LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF FORCED AND VOLUNTARY ERADICATION Forced eradication Voluntary eradication conducted along with alternative development interventions led to an initial increase due to \"perverse incentive\" eects but over time, illicit drug crop cultivation decreased at a higher rate in areas with voluntary eradication. resulted in an initial decrease in illicit drug crop cultivation due to the direct removal of coca bushes. However, cultivation later increased at a higher rate compared to similar areas where no forced eradication took place. 53 DYNAMICS TO WATCHFuture developments in the global opiate market largely depend on the situation in Afghanistan, which accounted for 86 per cent of illicit opium production in 2021. Global opium production has followed a long-term upward trend over the past two decades, and in 2021 production was up 7 per cent from the previous year, primarily as a result of higher opium yields in Afghanistan. The 2021 harvest took place from April to July, before the takeover by the de facto Taliban authorities in August. The socioeconomic conditions faced by people in Afghanistan, who are experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis, may act as an incentive to increase illicit opium poppy cultivation. Opium prices have risen since the beginning of August 2021, which may also have an impact. The effects of the ban on opium poppy cultivation, announced in Afghanistan in April 2022, and its application and enforcement remain to be seen, but changes in opium production in Afghanistan will have implications for opiate markets in virtually all regions of the world.

Methamphetamine manufacture and use have risen in Afghanistan in recent years, and the drug is being trafficked to the wider region. Accounts suggest that use of methamphetamine and \"captagon\" tablets is rising in South-West Asia and beyond, in particular in Iraq, although no recent estimates are available. Seizures in the Gulf suggest that a methamphetamine market may emerge there, too. The dramatic expansion of methamphetamine markets is illustrated in Mexico, for example, where treatment admissions for the drug have outnumbered those for alcohol, and where people entering treatment for methamphetamine use disorders increased by 218 per cent from 2013 to 2020. Seizures of the drug and its growing popularity among some user groups suggest that a methamphetamine market is also expanding in Western and Central Europe. Clandestine laboratories are becoming bigger and are manufacturing larger quantities.

The departure point for trafficking continues to be in the Levant (the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon), with destinations in the Gulf countries reached either directly by land and sea, or indirectly through Europe and possibly North Africa. Recent seizures in East Asia and West Africa point to further geographical expansion of the \"captagon\" market.

Although sales volumes on the dark web have fluctuated over the years, reflecting the frequent emergence and demise of individual darknet markets, available data suggest that drug-related sales on the dark web increased in 2020 from 2019, and a smaller increase was observed in 2021. Research shows a marked increase in people reporting purchasing drugs on the dark web over the period from January 2014 to January 2021 followed by a decline until January 2022, likely because some darknet markets were dismantled by the authorities or underwent exit scams, while alternative platforms, such as social media and encrypted messenger services, may have also played a role.DRUG MARKETS ON THE DARK WEB CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND SHOW GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION DAILY SALES (MINIMUM, MOSTLY DRUGS) ON 38 MAJOR GLOBAL Road 2 Agora Evoluon Alphab ay Dream M arket Empire Cannaz on Hydra Market White House web data (see online Methodological Annex).

LONG-TERM TRENDS IN QUANTITIES OF DRUGS SEIZED, 1998-2020DYNAMICS TO WATCH58 There are signs that drug use patterns may have become more harm - ful during the pandemic. At the same time, there was less access to services (prevention, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and overdose) for people who use drugs. Data show the shortage in drug treatment provision during 2020 in all regions. More recent data from studies into the early impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on drug use show the frequency of cannabis use and the quantities used have increased, while the number of users has remained stable.Relapse, as well as the risk of relapse and drug use-related risk behaviours, increased in several countries during the pandemic. Women who use drugs may be disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The decrease in the use of the drugs particularly consumed at rec - reational venues during the pandemic was likely short-lived, and early data suggest that such use may have already rebounded.PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS WERE LESS ABLE TO ACCESS DRUG TREATMENT SERVICES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHILE DRUG USE RISKS INCREASED Increases in overall cannabis consumption, mostly due to increased frequency and quantity used by existing users rather than recruitment of new users Decreases in drug use of adolescents which coincided with lockdown periods Regular drug use less aected, but users with drug use disorders more often experienced withdrawal and relapse.

Tramadol accounted for 55 per cent of reported quantities of pharmaceutical opioids seized in 2016\u20142020, followed by codeine (38 per cent), mostly seized in the form of cough syrups, as well as fentanyl and its analogues (3 per cent). However, when those seizure amounts are converted into defined daily doses, the order of importance becomes clear: 90 per cent of defined daily doses of synthetic opioids seized in 2020 were of fentanyls. The two epidemics of non-medical use of opioids, one related to illicitly manufactured fentanyls in North America and the other one involving non-medical use of tramadol in North and West Africa, the Near and Middle East and South-West Asia, continue to pose great health risks. In Africa, non-medical use of tramadol has likely been spreading, as reflected in increasing drug treatment demand in some countries. There is indication of non-medical use of tramadol in other regions as well, in particular South Asia, South-East Asia, Central Asia, North America and Europe.In the United States and Canada, overdose deaths, predominantly driven by use of fentanyls, remain at record high levels. Fentanyls are typically laced with heroin or other adulterated drugs, and they are also sold in falsified medicines. Use of fentanyls has been reported by several other countries, although currently, there are no indica - tions of an epidemic of non-medical use and related health consequences outside North America. However, fentanyls remain a potential threat in opioid markets. The spread of fentanyls could occur rapidly if market dynamics were to result in the shortage of the main opioid used in any of the markets. 65MAIN HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF NON-MEDICAL OPIOID USE Contracting hepatitis C (about half of PWID, global estimate) If untreated, liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death may follow.

The World Drug Report 2022 was prepared before that date and thus uses the former name in its reporting and analysis, except for the maps that were finalized more recently. b References to Kosovo shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). 72 WORLD DRUG REPORT 2022Consisting of five separate booklets, the World Drug Report 2022 provides an in-depth analysis of global drug markets and examines the nexus between drugs and the environ - ment within the bigger picture of the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change and environmental sustainability. Booklet 1 summarizes the four subsequent booklets by reviewing their key findings and highlighting policy implications based on their conclusions. Booklet 2 provides an overview of the global demand for and supply of drugs, including an analysis of the relationship between illicit drug economies and situations of conflict and weak rule of law. Booklet 3 reviews the latest trends in the global markets for opioids and cannabis at the global and regional levels, and includes a discussion of the potential impact of changes in opium poppy cultivation and opium production in Afghanistan, and an analysis of early indications of the impact of cannabis legalization on public health, public safety, market dynamics and criminal justice responses in selected jurisdictions. Booklet 4 presents the latest trends in and estimates of the markets for various stimulants - cocaine, amphetamines and \"ecstasy\" - and new psychoactive substances, both at the global level and in the most affected subregions, including an analysis of different coca bush eradication strategies and a focus on the expansion of the methamphetamine market in South-West Asia. Booklet 5 delves into the nexus between drugs and the environment, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of research into the direct and indirect effects of illicit drug crop cultivation and drug manufacture, as well as drug policy responses on the environment. The World Drug Report 2022 is aimed not only at fostering greater international coopera - tion to counter the impact of the world drug problem on health, governance and security, but also, with its special insights, at assisting Member States in anticipating and address- ing threats from drug markets and mitigating their consequences.
