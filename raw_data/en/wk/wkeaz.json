When scaled down to the nanosize, nanoscale metal -organic frameworks (nMOFs) have been explored for applications in diagnosis, imaging, and biomedicine by virtue of their structural and functional tunability. In this dissertation, we have further demonstr ated the use of nMOFs in cancer therapies and pH sensing in live cells. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the basic concepts of nMOFs and their potential applications. I also provide brief overviews on cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT), checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and RNA interference. Chapter 2 describes the rational design of the first porphyrin -based nMOF, DBP -Hf, for PDT of resistant head and neck cancer . In the nMOF design, porphyrin ligands are incorporated as the strut to maximize the loading of p hotosensitizers; the porosity and plate morphology of the nMOF facilitate the diffusion of the reactive oxygen species; the coordination of the ligands to Hf centers improve the performance of the photosensitizers. Thus, the nMOF display s greatly enhanced PDT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo , representing a new class of promising PDT agents for resistant cancer treatment. xvii Chapter 3 reports the design of first chlorin -based nMOF, DBC -Hf, with even more enhanced PDT efficacy. Chlorin is the reduced form of porphyrin and exhibits much improved photophysical properties for PDT application. While inheriting the crystallinity, stability, porosity, and nanoplate of the DBP ligand to chlorin red - shifts the absorption by 13 nm a nd increases the extinction coefficient by 11 fold. DBC -Hf thus outperforms DBP -Hf in PDT of two colon cancer mouse models. Chapter 4 details the design of another chlorin -based nMOF with large 1 -D channels for combination of PDT and checkpoint blockade i mmunotherapy. A small molecular inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is encapsulated into the MOF channels to alter the tumor microenvironment, which synergizes with the nMOF -mediated PDT to elicit systemic antitumor immune response. The synergis tic combination therapy achieve s effective local and distant tumor rejection in colorectal cancer models. We also elucidated the underlying immunological mechanisms and revealed compensatory roles of neutrophils and B cells in presenting tumor - associated a ntigens to T cells in this combination therapy. Chapter 5 describes the first use of an nMOF as a co -delivery system of chemotherapeutics and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A cisplatin prodrug was encapsulated into the pores of the nMOF and pooled siRNAs were loaded onto the nanocrystal surface by coordination to the metal sites. n MOFs protect siRNAs from nuclease degradation, enhance siRNA cellular uptake, and promote siRNA escape from endosomes to silence MDR genes in cisplatin -resistant ovarian cancer cells. Co -delivery of cisplatin and siRNAs with nMOFs led to an order of magnitude enhancement in chemotherapeutic efficacy in vitro . xviii Chapter 6 illustrates the first use of an nMOFs for intracellular pH sensing in live cells. Fluorescein TC) was covalently conjugated to exceptionally FITC loadings, efficient fluorescence, and excellent ratiometric pH -sensing properties. Live cell imaging studies revealed endo and exocytosis of the nMOF and endosome acidification in real time (videos available as supplementary files ). Fluorescently labeled nMOFs thus represent a new class of nanosensors for intracellular pH sensing and provide an excellent tool for studying nMOF -cell interactions. xix Acknowledgement s It has been a long way of learning before I can write this dissertation.

Introduction 1.1 Metal -organic frameworks Metal -organic frameworks (MOFs), al so known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are a class of crystalline, porous hybrid materials constructed from metal -containing nodes, also known as secondary building units (SBUs), bridged by organic linkers. The archetypal MOF is Prussian blue,1 a dark blue pigment with a cubic crystal structur e constructed from Fe(II) -CN- Fe(III) coordination units. MOFs have been an object of intense study since the 1990s because of their tunability and versatility. Their application to issues as imaging,33-36 and drug delivery35,37-43 have b een intensively explored. The ability to control coordination bond formation between the SBUs and the linkers allows for orthogonal design of the MOF structures (Figure 1 -1).44 By selecting metals with the desired coordi nation chemistry and ligands with the desired geometry, MOF structures can be designed with significant precision.45-48 Functionalities can thus be intentionally incorporated into MOFs by focusing on its components: the ligand,46,49,50 the SBU sites,26,44,49-52 the channels,53-56 and the surface of the material.57 2 Figure 1 -1 Lattice structure s (middle), corresponding SBUs (left), and organic linkers (right) of a variety of MOFs .

Copyright 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Due to lanthanide contraction, hafnium and zirconium are approximately the same size and thus similar in their coordination chemistry. Zr4+ and Hf4+ are hard acid metal ions that exhibit high affinity to ox ygen. As a result, Zr and Hf can form strong bonds with carboxylates to build exceptionally water -stable MOFs. Zr - and -based because Zr/Hf 3 oxides and phosphates are not very soluble in water so they are not bioavailable to in terrupt protein and nucleic acid functions in vivo . For example, zirconium phosphate has extremely low solubility (K sp=10-134), which demonstrates the high affinity of Zr(IV) to phosphate ions. We thus anticipated an accelerated decomposition rate of Zr/Hf -MOFs inside cells, where the phosphate concentration is significantly higher than the extracellular environment.58,59 For these reasons, we believe that Zr/Hf based MOFs should be suitable for biomedical applications. Several types of Zr -oxo clusters have been previously reported.48,60-64 Of these, Zr 6(3- O)4(3-OH) 4 is the most common option for highly stable MOFs.65-69 UiO65 and MOF -54566 are two typical examples. In UiO MOFs, all 12 edges of the Zr 6 octahedron are bridged by carboxylates, and the 8 faces are each capped by ligands to build a face -centered cubic structure ( 3, Figure 1 -2a,d), with a formula of Zr 6(3-O)4(3-OH) 4L6 (L refers to the ligand, similarly hereafter). In the MOF -545 structure, only 8 edges of the Zr 6 octahedron are bridged by carboxylates, a nd the remaining coordination sites on an equatorial plan are occupied by water or hydroxyl groups (Figure 1 -2b). The 4(OH) 4(H2O)4L2 (Figure 1 -2 e,f). This structure features a large 1 - D channel along the [001] direction with a channel diameter of 3.3 nm. We also discovered a new structure ( nMOF -1) constructed from linear dicarboxylate 12 SBU, [Zr 6(3-O)4(3-OH) 4(CO 2)9]2(2-OH) 6, which can be viewed as two Zr 6 clusters bridged by six 2-OH (Figure 1 -2c). Each Zr 6 cluster coordinates to 6 carboxylates from the linear dicarboxylate ligands on the equatorial plane to form a 2 -D layer, and the other ligands link 4 above and below to connect between layers (Figure 1 -2 g,h). The Zr 12 clusters thereby adopt an ABAB packing style along the c axis to form a trigonal structure ( 31). Figure 1 -2 Structure models of and Zr/Hf; red, O; gray, C.

Attachment to the linkers or nodes is a better option for postsynthetic functionalization if the attachment strength, feasibility of loading, and the release of cargo can be well balanced. nMOFs directly built from active agents have unique challenges because they require specific alignment of coordination sites, and the functionality of the cargo may be affected after constructing the framework. However, successful cases usually achieve ultra-high payloads, and we have shown that our nMOFs can perform significantly better than the free cargo. 6 Figure 1 -3 Different strategies for loading cargo into nMOFs , (a) Encapsulation in the channels; (b) attachment to the linkers; (c) coordination to the SB Us; (d) used as struts; (e) serving as connection nodes. The red balls represent the cargo. 1.3 Cancer Cancer is a major public health concern worldwide. It is currently the second leading cause of death in the United States, with ~1.7 million new cases e stimated in 2016.100 However, owing to rapid development of cancer treatment technology, the death rate is decreasing despite the increase in number of new cases every year. Figure 1 -4 summarizes the incidence and death rate by sex in the United States. Lung , prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancer are the most lethal cancer types for men, and lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer most fatal for women. Here we will introduce a few types of cancer related to our work. 7 Figure 1 -4 Ten Leading Cancer Types for the Estimated New Cancer Cases and Deaths by Sex, United States, 2016 .

Copyright 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1.3.1 Head and neck cancer Head and neck cancer i s a group of biologically similar epithelial malignancies that arise in the head or neck region (including the nasal cavity, sinuses, lips, mouth, salivary glands, throat, and larynx). Primary treatment of head and neck cancers include surgery and radiatio n therapy, with chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy serving as a secondary treatment.101 Almost all of 8 these epithelial malignanc ies are squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), and of those affected, about two -thirds will develop advanced stage disease, commonly involving regional lymph nodes.102 At least 50% of patients with locally advanced SCCHN relapse, usuall y within the first 2 years of treatment.101 Surgery remains the mainstay treatment of SCCHN but requires wide excision margins a nd usually causes functional deficits by damaging adjacent structures.103 Radiotherapy gives good prognosis on early stage tumors but is problematic for recurrent disease due to cumulative toxicity.104 Chemotherapy develops from a palliative care to a central component of trea tment in SCCHN,105 though systemic toxic ity and drug resistance remain a concern. Targeted therapy, such as cetuximab for EGFR inhibition, has emerged as a novel treatment strategy for SCCHN.106 Since SCCHN is usually superficial, photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a potential alternative treatment modality. PDT is a localized therapy that can minim ize peripheral tissue damage, and the lack of cumulative tissue toxicity enables repeated treatments without excluding the possibility of other treatments.107 It is as effective as surgery or radiotherapy for small superficial tumors and also works as a last recourse for recurrent head and neck cancer in patients who have failed conventional therapy.108 1.3.2 Colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is cancer that begins in the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer ranks third in both incidence and death rate for both sexes.100 Only 40% of patients with colorectal cancer are diagnosed at a local stage, for which the 5 -year survival rate is 90.3%, while for regional and distant metastatic stages the survival drops to 70.4% and 12.5%, respectively.109 9 Chemotherapy has been the mainstay treatment of colorectal cancer.110 Cocktails of a few chemotherapeutic drugs, such as FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin)111 and FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotec an),112 have become gold standards in the first - line treatment of colorectal cancer. Moreover, better understanding of the biology of colorectal cancer promotes the combination of chemotherapy with targeted therapy drugs such as cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumu mab in the clinic.113-115 Despite developments in colorectal cancer treatment, the high probability of metastases remains an issue that cause over one third of death eventually.109 The limitations of sur gery and adjuvant chemo/radio/targeted therapies to treat metastatic colorectal cancer urge the development of novel approaches.116 Immunotherapy is the most welcome candidate, since antitumor immunity generated by stimulation of the host immune system is likely capable of controlling metastatic tumor growth. However, combination with other treatment modalities is necessary to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy and increase the durable response rate. Unlike most of the commonly used cancer therapies, which are immunosuppressive at treatment doses,117,118 PDT can stimul ate the immune system to recognize and destroy distant metastases during treatment of the primary tumor, owing to a consequent acute inflammatory reaction.119 Nevertheless, the studies of PDT on colorectal cancer are still in a preclinical stage. 1.3.3 Ovarian cancer Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer with a high mortality rate that has remained unchanged over the pa st four decades.120,121 Modern management helps a significant proportion of women attain complete remiss ion in response to treatments, but most of those with 10 the advanced disease will develop recurrence within 18 months.122 Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type, with about 22,000 cases diagnosed each year in the United States.123 Due to the nature of this disease, debulking surgery is only auxiliary to chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer. Platinum drugs (cisplatin or the less toxic carboplatin) in combinatio n with paclitaxel or docetaxel have been the standard of care for past decades.122 Other strategies, such as targeted therapy and hormone therapy, have been explored, but little improvement in overall survival has been achieved.89,124 The dismal prognosis of ovarian cancer is in large part due to acquired resistance to chemotherapy.125 Though initial epithelial ovarian cancer is responsive to platinum drug based chemotherapy,126 relapses are often refractory to treatment and ultimately lead to mortality.127 New strategies to overcome drug resistance are urgently needed in order to reduce the mortality rate of ovarian cancer. Treatment of cancers with chemotherapy drugs often results in multidrug resistance (MDR). The suggested resistance mechanism includes memb rane transportation alteration, genetic responses, DNA repair enhancement, target molecules alteration, metabolic effects, and growth factor influence.128 Resistance pathways and m utations have been deeply explored both genetically and epigenetically,89,129-131 and a number of inhibitors targeting MDR genes or proteins have been developed in recent years.131-133 However, none of the new agents have significantly influenced the diagnosis and tr eatment of ovarian cancer in the clinic.134 1.4 Photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a phototherapy that combines three nontoxic components \u2014 a photosensitizer (PS), a light source, and oxygen in the tissue \u2014to destroy tumors and other 11 malignancies.135 PDT transfers energy from the light -excited PS to oxygen and other molecules in the tissue to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly, singlet oxygen (1O2), which induces cellular toxicity (Figure 1 -5).135,136 PDT can lead to localized destructi on of diseased tissues via selective uptake of the PS and/or local exposure to light, providing a minimally invasive cancer therapy. Figure 1 -5 The mechanism of photodynamic therapy . The application of PDT to cancer treatment dates back to the 1970s, w hen hematoporphyrin derivatives were studied for PDT efficacy in vivo .135 The first PDT agent photofrin\u00ae was approved for clinical use in 1993. Most PSs on the market are from the porphyrin family , with a few other dyes emerging in researches in recent years.137,138 For better performance in PDT, the PSs should generate high levels of singlet oxygen. In other words, PSs require strong absorption at the excitation wavelength, high intersystem 12 crossing ef ficiency, and low fluorescence and phosphorescence. Porphyrin and its derivatives feature high intersystem crossing quantum yield owing to their strong vibronic spin -orbit coupling.139 UV-visible absorptions of porphyrins and their derivatives have been interpreted by Martin Gouterman wi th a four -orbital model,140 in which the transition between two HOMOs and two LUMOs generates two pairs of absorption bands, B bands (Soret bands) and Q bands. For freebase porphyrins, the Q -bands further split to four peaks on the spectrum due to the lowering of molecular symmetry (Figure 1 -6). Figure 1 -6 The UV -vis absorption spectrum of porphyrin in correspondence to the illustration of Gouterman four -orbital theory . Chlorin is the reduced form of porphyrin in which one - double bond of the porphyrin is hydrogenated. The reduced molecular symmetry (from D 4h or D 2h to C 2h) and the destabilization of MOs causes red shift of Q y bands, wh ile the Q y band intensity increases due to higher oscillator strength of these excited states (Figure 1 -7a).141 Such changes in absorption vastly improve the performance of chlorins in PDT since near infrared light can penetrate deeper into the tissue (F igure 1 -7b). Further reduction of another - double bond on the opposite side of 13 chlorin affords bacteriochlorin, whose Q y absorption dramatically red shifts to ~740 nm. Unfortunately, because bacteriochlorins are usually unstable upon light irradiation, no bacteriochlorin PSs are developed for the clinic.142 Figure 1 -7 (a) The UV -vis absorption spectra of protoporphyrin IX (PpIx) and chlorin e6 (Ce6).

Though recognized as a l ocal therapy, PDT is found to be highly immune -active. PDT can induce both apoptosis and necrosis, producing a strong inflammatory response that activates antigen presentation to the lymph nodes (Figure 1 -8).119 The consequent T cell maturation and proliferation not only enhances local tumor destruction but also potentiates systemic antitumor vaccination. Nevertheless, PDT -induced anti tumor immunity has not yet been applied in the clinic. 14 Figure 1 -8 T cell proliferation induced by PDT . Reprinted with permission from Nat. Rev.

It exhibits high overall response rates in multiple cancer types and durable tumor control enjoyed by a small su bset of patients.143,144 Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, which uses small molecules or antibodies to stimulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors by modulating protein expre ssion and/or functions at dysregulated immune checkpoints, is currently a focal point of clinical interest.144,145 Multiple checkpoint blockade immunotherapy drugs have been approved by FDA for clinical use recently, including Ipilimumab, which targets CTLA -4, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma and Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, two antibodies against P D-1, approved in 15 Indoleamine 2,3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is an immunoregulatory of tryptophan (Trp) to kynurenine (Kyn).146-148 The results of this catalytic process leads to depletion of Trp and production of Kyn, thus preventing the clonal expa nsion of T cells and promoting T cell anergy and apoptosis.149,150 Small molecule IDO inhibitors such as 1 -methyl -tryptophan,149,151 INCB24360,152 and NLG919,153 can effectively block Trp catabolism but show modest effect as monother apies, due in part to ineffective antigen presentation and insufficient antitumor immunity. The combination of immunotherapy with conventional cancer therapies has been under investigation, since cell death caused by other therapies potentiates tumor antig en release that initiates T cell activation.145 For example, there are multiple ongoing trials on the combination of radiation therapy with anti -CTLA -4 or anti -PD-1/PD -L1 antibodies,154,155 while studies of chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapeutics are a lso ongoing.156 1.6 RNA interference and small interfering RNA RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process that inhibits gene expression by RNA, typically by causing mRNA destruction. The discovery of sequence -specific gene silencing by double -stranded RNA in the nematode wo rm Caenorhabditis elegans won its discoverers, Fire and Mello, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006.157 Small interfering RNA (siRNA), first detecte d as a product of RNA degradation in plants as RNA pieces of ~25 nucleotides, induce mRNA degradation and cause post -transcriptional gene silencing.158,159 This discovery strongly influenced drug development, since RNA interference provides potential 16 solutions to dysfunctional gene/protein expression, in addition to expediting the elucidation of a variety of molecular biology mechanisms.160,161 The major challenge of siRNA drug development is d elivery. Rapid renal clearance in circulation limits the direct intravenous injection of naked siRNA, which is also complicated by clearance by serum RNase A -type nucleases.162,163 Preventing degradation of nucleic acid drugs is another sign ificant challenge in extracellular and intracellular trafficking control.162,164 Multiple delivery platforms have been evaluated on siRNA delivery, including liposomes and lipid-like materials,165-167 vectors,172,173 and inorganic nanoparticles,174-176 but re al clinical success is far ahead. The dilemma lies in the balance between the stealth of the vehicle from reticuloendothelial system clearance and the effective cellular uptake and transfection. Liposomes and some neutral polymeric coating strategies can p rolong the blood circulation and increase the tumor uptake of siRNA, but the incapability of endosomal escape leads to degradation of the cargo; the cationic vehicles and virus vectors enhance siRNA transfection, but also invite immune system clearance. In chapter 5, we will introduce the invention of a novel nMOF delivery platform for co -delivery of chemotherapeutics and siRNAs.89 1.7 References 1. Itaya, K., Uchida, I. Neff, V.D.

A Porphyrin -Based Nanoscale Metal -Organic Framework for Photodynamic therapy 2.1 Rationale of the nMOF design Selective localization of PSs in tumors is critical for effective PDT. However, many PSs are hydrophobic in nature, which not only leads to insufficient tumor localization but also causes PS aggregation to diminish the PDT efficacy.1 We hypothesized that the incorporation of a porphyrin -derived bridging ligand i nto a robust and porous UiO nMOF structure with proper morphologies and dimensions would have several advantages over existing nanoparticle PDT agents: first, the PS molecules are well -isolated in the framework to avoid aggregation and self - quenching of th e excited states; second, coordination of porphyrin ligands to heavy Hf centers via the carboxylate groups can promote intersystem crossing to enhance ROS generation efficiency; third, the porous nMOF structure provides a pathway for facile diffusion of RO S (such as 1O2) out of the nMOF interior to exert their cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. In this nMOF design, an unprecedentedly high PS loading can be achieved to enable highly effective PDT of difficult -to-treat cancers. This chapter reports our effo rts on the design of the first porphyrin -based nMOF, DBP -Hf, as an efficient photosensitizer for PDT of resistant head and neck cancer. DBP -Hf efficiently generates 1O2 owing to site isolation of porphyrin ligands, enhanced intersystem crossing by heavy H f centers, and facile 1O2 diffusion through porous DBP -Hf nanoplates. Consequently, DBP -Hf displayed greatly enhanced PDT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo , leading to complete tumor eradication in half of the mice receiving a single DBP -Hf dose and a sin gle light exposure. 30 2.2 Results and Discussion 2.2.1 Synthesis and characterization of the H 2DBP ligand The new porphyrin derivative with linearly aligned dicarboxylate groups, 5,15 -di(p- benzoato)porphyrin (H 2DBP), was synthesized in 3 steps as shown in S cheme 2 -1.

Dipyrrylmethane was synthesize d based on a modified literature procedure.2 To a 1 -liter flask 500 mL of distilled pyrrole (7.2 mol) was added. To the flask paraformaldehyde (1.74 g, 58 mmol by formaldehyde) was a dded and the mixture was degassed for 15 minutes. The mixture was then heated at 60 \u00b0 C to dissolve most of the solid. After cooling to room temperature, 0.53 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added slowly to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirre d for an hour before the addition of 812 mg of sodium hydroxide, then the mixture was stirred for another 45 minutes. Pyrrole was distilled off under vacuum and the remaining solid was extracted with dichloromethane from water and washed with water twice.

The attempts to grow DBP -Hf crystals suitable for single -crystal X -ray diffraction are not successful likely due to the poor solubility of the ligand. Fortunately, the single crysta l structure of an and has the same length as DBP), is determined (Table 2 -1 & Figure 2 -6) and the powder X -ray diffraction (PXRD) patt ern DBP -Hf thus adopts a UiO is built from 12 -connected Hf6(\u00b53-O)4(\u00b53-OH) 4(carboxylate) 12 secondary building units (SBUs) and DBP bridging ligands.3 DBP -Hf has a very open framework structure with triangular channels of 1.6 nm in dimensions as well as octahedral and tetrahedral cavities of 2.8 nm and 2.0 nm in dimensions, respectively, which facilitates t he diffusion of ROS during PDT process. 3O2Hf4+ H2DBPhn DBP -Hf1O2+37 Table 2 -1 Chemical structure 1.01 13.00 Wavelength (\u00c5) 0.41328 Limiting indices -39<=h<= 41, -42<=k<= 32, Crystal system cubic Space group a, \u00c5 38.758(2) Reflection collected 81986 Data/restraints/parameters 1987/35/59 \u00b0 90 Goodness -of-fit on F2 2.324 \u00b0 R = 0.2644 Density Powder X from the [110] direction; (c) the octahedral cavity in the structure.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms that DBP -Hf particles display a plate morphology (Figure 2 -7). Nitrogen adsorption measurements gave a BET surface area of 558 m2/g for the nMOF (Figure 2 -8a). Thermogravimetric analy sis (Figure 2 -8b) shows a weight loss of 77% from 150 -600 \u00b0 C (calculated 73%). Inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry (ICP - MS) confirms a Hf content of 24.3% (calculated 23.7%). 39 Figure 2 -8 (a) Nitrogen adsorption isotherm of DBP -Hf at 77K and (b) Thermogravimetric analysis of DBP -Hf.

Individual SBUs are clearly visible in high -resolution TEM images of DBP -Hf (Figure 2 -7b). The distances between SBUs are measured to be approximately 2.7 nm (Figure 2 -7f), which are consistent with the calculated distance of 2.77 nm based on the X -ray structure model. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the high -resolution TEM image displays a 3 -fold symmetry f or the nanoplates (Figure 2 -7c), consistent with the symmetry along (111) direction of the cubic structure of DBP -Hf. The dimensions of the nanoplates are measured to be ~100 nm in diameter and ~10 nm in thickness. Such thin plates consist of only 4 -5 sets of (111) packing layer (d111=2.2 nm). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements gave an average diameter of 76.3 nm for the particles (Figure 2 -9). Notably, the nanoplate morphology is particularly advantageous for generating ROS for PDT. The diffusion length of 1O2 is no more than 90 -120 nm in aqueous environment 4-8 and was estimated to be 20 -220 nm inside cells.9 Therefore, the nanoplates as thin as 10 -nm in thickness are ideally suited for transporting 1O2 from the nMOF interior to the cell cytoplasm to exert cytotoxic effe cts. 40 DBP -Hf displays stability in physiological environment. After incubation in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium for 12 h, the DBP -Hf morphology remained unaltered by TEM observation (Figure 2 -7d). The remained crystallinity of the nMOFs was also confir med by the FFT of the TEM images and the unchanged PXRD pattern (Figure 2 -7a,e). Figure 2 -9 DLS plot showing the particle size of DBP -Hf.

Copyright 2014 American Chemical and of H 2DBP and DBP -Hf -visible absorption spectra -Hf in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffers (pH=7.4) are compared in Figure 2 -10. H 2DBP shows a Soret band at 402 nm and four Q -bands at 505, 54 0, 566, and 619 nm. The absorption of standard solutions of H2DBP at concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 4 and 8 mg/L were acquired and the extinction coefficients of H 2DBP at 402 nm and 619 nm are determined to be 2.2\u00d7 105 and 1.7\u00d7 103 M-1cm-1, respectively (Figure 2 -10b). DBP -Hf shows slight red shifts for all Q -bands, with the peaks appearing at 510, 544, 579, and 634 nm, probably due to the coordination of the carboxylate groups of DBP ligands to Hf centers. The presence of four Q -bands and thei r red shifts support the presence of free -base porphyrin ligands in DBP -Hf. The Soret band of is 41 significantly broadened, presumably due to inequivalent ligand environments in thin nanoplates as well as potential framework distortion in thin MOF str uctures.

The coordination of the porphyrin ligand to Hf will enhance the intersystem cr ossing from 1DBP excited state to 3DBP state,10 which decreases the fluorescence emission and increases the singlet oxygen generation quantum yield.

After exposure to a LED light source (peak emission at 640 nm, energy irradiance of 100 mW/cm2), the produced 1O2 chemiluminescent reagent SOSG to generate green fluores cence, and the change of fluorescence signal was quantified with a fluorimeter. The fluorescence intensity was plotted against irradiation time (Figure 2 -13). The 1O2 generation was depicted with an exponential function that corresponded to a pseudo first -order process. As the light intensity and photosensitizer concentration are fixed, for the photoreaction, we can assume that [ PS*] (the concentration of the excited state of the photosensitizer) is a constant. Therefore, we have singlet oxygen generation rate equation: [21] =[2] =[][2]=[2] Where k* = k[PS*]. Here we a coupled reaction of SOSG to consume singlet oxygen: Where [ SOSG*] is the concentration of reacted form of SOSG. [] =2[21][ ] 44 Apply ing steady state assumption on [1O2], we have [21] =[2][21]2[21][ ]=0 [21]=[2] +2[ ] Where k d is the rate constant of singlet oxygen loss (due to r elaxation or quenched by other species in the solution). When k 2[SOSG]<<k d and [O 2] is high, [21][2] = [] 1=k2k*[O 2]/kd, is proportional to [SOSG*]: =0[] Where I0 is the incident light intensity, f is the fluorescence quantum yield of SOSG*, S is the extinction coefficient of SOSG*, and b is the light path length. We can integr ate the equation to obtain the correlation of fluorescence intensity IF and irradiation time t: ln[ ] 0( )=1 =[1] Where A and k are fitting parameters, =00( ) 45 =()2/ Where c0(SOSG) is the initial SOSG concentration; is the quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation, Nir is the irradiation light intensity by photons per second, PS is the extinctio n coefficient of photosensitizer at LED emission wavelength, c(PS) is the photosensitizer concentration. Linear approximations are applied in above equations. Note that for H 2DBP+HfCl 4 sample, singlet oxygen generation rate is very low, SOSG consumption be comes negligible. Then the equation could be simplified to = Thus we can compare the linear regression slope to product of Ak in the other groups. The fitted equations for H 2DBP and DBP -Hf t) IDBP -Hf = 88(1-e-0.0033 t) The product of Ak in the equation is propo rtional to the initial rate of the reaction that indicates the 1O2 generation efficiency.

Table 2 -3 Fitting parameters of singlet oxygen generation rate . A k In vitro and in vivo efficacy Encouraged by the excellent 1O2 generation efficiency, we tested the PDT efficacy of DBP - Hf on resistant head and neck cancer models. The tumor cell uptake of DBP -Hf was first evaluated by incubating human head and neck cancer cells SQ20B with DBP -Hf (30 \u00b5 g/mL) for 47 4 h or 12 h (Figure 2 -14). The Hf concentrations in the cells were determined by ICP -MS. No significant difference was observed between the uptake amount after 4 h and 12 h incubation, indicating rapid internalization of DBP -Hf to the cancer cells. Figure 2 -14 Cellular uptake of DBP -Hf after 4 or 12 hour incubation . Reprinted with permission from J. Am. C hem. Soc. , 2014 , 136, 16712 -16715. Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society. To further confirm the PDT efficacy of DBP -Hf, SQ20B cancer cells were treated with H2DBP, DBP -Hf, or PpIX at various concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 \u00b5 M based on ligand concentrations), the cells were irradiated with LED light (640 nm, 100 mW/cm2) for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or 30 min (total light dose 180 J/cm2), respectively. Significant PDT efficacy was observed in DBP -Hf treated groups, even for the group rece iving 5 \u00b5 M PS dose and 15 min irradiation (Figure 2 -15). H 2DBP -treated groups show moderate PDT efficacy only at 20 \u00b5 M dose with 30 min light irradiation while no cytotoxicity was observed in dark control or blank control groups. In comparison, PpIX is muc h less photocytotoxic than DBP -Hf under similar conditions. Cells incubated with PBS after irradiation for 15 min and 30 min did not show appreciable viability changes (95.2\u00b1 2.2% for 15 min and 96.1\u00b1 5.2% for 30 min) compared 48 with cells incubated with PBS a nd received no irradiation, suggesting that irradiation alone will not induce any cytotoxicity. There was also no cytotoxicity observed in cells treated with H 2DBP or DBP -Hf without irradiation. This result indicated that H 2DBP and DBP -Hf alone are non - toxic to cells at tested concentrations up to 100 \u00b5 M. We carried out proof -of-concept in vivo experiments on SQ20B subcutaneous xenograft murine models to evaluate the PDT efficacy of DBP -Hf. The mice were treated with PBS control, DBP -Hf (3.5 mg DBP/kg) or H2DBP (3.5 mg/kg) by intratumoral injection. Twelve hours post injection, each mouse was irradiated at the tumor site with light (180 J/cm2) for 30 min. For comparison from literature, photofrin\u00ae is administrated by intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg/kg in tumor bearing mice and with light irradiation of 135 J/cm2.11 As depicted in Figure 2 -16, the tumors of mice treated with DBP -Hf started shrinking 1 day post PDT treatment. Most importantly, among the fo ur tumors in the DBP -Hf group, two tumors were completely eradicated by single nMOF administration and single light irradiation while the sizes of the other two tumors decreased from ~150 mm3 to ~3 mm3. The tumor growth of mice treated with H2DBP was sligh tly suppressed after PDT, however accelerated after 5 days and exhibited no difference to the control group at the endpoint. After local administration, DBP -Hf could be efficiently internalized by the tumor cells and induce cytotoxicity upon irradiation wh ile the free ligand might be cleared away from the tumor sites before irradiation. No skin/tissue damage was observed after PDT treatment on all mice (Figure 2 -16c). The histologies of tumor slices of all three groups were observed after PDT treatment (Fig ure 2 -17). The dominant normal tumor cells are observed in control and ligand treated groups. Prevailing apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cells were observed in tumor slices from nMOF group and massive inflammatory cells indicated the 49 immunoresponse after PDT. The blood vessels in tumor tissue in nMOF treated group are destroyed after PDT while not disturbed in control and ligand treated groups.

As a result of site isolation of DBP ligands, enhanced intersystem crossing by Hf clusters, and facile 1O2 diffusion out of a porous nanoplate, the nMOF works as an efficient PDT photosensitizer, as demonstrated by both 1O2 generation efficiency measurements and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. In vivo PDT efficacy studies with subcutaneous xenograft murine models demonstrated 50 times tumor volume reduction in half of the mice and complete tumor eradication in the other half of mice that we re treated with DBP -Hf. In comparison, no therapeutic effect was observed in the mice treated with H 2DBP. The facile structural and compositional tunability of nMOFs should allow further tuning of other properties to afford a new generation of highly poten t PDT agents for treating resistant cancers in the clinic. 2.4 Methods UV-visible absorption: The UV -vis absorption spectra of H 2DBP and DBP -Hf were acquired with a UV -vis spectrophotometer (UV Japan). The H 2DBP DBP -Hf NMOF suspension were prepared in 0.67 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The absorption of standard solutions of H2DBP at concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 4 and 8 mg/L were acquired and the standard curve was plotted by linear fitting of the absorb ance at 402 nm. Fluorescence lifetime measurement: measured a ChronosBH lifetime fluorimeter (ISS, Inc.) using Time -Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) 53 methods. The fluorimeter contained -Hickl -130 e a SC400 supercontiuum laser source with integrated pulse picker and AOTF. Emission wavelengths were selected with bandpass filters (Semrock and Chroma). The Instrument Response Function (IRF) was measured to be approximately 120ps FWHM in a 1% scattering solution of Ludox LS colloidal silica. Lifetimes were fit via a forward convolution method in the Vinci control and analysis software. Singlet Oxygen generation test: A light -emitting diode (LED) array with peak emission at 640 nm was used as the light source of singlet oxygen generation. The irradiance of LED is 100 mW/cm2. Singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) reagent (Life Technologies) was emplo yed for the detection of singlet oxygen. H 2DBP and DBP -Hf samples were prepared in 5 M solutions/suspensions in HBSS buffer (for DBP -Hf samples, the concentration was calculated as ligand equivalents). To 2 mL each of these solutions/suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 L at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 M) before fluorescenc e measurement. For a typical measurement, fluorescence intensity was acquired on a spectrofluoro - photometer (RF -5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with excitation at 504 nm emission at 525 nm (slit width 1.5 nm/3 nm for ex/em). Fluorescence was measured after ir radiation by LED for 0 (as background), 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 1 min, 1.5 min, 2 min, 2.5 min, 3 min, 3.5 min, 4 min, 4.5 min, 5 min, 6 min and 7 min. Cellular uptake: SQ20B cells were seeded on 6 -well plates at 5\u00d7 105 cells/well and further incubated for 24 h. The DBP -Hf samples were added to the cells at a concentration of 30 mg/L. After incubating for 4 h and 12 h, the cells were collected and the cell numbers were counted by 54 hemocytometer. The cells were digested with concentrated nitric acid and subjected to ICP-MS for the determination of the Hf concentration. The cellular uptake amounts were expressed as Hf (ng) per 105 of cells. In vitro cytotoxicity: The cytotoxicities of DBP -Hf, H 2DBP, and PpIX were evaluated in human head and neck cancer cells SQ20B whi ch are resistant to cisplatin and conventional radiotherapy. SQ20B cells were seeded on 96 -well plates at 2000 cells/well. The cells were treated with DBP - Hf and H 2DBP at various ligand concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 M base on ligand concentrations ) after a 24 -h incubation. A further incubation of 4 h was allowed, followed by replacing the culture medium with 100 \u00b5 L of fresh DMEM/F12 medium. The cells were irradiated with LED light (640 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or 30 min (total light dose 180 J/cm2), respectively. The cells without irradiation treatment served as controls. The cells were further incubated to achieve a total incubation time of 72 h with DBP -Hf, H2DBP or PpIX. The cell was investigated using SQ20B subcutaneous xenograft murine mice were by subcutaneous inoculation of SQ20B cell suspension (5\u00d7 106 cells per mouse) into the right flank region of 6 -week athymic female nude mice. Three groups were included for comparison: PBS as control, H 2DBP, and DBP -Hf. When tumors reached 100 mm3, PBS, H 2DBP, and DBP -Hf were intratumorally injected to animals at a DBP dose of 3.5 mg/kg. At 12 h post -injection, mice were anesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and tumors were irradiated with a 640 nm LED for 30 min. The light intensity was measured as 100 mW /cm2, and the total light dose was 180 J/cm2. Both injection and PDT were performed once. 55 To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, tumor growth and body weight evolution were monitored. The tumor size was measured with a digital caliper every day. Tumor volum es were calculated as follows: (width2 \u00d7 length)/2. Finally, all mice were sacrificed on Day 8, and the excised tumors were photographed and weighed. Tumors were fixed with formalin. Paraffin -embedded 5 m tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and e rosin (H&E) and observed with light microscopy (Pannoramic Scan Whole Slide Scanner, Perkin Elmer, USA). 2.5 References 1.

A Chlorin -Based Nanoscale Metal -Organic Framework for Photodynamic therapy 3.1 Rationale of the nMOF design After the first successful attempt to use the porphyrin -based nMOF, DBP -Hf, as a photosensitizer (PS) for PDT, we wish to further optimize the nMOF system. Despite the excellent performance in pilot animal studies, the photophysical properties of DBP -Hf are not optimal. The lowest energy absorption at 634 nm and the relatively small extinction coefficient () of 2200 M-1\u00b7 cm-1 indicate a low energy conversion efficiency. In this chapter, we report the design of the first chlorin -based nMOF, DBC -Hf, with much improved photophysical properties and PDT efficacy. Hematoporphyrin derivatives were developed as the first generation PSs, leading to the clinical application of the first PDT agent photofrin\u00ae in 1993.1 However, the photophysical properties of porphyrins are non -ideal with the absorption peaks typically near the high energy edge of the tissue -penetrating window (600 -900 nm) and small values. In molecular PS design, reduction of porphyrins to chlorins has been shown to shift the absorption to a longer wavelength with a concomitant increase in .2,3 For example, reduction of 5,10,15,20 -m- tetra(hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin to its chlorin derivative red -shifts the last Q -band from 644 to 650 nm along with a dramatic enhancement in from 3400 M-1\u00b7 cm-1 to have improved photophysical properties over DBP -Hf to lead to more effective cancer treatment by PDT. 58 Scheme 3 -1 Schematic description of the singlet oxygen generation by DBC -Hf photo - sensitization with LED light .

The synthesis of H 2DBC ligand follows the route in scheme 3 -2. 5,15-di(p- methylbenzoato)porphyrin (Me 2DBP) was synthesiz ed following the protocol in Chapter 2 . Me 2DBP was reduced to 5,15-di(p-methylbenzoato )chlorin (Me 2DBC) following a modified procedure from the literature.4 To a 2 -neck round bottom flask were added Me 2DBP (239 mg, 0.41 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (520 mg, 3.76 mmol). Under nitrogen protection 30 mL of anhydrous pyridine was added. The solution was heated to 105 \u00b0 C before the addition of 3 mL of p -toluenesulfonhydrazide solution (0.275 M in anhydrous pyridine). The reaction mixture was kept at 105 \u00b0 C for another 8 hours during which 4 fractions of p - toluenesulfonhydrazide solutions (0.275 M in a nhydrous pyridine, 3 mL for each fraction) were added every 2 h. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 105 \u00b0 C in the dark for another 12 h. The product was extracted with 2:1 ethyl acetate/water and washed with 2 M HCl, 2 M phosphoric acid (twice), wate r, and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The solution was 60 treated with 2,3-dichloro -5,6-dicyano -benzoquinone (via slow addition of 1 mg/mL solution in chloroform) until the characteristic absorption of the over -reduced product at 735 nm disappeared.

A potassium hydroxide aqueous solution (2.5 mL, 2 mol/L) was then added. The solution was heated to reflux under nitrogen protection overnight. Half of the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator before the pH was adjusted to pH=3 with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid.

Copyright 2015 American Chemical 66 Synthesis and characteriz ation of DBC -Hf A between HfCl 4 and H 2DBC in DMF afforded the dark purple powdery product of DBC -Hf. To a 20 -mL glass vial was added 3 mL of HfCl [2 mg/mL in N,N (3.5 mg/mL in DMF, 0.018 mmol), and 0. 36 mL of acetic acid ( 6.3 mmol). The reaction mixture was kept in an 80 \u00b0 C oven for 3 days. The nMOF product was collected by centrifugation and washed with copious amounts of DMF, 1% triethylamine (NEt 3) in ethano l (v/v), and ethanol successively and stored as a stock suspension in ethanol. Powder X -ray diffraction (PXRD) indicated that DBC -type structure as DBP -Hf, due to the geometric similarity between the DBC and DBP ligands (Figure 3-5a). The in DBC -Hf are bridged by DBC framework of Hf 6(\u00b53-O)4(\u00b53-OH) 4(DBC) 6. The Hf -mass whereas a DBC weight loss of 64% (72% calculated) was observed in thermogravimetric analysis (Figure 3 -5b). The discrepancy of organic weight loss by TGA is presumably a result of the termination of Hf 6(3-O)4(3-OH) 4 SBUs by acetate groups in the ultrathin DBC -Hf nMOF. 67 Figure 3 -5 PXRD pattern -Hf and DBC -Hf before and after incubation in cell culture medium.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms that DBC -Hf adopts a nanoplate morphology similar to that of DBP -Hf (Figure 3 -5c). The plate diameters are 100~200 nm, while the thi ckness varies from 3.3 to 7.5 nm by direct observation of the particles lying perpendicular to the TEM grid (Figure 3 -5c,d). Notably, since the calculated distances between neighboring (111) packing layers (d 111) of the UiO -type structure are 2.2 nm, the u ltra-thin plates consist of only 2 -4 sets of (111) packing layers. Such plates are even thinner than DBP -Hf of ~10 nm in thickness, further facilitating the ROS diffusion during PDT. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of DBC -Hf gave an average dia meter of 128.5 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.17 and a potential of -10.2 mV in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (Figure 3 -6). The stability of DBC -Hf in biological media was confirmed by culturing the nMOF in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium for 12 h. The morphology of nMOFs did not change by TEM (Figure 3-7 a,b), while high resolution TEM images along with their fast -Fourier transform (FFT) patterns indicate the retention of nMOF crystallinity 3 -7 c-f). The PXRD pattern did not change after incubation in RPMI 1640 cell medium, further proving th e framework stability of DBC -Hf in physiological environments (Figure 1a).

H 2DBC has a split Soret band at max=408 nm and four Q 534, 643 nm. DBC all Q -bands compard to H2DBC, with the peaks at 508, 545, 592, and 646 nm. The lowest energy Q -band of DBC -Hf thus red -shifted by 13 -Hf, with an value of 24600 M-1\u00b7 cm-1 that is 11 -fold greater than that of DBP -Hf. H 2DBC has an value of 21800 M-1\u00b7 cm-1 for the lowest energy Q - band, which is 13 -fold greater than that of H 2DBP (1700 M-1\u00b7 cm-1). The fluorescence peak of H 2DBC shows up majorly at ~641 nm, with a weak -8b). The DBC -Hf fluorescence was ~200 fold weaker than H 2DBC, similar to the case of DBP -Hf and H 2DBP, due to an enhanced intersystem crossing upon coordination of DBC ligands to Hf4+ ions the carboxylate grou ps. with this, DBC -Hf has a slightly shorter fluorescence lifetime of 7.88 ns compared to H 2DBC (8.15 ns) by Time -Correlated Single Photon Counting measurements (Figure 3 -8c and Table 3 -1). 71 Figure 3 -8 Photophysical and photochemical properti es of H 2DBC and DBP mM PBS.

Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) was employed to determine 1O2 generation efficiencies of H 2DBC and DBC -Hf. The fluorescence of SOSG response to 1O2 (ex = 504 nm,em = 525 nm) was quantified with a fluorimeter. For comparison, 1O2 generation efficiency of H 2DBP, DBP -Hf and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) were also determined. The fluorescence plotted against irradiation time was fitted with an exponential function (Eq 1), indicating a pseudo first -order 1O2 generation process (Figure 3 -8d). For detailed discussion on the fitting model see chapter 2. IF = A(1-e-kt) (Eq 1) Where IF is fluorescence intensity and t is irradiation time while A and k are fitting parame ters (Table 3 -2). The total 1O2 generation yield was normalized based on that of PpIX to compare the overall photosensitization efficiency. DBC -Hf is ~3 times as efficient as DBP -Hf in generating 1O2. 73 Table 3 -2 Fitting parameters for 1O2 generation curve s.

Solutions of 7.5 M ligand or D BP-Hf (base on ligand concentration) were irradiated for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 minutes and the concentrations were calculated from the characteristic absorption of chlorin species at ~650 nm (Figure 3 -9a,b). DBC -Hf the ligan d: 87% of DBC -Hf absorption was preserved after 9 min irradiation (54 J/cm2 total light dose), comparing to 76% for H 2DBC (Figure 3 -9c) under the same conditions. The improved photostability of DBC -Hf is attributed to the rigidification and isolation of th e PSs in the nMOF structure. In comparison, DBP -Hf is even less sensitive to light: after 10 min irradiation at 640 nm (60 J/cm2 light dose) over 98% of Soret band absorption was retained (Figure 3 -9d). During synthesis of the H 2DBC ligand, we red the Q -band absorption at ~735 nm, which should be perfect for light penetration for PDT application. Unfortunately, the rapid photobleaching of b acteriochlorins hinders the practical PDT applications that no bacteriochlorin products have been developed to the clinic.5 After isolating Me 2DBB by column chromatography, we prepared it into dichloromethane solution and monitored the absorbance at 735 nm upon LED irradiation (100 mW/cm2, 740 nm, Figure 3 -9e). 74 With only 2 minute irradiation (12 J/cm2 light dose) over 90% of Me 2DBB degraded (Figure 3 - 9f). Due to the unstable nature of the bacteriochlorin upon light irradiation, we abandoned the efforts to grow DBB -based nMOFs. Figure of D BC-Hf (a) and H 2DBC (b) upon LED irradiation.

The tumor cell uptake of nMOFs was evaluated by incubating CT26 cells with DBP DBC -Hf of 50 \u00b5 M). The Hf contents in CT26 cells were determined to be (3.44\u00b1 0.13) and nmol/105 by ICP -MS. We also compared the cellular uptake of DBC -Hf and H 2DBC in terms of ligand co ncentrations by UV -vis analysis in CT26 and HT29 (Figure 3 -10). The cellular uptake amounts of DBC -Hf and H 2DBC in terms of ligand concentrations were (13.7\u00b1 0.8) and (20.2\u00b1 1.7) nmol/106 cells in HT29 cells (Figure 3 -10a) and (4.9\u00b1 0.4) and (0.6\u00b1 0.1) nmol/106 cells in CT26 cells (Figure 3 -10b). 76 Figure 3 -10 Cellular uptake evaluation of H 2DBC and DBC -Hf in HT29 (a) or CT26 (b) cells .

The in vitro PDT efficacy of DBC -Hf against colon cancer cells were investigated and compared with DBP -Hf and their corresponding free ligands. The nMOFs or free ligands were incubated with CT26 or HT29 cells at various concentrations, and the cells were irradiated wit h LED light at a total light dose of 90 J/cm2. DBC -Hf outperformed DBP -Hf by effectively killing both cancer cell lines at low nMOF and light doses (Figure 3 -11). Free ligand treated groups also showed moderate PDT efficacy, while no cytotoxicity was obser ved in dark control or PBS control groups. The IC 50 values of DBC -Hf, H 2DBC, DBP -Hf, and H 2DBP in CT26 cells with irradiation were calculated to be 5.1\u00b1 0.2, 8.5\u00b1 0.1, 10.4\u00b1 0.5, and 20.0\u00b1 3.1 \u00b5 M (by ligand concentrations), respectively. The IC 50 values of DBC -Hf, H 2DBC, DBP -Hf, and H 2DBP in HT29 cells with irradiation were calculated to be 6.0\u00b1 1.5, 7.5\u00b1 2.3, 13.1\u00b1 2.2, and 17.0\u00b1 4.0 \u00b5 M, respectively. These results confirm that DBC -Hf is a more potent PS than DBP -Hf in PDT owing to the enhanced photophysical Raw264.7 cells, but higher ligand concentration (> 20 \u00b5 M) was required to achieve 50% cell killing (Figure 3 -11c).

Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. We further studied the mechanism of PDT cytotoxicity of the DBC -Hf nMOF and the \u00b5 M DBC -Hf or H 2DBC followed by light irradiat ion at 0.1 W/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). The apoptosis induced by PDT treatment was determined with the Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V/dead cell apoptosis kit by flow cytometry. No apoptosis or necrosis was observed for cells treated with DBC -Hf or H 2DBC in the dark while significant amounts of cells underwent apoptosis when treated with DBC -Hf or H 2DBC upon light irradiation (Figure 3 - 12). Calreticulin (CRT) is a distinct biomarker exposed on the surface of cells undergoing immunogenic cell death (ICD).11 The CRT expression was determined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence to assess the ICD induced by PDT with DBC -Hf (Figure 3 -13). Cells treated with DBC -Hf or H 2DBC without light irradiation showed no surface CRT expression 0 5 10 15 20020406080100 Cell viability % Ligand dose (M)DBC-Hf dark light H2DBC dark light DBP-Hf dark light H2DBP dark light 0 5 10 15 20020406080100 DBC-Hf dark light H2DBC dark light DBP-Hf dark light H2DBP dark lightCell viability % Ligand dose (M)a) b) 0 10 20 30 40 500306090120 Cell viability % Ligand dose (M)DBC-Hf dark light H2DBC dark light c)78 while significant amounts of CRT were detected on the surface of cells upon irradiation.

We carried out in vivo anticancer efficacy experiments on subcutaneous flank tumor mouse models of CT26 and HT29. The mice were intratumorally injected with (1) PBS control, (2) DBC -Hf, (3) DBP -Hf, (4) H 2DBC, or (5) H 2DBP at a ligand dose of 1 mg/kg or (6) DBC -Hf at a ligand dose of 3.5 mg/kg. As depicted in Figure 3 -14 and 3 -15, the tumor growth of mice treated with DBC -Hf (1 mg/kg DBC dose) was effectively inhibited in both models. DBP -Hf and the two PS ligands failed to suppress the tumor growth in either model, due to low PS and light doses. Higher doses of DBC -Hf and light irradiation led to effective tumor regression in H T29 with single treatment and in CT26 with two treatments (Figure 3 -14a and 3 -15a). The weights and sizes of tumors treated with DBC -Hf at the endpoint were also significantly smaller than the other groups (Figure 3 -14 b,d and 3 -15 b,d). Histology of froze n tumor slices further confirmed that only DBC -Hf treatment caused apoptosis/necrosis of tumors but not in DBP -Hf or the two PS ligands (Figure 3 -16). Along with the in vitro PDT results, the superior anticancer efficacies achieved by DBC -Hf in both colore ctal cancer models indicate that -Hf is a more efficient photosensitizer than DBP -Hf. The statistical analysis of tumor weights was run by two -way T -test. For CT26 model, the P dose), DBP DBC dose), DBP 0.43374, 0.15008, respectively. Significant difference of tumor we ights was only observed 81 between DBC -Hf and PBS control group. DBC -Hf with higher doses of nMOF and light irradiation led to successful tumor regression in both models. Figure 3 -14 In vivo PDT efficacy on CT26 mouse tumor model .

CT26 tumor model HT29 DBC 0.000000054 3.3 Conclusion In this chapter, we have rationally designed the first chlorin -based nMOF, DBC -Hf, with an exceptionally high PS crystallinity, framework stability, porosity, nanoplate morphology, and enhanced intersystem DBC -Hf exhibits a 13 nm red -shift and an 11 - fold extinction coefficient increase in the lowest energy Q -band wh en compared to the previously generation DBP -Hf. As a result, DBC -Hf is three times as efficient as DBP -Hf in generating 1O2 and exhibits much higher PDT cytotoxicity in two colon cancer cell lines. The 84 superior anticancer efficacy of DBC -Hf compared to DB P-Hf was also demonstrated in two colorectal adenocarcinoma mouse models. We further elucidated that both apoptosis and immunogenic cell death contribute to the anticancer efficacy induced by DBC -Hf based PDT. nMOFs thus provide an excellent platform for a chieving highly efficient PDT via both apoptosis and immunogenic cell death, and represent a novel class of nanomedicine with significant potential for clinical translation.12,13 3.4 Methods Digestion for ICP -MS: The nMOF sample was dried on vacuum overnight before being digested by a mixture of concentrate nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid (63% HF/69% HNO The sample diluted with 2% nitric acid to a total MOF concentration analysis: Thermogravimetric TGA ic analyzer. The nMOF was collected by centrifugation and dried on the vacuum overnight. The sample was then transferred to a platinum plate and heated at 3 \u00b0 C/min to 650 \u00b0 C in air. The weight percentage was plotted against temperature and was normalized t o the weight at 100 \u00b0 C to eliminate the influence of absorbed moisture. Fluorescence measurement: The fluorescence spectra of H 2DBC were on a spectrofluorophotometer (Fluorolog -3, Horiba, Japan). H 2DBC was prepared into 1 M solutio n in phosphate buffer saline and DBC -Hf was suspended in water to 1 M by equivalent ligand concentration for the measurement. 85 Fluorescence lifetime measurement: Time -domain lifetimes were measured on a ChronosBH lifetime fluorometer (ISS, Inc.) using Time -Correlated Single Photon (TCSPC) methods. The fluorometer contained Becker SPC detection and an HPM - 100-40 Hybrid PMT detector. Excitation was provided 403 nm picosecond pulsed laser source (Hamamatsu PLP -10). Emission wavelengths were selected with interference filters (Semrock). The Instrument Response Function (IRF) was measured to be approximately 0.009 ns FWHM in a 1% scattering solution of Ludox LS colloidal silica. Multi -component exponential decay lifetimes were fit via a forward convolution method in the Vinci control and analysis software. DBC -Hf, H 2DBC and a control mixture of HfCl 4 and H 2DBC were prepared into solution/suspensions in Hank's Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS) for the measurement. Singlet Oxygen ge neration test: A light -emitting diode (LED) array with peak emission at 650 nm was used as the light source of singlet oxygen generation test for H 2DBC and DBC -Hf while a 640 nm LED was on H 2DBP, DBP -Hf and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) are 100 mW/cm2. Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) reagent (Life Technologies) was employed for the detection of oxygen. H 2DBC, DBC -Hf, H 2DBP, DBP PpIX prepared in 1 M solutions/suspensions in diluted HBSS buffer (for DBC -Hf and DBP -Hf, the concentration was calculated as ligand equivalents). To 2 mL each of these solutions/suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 L at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 M) before fluorescence measurement. For a typical measureme nt, fluorescence intensity was acquired on a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with excitation at 504 nm and emission at 525 nm (slit width 1.5 nm/3 nm for ex/em). Fluorescence was measured after irradiation by LED for 0 (as background), 15 s, 30 s, 45 s, 1 min, 1.5 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, 5 min and 7 min. 86 Cellular uptake evaluation: DBP -Hf or DBC -Hf was incubated with CT26 cells at a Hf concentration of 50 M for 4 h. The cells were collected, counted with a hemocytomter, and digested by concentrated nitric acid. The cellular uptake amounts of Hf were determined by ICP - MS and normalized with cell numbers. H2DBC or DBC -Hf was incubated with CT26 cells or HT2 9 cells at a ligand concentration of 5 M for 4 h. The cells were collected, counted with a hemocytomter, redispersed in saturated K3PO 4 aqueous solution, and homogenized with an ultrasound probe. The ligand was further extracted by DMSO followed by centri fugation. The upper phase (organic) was isolated and diluted before UV -vis determination of the ligand concentrations. In vitro murine cancer cell CT26 and human colorectal cancer cell HT29 cells, respectively. CT26 cells and HT29 cells were seeded on 96 -well plates at 1000 cells/well and 2500 cells/well, respectively. The cells were treated with DBC -Hf, H 2DBC, DBP -Hf, and H 2DBP at various ligand concentrations (2 , 5, 10, and 20 M base on ligand concentrations). A further incubation of 4 h was allowed followed by replacing the culture medium with 100 \u00b5 L of fresh RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were irradiated with LED light (650 nm for DBC -Hf and H 2DBC; 640 -Hf and H 2DBP) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or kept in dark, respectively. The cells were further incubated to achieve a total incubation time of 72 h. The cell viability was detected carried out in a murine macrophage Raw 264.7 cell line. Raw 264.7 cells were seeded on 96 -well plates at 1000 cells/well. The cells were treated with D BC-Hf 87 and H 2DBC at various ligand concentrations (2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 M base on ligand concentrations). A further incubation of 4 h was allowed, followed by replacing the culture medium with 100 \u00b5 L of fresh RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were irradiated wit h LED light (650 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or kept in dark, respectively. The cells were further incubated to achieve a total incubation time of 72 h. The cell viability was detected by MTS assay. Apoptosis and necrosis detec tion: The apoptosis induced by PDT of DBC -Hf and H2DBC were evaluated by flow cytometry. CT26 cells were seeded at 1\u00d7 106 cells per well in 6 - well plates and further cultured for 24 h. The culture media were replaced by 2 mL of fresh culture me dia containing 10% FBS. DBC -Hf and H 2DBC were added to the cells, respectively, at an equivalent ligand concentration of 5 \u00b5 M. Cells incubated with PBS served as control. After 24-h incubation, the cells were irradiated with LED light (650 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). Following further incubation of 24 h, the floating and adherent cells were collected and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V/dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The apoptosis and n ecrosis was examined on a flow cytometer (LSRII Orange, BD, USA). Immunogenic cell death detection: The cell death by PDT of DBC -Hf and H2DBC were evaluated by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. For immunofluorescence analysis, CT26 cells w ere seeded at 5\u00d7 105 cells per well in 6 -well plates and further cultured for 24 h. The culture media were replaced by 2 mL of fresh culture media containing 10% FBS. DBC -Hf and H 2DBC were added to the cells, respectively, at an equivalent ligand concentrat ion of 5 \u00b5 M. Cells incubated with PBS served as control. After 24 -h incubation, the cells were irradiated with LED light (650 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). Following further 88 incubation of 4 h, the cells were washed with PBS three times, fixed wi th 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated with AlexaFluor 488 -calreticulin (CRT) antibody for 2 h, stained with DAPI, and observed under CLSM using 405 nm and 488 nm lasers for visualizing nuclei and CRT expression on the cell membrane, respectively. For flow cy tometry analysis, CT26 cells were seeded at 1\u00d7 106 cells per well in 6 -well plates and further cultured for 24 h. The culture media were replaced by 2 mL of fresh culture media containing 10% FBS. DBC -Hf and H 2DBC were added to the cells, respectively, at a n equivalent ligand concentration of 5 \u00b5 M. Cells incubated with PBS served as control. After 24 -h incubation, the cells were irradiated with LED light (650 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). Following further incubation of 4 h, the cells were collect ed, incubated with AlexaFluor 488 - CRT antibody for 2 h, and stained with propidium iodide (PI). The samples were analyzed by flow cytometer (LSRII Orange, BD, USA) to identify cell surface CRT. The fluorescence intensity of stained cells was gated on PI -negative cells. In vivo efficacy: The PDT efficacy of DBC -Hf was investigated using a flank CT26 mouse tumor model and HT29 subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Tumor bearing mice were established by subcutaneous inoculation of HT29 cell suspension (2\u00d7 106 cells per mouse) or CT26 cell suspension (1\u00d7 106 cells per mouse) into the right flank region of 6 -week athymic male nude mice or 6 -week BALB/c male mice, respectively. Six groups were included for comparison: (1) PBS control, (2) DBC -Hf, (3) DBP -Hf, (4) H 2DBC , or H 2DBP at a ligand dose of 1 mg/kg or (6) DBC -Hf at a ligand dose of 3.5 mg/kg. Twelve hours post injection, each mouse in group (1) -(5) was irradiated at the tumor site with light (0.1 W/cm2) for 15 min (90 J/cm2) and the mice in group (6) receive d light irradiation (0.1 W/cm2) for 30 min (180 J/cm2). For (1) to (5) groups on the CT26 model, mice are treated again 4 days after first treatment, while for (1) to (5) 89 groups on HT29 model, mice are treated every 4 days for total 4 treatments. When tumo rs reached 100 mm3, PBS, DBC 2DBC, or H 2DBP were intratumorally injected to animals. At 12 h post -injection, mice were anesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and tumors were irradiated with a 640 nm LED for DBP -Hf/H 2DBP or a 650 nm LED for DBC -Hf/H 2DBC. The light intensity was measured as 100 mW/cm2. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, tumor growth and body weight evolution were monitored. The tumor size was measured with a digital caliper every day. Tumor volumes were calculated as follows: (width2 \u00d7 length)/2. Finally, all mice were sacrificed when the tumor size of control group exceeded 2 cm3, and the excised tumors were photographed and weighed. The tumors were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium, sectioned at 5 -\u00b5 m thickn ess, and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain for histopathological analysis. 3.5 References Dougherty, T.J.

A Chlorin -based Nanoscale -Organic Framework Systemically Rejects Colorectal Cancers via Synergistic Photodynamic Therapy and Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy 4.1 Rationale of the nMOF design In Chapters 2 and 3, we demonstrated examples of nMOFs to exert highly efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).1,2 Moreover, we showed in Chapter 3 that nMOF -mediated PDT causes immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumors. We believe that an immunotherapeutic agent that alters the tumor microenvironment can potentiate the immune activation by PDT and lead to systemic cancer vaccination. We herein designed a new nMOF, TBC -Hf, 4TBC) and Hf -based SBUs. We took advantage of the highly porous structure of th e nMOF to load an IDO inhibitor (IDOi) afford IDOi@TBC -Hf. The IDOi@TBC -Hf system enables a novel cancer treatment strategy by combining nMOF -enabled PDT and IDOi -based immunotherapy (Figure 4 -1). Unlike the combination of chemotherapy/radio therapy with immunotherapy that the treatment dose on major tumor is compromised, the new treatment enjoys the local tumor destruction potency by PDT while eliciting systemic antitumor immune response. Hence, the synergistic combination therapy achieved ef fective local and distant tumor rejection in colorectal cancer models. 92 Figure 4 -1 Schematic presentation of combined PDT and immunotherapy by IDOi@TBC -Hf. Local injection of IDOi@TBC -Hf and light irradiation generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), causin g immunogenic cell death (ICD), and releasing tumor -associated antigens that are presented to T -cells. Meanwhile, the inhibitor released from IDOi@TBC - tryptophan/kynurenine catabolism to activate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironmen t. The combination of antigen presentation from PDT and checkpoint blockade by IDO inhibition causes T -cell proliferation and infiltration, leading to not only eradication of local, treated tumors but also rejection of distant, untreated tumors. 93 4.2 Result s 4.2.1 Synthesis and characterization of H 4TBC ligand -benzoato)chlorin (H 4TBC) was synthesized in 3 steps as depicted in scheme 4-1. Scheme 4-1 Synthesis of 6.83 g of methylterephthalaldehydate (41.6 mmol) and 2.80 mL of pyrrole (40.4 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL of propionic acid. The s olution was heated to reflux (150 \u00b0 C) in dark overnight. The purple product was collected by vacuum filtration and was washed with water, methanol and ethyl ether in 4TBP (500 mg, 0.59 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (750 mg, 5.4 mmol) were added to a 2 -neck round bottom fl ask. 40 mL of anhydrous pyridine was added under nitrogen. The solution was heated to 105 \u00b0 C before the addition of 4.0 mL of p - toluenesulfonhydrazide solution (0.30 M in anhydrous pyridine). The reaction mixture was kept 94 at 105 \u00b0 C for 4 hours during which another 2 fractions of p -toluenesulfonhydrazide solutions (0.30 M in anhydrous pyridine, 4.0 mL for each fraction) were added every 2 h. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 105 \u00b0 C in the dark for another 12 h. The product was extracted with 2:1 ethyl acetate/water and washed with 2 M HCl, 2 M phosphoric acid, water, and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The solution was treated with 2,3 -dichloro -5,6-dicyano - benzoquinone (via slow addition of 1 mg/mL solution in chloroform) until the characteristi c absorption of the over -reduced product at ~735 nm disappeared. The product was purified by aluminum oxide column chromatography with dichloromethane -tetra(p -methylbenzoato)chlorin .

An aqueous NaOH solution (2 mol/L, 40 equiv.) was added to a solution of Me 4TBC after degas with N 2. The solution was heated at 74 \u00b0 C (reflux) overnight. After removing most of the organic volatile by a rotary evaporator, the solution was diluted with water and neutralized with HCl (1 M) to pH=3. The product was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water and methanol before drying on the vacuum. Yield: 78%. 1H (m, 5,10,15,20 -tetra(p -benzoato)chlorin .

TBC -Hf was washed with copious amounts of DMF, 1% triethylamine (NEt 3) in ethanol (v/v), and ethanol successively and stored in ethanol as a stock suspension. As a control, TBP -Hf with the corresponding porphyrin ligand 99 4TBP) was synthesized a solvothermal HfCl 4 and H 4TBP in N,N -diethylformamide (DEF) at 120 \u00b0 C and washed in the same fashion as for TBC -Hf. TBC -Hf and TBP -Hf adopt the the previously reported TBP -Zr analog (MOF -545), based carboxylate moieties from the TBC li gands bridge 8 out of 12 edges of octahedral Hf 6(\u00b53-O)4(\u00b53-OH) 4 SBUs. The remaining coordination sites on the SBUs are occupied by 4 water and 4 terminal hydroxy groups on the equatorial plane to afford a hexagonal framework of Hf 6(\u00b53-O)4(\u00b53- OH) 4(OH) 4(H2O)4(TBC) 2 (Figure 4-7b). The nMOFs therefore feature large one -dimensional channels with diameters of 3.5 nm along the c axis, along with smaller channels with diameters of 1.0 nm along the c axis and 1.1 nm \u00d7 0.9 nm windows perpendicular TBC and 1077 and 1462 m2/g, respectively (Figure 4-8). During the course of this study, a few reports of TBP -based nMOFs with a cubic structure for PDT have appeared.4,5 However, we expect that our highly porous TBP -Hf control will outperform the cubic TBP -based nMOFs due to the enhanced 1O2 diffusion through the nMOF channels. In TBC -Hf and TBP -Hf, the porphyrin and chlorin rings are highly rigid in the nMOF structures to minimize energy transfer and self -quenching. 100 Figure 4 -7 Structures of TBC in comparison with MOF secondary unit (SBU) of TBC -Hf (Violet, Hf; red, O; gray, C).

The Soret absorption of TBC -Hf almost that of the free ligand ( max=421 nm) while the Q -bands to 520, 548, 600, and 653 nm. In comparison, the Soret peaks H 4TBP TBP -Hf are at max=420 nm and 418 nm, respectively, and the Q -bands are at 516, 549, 592 and 646 nm for H 4TBP and 517, 550, 593 and 647 nm for TB P-Hf. The lowest energy Q -band of the chlorin therefore red -shifts by 6 nm after reduction from the porphyrin counterpart (652 nm compared to 646 nm). The extinction coefficient of at energy absorption ( =44700 M-1\u00b7 cm-1) is ~9 H 4TBP (=4800 M-1\u00b7 cm-1) while the (=38500 M- 1\u00b7 cm-1) TBP -Hf (=6400 M-1\u00b7 TBC -Hf (653 nm) is at a wavelength of 7 -nm longer than t hat of our previously reported DBC -Hf and the of TBC -Hf is ~1.6 fold higher than that of DBC -Hf. 105 Figure 4 -12 Photophysics and photochemistry of the ligands and nMOFs .

H 4TBP fluorescence emissions are close to those of H4TBC, though the 651 nm/713 nm peak intensity ratio is ~2 (Figure 4 -12b). After forming nMOFs, the fluorescence intensities TBC -Hf, the fluorescence blue to 650 nm and 712 nm and the intensities decrease by 5.3 and 4.7 respectively; drop by 9.0 -fold and 6.5 -fold, respectively. The decrease in fluorescence i ntensity results from the enhanced intersystem crossing after coordination of the chlorin/porphyrin ligands to Hf on the SBUs. Time -Correlated Single Photon Counting measurement results also supported this interpretation: the fluorescence lifetime at 650 nm dropped from 9.56 ns for H 4TBC to 8.25 ns for TBC -Hf and from 9.25 ns for H 4TBP to 8.38 ns for TBP -Hf (Figure 4 -12 d, e and Table 4 -1). Table 4 -1 Lifetimes fluorescence TBC -Hf, H 4TBP, and TBP -Hf et Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG) assay. The nMOF samples and ligand controls were irradiated with a LED ( max=650 nm, 20 mW/cm2) and the fluorescence enhancement upon reaction of SOSG with 1O2 was measured by a fluorimeter (excitation/emission at 504/525 nm). The fluorescence intensity plotted against irradiation time fit exponential decay equations, as we had previously observed in other nMOF systems,1,2 indicating a pseudo first -order 1O2 generation 4 -12f). TBC -Hf outperforms TBP -Hf and H 4TBC in terms of 1O2 generation efficiency. 4.2.3 In vitro PDT efficacy and mecha nistic study We first confirmed efficient cellular uptake of TBC -Hf and TBP -Hf by incubated with colorectal cancer CT26 cells at a ligand concentration of 25 M for 24 h. The Hf contents inside cells were determined to be (2.07\u00b1 0.26) and (1.79\u00b1 0.17) nmol/104 cells, respectively, by ICP -MS analysis (Figure 4 -13). The in vitro PDT efficacy of TBP-Hf, TBC -Hf, and both ligands against TBC -Hf TBP under nMOFs and ligands outperformed protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) upon irradiation, a commonly used PS, while no cytotoxicity was observed in dark control groups (Figure 4 -14). The IC 50 values of TBC -Hf, TBP -Hf, 10.04\u00b1 1.22, 12.83\u00b1 1.59 and 23.72\u00b1 0.60 M, respectively, at an irradiation dose of 90 J/cm2 (Figure 4 -14c). These results were confirmed by a second colorectal cancer MC38 cell with IC50 values of 2.57\u00b1 0.85 and 108 17.9\u00b1 5.0 M for TBC -Hf and H 4TBC, respectively. The IC 50 values exceeded 50 M for TBP- Hf, H 4TBP, and PpIX for MC38 cells (Figure 4 -14d). To demonstrate the versatility of our nMOF system, an unrelated B16F10 melanoma cell were employed to confirm the PDT efficacy, yielding IC 50 values of 5.48 TBC-Hf TBP-Hf050100150200250 Hf concentration nmol/104 cells Figure TBP -Hf and TBC -Hf in CT26 cells . 109 Figure 4 -14 In vitro PDT efficacy on CT26 (a,c), MC38 (b,d) and B16F10 (e) cells . 110 Unlike most conventional cytotoxic agents, PDT is known to induce ICD via apoptosis and necrosis, thereby mediating antitumor immune response.7 We confirmed that both apoptosis and necrosis occur upon treatment with PDT by flow cytometry of Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V - labeled dead cells. MC38 cells were incubated TBC -Hf, at 1 \u00b5 M (ligand concentration of 2 M) follow ed by light irradiation at 90 J/cm2 (650 nm, 100 mW/cm2). Significant amounts of cells underwent apoptosis/necrosis when treated with PDT of TBC -Hf, TBP 55.5%, and 57.6% healthy cells, respectively, compared to 80-90% healthy cells in dark control or PBS -treated cells with irradiation (Figure 4 -15a). These results were further confirmed in CT26 cells under the same conditions (Figure 4 -15b). These results indicate the chlorin -based TBC -Hf is a more efficient PS than the porphyrin -based TBP -Hf at equivalent nMOF and light doses. We also investigated the ability of PDT treatment to induce ICD by determining cell -surface expression of \u00b5 M (ligand concentration of 2 \u00b5 M) followed by light irradiation at 90 J/cm2. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were collected and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 -CRT antibody and propidium iodide (PI, Figure 4 -16). The fluorescence intensity of stained cells was gated on PI-negative cells. For immunostaining analysis, the cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488 -CRT and DAPI, and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Figure 4 -17). In both instances, cells treated with nMOF or ligand sho wed significant CRT expression on the cell-surface upon irradiation but none with PBS control or without irradiation. Due to the higher 1O2 generation efficiency and in vitro PDT efficacy of TBC -Hf, we focus our subsequent in vivo studies on TBC -Hf and use TBP-Hf as a control wherever appropriate. 111 Figure 4 -15 Annexin V/PI analysis of CT26 (a) and TBP -Hf, H 4TBC, and 4TBP with or without irradiation (90 J/cm2). The quadrants from lower left to upper left (counte r clockwise) represent healthy, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells, respectively.

Scale bar = 50 M. 114 4.2.4 The abscopal effect of IDOi@TBC -Hf The immunoregulatory enzyme IDO is often overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment, where it facilitates the survival and growth of tumor cells by suppress ing antitumor immune responses.8 The small -molecule IDO by Incyte, can reverse immunosu ppression and inhibits tumor growth upon oral administration.6 We propose that by encapsulation of IDOi into the nMOF channels, IDOi@TBC -Hf can release IDOi both into the local tumor environment and enter blood circulation for systemic IDO inhibition. The effects of IDOi will alter the suppressive tumor microenvironment of both the treated and untreated tumors. We hypothesize that synergizing local PDT of IDOi@TBC -Hf with checkpoint blockade therapy can promote an efficient abscopal effect, regression of an unt reated tumor at a distant site following the local treatment of another tumor in the same organism. We evaluated the abscopal effect of IDOi@TBC -Hf and light irradiation in two immunocompetent mouse models using bilateral tumor models of colorectal cancers CT26 and MC38 in the flank regions of BALB/c mice and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. When the primary tumors reached ~100 mm3, mice received a single injection of H 4TBC, 4TBC plus IDOi, TBC - Hf, or IDOi@TBC -Hf into the primary tumors at a ligand dose of 20 \u00b5 mol/kg or a corresponding IDOi dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Twelve hours after injection, the primary tumors were irradiated at a light dose of 90 J/cm2 (650 nm, 100 mW/cm2). Mice treated with IDOi@TBC -Hf without light irradiation served as dark controls. As depicte d in Figure 4 -18 and 4 -19, local nMOF injection with light irradiation led to near elimination of the treated primary tumors. At the endpoint, CT26 tumor -bearing mice treated with IDOi@TBC -Hf or -Hf and PDT therapy had tumors only (1.1\u00b1 0.2)% and (0.7\u00b1 0. 4)% the size of PBS treated tumors, respectively. Similarly, MC38 tumor -bearing mice had tumors only (0.8\u00b1 0.3)% and (0.9\u00b1 0.4)% of the size of PBS treated 115 tumors, respectively. H 4TBC with light irradiation and IDOi@TBC -Hf dark group failed to inhibit the tu mor growth while H 4TBC plus IDOi with light irradiation slightly inhibits the tumor growth (Table 4 -2). Moreover, only PDT treatment of IDOi@TBC -Hf successfully reduced the sizes of the untreated distant tumors. Tumors began shrinking on Day 6 and 5 after treatment in the CT26 and MC38 models, respectively, suggesting the treatment evoked systemic antitumor immunity in mice (Table 4 -2 and 4 -3). TBC -Hf with light irradiation and IDOi@TBC -Hf dark control slightly inhibited the distant tumor growth, showing in effectiveness of monotherapies.

We further investigated the underlying immunol ogical mechanisms in the MC38 model by Enzyme -Linked and flow cytometry. We first performed an ELISPOT assay to detect the presence of tumor antigen -specific T cells 14 days after treatment. As shown in Figure 4 -20, the number of antig en-specific IFN - producing T cells a) b)118 increased to 799 per million splenocytes in mice treated with IDOi@TBC -Hf (vs. 128 per million splenocytes in PBS group, P=0.0879), indicating that PDT of IDOi@TBC -Hf induced in situ tumor vaccination to effectively gene rate tumor -specific T cell response. Figure 4 -20 Antigen -specific IFN - spot forming cells (SFC) at 14 days after IDOi@TBC -Hf PDT treatment . Further analysis of the immune response was carried out by investigating the tumor - infiltrating leukocyte profi les in each tumor by flow cytometry. Previous research has shown that PDT can evoke acute inflammation,7 so we first evaluated the popul ation of leukocytes responsible for innate immune response (neutrophils, B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages) in both primary and distant tumors 12 hours after PDT treatment. As shown in Figure 4 -21, IDOi@TBC -Hf administration and light irradiation l ed to significant increase in the percentage of tumor -infiltrating neutrophils and B cells with respect to the total number of cells in the tumor compared to PBS (neutrophils: P=0.0369 vs. PBS; B cells: P=0.0215 vs. PBS). To our surprise, No pep. KSP012PBS IDOi@TBC-HfIFN- SFC/103cells119 the percentage of infiltrating dendritic cells (DC) appeared to decrease compared to PBS control in the primary tumor (Figure 4 -21c), although the difference is not of statistical significance. Figure 4 -21 Population of leukocytes in the tumor 12 h after IDOi@TBC -Hf PDT treatment . The percentage of tumor -infiltrating neutrophils (a), B cells (b), DCs (c) and macrophages (d), with respect to the total number of cells in the tumor compared to PBS. To better understand the roles these types of cells played in the antigen pr esentation after PDT, we further detected the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC -II) expression on these cells 12 hours after PDT treatment. MHC -II mediates establishment of specific immunity by interacting with CD4 molecules on the surface of helper T cells.9 We found a significant decre ase in MHC -II expression levels on DCs, macrophages, and neutrophils P=0.0004 vs. PBS; neutrophils: P=0.006 120 vs. PBS, Figure 4 -22). These results imply that TBC -Hf mediated PDT may have an im pact on the mode of antigen presentation, which is typically the role of DCs. Figure 4 -22 The MHC -II expression level in the tumor 12 h after IDOi@TBC -Hf PDT treatment . (a) DCs, (b) macrophages, (c) B cells, and (d) neutrophils. We also determined the t umor -infiltrating leukocyte profiles 12 days post PDT treatment. As shown in Figure 4 -23 a-c, IDOi@TBC -Hf significantly increased the proportion of infiltrating CD8+ T cells relative to the total number of cells in the distant tumor (P=0.0012 vs. PBS), an essential step to mounting an antitumor immune response to induce the abscopal effect. In both primary and distant tumors, the percentages of infiltrating CD45+ leukocytes and CD4+ T cells with respect to the total number of cells in the tumors were signif icantly increased in mice treated with PDT of IDOi@TBC (Treated tumor, CD45+: P=0.0061 vs. PBS; cells: P=0.0388 vs. PBS). Interestingly, IDOi@TBP -Hf administration and PDT also led to a significant increase in the percentages of tumor -infiltrating B cells and a decrease in the percentages of tumor infiltrating DCs with respect to the total number of cells in the primary tumors 12 days post the treatment (B cells, P=0.0017 vs . PBS; DCs: P=0.0041 vs. PBS, Figure 4 -23 d, e). We also performed T cell blocking experiments to confirm the involvement of T cells in the efficient abscopal response on bilateral subcutaneous MC38 mouse model. MC38 tumor -bearing mice were treated with ID Oi@TBC -Hf and light irradiation as described before and received intraperitoneal injection of Mouse IgG, anti -CD4, or anti -CD8 antibody at a dose of 200 \u00b5 g/mouse/injection on Day 0 and Day 5 post the PDT treatment. While mice treated with Mouse IgG showed regression of both primary and distant tumors, no abscopal effect was observed on mice with blocking of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Figure 4 -24). Furthermore, blocking of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells also diminished the effect of IDOi@TBC -Hf in regressing the primary t umors. These results indicated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were essential not only to abscopal effect but also to primary tumor rejection. 122 Figure 4 -23 Tumor -infiltrating leukocyte profiles in the tumors 12 days after IDOi@TBC -Hf PDT treatment .

Black, red and blue arrows refer to the time of IDOi@TBC -Hf injection, light irradiation and antibody injection, respectively. 4.3 Discussion In this chapter, we present a new treatment strategy that combines local PDT of a new nMOF, TBC -Hf, in combination with IDO inhibition with nMOF -delivered small molecules to achieve effective and consistent abs copal responses in mouse models of colorectal cancers. We have shown that IDOi released from locally injected IDOi@TBC -Hf reversed the suppressive tumor microenvironment in both treated and untreated tumors, which further synergized with TBC -Hf mediated PD T to stimulate the immune system for activating both acute innate and prolonged adaptive immune response to achieve efficient local tumor regression and a consistent abscopal response. Our treatment method maximizes the benefits of local treatment with systemic immune response for the rejection of both primary and distant tumors while minimizing side effects, potentially affording an effective systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancers. 124 Owing to the outstanding photophysical the chlori n-based TBC ligand, TBC - Hf shows its porphyrin counterpart TBP -Hf. The tetracarboxylate ligand constructs a robust framework with very large channels for small molecular inhibitor loading and ROS diffusion, and the coord ination to Hf 6 SBUs enhances intersystem crossing to enhance 1O2 generation. As we10-13 and others14-16 have demonstrated the synthetic tunability and potential biomedical applications of nMOFs in the past decade, we believe that the nMOF compositions and structures can be further optimized in order to enhance light absorption and 1O2 generation/diffusion. We thus expect nMOF -based synergistic PDT and immunotherapy have the potential for future clinical translation for the treatment of metastatic cancers. We propose that IDOi@TBC -Hf administration and light irradiati on causes highly efficient tumor regression of both primary treated tumors and distant untreated tumors owing to two factors. First, TBC -Hf based PDT causes ICD of cancer cells in the primary tumors, which activates innate immune system and promotes antige n presentation (Figure 4 -1). The massive stressed and dying necrotic tumor cells in the PDT -treated primary tumor sites are engulfed by the innate immune effector cells followed by presenting tumor -derived antigenic peptides to T cells, thus stimulating a tumor -specific T cell response. Second, the IDOi is released from intratumorally injected IDOi@TBC -Hf to systemically inhibit IDO activity to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environments. The two treatment modalities, PDT and IDOi checkpoint blockade t herapy, synergize with each other to kill cancer cells locally and create an immunogenic tumor microenvironment systemically, leading to durable and consistent abscopal effects. 125 Dendritic cells are one of the most important antigen -presenting cells and pr evalently believed to play a key role in antitumor immune response.17 However, we observed a slight decrease of DC population percentage along with a significant decrease of MHC -II expression level on DCs after PDT treatment with IDOi@TBC -Hf, indicating an altered role for DCs after PDT treatment. Meanwhile, the increase of both neutrophils and B cell population percentages implies a compensating effect of other an tigen presenting cells to present tumor -associated antigens and initiate the antitumor immune response. Previous studies also suggested that neutrophils, rather than DCs, directly affect T cell proliferation upon PDT treatment.18 Our future efforts will be directed toward elucidating the roles of neutrophils and B cells in initiating antitumor immune response after the PDT of IDOi@TBC -Hf. 4.4 Conclusion In this work, we have rationally designed a chlorin -based nMOF with large channels for highly efficient P DT, while simultaneously loaded an IDO inhibitor into its channels to achieve combination therapies of PDT and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. We consistently observed an abscopal effect in mice receiving treatment with PDT of IDOi@TBC -Hf. The in situ vaccination induced by PDT treatment and IDOi immunotherapy synergize with each other and effectively generate systemic antitumor immunity. We believe the present strategy has the potential to significantly increase the durable response rates of checkpoint blockade cancer immunotherapy and lead to clinical benefits for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers and other difficult -to-treat cancers. 126 4.5 Methods Materials, cell lines, and animals: All of the starting materials were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich and Fisher (USA), unless otherwise noted, and used without further purification. Murine colon adenocarcinoma cells CT26 and MC38 and murine melanoma cells B16F10 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultur ed in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS. C57BL/6 female mice (6 weeks, 20 -22 g) and BALB/c female mice (6 weeks, 20 -22 g) were provided by Harlan Laboratories, Inc (USA). The study pro tocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Chicago. Synthesis of TBC -Hf: To a 2 -dram glass vial was added 1 mL of HfCl 4 solution [2 mg/mL in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 6.2 \u00b5 mol], 1 mL f the 4TBC solution (1.9 mg/mL in DMF, 2.4 \u00b5 mol), \u00b5 L of 88% formic acid (1.4 mmol). The reaction mixture was kept in an 80 \u00b0 C oven for 2 days. The purple powder was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF, 1% triethylamine in ethanol (v/v) and ethanol. Synthesis of TBP -Hf: To a 2 -dram glass vial was added 1 mL of HfCl 4 solution [2 mg/mL in N,N-diethylformamide (DEF), 6.2 \u00b5 1 solution (1.9 mg/mL in DEF, 2.4 \u00b5 mol), and mg of benzoic acid (0.49 mmol). The reaction mixtu re was kept in a 120 \u00b0 C oven for 2 days. The violet powder was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF, 1% triethylamine in ethanol diffraction: TBC -Hf or TBP -Hf sample was prepared by centrifugation in a capillary tube with one end sealed. The powder X -ray diffraction pattern was acquired on Bruker D8 VENTURE single crystal dual -source diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) and integrated by software. BET surface measurement: Nitrogen adsorption of TBC -Hf Analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) at 77K. The BET surface areas were calculated by software to be 1077 and 1462 m2/g. Digestion for ICP -MS: The nMOF samples was dried under vacuum overnight before being digested by a mixture of concentrate nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid (63% HF/69% HNO 3 1/100 v/v). The sample was diluted 35 times and filtered by a PES syringe filter unit before instrument analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis: Thermogravimetric analysis on TBC -Hf Shimadzu TGA -50 thermogravimetric analyzer. The nMOF was collected by centrifugation and dried under vacuum overnight. The sample was then transferred to a platinum plate and heated at 3 \u00b0 C/min to 650 \u00b0 C in air. The weight percentage w as plotted against temperature and was normalized to the weight at 150 \u00b0 C to eliminate the influence of absorbed moisture. The IDOi loading was calculated following the equation below: %=(1 % % )\u00d7100% 128 Fluorescence measurement: The were taken on a spectrofluorophotometer (Fluorolog -3, Horiba, Japan). Samples were prepared as 1 M solutions in phosphate buffer saline o r water by equivalent ligand concentration for the measurements. Fluorescence lifetime measurement: Time -domain lifetimes were measured on a ChronosBH lifetime fluorometer (ISS, Inc.) using Time -Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) methods. The fluoro meter contained Becker -Hickl SPC -130 detection electronics and an HPM - 100-40 Hybrid PMT detector. Excitation was provided 403 nm picosecond pulsed laser source (Hamamatsu PLP -10). Emission wavelengths were selected with interference filters (Semrock). The Instrument Response Function (IRF) was measured to be approximately 0.009 ns FWHM in a 1% scattering solution of Ludox LS colloidal silica. Multi -component exponential decay lifetimes were fit via a forward convolution method in the Vinci control and analysis software. Samples were prepared into solution/suspensions in water for the measurement. Singlet Oxygen Generation: A light -emitting diode (LED) array with peak emission at 650 nm was used as the light source of singlet oxygen generation test. The irradiance of LED is 20 mW/cm2. Singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) reagent (Life Technologies) was employed for the detection of singlet oxygen. H 4TBP, H 4TBC, TBP -Hf and samples were prepared in 1 \u00b5 M solutions/suspensions in water (for the nMOFs, th e concentration was calculated as ligand equivalents). To 2 mL each of these solutions/suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 \u00b5 L at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 \u00b5 M) before fluorescence measurement. For a typical measurement, fluorescence intensit y was acquired on a spectrofluorophotometer (RF -5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with excitation at 504 nm emission at 525 nm (slit width 1.5 nm/3 nm for ex/em). Fluorescence was measured after irradiation by LED for 0 (as background), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 min. 129 Cellular uptake evaluation: TBP-Hf or TBC -Hf was incubated with CT26 cells at a Hf concentration of 150 M for 24 h. The cells were collected, counted with a hemocytomter, and digested by concentrated nitric acid. The cellular uptake amounts of Hf were determined by ICP - MS and normalized with cell numbers. IDOi encapsulation: To a suspension of TBC -Hf in eth anol (2.5 mg/mL, 3.0 mL), 3.3 mg of IDOi was added. The mixture was sonicated for 1 minute and 3.0 mL of water was added. The solution was stirred at room temperature in dark for 12 h to afford IDOi@TBC -Hf. IDOi@TBC - Hf was collected by centrifugation and w ashed with 50% ethanol/water. In vitro PDT efficacy: The cytotoxicity of TBC -Hf and H 4TBC CT26 melanoma cell B16F10, respectively. CT26 cells or B16F10 cells were seeded on 96 -well plates at 1000 ce lls/well. The cells were treated with TBC - Hf and H 4TBC at various ligand concentrations (2, 4, 10, 15, 20, and 50 \u00b5 M base on ligand concentrations). A further incubation of 4 h was allowed followed by replacing the culture medium with 100 \u00b5 L of fresh mediu m. The cells were irradiated with LED light (650 nm) at 100 mW/cm2 for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or kept in dark, respectively. The cells were further incubated to achieve a total incubation time of 72 h. The cell viability was detected by (3 - -Hf was investigated using a bilateral CT26 mouse colorectal cancer model and a bilateral MC38 mous e colorectal cancer model. Tumor bearing mice were established by subcutaneous inoculation of CT26 or MC38 cell suspension (1\u00d7 106 cells per mouse on the right flank and 2\u00d7 105 cells per mouse on the left flank) into 6 -130 week female BALB/c or 6 -week female C57 BL/6 mice, respectively. When the right tumors reached 100 mm3, the CT26 tumor bearing mice received intratumoral injection only into the right tumors of PBS, H 4TBC, H 4TBC+IDOi, TBC -Hf, or \u00b5 mol/kg and IDOi dose of 1.5 mg/ kg. Twelve hours post injection, CT26 tumor bearing mice were anesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and right flank tumors were irradiated with a 650 nm LED at 0.1 W/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). IDOi@TBC -Hf without light irradiation served as a dark control. The nMOF injection and light irradiations were performed every three days for a total two injections and irradiations. For MC38 tumor model, mice received intratumoral injection only into the right tumors of PBS, TBC -Hf, or IDOi@TBC -Hf at a ligand dose \u00b5 mol/kg and IDOi dose of 1.5 mg/kg. Twelve hours post injection, MC38 tumor bearing mice were anesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and right flank tumors were irradiated with a 650 nm LED at 0.1 W/cm2 for 15 min (90 J/cm2). IDOi@TBC -Hf without light i rradiation served as a dark control. The nMOF injection and light irradiations were performed only once on MC38 tumor bearing mice. For both CT26 and MC38 models, no NMOF injection or light irradiation was performed on the left tumors. To evaluate the the rapeutic efficacy, the tumor size was measured with a digital caliper every day. Tumor volumes were calculated as follows: (width2 \u00d7 length)/2. Finally, all mice were sacrificed when the tumor size of control group exceeded 2 cm3, and the excised tumors we re photographed and weighed. T cell blocking: The abscopal effect of IDOi@TBC -Hf was evaluated on bilateral subcutaneous MC38 model on C57BL/6 mice with CD4+ T cell or CD8+ T cell depletion. When the right tumors reached ~100 mm3, IDOi@TBC -Hf was intratumo rally injected to the mice at a dose of 20 \u00b5 mol/kg. Anti -CD4 (for CD4+ T cell depletion), anti -CD8 (for CD8+ T cell depletion), or 131 mouse IgG (control) were intraperitoneally injected to the mice (200 \u00b5 g/mouse/injection) on Day 0 and Day 5 post the first tr eatment. Twelve hours post injection, mice were anesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and the right tumors were irradiated with LED light irradiation (100 mW/cm2, 90 J/cm2, 650 nm). Single IDOi@TBC -Hf injections followed by single light irradiations were c arried out. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, the tumor size was measured with a digital caliper every other day. Tumor volumes were calculated as follows: in by ELISPOT assay (Mouse IFN gamma ELISPOT A Multiscreen HTS -IP plate was coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C with anti - Mouse IFN - capture antibody. Single -cell suspensio ns of splenocytes were obtained from MC38 tumor -carrying mice and seeded onto the antibody -coated plate at a concentration of 2\u00d7 105 cells/well. Cells were incubated with or without KSPWFTTL (KSP) stimulation (10 g/mL; in purity > 95%; PEPTIDE 2.0) for 48 h at 37 \u00b0 C and then discarded. The plate was then incubated with biotin -conjugated anti -IFN- detection antibody at room temperature (r.t.) for 2 h, followed by incubation with Avidin -HRP for 2 h at r.t. AEC substrate solution (Sigma, Cat. AEC101) was adde d for cytokine spot detection. Flow Cytometry: Tumors were harvested, treated with 1 mg/mL collagenase I (Gibco, USA) for 1 h, and ground by the rubber end of a syringe. Cells were filtered through nylon mesh filters and washed with PBS. The single -cell suspension was incubated with anti -CD16/32 (clone 93; eBiosciences) to reduce nonspecific binding to FcRs. Cells were further stained with the following LSR FORTESSA (BD Biosciences) was used for cell acquisition, and data analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (TreeSta r, Ashland, OR). MHC -II expression: Tumors were harvested 12 hours after LED irradiation, treated with 1 mg/mL collagenase I, and ground by the rubber end of a syringe. Cells were filtered through nylon mesh filters and washed with PBS. The single cell sus pension was incubated with anti - CD16/32 (clone 93; eBiosciences) for were determined respectively. 4.6 References 1. Lu, K., He, C. & Lin, W.

A Nanoscale Metal -Organic Framework for the Co -delivery of Chemotherapeutic Agents and Nucleic Acid Drugs 5.1 Rationale of the nMOF design Nanoscale metal -organic frameworks display multifunctionality as a nanocarrier platform for drug delivery, by virtue of their high porosity and structural tunability. In Chapters 2, 3, and4, we showed examples that directly construct nMOFs with cargo molecules as the struts. In this chapte r, we will introduce another work on drug delivery where we employed the large pores of the MOF structure as well as the surface metal coordinate sites for the co -delivery of therapeutic agents to treat resistant cancer. We surmise that nMOFs can realize t he co -delivery of chemotherapeutics and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with the following strategy: the large pores of nMOFs can be used to load chemotherapeutics while the metal ions on the nMOF surfaces can be used to bind siRNAs. The simultaneous and e fficient delivery of cisplatin and pooled siRNAs to ovarian cancer cells can allow for enhanced anticancer efficacy by blocking multiple drug resistance pathways.

Copyright 2014 American Chemical characteriz ation of nMOF (DMF) solution of ZrCl 4 and H 2L at 80 \u00b0 C for 5 days with acetic acid as modulator, which is different from the other reports (Scheme 5 -1).3 To our surprise, the as -synthesized nMOF -1 did not adopts a UiO type structure as predicted, implied by its powder X -ray diffraction (PXRD, Figure 5 -8a) from that -like morphology by Tecnai F30, FEI, USA, Figure 5 - 8b). Instead, a new type of SBU with a formula of [Zr 6(3-O)4(3-OH) 4]2(2-OH) 6 was formed in which two Zr 6(3-O)4(3-OH) 4 SBUs are bridged by 6 2-hydroxyl groups to construct a new structure as modeled in Figure 5 -9. The new structure adopts 31 symmetry and the pore sizes are the same to the UiO type structures with the same ligand. TEM micrographs give the dimensions of the nMOFs to be ~100 nm in diameter of plates and ~30 nm in thickness (Figure 5-8 b,e). High resolution TEM images confirm that the distances between the lattice fringes are 1.83 nm (Figure 5 -8e), corresponding to the predicted d 101 value of 1.87 nm. The fast Fourier transform pattern (FFT) proved a 6 -fold symmetry along the observ ation direction, consistent to the hexagonal symmetry of the structure (Figure 5 -8e, inset). 143 Figure 5 -8 Structural characterization of the nMOFs before and after drug loading .

Interestingly, we observed \"standing\" particles that align perpendicular to the TEM grid (a) as well as a \"leaning\" particle stacking on another plate (b) in the high -resolution TEM graph (Figure 5 -8f). The cisplatin loading in Cis@ nMOF -1 was determined to be inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of -1 is monitored by ICP -MS following dialysis in PBS. The prodrug released slower after encapsulation into nMOF -1 with a total release of 34% up to 24 h (Figure 5 -11). The significantly decreased release rate indi cates successful encapsulation of the prodrug and can be attributed to the collapse of nMOF structure in 5 mM PBS to retard the drug release. The cisplatin prodrug was released even much more slowly from Cis@ nMOF -1 in water, with less than 15% release in 2 4 h. The study shows that negligible amount of cisplatin prodrug was released from Cis@ nMOF -1 during the siRNA loading, which was done in water in 30 min.

Drug resistance often involves multiple and dynamically acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms. Among them, P -glycoprotein (P -gp) is over -expressed in the malignant tissues and is responsible for decreased drug accumulation in cells.4 Bcl-2 is responsible for the activation of cellular anti -apoptotic defense.2,5 Survivin has a functional role in both cell division and apoptosis control, and is often found to be upregulated in cancers.6 Simultaneously blockade of these MDR -relevant molecular signaling pathways can potentially overcome drug resistance in cancer cells. siRNA was loaded onto Cis@ nMOF -1 by simply mixing nMOF in water at a cisplatin : siRNA mas s ratio of 4.5:1 to afford siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 (Scheme 5 -1). siRNA is believed to bind to nMOF -1 surface via multiple coordination bonds between phosphate residues on the siRNA backbone and vacant Zr sites on the nMOF surface 147 (Figure 5 -13). The siRNA loading did not change the morphology of nMOFs as shown by TEM (Figure 5 -8 d,g). Dynamic light scattering (DLS, Nano -ZS, Malvern, UK) increase in the DLS diameter for siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 evidences the presence of siRNA on the nMOF -1 surface. The siRNA binding capabilities of nMOFs were confirmed by gel electrophoresis, which showed tha t nMOFs could efficiently \"capture\" siRNA on the surface as evidenced by the complete retardation of siRNA band migration for siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 (Figure 5 -15a). The siRNA loading efficiency (LE) was also quantitatively examined by fluorimetry. Fluorescently labeled siRNA (TAMRA -siRNA) was used to form siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1, and the LE was determined to be as high as 81.6\u00b1 0.6 %. As a result of steric hindrance on surfaces, nMOFs protected siRNA from RNase degradation: a siRNA incubatin g siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 in serum for up to 4 h while the naked siRNA was completely degraded under the same condition (Figure 5 -15b). Interestingly, siRNA \"coating\" on the NMOF surface significantly retarded protein adsorption, suggesting possible stabilization of NMOFs via siRNA binding (Figure 5 -15c). 148 Figure 5 -13 Structure model of the interaction between the siRNA and nMOF surface magenta, P. 149 Figure 5 -14 DLS plot showing the particle size of nMOF nMOF -1 (b) and siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 (c).

The siRNA uptake was also directly observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As illustrated in Figure 5 -16c, la rge amounts of siRNA (red fluorescence) were located in the cytoplasms of SKOV -3 cells. In addition, zirconium phosphate has extremely low solubility (Ksp=10-134), which demonstrates a high affinity of Zr(IV) to phosphate ions. As illustrated in Figure 5 -16b, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing relatively high phosphate group concentration (2 mM) significantly promoted siRNA release compared to water. It is reasonable siRNA@nMOF -1 control(a) (b)(c) h 1 h 2 h 4 h 0.5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h151 to expect that siRNA could dissociate from Cis@ nMOF -1 by decomposition of nMOF after internalization and entrapment in endosomes due to the presence of much higher concentrations of endogenous phosphate ions in endosomes than in extracellular environments.10,11 The dissociated Zr ions can to the negatively charged and phosphate -group -enriched endosome membrane to disrupt the endosome structure and facilitate the release of entrapped siRNAs. This hypothesis was supported by CLSM studies and time -dependent endosome/siRNA co - localization studies (Figure 5 -17 and 5 -18). After 2 -hour incubation, siRNA in the siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 was able to escape from the endo/lysosome entrapment, as demonstrated by the separation of red (siRNA) and green (Lyso tracker Green stained lysosome) fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Figure 5 -16d). We further evaluated the transfection efficiency mediated by siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 in SKOV -3 As shown in Figure 5 -19, siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 evoked potent gene silencing in SKOV cells at 0.4 \u00b5 g/mL (30 nM) of siRNA as determined by ELISA. Interestingly, by using one-third of the siRNA dose for the pooled siRNAs/Cis@ nMOF -1 compared to single siRNA/ Cis@ nMOF -1, gene silencing efficiencies were achieved, suggesting the synerg istic silencing effects of pooled siRNAs. In comparison, none of the free siRNA solution, Cis@ nMOF -1, and nMOF -1 was able to down -regulate the gene expression. 152 Figure 5 -16 Cellular uptake and endosomal escape of siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 in SKOV of siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 in SKOV -3 cells (n = 3).

The cisplatin cisplatin plus pooled siRNAs/ nMOF -1 were to be 4.7, 4.7\u00b1 1.8, 45.1\u00b1 7.0, and 6.6\u00b1 0.3 \u00b5 M, respectively. N o cytotoxicity (cell viability of 96.2\u00b1 3.4%) was observed in SKOV -3 cells when treated with siRNA/ nMOF -1 at 12 times higher siRNA dose. By -delivering pooled siRNAs and cisplatin utilizing nMOFs, the IC50 value dramatically decreased (by more than 11 fol d) compared to free cisplatin and Cis@ nMOF cell lines including A2780, PC-3, MCF -7, and H460 cells but significantly 50 values in cisplatin -resistant A2780/CDDP cells (4.2\u00b1 0.6 b -f and Table 5 -1). This result suggested that the cisplatin -resistant ovarian cancer cells could be r e-sensitized after transfected with siRNA/ Cis@ synergistic effects siRNA and cisplatin significantly enhanced the in vitro chemotherapeutic efficacy. At 50 times higher nMOF -1 dose, cell viability was determined to be 98.1\u00b1 5.4%, in dicating a lack of toxicity for nMOF -1. We carried out DNA ladder and Annexin V conjugate staining assays in order to demonstrate that the enhanced cytotoxicity of siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 was caused by cell apoptosis rather than necrosis. As indicated in Figure 156 5-22, no DNA fragmentation was detectable in the control, Cis@ nMOF -1, and free cisplatin groups. Cells treated with siRNA/Cis@ nMOF -1 displayed characteristic DNA fragmentation or laddering, demonstrating that the cytotoxicity induced by siRNA/Cis@ associated with apoptosis.

The simplicity of the present approach makes it amenable to co -delivery of chemotherapeutics and other nucleic acid drugs such as siRNA, microRNA, plasmid DNA by nMOFs. We believe that 161 this unique nMOF platform holds great promise in the treatment of difficult -to-cure cancers by co-delivering therapeutic cargoes of disparate characteristics and functions. 5.4 Methods nMOF -1 synthesis: DMF solutions of ZrCl 4 mg/mL, 18 \u00b5 mol) and H 2L (3 mL, 2 mg/mL, 18 \u00b5 mol) were added to a 20 mL glass vial. The mixture was diluted to 10 mL, followed by addition of 750 \u00b5 L of acetic acid. The mixture was kept in an 80 \u00b0 C oven for 5 days. The light yellow product was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF, 5% triethylamine ethanolic so lution and ethanol in sequence, and preserved in ethanol as a stock suspension. (Yield: dissolved in 2 mL of DMF. To this solution 10.7 mg of nMOF -1 was suspended. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 36 hours. The prodrug -loaded nMOF -1 (Cis@ nMOF -1) was and washed with copious amounts of DMF and ethanol in sequence, and was suspended in eth anol. nMOF digestion for NMR: Cis@ nMOF -1 (2-3 mg) is collected by centrifugation and dried on vacuum overnight. The yellow powder is then digested in sodium phosphate (tribasic) saturated D2O by sonication for 10 min and vortex for 2 min. The organic compo nents were extracted by DMSO -d6 for 1H NMR dialyzed in 5 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) in a dialysis bag 162 (MWCO 7000) with sti rring (150 rpm) at 37 \u00b0 C in a beaker.

The FITC -conjugated nMOFs promise a few advantages for pH i sensing includ e: (1) the periodic and porous structures of nMOFs enable high FITC loadings without dye aggregation, thus preventing deleterious self -quenching; (2) the open channels of nMOFs allow rapid and free diffusion of hydronium ions to afford fast sensor response ;18-20 (3) the covalent conjugation of FITC to nMOFs prevents dye leaching, thus eliminating background interference stemming from the released dye during pH i sensing.

The covalent conjugation of FITC to nMOF -1 framework efficiently prevents the dye leaching, which is confirmed by UV -visible spectroscopy. Less than 4.5% of FITC fluorescence was observed in the supernatant after incubating F-nMOF in Hanks's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for 24 h (Figure 6 -6). After incubation in HBSS for 720 722 724 726 728 73001020 330 332 334 336 338 340020406080100176 up to 48 h, F-nMOF exhibited unaltered morphology an d PXRD patterns (Figure 6 -2 a, f, Figure 6-7), indicating its structural stability in the media used for pH i sensing. Low fluorescence efficiency is another common issue for dye -loaded nanosensors, which can be attributed to the insufficient dye loading or self-quenching due to dye aggregation. Typical fluorescence dye loadings in amorphous nanosensors range from 0.1 -0.5% in order to avoid aggregation -induced self -quenching.11,21,22 In contrast, the porous and regular structure of nMOF -1 allows exceptionally high dye loadings without dye aggregation (see below).

We evaluated the fluorescence efficiency of F-nMOF with a series of FITC loadings in order to obtain optimal F-nMOF for pH i sensing. The FITC loading increased with the FITC feed amount (1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, and 30 wt.% ), and exhibited saturation behaviors when FITC feed 0 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 24 h 12 h 48 h178 reached 12 wt.% (Figure 6 -8 and 6 -9). The fluorescence efficiency of F-nMOF at different FITC loadings was evaluated by comparing the absorbance of F-nMOF at 490 nm (Figure 6 -10) and the fluorescence int ensity of F-nMOF at 516 nm (with excitation at 490 nm), respectively. As shown in Figure 6 -11, the absorbance of F-nMOF increased linearly as the FITC loading increased (after subtracting the light scattering of the blank nMOF -1). In contrast, the fluoresc ence linearly increased as the FITC loading increased up to a FITC loading of ~7 wt.% (corresponding to 8 wt.% of feed amount), and then saturated as the FITC loading further increased, suggesting appreciable self -quenching of FITC dyes at >7 wt.% loading. For subsequent pH i sensing and imaging studies, we use F-nMOF with a FITC loading of 4 wt.% in order to avoid self -quenching of FITC dyes and potential complications from different pH dependence behaviors of dye aggregates.

FITC acts as a pH sensor by providing pH -specific ratios of fluorescence intensities at 520 nm when excited at 488 nm and 435 nm, respectively. pH calibrati ons for both free FITC solution and F-nMOF suspension were carried out in acetate and PBS buffers with pH values ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 by fluorimetry. The 520 nm fluorescence intensity ratios by exciting at 488 nm and 435 nm (I 488/520 :I435/520 ) were 181 calculated and the correlation of fluorescence intensity ratio r to pH was established by non - linear curve fitting (Figure 6 -12 a,b), which we will discuss in detail later.

The dual -excitation fluorescence emission intensity ratio ( r) to pH plot was similar to a titration curve, indicating that the pH response likely result from a deprotonation process. The pKa of fluorescein mono -anion is 6.7. The di -anion form of fluorescein has higher absorbance at 490 nm than its mono -anion form w hile the 435 nm absorption peak disappears.23,24 In order to better understand and analyze the correlat ion between r and pH, a fitting was performed as follows: HA and A were used herein to refer to mono - and di -anionic forms of FITC, respectively.

The open channels of F-nMOF facilitate the rapid and free diffu sion of hydronium ions, allowing rapid pH response of conjugated FITC.18 The pH calibration curves of F-nMOF acquired by fluorimetry and CLSM were similar, veri fying the validity of the CLSM quantification method for subsequent live cell imaging studies. The pH response of F-nMOF exhibits high sensitivity and relatively small deviations at pH = 5.0 -7.0, the typical pH range for cell culture media, cytosol, and en docytic compartments. The standard deviations of pH were below 0.2 pH unit in this pH range. Thus, F-nMOF represents an excellent nanosensor for sensing pH i, and is ideally suited for real -time monitoring of endocytosis of nMOF and endosome maturation. 6.2.3 Live cell pH sensing pH measurements of live cells at fixed pH values were then performed to confirm the validity of the pH calibration curve in vitro . Human non -small cell lung cancer H460 cells were incubated with F-nMOF in HBSS for 2 h and then incu bated with fresh pH clamping buffers containing 100 M nigericin and with fixed pH values ranging from 4.0 to 8.0.25 CLSM images 187 were obtained with dual excitation wavelengths and the I 488/520 :I435/520 ratios of F-nMOF particles inside the cells clamped at different pH values were analyzed by Image J (Figure 6 -14). The pH vs. r curve shown in Figur e 6-15 fits well with the pH calibration curve presented in Figure 6 -12c, which further validates the pH calibration curves established by both fluorimetry and CLSM.

Intracellular distribution and stability of nMOF -1 were directly observed by TEM (Figure 6-16 b -d). Upon enter ing the cells, nMOF -1 located at the endosomes and maintained the structural integrity (hexagonal plate -like structure) inside the endosomes. The lattice fringes are clearly visible for endosome -trapped particles. The distance between lattice fringes was measured to be 2.25 nm (Figure 6 -16d), in agreement with the d 100 value of 2.26 nm for the nMOF -1 structure. Fast of -trapped nMOF -1 also gave an electron diffraction pattern that is consistent with that of prist ine nMOF -1, confirming that nMOF -1 remain crystalline inside endosomes. These results collectively demonstrate that F-nMOF is a reliable pH i sensor owing to its efficient endocytosis and adequate stability inside cells. 190 .

The luminal pH of endocytic organelles is acidic, and acidification constitutes an im portant part of endosome maturation.26 Endosome maturation can be completed within 30 minutes, with the pH dropping from ~6.8 (early endosome) to ~5.0 (late end osome).1,26 Because of the high sensitivity of F-nMOF in sensing pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 and its rapid and efficient endocytosis, we surmised that F-nMOF would be able to reveal the endosome acidification process and its own intracellular fate. Live cell imaging was thus performed to monitor the endocytosis of F-nMOF (Figure 6 -17). Images were acquired every 2 0 s using dual excitation wavelengths (488 and 435 nm). The internalized F-nMOF particles were tracked and the 488/435 fluorescence intensity ratios were quantified by Image J. The pH of each individual endosome with F-nMOF entrapment was calculated using the pH calibration curve of F-nMOF obtained by CLSM (Figure 6 -12c) and plot against time. 192 Figure 6 -17 Time relapse pH changes in individual endosomes .

The pH values of ROI 3 and ROI 4 in video 1 and ROI 3 in video 2 (referring to Supplemental File video 2 and SI of J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 2014 , 136, particles were entrapped in endosomes and experienced endosome maturation. Interestingly, we also observed exocytosis of F-nMOF : ROI 1 in Figure 6 -17b and video 2 did not show significant acidification in the first 3 00 s and the F- nMOF particles were recycled back to the cell membrane and underwent exocytosis in 300 s. Five individual F-nMOF particles were observed after exocytosis, likely from one single endosome. Additionally, the pH of ROI 1 in Figure 6 -17b and vid eo 2 was about 6.5 before exocytosis (Figure 6 -17d), which was consistent with the pH for typical recycling endosomes (pH 6.5). ROI 2 in Figure 6 -17b and video 2 also experienced exocytosis after about 500 s and its pH remained at ~6.5 (Figure 6 -17d). Thes e results suggest that sufficient endosome acidification is necessary for intracellular trafficking of nMOFs. In the absence of acidification process, nMOFs undergo exocytosis mediated by recycling endosomes.1 We also performed pH i measurements on fixed cells that had been incubated with F-nMOF . The cells were incubated with F-nMOF for 5 -20 min, fixed, and subjected to CLSM observation. The pH values of individual e ndosome in cells incubated with F-nMOF for different time periods were analyzed to provide histograms showing the numbers of endosomes of different pH values (Figure 6 -19). The endosome maturation evolved over time with peak pH decreasing from 6.4 at 5 min to 5.6 at 20 min, which is consistent with previously reported endosome maturation processes.26 194 Figure 6 -18 Orthogonal views of cells incubated with F-nMOF showing that the particle of interest was stuck on the cell membrane over time .

FITC conjugated nMOF -1 exhibited desired structural stability, fluorescence efficiency, pH response sensitivity, and efficient cellular uptake. Combining all thes e advantages of F-nMOF , this novel fluorescence nanosensor provides a reliable and accurate method for real-time intracellular pH sensing. Additionally, the present study also offers the first insight into the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking proc ess with a DMF solution of ZrCl 4 (1.4 mg/mL), and the mixture was kept in an 80 \u00b0 C oven for 5 days. The prod uct was collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF, triethylamine/ethanol (1:20, v/v), and ethanol. FITC conjugation: For a an anhydrous DMF solution of FITC (50 \u00b5 g/mL) was added to an nMOF -1 suspension (0.5 mg in 0.5 mL of anhydrous DMF). Different FITC feed amounts (from 1 wt.% to 30 wt.%) were used to evaluate the correlation between FITC loading and fluorescence efficiency. The mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 24 hours and the orange F-nMOF product was collec ted by centrifugation and washed and ethanol. Authentic FITC -conjugated ligand (FITC -L) was also synthesized for comparison. mixture of H2L (10.2 mg, 0.031 mmol) and FITC (11.8 mg, 0.030 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of 197 anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in a 20 -mL glass vial. The solution was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 6 hours. The solution was lyophilized to remove most of the solvent. The remaining solution (about 0.5 mL) was added to 100 mL of dichloromethane. Yellow precipitat e was collected by centrifugation (d, 2H), 8.05-8.00 (m, 3H), 7.89 (d, 2H), 7.81 (dd, 2H), (m, 3H), (d, -1 was digested in a saturate solution of potassium phosphate in deuterium oxide. The organic species were extracted by DMSO -d6. The 1H NMR spectra of DMSO -d6 for comparison . Mass spectroscopy: F -nMOF was digested in a saturated potassium phosphate aqueous solution and the ligand was extracted with DMSO. The sample was delivered with 100% methanol on an LC-MS instrument (Agilent 1100 LC/MSD with ESI and APCI ion ). le aching test: F -nMOF was incubated in HBSS at a concentration of 0.22 g/L. After 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h or 24 h of incubation the suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove nMOFs and 500 L of supernatant was collected for UV -vis measur ement (and 500 L HBSS was compensated each time). The supernatants were diluted by 5 fold with HBSS and subjected to UV -vis analysis. Accumulative FITC release was calculated by comparing the FITC amount in the supernatant with the total FITC loading. FITC loading quantification: FITC was dissolved in a triethylamine/DMF (1:9, v/v) solution to obtain a series of FITC solutions with concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 mg/L. Absorption 198 spectra were recorded with a UV -vis spectrophotometer (UV -2401PC, Shimadzu , Japan). A standard curve was plotted from linear fitting of the absorbance at 523 nm as a function of FITC concentrations. The extinction coefficient was determined to be 0.0840 L\u00b7 mg-1\u00b7 cm-1. The supernatant collected from each washing step after FITC loa ding was prepared into 3.3 mL of triethylamine/DMF (1:9, v/v) solution, and the FITC amount was quantified by UV -vis spectrophotometer. The FITC loading amount was calculated by subtracting the amount in the supernatant (unloaded) from the feed amount. Fluorescence efficiency in nMOFs with different FITC loading: nMOF -1 and F-nMOF with different dye loadings were dispersed in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) at an nMOF concentration of 50 mg/L. The absorption spectra of F-nMOF were acquired and corrected b y eliminating the scattering background from blank nMOF -1. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of F-nMOF was determined at excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 516 nm. The absorbance at 490 nm and fluorescence intensity of F-nMOF (excitation at 490 nm and emission at 516 nm) were plotted against FITC loading amount. Ratiometric pH calibration and measurements in buffers: The pH response of F-nMOF was evaluated in buffered solution with pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 with a spectrofluorop hotometer (RF-5301PC, Leica SP5 II, Integrated Microscopy Core Facility at the University of Chicago). For the calibration by fluorimetry, 20 \u00b5 L of 1 mg/mL F-nMOF or 0.1 mg/mL FITC free sol ution was added to 2 mL of buffered solution (acetic buffered solution for pH 4.0 -6.0 and phosphate buffered solution for pH 6.5 -8.0), respectively. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using two excitation wavelengths, 435 nm and 488 nm. The fluorescence em ission intensity ratio was 199 calculated at emission wavelength of 520 nm. A pH calibration curve was obtained by plotting the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 488 nm and 435 nm (I 488/520 :I435/520 ) as a function of pH. For the calibration by CLSM, 1 \u00b5 L of 1 mg/mL F-nMOF was mixed with 9 \u00b5L of HBSS Hank's Balanced Salt Solution of which the pH was adjusted by 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl to 4.0 -8.0, and added to a glass -bottom petri dish (No. 1.5, uncoated glass, MatTek Corporation). The images were acquired using tw o different lasers (435 nm and 488 nm) and the same filter for 488 nm laser by CLSM. The fluorescence intensity of nMOF particles at dual excitation wavelengths was quantified directly from the images using Image J, and the fluorescence emission intensity ratio (488 nm versus 435 nm) was calculated accordingly. An in vitro pH calibration curve was obtained by plotting the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 488 nm and 435 nm (I 488/520 :I435/520 ) as a function of pH. pH clamping and measurement experiments: H460 cells were seeded on a glass -bottom petri dish (No. 1.5, coated with poly -lysine, MatTek Corporation) at cell density of 5\u00d7 105 cells and further cultured for 24 h. The cell culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh HBSS. The cells were further cultured with F-nMOF for 2 h. After the incubation, the HBSS was removed and replaced by clamping buffers (120 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM CaCl 2, 20 mM HEPES) of pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.0, containing 100 M nigericin. Images were collected using Leica SP5 II microscope equipped with 100X, 1.4 oil objective, PMT fluorescence detector, transmitted light detector with DIC polarizer, and full wrap incubator box with warm air heating for live samples controlled by LAS_AF Leica confocal software. For pH measurements, cells were imaged in three channels to yield three images, (i) exciting at 488 nm and collecting at 520 nm (ii) exciting at 435 nm and col lecting at 520 nm (iii) 200 DIC. Mean intensity of F-nMOF inside the cells was measured in 488 nm and 435 nm channels and a ratio of 488 nm to 435 nm intensities of F-nMOF was obtained. The pH was plot against I488/520 : I435/520 . Time -dependent cellular uptake : H460 cells were seeded on a 6 -well plate at 1\u00d7 106 cells per well and cultured for 24 h. Thirty microliter of 2 mg/mL F-nMOF were added to each well. After a 10 -min, 20 -min, 30 -min, and 120 -min incubation, cells were collected by cell scraper, washed with PBS three times, and counted with hemocytometer. The cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and the cell pellet was digested with 500 \u00b5 L of concentrated nitric acid. After 24 h, the digestion was diluted with water and subjected to inductively coup led plasma mass spectrometry (ICP -MS, Agilent 7700X) to determine the Zr concentration. Results were expressed as the amount of F-nMOF (pg) calculated from the Zr concentration associated with one cell. TEM observation of nMOF -1 cellular uptake: The uptake and intracellular trafficking of nMOF -1 in H460 cells were directly observed by TEM. H460 cells were seeded on 10 -cm petri dish at 2\u00d7 106 cells and cultured for 24 h. Two hundred microliters of 1 mg/mL nMOF -1 were added to the cells. Following incubating f or 2 h, the cells were fixed, sectioned at 40 -70 nm thickness, and observed under TEM. Live cell image acquisition and analysis: H460 cells were seeded on a glass -bottom petri dish (No. 1.5, coated with poly -lysine, MatTek Corporation) at cell density of 5 \u00d7 105 cells and further cultured for 24 h. The cell culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh HBSS before live cell imaging to avoid auto -fluorescence coming from the culture medium. The live cell imaging started right after adding 25 \u00b5 L of 1 mg/mL F-nMOF to the cells. Images were 201 collected using Leica SP5 II microscope equipped with 100X, 1.4 oil objective, PMT fluorescence detector, transmitted light detector with DIC polarizer, and full wrap incubator box with warm air heating for live samples co ntrolled by LAS_AF Leica confocal software. For pH measurements, cells were imaged in three channels to yield three images, (i) exciting at 488 nm and collecting at 520 nm (ii) exciting at 435 nm and collecting at 520 nm (iii) DIC. Cross talk and bleed -through were measured and found to be negligible for the present experimental setup. No auto -fluorescence was observed on blank cells. A time relapse experiment was carried out to monitor the endocytosis and exocytosis of F-nMOF in H460 cells at a time interv al of 20 s and a total time ranging from 15 to 18 minutes. Z -stack scanning was applied to each frame. Mean intensity of F-nMOF was measured in 488 nm and 435 nm channels and a ratio of 488 nm to 435 nm intensities of F-nMOF was obtained. The pH evolution of F-nMOF experienced was calculated from the pH calibration curve obtained before. Intracellular pH sensing in fixed cells: H460 cells were seeded on a glass -bottom petri dish (No. 1.5, coated with poly -lysine, MatTek Corporation) at cell density of 5\u00d7 105 cells and further cultured for 24 h. The cell culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh HBSS. The cells were incubated with F-nMOF for 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were imaged using Leica SP5 II cope equipped with 100X, 1.4 oil objective, PMT fluorescence detector, and transmitted light detector with DIC polarizer. For pH measurements, cells were imaged in three channels to yield three images, (i) exciting at 488 nm and collecting at 520 nm (ii) e xciting at 435 nm and collecting at 520 nm (iii) DIC. Mean intensity of F-nMOF was measured in 488 nm and 435 nm channels and a ratio of 488 nm to 435 nm intensities of F-nMOF were obtained. pH was calculated from the pH calibration curve obtained before. 202 6.5 References 1.
