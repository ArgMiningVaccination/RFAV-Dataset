Insurance products available on the individual and small group markets frequently fell short of and paled in comparison to insurance offered to employees of large companies. The ACA sought to level the playing field by requiring plans to cover ten categories of Essential Health Benefits (EHBs), equal to those in a typical employer plan.i The EHB catego ries represent a commitment to making healthcare accessible and affordable for all consumers. Any actions that reverse that commitment will harm consumers, as it would mark the return of junk insurance to the market. Consumers could find themselves unable to afford insurance that covers the care they know they need, and underinsured for care they did not realize they would need. Maintaining EHB requirements is a reflection of the principle that, as a nation and for the public good, we are all in it togethe r\u2014ensuring a baseline of medical and financial security for Americans. Dropping EHB standards would increase the likelihood that consumers will be unable to afford coverage for health conditions they know they have If consumers can save money by opting o ut of insurance benefits they do not believe they need, the costs of plans with those benefits will go up for those who need them.ii Men, and some women, will likely opt out of maternity coverage, bumping up the costs of comprehensive policies for women. Ad ditionally, the fact that the most expensive part of maternity care \u2014labor and delivery \u2014comes at the end of pregnancy may encourage adverse selection, with women switching to plans that include maternity care only when they absolutely need the coverage.iii People without chronic health conditions may opt out of plans that have pharmacy coverage, causing costs for the remaining pool to spiral upwards.iv Consumers with chronic conditions who cannot afford plans with robust prescription benefits may have difficul ty affording their medications, resulting in substantially higher cost hospitalization and other medical interventions.v Eliminating mental health and substance abuse disorder services from benefit requirements would drastically narrow risk pooling for the se services, leading to a precipitous drop in access to and use of these services.vi This would have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans struggling with addictions such as opioid overuse. Dropping EHB standards would encourage consumers to pu rchase inadequate coverage It would be a major threat to consumers' health and financial security to lose the ACA's guarantee of categories of coverage, especially since many health conditions arise unexpectedly. If insurers are permitted to sell products that skimp on costly care, presumably in exchange for cheaper premiums, many consumers could find themselves uninsured for conditions they did not anticipate. 51% of pregnancies in North America were unintended in 2012;vii 20.5 million Americans 12 or older had a substance use disorder in 2015. Of them, 2 million had a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers and 591,000 had a substance use disorder involving heroin;viii Roughly 43 million Americans, 17.9% of U.S. adults, has a diagnosable m ental health disorder.ix About 20 percent of adolescents (ages 13 -18) have or have had a serious debilitating mental health disorder.x EHBs were created to protect consumers from \"junk insurance,\" which was frequently sold on the individual market prior t o the ACA Pre-ACA, more than half of consumers enrolled through the individual market had plans considered \"junk insurance,\" and which would not meet coverage requirements under the ACA.xi On the eve of the ACA, millions of consumers enrolled in insuranc e products in the individual market that failed to cover many common health conditions, for example: 62 percent of enrollees did not have coverage for maternity services;xii 34 percent of enrollees did not have coverage for substance abuse services;xiii 18 percent of enrollees did not have coverage for mental health services;xiv Twenty percent of adults with individual market health insurance products lacked coverage for prescription medicines, compared to only 5 percent of those with employer coverage;xv Nearly one -in-seven American children struggled with some level of developmental disability and condition, such as autism spectrum disorder, who could benefit from habilitative services to allow them to perform basic life functions. However \"coverage of hab ilitative services, whether for children or adults, was effectively confined to the Medicaid program.\"xvi Weakening EHB standards would create winners and losers among consumers Making the EHB categories optional for the states would create a patchwork of consumer protections, with consumers in some states having guaranteed access to much -needed care, while consumers in other states would be left to the whims of whatever benefits structure wins in their state's market. Standardizing basic categories of EHBs made comparing health insurance easier for consumers. If these categories become optional or uneven across the states, consumers will undoubtedly have a much tougher shopping experience. They also may be mislead into purchasing coverage that falls short o f their needs. If insurance plans are separately granted the ability to freely sell insurance across state lines, residents of states with more robust EHB requirements will find themselves bound to lower standards set by other states if they purchase what turns out to be an out -of-state policy.xvii, xviii Consumers Union is the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.
