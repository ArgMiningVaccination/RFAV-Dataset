It has begun programmes for start -up funding, incubation and translation of academic discoveries. Early Start -up Funding : C-CAMP has partnered with BIRAC (Biotechnology Ind ustry Research Assistance Council, DBT) to provide very early stage grants for establishment of proof -of-concept studies for budding start - ups. Incubation: With an aim of enabling early start -ups with \"plug and play\" feature, C -CAMP has established a very well-equipped bio - incubator facility, as well as high end technology and expertise. Bio-innovation Accelerator: As another step to promote and foster entrepreneurship, the Bio -innovation accelerator aims to translate early stage scientific discoveries/in ventions from the Biocluster campus through validation/proof - of-concept studies towards industry- ready technologies. 8 1 PhD Program NCBS and inStem are devoted to excellence in research and tea ching and our graduate program attract s students from diverse disciplines from all over the country and abroad. Student life is enriched by a range of seminars, meetings and workshops, providing opportunities to interact with students and faculty from researc h institutions and Universities in the country and abroad. Student participation in intern ational meetings and workshops both within the country and outside is actively encouraged. We also have active collaborative research programs involving student exchanges, with laboratories across the world. In addition, we offer short -term learning/training opportunities to pre - doct oral s tudents from Universities and Colleges within India and other countries. M. Sc. Wildlife Biology & Conservation NCBS offers a Masters Program in Wildlife Biology & Conserv ation in collaboration with the Centre for Wildlife Studies, Bangalore. This 2 -year progra m attracts exceptional students from diverse disciplines with a strong 2 interest in wildlife and conservation issues. The Post -doctoral & Visiting Fellows Program The Bangalore Biocluster has a small but vibrant program for researchers who hav e a PhD degree. The purpose of the research program is to bring exceptional young scientist s to a stimulating intellectual environment where the best facilities are available. We expect tha t this will result in excellent science and the opportunity for mat uring to move on to ind ependent positions in India and abroad. Our Fellows are supported by fellowships from NCBS or national and international funding agencies. In addition, the Visiting Research Fell ows/Research Associates program hosts for shorter terms , post -doctoral fellows wit h primary appointments in other Institutes. Additional details on these and related programs is available at Academic Programs at http://www.ncbs.res.in Academic programs 9 1 In a rapidly changing scientific world the campus Meetings and Workshops Program seeks to develop national and global connectivity at every scientific level, bringing the best laboratory and lecture courses and scientific meetings to the Indian life scienc e community at our venue. In a competitive world excellence can be sustained only by constant connectivity and interaction. Workshops and events are included in areas that reflect the scientific and research interests of the academic community at the Ban galore Biocluster. These range from small intense formats to those with 50 or more student and researcher participants from within the country and varying numbers of overseas participants. While meetings and workshops may include organizers from other inst itutes and agencies, the primary contact is a member of the faculty at NCBS. Colloquium speakers are usually established scientists working in the natural sciences. 2 More about events at the Bangalore Biocluster campus at http://www.ncbs.res.in/e vents.htm Meetings, workshops and courses 10 1 The Science and Society Programme develops or sponsors projects and events that bridge the sciences and the humanities to stimulate cross - disciplinary dialogue. One aim of this venture is to extend the activities sponsor ed by the programme beyond the confines of academia and make it accessible to the larger public. To this end, lectures, exhibitions, and theatre performances are regularly hosted, enhancing the exchange of ideas and knowledge between scho lars involved with t he programme and the community at large. In 2013 -2014, the programm e sponsored a variety of events, including ten public talks, a music performance, a German film festival , two documentary film screenings, two theatre performances an d an art history lecture series. The programme maintains high intern ational visibility by bringing together partic ipants from within and outside India. The German film festival and the art history lecture series were both the first of its kind to be presente d at NCBS. With the support and encouragement of the faculty, staff and s tudents of NCBS, the programme will continue to expand its scope and activities 2 NCBS has an active program of Public Talks and Colloquia, which involves general talks by eminent public figures on science, science policy and society issues. These talks are accessible for a very wide audience, including students in neighboring scientifi c institutions and serve to raise awareness both of international science and other issues of relevance in the Indian scientific context.

Along with some of the finest labs in the country the campus also hosts a remarkable arrangement of recreational facilities for our staff. The campus provides several prospects for one to be come a part of a social, recreational and academic community. Unlimited Wi-Fi access all across campus including special access for visiting non- members. Food and Drink : The campus depends on 3 large cafeterias and the food courts operate on an 18 hour sc hedule, especially to cater to academic schedules. SBI ATM accepts all national and international cards Travel : Transit options also include round the clock shuttle services that connects the campus to IISc, a premier scientific institute facilitating scientific exchanges as well as making commuting easier for staff. The institute also offers flexible ways of transport around a city that can be daunting to new post -docs and students. Creche (Dolna): Situated within the NCBS campus, Dolna provides full day care for the children of staff and students. Activities include nature walks around campus and well -planned activities that promote learning. Children benefit from science -related activities such as bird watching or campus walks with students and faculty of NCBS, and other advantages that typically come with being part of a growing campus. 2 24 hour Library : the Library is at the heart of the campus and home to an impressive number of online journals and books on other disciplines including science. Other Facilities : Movie club, Nature Club, Climbing Club and Piano Room Sport : The campus provides a wide range of opportunities for everyone to enjoy sport and exercise and lead an active and healthy lifestyle. A state of the art Gymnasium also houses table Tennis , Squash and Badminton courts along with Chess, Darts and Carrom enclosures . We also offer occasion group exercise opportunities like Zumba and Yoga. The tennis and volleyball court lies south of the building. A climbing wall adorns the east side of the Southern labs. A Foosball table is available at C -CAMP. The Swimming pool is the pride and joy of this campus, supervised by lifeguards and treated to maintain the very highest standards of cleanliness and safety. The lawns facing the labs support a fl ood lit artificial turf for Cricket and Football pitch, two very popular choice of sports on campus. Healthcare : Medical Service - Given the array of recreation activities on campus, healthcare includes access to a Physiotherapist, 2 General Practitioner a nd a specialist Paediatrician. An onsite Ambulance is available in case of an emergency. The nearest hospital is a 2 km distance - Columbia Asia. A free and confidential counselling service is also available for all campus members provided by an independe nt support group. Campus life 12 Structural Biology Structural Biology is the general term used to understand the function of biological molecules from the arrangement of the atoms that m ake up the molecules in three dimensions. The last year has seen a tremendous increase in infrastructure in the campus structural biology program. We now hope to enhance our capabilities in single particle Electron Microscopy and tomography. The coming together of all the different structural biology techniques under one umbrella provides exciting opportunities for asking scientific questions that cannot be answered by any one technique alone. While we expect exciting science in the next five years fro m the core structure biology groups, we also hope to be a national membrane protein expression facility for eukaryotic membrane proteins as well have the campus biologists begin to use structural biology as a powerful tool in their individual research prog rams - connecting structure to function. Chemical ecology The Chemical Ecology Program focuses on a relatively new field of research in India and will result in the molecular characterization of interactions between various organisms (microbes, plants or animals). Such interactions and their understanding will impact many fields of biology, including agriculture (through their influence on pollination, crop size, and pest borne diseases), medicine (e.g. understanding the chemical basis of traditional me dicine or how insect disease -vectors identify their mammalian hosts) and biotechnology (designing strategies for better crops through facilitating pollination, pest and disease transmission control). The chemical ecology program is interdisciplinary in nature, as it draws from ecology, evolution, chemistry, neuroscience, behavior and natural history. This makes the field contextual and therefore chemical ecology research needs to be conducted in places with rich organismal interactions. Centre for Brain Development and Repair Disorders of the brain represent a growing and major public health threat to India. There is an unmet need for a human based and led approach to investigating the cause(s), consequence and ultimately treatment of these diseases. Critically this requires a cadre of neurologist scientists who can both inform the basic scien ce as well as lead the underpinning clinical research necessary for translation of laboratory discoveries. Presently India does not have such a group of physician -scientists. The Centre for Brain Development and Repair is a collaborative effort between inStem, NCBS and the University of Edinburgh (UoE). CBDR's mission is to develop a collaborative, comprehensive program to understand the cause, consequence and, finally, treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The initial thrust of the Centre is to conduc t studies specifically focusing on Autism Spectrum Disorders/ Intellectual Disabilities (ASD/ID). New cross- campus research directions 13 Looking ahead We strive to excel in a future whose course we do not know and cannot control. To succeed we must to do something that is distinctive, and this will take more than a sum of our parts. We need to eng age with and challenge our immediate and distant environs to help shape our collective future. We want a campus that preserves the spirit of free enquiry but does not become an ivory tower unto itself.. We must strive to translate the generous support that has been invested in us to create knowledge and value. To achieve these goals we need a management culture that is flexible, outward -looking and demanding while being welcoming and self - correcting. The organizations in the cluster have their own indivi dual management structures and must interact with each other in every aspect of their functions, facilitated by good governance and best practices. www.ncbs.res.in www.instem.r es.in www.ccamp.res.in Funding NCBS is a part of TIFR, a major autonomous institute aided by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India. inStem is an autonomous institute aided by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India.
