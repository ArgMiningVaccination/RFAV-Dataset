We fit a Vector-autoregression (VAR) for the overall US population and for groups identified based on gender and race. We find that shocks to unemployment are followed by statistically significant increases in mortality rates and declines in life expectancy. We use our results to assess the long-run effects of the COVID-19 economic recession on mortality and life expectancy. We estimate the size of the COVID-19-related unemployment to be between 2 and 5 times larger than the typical unemployment shock, depending on race/gender, resulting in a 3.0% increase in mortality rate and a 0.5% drop in life expectancy over the next 15 years for the overall American population. We also predict that the shock will disproportionately affect African-Americans and women, over a short horizon, while white men might suffer large consequences over longer horizons. These figures translate in a staggering 0.89 million additional deaths over the next 15 years.

(2020). Initially reported as an outbreak in the province of Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, e.g., Guan et al. (2020). Approximately 74 million cases and 1.6 million deaths have been reported worldwide, with over 17 million people infected and approximately 0.3 million deceased in the USA alone (updated December 16, 2020; see WHO (2020) and CDC (2020)). SARS-CoV-2 is shed by asymptomatic individuals and persists in the environment for days, implying that public health measures to halt virus spreading could be e ective at reducing transmission and mortality, see Li et al. (2020) and Pan et al. (2020). Universal masking, social distancing, contact tracing, and quarantine were later identi ed as e ective tools to contain SARS-CoV-2 spreading, see Leung et al. (2020) and Moghadas et al. (2020). Mathematical modeling predicted a catastrophic exhaustion of health care personnel and resources, partic- ularly ventilators, unless strict containment measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spreading were established, see Anderson et al. (2020) and Davies et al. (2020). Between late March-early April, most U.S. states imposed stay-at-home orders and lockdowns, resulting in widespread shut down of business. Unemployment rate rose from 3.8% in February 2020 to 14.7% in April 2020 with 23.1 million unemployed Americans. Despite a decline to 6.7% in November 2020, the average unemployment rate over the year is comparable with the 10% unemployment rate at the peak of the 2007-2009 Great Recession and it is near the post-World War II histori- cal maximum reached in the early 1980s (10.8%). Importantly, COVID-19 related job losses disproportionately a ect women, particularly of Hispanic heritage; African Americans; foreign born individuals; less educated adults and individuals age 16-24. In fact, the unemployment rate underestimates the extent of the economic contraction as many potential workers have abandoned the workforce (especially women). The impact of the loss of income on psychological and physical health has been well docu- mented in white males, see McKee-Ryan et al. (2005), Brenner (2005), and Wilson and Walker (1993). In epidemiological studies, unemployment at the individual level associates with de- creased health and higher mortality, regardless of aggregate unemployment rate, see Roelfs et al.(2015). A surge in suicide rates has been clearly observed in unemployed individuals, partic- ularly men. Cardiovascular diseases peak in face of nancial stress and preventive ontological care declines, thus contributing to excess mortality. While the trade-o between containing the COVID-19 pandemic and economic activity has been analyzed in the short-term, there is currently no analysis regarding the long-term impact of the COVID-19-related economic recession on public health. What is more, most of 1the papers interested in the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and economic activity argue, correctly, that lockdowns can save lives at the cost of reducing economic activity,1but they do not consider the possibility that severe economic distress might also have important consequences on human well-being (Gordon and Sommers (2016) and Ruhm (2015)). This shortcoming is arguably explained by the fact that current macroeconomic models do not allow for the possibility that economic activity might a ect mortality rates of the agents in the economy. In this paper, we aim at making progress on this gap in the literature by taking a time- series approach. We use annual data on average life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality rates collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, which are paired with the unemployment rates from the St. Louis Fred website. We construct the data set not just for the overall US population, but also for subgroups of the population categorized by race (African-American or White) and gender (women or men). We use a vector autoregression (VAR, Sims (1980)) to model the joint dynamics of the growth rates of life expectancy and mortality rates together with the unemployment rates. We acknowledge that life expectancy and mortality rates are likely to present observation errors as the US population is not continuously and perfectly observed. To address this issue, we allow for observation errors that essentially wash out the non-persistent idiosyncratic components in life expectancy and mortality rates. We rely on a Bayesian method to construct posterior estimates of model unknowns includ- ing the VAR coe\u000ecients and the smoothed growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality rates. Equipped with posterior estimates for the VAR parameters, we use an impulse response analysis based on a Cholesky decomposition method to assess the e ects of an increase in un- employment on the life expectancy and mortality rates. The main message arising from our exercise is that the typical unemployment shock results in a statistically signi cant decline in life expectancy and increase in mortality rates for the overall population. In normal times, the unemployment shock is around 0.84% on an annual basis and it is quite persistent. The e ect of the unemployment shock on the growth rate of life expectancy and the death rate reaches its peak in the third year and remains elevated for a long time. We repeat the exercise with data for di erent population groups identi ed based on race and gender to highlight substantial heterogeneity. We nd that the size of the typical unemployment shock is much larger for African-Americans, with a standard deviation of around 1.31%, than for the White population (standard deviation around 0.76%). Speci cally, African-American men typically experience the largest unemployment shocks, with a standard deviation of around 1.70%, approximately twice as large as the typical shock experienced by White men. We nd that the typical unemployment shock for White women is the smallest, around 0.58%, which 1This literature is constantly growing. A non-exhaustive list includes Eichenbaum et al. (2020a), Coibion et al.(2020), Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), Jones et al. (2020), Hall et al. (2020), among others. 2is about 65% of the unemployment shock experienced by White men. Similarly, the size of a one-standard deviation unemployment shock for African-American women (1.00%) is about 59% of the typical shock experienced by African-American men, but its absolute magnitude is larger than that experienced by White men. In light of this evidence, it is perhaps not surprising that the e ects of the typical unemployment shock on life expectancy and the death rate are more severe for the African-American population. However, we emphasize that this is not entirely the consequence of larger shocks, as the pattern largely persists for the case of life expectancy when controlling for the size of the shock. When controlling for the size of the shock, we nd that women present a relatively larger increase in death rates. This pattern is especially visible for White women, suggesting that even if they generally su er smaller shocks, they are disproportionately more a ected by them. Based on these results, we examine the long-run e ect of the COVID-19 unemployment shock on life expectancy and the age adjusted death rates across di erence races and gender. Our data for life-expectancy and death rates stop in 2017. However, we have unemployment data until October 2020. We thus use observations for the unemployment rate to construct an estimate of the COVID-19 unemployment shock, while treating the corresponding ones for the life expectancy and mortality rates as missing observations. As before, we adopt an identi cation strategy based on a Cholesky decomposition. By comparing the magnitude of the COVID-19 unemployment shock to those in the normal (non-critical) times, we can infer about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic indirectly. Based on our approach, the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 3.17 standard devia- tions larger than the typical shock to the unemployment rate for the overall population (about 2.68% in magnitude). We estimate that this unprecedented unemployment shock will result in a 3.01% increase in mortality rates and a 0.50% drop in life expectancy over the next 15 years. Compared to the typical unemployment shock, we nd that women (both African-American and White) are disproportionately a ected relative to men. Particularly for White women, the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 4.72 standard deviation larger (about 2.74% in magnitude) than their typical shock to the unemployment rate, by far the largest in relative magnitude with respect to the typical shock. However, African-American men still su er the largest shock in absolute terms (3.65%, 2.13 standard deviations). As a result, the impact of the COVID-19 unemployment shock on the death rate is large for all groups, but visibly larger for African-Americans and White women. As explained above, this is in part the result of a larger shock, but also of a larger response conditional on the size of the shock. The long-term e ects of the COVID-19 related unemployment surge on the US mortality rate have not been characterized in the literature. Thus, as a last step, we compute an estimate of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock. This corresponds to the di erence between the number of deaths predicted by the model with and without the 3unemployment shock observed in 2020. For the overall population, the increase in the death rate following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers correspond to 0.24% and 0.37% of the projected US population at the 15- and 20-year horizons, respectively. For African- Americans, we estimate 180 thousand and 270 thousand excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers correspond to 0.34% and 0.49% of the projected African- American population at the 15- and 20-year horizons, respectively. For Whites, we estimate 0.82 and 1.21 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers correspond to 0.30% and 0.44% of the projected White population at the 15- and 20-year horizons, respectively. These numbers are roughly equally split between men and women. Overall, our results indicate that, based on the historical evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic might have long-lasting consequences on human health through its impact on economic activity. We interpret these results as a strong indication that policymakers should take into considera- tion the severe, long-run implications of such a large economic recession on people's lives when deliberating on COVID-19 recovery and containment measures. Without any doubt, lockdowns save lives, but they also contribute to the decline in real activity that can have severe conse- quences on health. Policy-makers should therefore consider combining lockdowns with policy interventions meant to reduce economic distress, guarantee access to health care, and facilitate e ective economic reopening under health care policies to limit SARS-CoV-19 spread. The idea that economic activity might a ect human well-being has been studied before. Contrary to what might be expected, there is no widespread agreement on the e ect of eco- nomic activity on mortality rates. Ruhm (2000, 2003, 2005, 2012) and Mulas-Granados (2005) argue for a procyclical relation between macroeconomic activity and mortality, with death rates increasing during periods of high employment. However, in a more recent contribution, Ruhm (2015) nds that since 1990 the relationship has become weak or non-existent. This seems to be due to a change in the composition of the causes of deaths. Speci cally, fatalities due to cardiovascular disease and, to a smaller degree, transport accidents are procyclical, whereas cancer and some external sources of death (particularly accidental poisonings) have emerged as strongly countercyclical. Gordon and Sommers (2016) use county-level data to study the e ects of unemployment, poverty rates, and median incomes on mortality rates over the period 1993-2012. They nd that higher unemployment has modest negative impacts on mortality, in contrast with previous studies and in line with our ndings. Furthermore, they emphasize that county-level poverty rates and lower median incomes are better predictors of mortality rates. In our study, we use unemployment because it is available over a prolonged period of time. With respect to these studies, our methodological approach is quite di erent, given that we take a time series approach, as opposed to panel regressions. This allows for a dynamic relation between the variables of interest and for a discussion of the e ects of the national 4business cycle that in these studies is absorbed by the time xed e ect (see Ruhm (2015) for an excellent discussion). We see these two approaches as complementary. Our benchmark results are based on an identifying assumption that relies on unemployment not having any contemporaneous e ect on mortality rates and life-expectancy. Our results on the long-term e ects of unemployment on mortality and life-expectancy are qualitatively un- changed when using a di erent identi cation strategy in which shocks to unemployment are allowed to have a contemporaneous e ect on the other two variables. When using this alter- native identi cation assumption, an interesting result emerges. An increase in unemployment leads to a contemporaneous decline in mortality rates and to a contemporaneous increase in life-expectancy. This e ect eventually reverts in two-three years and in the long-run mortality increases and life expectancy declines. The long-term e ect dominates and our key results on the long-term cumulative e ects of unemployment remain unchanged. At the same time, these results could help reconcile the mixed evidence in the existing literature discussed above. On impact, unemployment can lead to a reduction in mortality as deaths due to work-related causes or motor vehicle accidents declined, but over time economic distress takes a toll on human well-being. We consider this an interesting direction for future research. Our results add to the body of literature that analyzes the macroeconomic consequences of COVID-19. This literature is growing exponentially and we apologize to our colleagues for being unable to cite all relevant contributions here. A few papers that rely on historical pan- demic episodes to provide plausible estimates for outcomes due to COVID-19 include Barro et al.(2020), Ludvigson et al. (2020), and Jorda et al. (2020). Other papers study the interac- tion between economic decisions (e.g., optimal policy) and epidemics, Eichenbaum et al. (2020a), Eichenbaum et al. (2020b), Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020), Krueger et al. (2020), Glover et al. (2020), and Rampini (2020). Among the existing papers, our work is more closely related to those that examine the medium- to long-term e ects of pandemics such as Jorda et al. (2020), who argue that signi cant macroeconomic after-e ects of pandemics can persist for a long time, and Kozlowski et al. (2020), who claim that a persis- tent change in beliefs about the probability of an extreme, negative shock to the economy could be an important long-term consequence of COVID-19. Overall, the economic literature has extensively analyzed the short-run trade-o between economic activity and the containment of the pandemic. We emphasize that an equally important long-run trade-o exists. It is worth clarifying that with this claim, we do not want to suggest that policymakers should refrain from ordering lockdowns, as necessary lifesaving measures, but rather that, if they decide to do so, they should provide alongside enhanced health and economic support for the most vulnerable portions of the population. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2presents the data and the method- ological approach. Section 3presents the historical relation between shocks to unemployment 5and life expectancy and mortality rates. Section 4studies the implications of the historical results for the COVID-19 unemployment shock. Section 5concludes. 2 Empirical Approach In this section, we rst describe the data set used in our analysis and then introduce the statistical model employed to study the dynamic relation between real activity, mortality rates, and life expectancy. The statistical model is a VAR in which we allow for the possibility that mortality rates and life expectancy are observed with an error. 2.1 Data We collect data on average life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. CDC data are available to the public only until 2017. All data are available at annual frequency. The CDC website also provides age-adjusted life expectancy and mortality rates based on gender and limited race breakdown (African-American versus White). Race (African-American, White, Asian, etc) and Hispanic origin (yes/no) are classi ed independently by the CDC. Thus, Hispanic can be of any race and within each race group there can be descendants of Hispanic origin. No extended data series are available for Hispanic/Latinos heritage, Asians, American Indian/Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiian/Other Paci c Islanders or mixed races. CDC data for the African-American population span a shorter period of time (1972-2017). The series for White population are also shorter (1954-2017) than the series for the overall population (1950-2017). This is important when comparing results across races and with respect to the overall population, because the sample used for the estimation is not homogeneous. We obtain the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rates for the overall population and for each race and gender groups from FRED, the website of the St. Louis Fed. We pair the CDC series with the corresponding unemployment series to obtain seven groups: Overall population, African-American population, African-American men, African-American women, White population, White men, White women. Gordon and Sommers (2016), using county level data and panel regressions, nd that median income and poverty rates are better predictors of mortality rates than unemployment rates. In our study, we use unemployment rates because these series are available over a prolonged period of time. Furthermore, the panel regression approach used in previous studies assumes that the e ects of the national business cycle is absorbed by the time xed e ect (Ruhm (2015)). Thus, our approach is inherently di erent and complementary to the previous studies interested in the relation between real activity and human health. 6Figure 1: Raw data 1960 1980 2000 202065707580 1960 1980 2000 2020500100015002000 1960 1980 2000 202005101520 African-American African-American (M) African-American (W) White White (M) White (W) Overall population Notes: This gure presents the average life expectancy ( rst chart), the age-adjusted death rate (second chart), and the unemployment rate (third chart) for the overall US population and for the US population classi ed according to race and gender. The data span from 1950 to 2017 for the overall population; 1954 to 2017 for White population; and 1972-2017 for African-American population. Figure 1 provides a rst look at the raw data series for the overall population and for the six groups identi ed based on race and gender. We highlight a series of features in the data that are noteworthy. First, for all groups considered, the average life expectancy has been increasing over time. Second, and consistently with the increase in life-expectancy, the age-adjusted death rates have been falling over time. Third, the African-American population (both men and women) has historically experienced shorter average life expectancy, higher age-adjusted death rates, and higher unemployment rates relative to the White population. Fourth, men have shorter life expectancy and higher death rates, regardless of rave. Finally, these di erences have been declining over time and the conditions for African-American men have improved the most as they currently experience much longer life expectancy and lower (age adjusted) death rates relative to the 1970s. However, the di erences remain large and visible. To further elaborate on these points, we compute percentage changes of life expectancy and death rates by taking their log di erences and multiplying them by 100. Table 1provides the summary statistics (i.e., sample average, autocorrelation at rst lag, and standard deviation) of these two transformed variables and the unemployment rate. The summary statistics are computed for the overall population and for the six groups identi ed based on race and gender. In the left part of the table, we report the summary statistics for each group based on the longest sample available for that group. In the right part of the table we report the same statistics over the common subsample (1972-2017) for which we have data for all groups. This approach facilitates the comparison across groups. In line with what we outlined above, all groups have experienced an improvement in life- expectancy and a decline in death rates. However, the table reveals substantial heterogene- ity across gender and race. Speci cally, we nd that proportionally the African-American 7population has experienced a more signi cant improvement in these measures of human well- being. Given that the White population was starting with lower mortality rates and higher life-expectancy, this di erence in growth rates translates into a gap that has been narrowing over time. At the same time, the variables corresponding to the African-American population are much more volatile than those of the White or overall populations. Furthermore, the un- employment rates for the African-American population are also larger and more volatile when compared to those of the White population. This feature of the data already suggests that the impact of the business cycle on human well-being could be more relevant for the African- American population. The data also reveal high frequency movements in the growth rates of life-expectancy and mortality rates. These can be due to measurement error, as the US population is not con- tinuously observable, or other factors unrelated to the business cycle. The negative sample autocorrelation of the growth rates speaks to this evidence. Thus, in our empirical analysis we allow for the possibility that life-expectancy and death-rates are measured with error. We discuss the details in the next subsection. 2.2 A VAR with observation error We specify a VAR to describe the joint dynamics of the growth rates of life expectancy, mortality rates, and the level of unemployment rate for each group ithat we are interested in (overall population and the six groups organized based on race and gender): xi;t=\u0016i+ \bixi;t\u00001+\u0011i;t; \u0011i;t\u0018N(0;\u0006i): (1) wherexi;tis a three-dimensional vector containing three series for group i: the growth rate of life-expectancy, the growth rate of the age-adjusted death rate, and the unemployment rate; \u0016i is a vector of constants, the matrix \b icontains the autoregressive coe\u000ecients, lis the number of lags, and \u0011i;tis a vector of Gaussian innovations. The VAR above is speci ed with one lag. This is the number of lags that we use in our empirical analysis and it is chosen based on the Akaike Information criterion. However, the methodology that we describe below easily allows for more lags. In estimating (1), we want to allow for the possibility that life expectancy and death rates are observed with an error or have high frequency swings around a central trend. Thus, we cannot directly run the VAR. To tackle this issue, we specify a state-space model in which the measurement equation allows for measurement errors in the levels of the observables: yi;t=zi;t+\u000fi;t; \u000fi;t\u0018N(0; i); (2) whereyi;tincludes the log of life expectancy, the log of death rates, and the unemployment rate for group i. Here,zi;tcontains the true log-level series for life expectancy and age-adjusted 8Table 1: VAR data summary statistics Av ailable sample Common sample Mean Autocorr Stdev Mean Autocorr Stdev (A) Percentage 0.39 White 0.18 -0.05 0.26 0.20 0.06 0.26 White (M) 0.20 0.07 0.28 0.25 0.28 0.24 White (W) 0.15 -0.08 0.25 0.15 0.16 0.24 (B) Percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate Ov Notes: We provide the sample moments (mean, autocorrelation at rst lag, and standard deviation) of the three series used in the estimation: the growth rate of the average life expectancy (panel A), the growth rate of the age-adjusted death rate (panel B), and the unemployment rate (panel C) for the overall US population and for distinct groups identi ed based on race and gender. The available data span from 1950 to 2017 for the overall population; from 1954 to 2017 for white workers; and from 1972 to 2017 for African-American workers. The common sample is from 1972 to 2017. death rates, free from measurement errors. We model the measurement errors as i.i.d. random variables with a diagonal covariance matrix i. We do not allow for measurement errors in the unemployment rate, \u000fi;3;t= 0, as the measurement issue for the unemployment rate is much 9less of a concern at annual frequency. As the measurement equation is expressed in log-levels, we express xi;tas linear transfor- mation of the log-level series for consistency: xi;t=zi;t\u0000Mzi;t\u00001; M =2 41 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 03 5: (3) Combining (1) with (3), the state transition equation (1) can be re-expressed in terms of the true log-level series zi;t=\u0016i+ (M + \bi)zi;t\u00001\u0000\bMzi;t\u00002+\u0011i;t; \u0011i;t\u0018N(0;\u0006i): (4) In sum, the measurement equation (2) and the state transition equation (4) constitute our state-space representation of the system. Thus, our state-space model enables the estimation of the VAR parameters, \b iand \u0006i, which are crucial for the analysis presented below, while at the same time allowing for measurement errors. The fact that observation errors apply to the log-levels of the age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy as opposed to their growth rates implies that the ltered series for life-expectancy and death rates cannot persistently deviate from the observed ones. Data exploration. We estimate a total of seven VARs: Overall population (our benchmark case), African-American, African-American men, African-American women, White, White men, and White women. All data are available at annual frequency. Lag order selection. We set the lag order of the VAR in the state transition equation to one. The choice of a one lag in (1) is guided by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) when we directly estimate (1) with bandpass ltered series as a rst test. Furthermore, it seems appropriate given the small sample that we have available and the use of data at annual frequency. Cholesky decomposition. To quantify the e ects of an increase in unemployment on life expectancy and mortality rates, we need to isolate structural shocks to unemployment, i.e., shocks that are exogenous with respect to the mortality rate and life expectancy. To do this, we orthogonalized the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals using a Cholesky decomposition with unemployment placed last. This assumption implies that the unemployment shock can a ect the other two series only with a lag of one year. We believe this is a conservative assumption as the role of unemployment rate shock is depressed in this ordering. For robustness, we also consider a speci cation in which the ordering is reverted and unemployment is allowed to a ect the other two variables contemporaneously. 10Figure 2: VAR data 1960 1980 2000-0.500.51 1960 1980 2000-4-202 1960 1980 200024681012 Smoothed series Original series Notes: This gure presents the growth rate of the average life expectancy ( rst chart), the growth rate of the age-adjusted death rate (second chart), and the unemployment rate (third chart) for the overall US population. The original series are presented in gray circled lines. For the rst two series, we compare with the smoothed estimates from our model (green lines). The data span from 1950 to 2017. 3 Results From the estimation of our state-space model, we obtain posterior estimates of model unknowns including the VAR parameters in (1) and the smoothed estimates of life expectancy and death (mortality) rates free from measurement errors. We rst discuss the properties of the smoothed growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality rates, and subsequently, examine how an increase in unemployment a ects the growth rates of the life expectancy and mortality rates conditional on the posterior estimates of the VAR coe\u000ecients. 3.1 Model-implied growth rates of life expectancy and mortality Figure 2 presents the growth rates of the life expectancy and death rates of the overall pop- ulation implied by the smoothed estimates and compares them with the corresponding data series. The smoothed and raw series for the sub-groups are reported in Figure 3. We nd that the smoothed and raw growth rates move very closely. However, a non-negligible portion of the uctuations in the raw growth rates is attributable to measurement errors, most notably so for the growth rate of death rates. One way to clearly see this pattern is by analyzing the behavior of the autocorrelation and standard deviations of the raw series and of the smoothed series as reported in the right part of Table 2. For ease of comparison, the left part of Table 1 is reproduced in Table 2. We nd that compared to the data moments, the model-implied au- tocorrelation value is higher and the standard deviation is smaller, as the noise in the original series is removed.

The Appendix shows that the log level of the two (actual and smoothed) series move very closely, implying that the smoothing algorithm does not alter the core dynamics of the original variables. In sum, our state-space model is able to smooth out uctuations in the raw growth rates while preserving the core dynamics of the underlying variables. As a result, at lower frequencies (i.e., cycles longer than one year), the smoothed growth rates comove with the raw growth rates. These are arguably the frequencies that we are interested in when studying the relation between unemployment and human health and they are less likely to be contaminated by signi cant observation errors. 3.2 Relationship across unemployment, mortality, and life expectancy To understand the e ects of an increase in unemployment on the mortality rate and life ex- pectancy, we use an impulse response analysis based on a Cholesky decomposition. We order unemployment last, implying that all contemporaneous co-movements between the variables of interest are attributed to structural shocks to the other two variables. In other words, under this identi cation assumption, shocks to unemployment can a ect mortality rates and life- expectancy only with a lag. Below, we also discuss results for the case in which unemployment is ordered rst. Figure 4 reports the responses of life expectancy and the age-adjusted death rate to a one- standard deviation shock to the unemployment rate for the overall population. The gure reports the median response and 68% and 90% credible sets. The shock to unemployment is quite persistent and is followed by statistically signi cant changes in the growth rates of life expectancy and the death rate. These e ects are also quite long lasting. Focusing on the 14Figure 5: Impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation shock to unemployment (1) African-American population: Overall 2 4 6 8 10-0.1-0.050 2 4 6 8 1000.20.4 2 4 6 8 1000.511.5 (2) African-American population: Men 2 4 6 8 10-0.15-0.1-0.050 2 4 6 8 1000.20.40.6 2 4 6 8 10012 (3) African-American population: Women 2 4 6 8 10-0.08-0.06-0.04-0.0200.02 2 4 6 8 1000.20.4 2 4 6 8 1000.51 (4) White population: Overall 2 4 6 8 10-0.04-0.020 2 4 6 8 1000.10.20.3 2 4 6 8 10-0.200.20.40.60.8 (5) White population: Men 2 4 6 8 10-0.06-0.04-0.020 2 4 6 8 1000.10.2 2 4 6 8 1000.51 (6) White population: Women 2 4 6 8 10-0.04-0.0200.02 2 4 6 8 1000.10.20.3 2 4 6 8 1000.20.40.6 Notes: We provide impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation shock to unemployment for the US population classi ed according to race and gender.

The median values for these peaks are around -0.04% and 0.15%, respectively. The impulse responses based on race and gender are presented in Figure 5. To facilitate the comparison across groups, the median impulse responses for each group are reported in Figure 6. The rst row of Figure 6contains the median impulse responses to a one-standard deviation unemployment shock (as in Figure 4and Figure 5). Given that the size of the typical shock varies across groups, the second row of Figure 6reports the impulse responses to a normalized (1%) unemployment shock to keep the size of the shock identical across groups. Several important observations can be made. The responses of the growth rates of the age-adjusted death rates are statistically signi cant for all groups. For the growth rate of life expectancy, 90% credible sets exclude zero for four out of six groups, while 68% credible sets exclude zero for all groups. Thus, we nd strong statistical evidence of a dynamic relation 16between unemployment shocks and human well-being for all groups. African-Americans expe- rience larger unemployment shocks and the e ects of these shocks on unemployment are more persistent. Conditional on the same race, the shocks for women are smaller. The e ects on life expectancy and death rates are more severe for African-Americans, overall. This cannot be entirely explained as a consequence of larger shocks, as in the case of life expectancy, the pattern largely persists when controlling for the size of the shock. However, it could be the result of the larger persistence of unemployment following the shocks. Conditional on the size of the shock, we nd that women (both African-American and White) present a relatively larger increase in death rates and this is particularly visible for White women. Finally, White men seem to have the larger response of age-adjusted death rates in the long run (10-year horizon). In comparing these impulse responses, it is important to keep in mind that the sample is not homogeneous across groups. The sample of the African-American population is signi cantly shorter (1972-2017) than that of the White population (1954-2017). However, most of the results described below are robust to using the common sample 1972-2017 (see Figure A-4 in the appendix). The only pattern that changes when using the common sample is the persistent response of white men death rates at long horizons. When using the shorter sample, this result does not appear. Thus, we infer that it is mostly driven by the dynamics of the three variables at the beginning of the sample. The Appendix also reports results for an identi cation strategy based on ordering unem- ployment rst in the Cholesky decomposition. In this case, unemployment shocks are allowed to have contemporaneous e ects on the other variables in the system. As explained in the intro- duction, there are several reasons explaining why unemployment could have contemporaneous e ects on mortality rates (not commuting to work, no risk of work related deaths, etc.). The nding that an unemployment shock is eventually followed by an increase in mortality and a decline in life-expectancy is robust to using this di erent identi cation strategy. However, when using this alternative identi cation assumption, an interesting result emerges with respect to the short-run dynamics. An increase in unemployment leads to a contemporaneous decline in mortality rates and to a contemporaneous increase in life-expectancy. This e ect quickly re- verts in two-three years and in the long-run mortality increases and life expectancy declines, in line with our benchmark results. In other words, the long-term e ect dominates the short-term dynamics. Thus, the results about the impact of the COVID-19 unemployment shock that we will describe below are not qualitatively a ected by the speci c identi cation strategy. At the same time, this di erent identi cation strategy could be helpful in understanding why previous studies have often found con icting results on the e ects of unemployment on human health. On impact, unemployment can lead to a decline in morality as deaths due to motor vehicle or work-related accidents diminish, but over time economic distress might take a toll on human well-being. 17Table 3: Fraction of forecast error variance explained by unemployment shock (%) (1) Percentage change in life expectancy 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall Percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall table provides the fraction of forecast error variance of the percentage change in life expectancy and the age-adjusted mortality rate explained by unemployment shock at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. We present the median values and provide the values that correspond to the 90% bands in brackets. 3.3 Historical importance of unemployment shocks The previous subsection highlights that unemployment shocks are followed by statistically sig- ni cant changes in the growth rates of the age adjusted death rate and life expectancy. In this subsection, we are interested in assessing the relative importance of unemployment shocks for these two variables. To assess the historical importance of unemployment shocks, we compute a variance decom- position by comparing the unconditional variance, as implied by the VAR model, when only the orthogonalized unemployment shock is active, to the overall variance. Speci cally, we com- 18Table 4: COVID-19 unemployment shocks Standard deviation Magnitude (%) [0:75;3:73] Notes: The table provides the COVID-19 unemployment shock implied by our state-space model for overall US population and for US population classi ed according to race and gender. To facilitate the interpretation, we provide the scale of standard deviation as well as the actual magnitude (%) of the shock. pute the fraction of forecast error variance of the percentage change in life expectancy and the age-adjusted mortality rate explained by the unemployment shock at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year horizons. Table 3 summarizes our ndings. The rst row in each panel of Table 3 reports the results for the overall population. At 15 years, the fractions of forecast error variance explained by unemployment shocks are 7.46% and 11.58% for life expectancy and death rate, respectively. Thus, the contribution of unemployment shocks to these measures of human health is by no means negligible. In line with our previous ndings, Table 3 reveals substantial heterogeneity across gender and race. We nd that unemployment shocks account for larger fractions of the variations in life expectancy and death rates in the case of men relative to women. For example, the fraction of variance for the growth rate of life expectancy is twice as large (17 :90% vs 8:42%) for African-American men with respect to African-American women and almost three times as large (13:98% vs 5:41%) for White men with respect to White women (15-year horizon). A similar pattern emerges for the contribution to the age-adjusted death rate: The fraction of variance is twice as large (17 :78% vs 8:99%) for African-American men with respect to African-American women and almost three times as large (27:96% vs 8 :44%) for White men with respect to White women (15-year horizon). When comparing the White population to the African-American population, we nd that unemployment shocks are more impactful for African-Americans. However, the gap across races is smaller than the gap across gender, when controlling for race. 194 Long-run impact of the COVID-19 unemployment shock The COVID-19 pandemic is having immediate, substantial consequences on the death rate in the United States. At the same time, it has led to a severe macroeconomic contraction. Part of this contraction can be explained in light of the shock itself, as several people autonomously decided to scale down their consumption, especially for services such as restaurant and enter- tainment. On top of this, lockdowns have also contributed to further reduce economic activity. These measures have arguably saved lives, reducing the contagion rate and mitigating the risk of exhaustion of health care personnel and resources. However, the severe economic contraction due to the pandemic itself and the measures used to contain it might have long-term conse- quences on life-expectancy and death rates. In this section, we are interested in using our VAR to assess the potential impact of the economic contraction in light of the historical relation between unemployment and human health. 4.1 E ects on life expectancy and age-adjusted death rate What is the cumulative e ect of the COVID-19 unemployment shock on life expectancy and the age-adjusted death rate at a 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year horizon? To answer this question, we rely on our state-space model to produce a measure of the unemployment shock experienced by the US economy. Despite the estimation sample ending in 2017, unemployment data for 2018, 2019, and (partially for) 2020 are available for the overall population and for each group. At the time of this draft, the historical unemployment rates are available up to October 2020. We use the ten-month average of the available monthly unemployment rates as a proxy for the 2020 annual unemployment rate. Conditional on the posterior coe\u000ecient estimates and the 2018-2020 values of the unemployment rates, we can lter out the reduced-form shocks \u0011i;tin (1) based on the state-space model. We can do so by treating the 2018-2020 values of the life expectancy and death rate as missing observations. We then apply a transformation based on the Cholesky decomposition to the inferred reduced-form shocks to back out the structural unemployment shocks. The implied COVID-19 unemployment shock distributions are provided in Table 4. This empirical approach aims at distinguishing and isolating the consequences for human health of the economic distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Obviously, the original shock that led to the increase in unemployment is a health shock, but our goal here is to only consider the consequences for human health of the COVID-19-related increase in unemployment. In this context, unemployment acts as a readily available proxy for the overall economic distress. Based on our approach, the COVID-19 unemployment shock is about 3.17 standard devi- ations larger (about 2.68% in magnitude) than the typical shock to the unemployment rate. 20Table 5: Cumulative changes of life expectancy and age-adjusted death rates over di erent horizons following the COVID-19 unemployment shock (1) Percentage change in life expectancy 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall Percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall The table shows the predicted cumulative percentage change in life expectancy and age adjusted mortality rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. We present the median values and provide the values that correspond to the 90% bands in brackets. Results are presented for the overall US population and subdivided based on race and gender. We applied the same method to obtain a measure of the unemployment shock for the groups sorted by gender and race. The scale of these shocks in terms of standard deviations (or per- centage points) are: 2.37 (or African-American 3.00 (or 3.02%) for African-American women, 3.53 (or 2.68%) for the White population, 3.03 (or 2.69%) for White men, and 4.72 (or 2.74%) for White women. Thus, consistently with previous studies, we nd that women (both African-American and White) are disproportionately a ected relative to men. 21Table 6: Life expectancy and deaths in 2017 Life Deaths Implied expectancy Age-adj. rates Crude rates Crude numbers population (per million) (per million) (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) Ov The table summarizes the life expectancy and deaths for the overall US population and for di erent groups based on race (African-American vs White) and gender (men vs women) in 2017. Table 5 reports the cumulative e ect of the COVID-19 unemployment shock on the life expectancy and death rates as predicted by our model at di erent horizons. The rst row in each panel of Table 5reports the results for the overall population. At the 15-year horizon, the death rate is 3.01% higher and life expectancy is 0.50% lower. These numbers represent the marginal e ect of the shock: they indicate the expected change in life expectancy and death rates following the COVID-19 unemployment shock keeping xed other factors that a ect these measures of well-being, like the progress in health care. Table 5also reveals substantial heterogeneity across genders and races. The impact on the death rate is large for all groups, but visibly larger for African-Americans. As explained above, this is in part the result of a larger shock, but also of a larger response conditional on the size of the shock. At a 15-year horizon, we expect a decline in life expectancy of 0.85% for African- American citizens, 1.15% for African-American men, 0.76% for African-American women, 0.58% for White citizens, 0.74% for White men, and 0.41% for White women. At a 15-year horizon, the increases in death rates are 3.86% for African-American s, 3.40% for African-American men, 3.70% for African-American women, 3.48% for Whites, 4.14% for White men, and 3.37% for White women. As explained before, the higher increase in the age-adjusted death rate observed in White men is somehow sensitive to the sample used in the VAR. To translate these percentage changes in absolute changes of age-adjusted lost lives and years of life expectancy, we multiply the predicted percentage change in life expectancy and age adjusted mortality rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years provided in Table 5with the most recent life 22Table 7: Absolute changes of life expectancy and age-adjusted deaths over di erent horizons following the COVID-19 unemployment shock (1) Absolute change in life expectancy 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall Absolute change in the age-adjusted deaths 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years The table shows the predicted cumulative absolute change in life expectancy and age adjusted deaths at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. We multiply the predicted percentage change in life expectancy and age adjusted mortality rate at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years provided in Table 5with the most recent life expectancy and age-adjusted deaths data provided in Table 6. expectancy and age-adjusted death rate data provided in Table 6. Table 7shows the predicted cumulative absolute changes in life expectancy and age-adjusted death rate. Based on these data, a 0.50% decline in life expectancy translates into a decline of 0.39 life years while a 3.01% rise in death rate translates in 22.00 age-adjusted excess deaths every 100,000 citizens at a 15-year horizon for the overall population. The implied declines in years of life expectancy are 0.64 for African-Americans, 0.83 for African-American men, 0.60 for African-American women, 0.46 for Whites, 0.57 for White men, and 0.33 for White women. The implied increases in 23Table 8: Excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock (per million) 5 years 10 years 15 years 20 years Overall The table provides an estimate of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock based on the CENSUS projections of the US population adjusted to account for the additional deaths resulting from the unemployment shock. age-adjusted deaths every 100,000 citizens are 32.97 for African-Americans, 35.64 for African- American men, 26.10 for women, 25.53 for White, 35.71 for White men, 21.03 for White women. Overall, these results suggest that the COVID-19 economic distress will be followed by signi cant changes in mortality rates and life expectancy. Our evidence shows that excess deaths will disproportionately a ect African Americans, consistent with previously published work on the impact of race on recovery post disasters and all-cause mortality, see Fothergill et al. (1999), FitzGerald and Hurst (2017), and Schroeder (2020). These gures might be a conservative projection once we recognize that the pandemic has led many workers, especially women, to exit the labor force, with the result that the measured unemployment might underestimate the real dimension of the shock to the labor market. 4.2 Excess deaths The long-term e ects of the COVID-19 related unemployment surge on the US mortality rate have not been characterized in the literature. Thus, as a last step, we compute an estimate of the excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 unemployment shock. This corresponds to the di erence between the number of deaths predicted by the model with and without the unemployment shock observed in 2020. Here, we brie y explain how we compute the excess deaths and refer the reader to Ap- pendix Cfor details. In essence, our state-space model provides an estimate for the change in 24the age-adjusted death rate following the COVID-19 unemployment shock. Using the latest death rate as an initial value, we can construct projections for the age adjusted death rates with,Ru t;and without, Rt, unemployment shock observed in 2020. We can do this for any horizont >2020: Here, we omit the group identi er ifor ease of exposition. Note that we use a superscript uto indicate that the variable is impacted by the COVID-19 unemployment shock. We then need to convert Ru tandRtinto a prediction for the crude death rates with and without the unemployment shock, Ru c;tandRc;t, respectively. For this step, we model the historical relations between the crude and age adjusted death rates and use this historical rela- tion to convert projections of the age-adjusted death rate into projections for the crude death rate. Speci cally, we run an OLS regressions of the crude death rate on an intercept and the age-adjusted death rates. Through linear transformation via the OLS coe\u000ecients, we obtain Ru c;tandRc;t, respectively. Finally, we require long-run projection of the US population. We treat the Census Bureau projection as the projection consistent with the model absent the unemployment shock. We then reconstruct the alternative projection based on the change in the death rate as predicted by the model. In sum, we compute the excess deaths EDu tas: EDu t=Ru c;tPu t\u0000Rc;tPt; (5) whereRu c;tis crude death rate with the unemployment shock, Rc;tis the predicted crude death rate without the unemployment shock, Pu tis the population projection with the un- employment shock, Ptis the population projection without the unemployment shock (available from the Census Bureau). Table 8 provides the respective numbers for the overall population and the di erent groups identi ed based on race and gender. For the overall population, the increase in the death rate following the COVID-19 pandemic implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. For African-Americans, we estimate 180 thousand and 270 thousand excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. For White, we estimate 0.82 and 1.21 million excess deaths over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively. These numbers are roughly equally split between men and women. These numbers indicate that the consequences of the pandemic might go well beyond the deaths directly caused by the disease. While the extent of the long-term excess mortality related to coronavirus crisis is staggering, several considerations are in order. First, the additional number of lives that would have been lost secondary to COVID-19 acute illness and health care resources exhaustion if lockdowns had not been implemented is estimated to be over 100,000 in the US alone, Fothergill et al. (1999), Stone (2020), and Emanuel et al. (2020). Second, our analysis makes a number of implicit assumptions based on historical data regarding the time and severity of the recession. It is important to keep in mind the signi cant amount of uncertainty around this variable. 25It is possible that the economy will recover faster than in the past. Furthermore, a shift in economic and social politics can drastically a ect the duration and severity of the recession, and consequently modify our excess mortality estimates, Bianchi and Melosi (2017). Third, based on emerging data, it is likely that the limited access to health care during the lockdown, temporary discontinuation of preventive care interventions, massive loss of employer-provided health insurance coverage, and the lingering concern of the population about seeking medical care out to fear of contracting COVID-19 will impact mortality rate and life expectancy even more severely, Gar eld et al. (2020) and Sharpless (2020). Fourth, this is the rst recession with the A ordable Care Act (ACA) in place, a critical resource to mitigate the e ects of unemployment on citizens well-being, see Gruber and Sommers (2020). Our results have three important policy implications. First, it would be desirable to study and implement health policy measures to guarantee activities remain open with minimal risks to workers and public, whenever possible. For instance, implementation of universal masking and social distancing policies at a large health care system in the Northeastern US resulted in a decline of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across health care workers, despite the high-risk setting (seeWang et al. (2020)). Second, it is of utmost importance to facilitate routine preventive care and health care access for the whole US population, including the over 20 million Americans who lost employer-provided health care coverage, Gar eld et al. (2020) and Gruber and Sommers (2020). Third, policy interventions meant to reduce the economic impact of the recession are likely to also contribute to save lives. 5 Conclusion We examine the historical relation between life-expectancy, death-rates, and unemployment for the overall US population and groups organized based on race and gender. We use a VAR that allows for observation errors and we nd that increases in unemployment are followed by statistically signi cant increases in death rates and declines in life-expectancy. A sizable fraction of the variation of these two variables can be accounted by unemployment shocks. We then use this historical relation to form predictions about the potential impact of the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on human health. Our results suggest that the toll of lives claimed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus far exceeds those immediately related to the acute COVID-19 critical illness and that the recession caused by the pandemic can jeopardize population health for the next two decades. Based on our ndings, African American citizens and women will be su ering more profoundly from the coronavirus-driven recession, adding on to their disproportionate adverse outcome in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Garg et al. (2020). Based on our ndings, large, sustained and swift government maneuvers to support the currently unemployed labor force and to abate unemployment will be as equally 26important as the massive e orts focused on limiting and eventually eradicating transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with e ective vaccination strategies that are nally into place.

A-7D.1 Forecasts based on the COVID-19 reduced-form shocks Table A-1: Ratio of the structural and reduced-form COVID-19 unemployment shock [0:53;0:99] Notes: We apply a Cholesky decomposition to obtain the structural COVID-19 shocks. We set the structural COVID-19 shocks to zero except for the one corresponding to unemployment rate and multiply the lower triangular matrix from the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. The table provides the ratio of this transformed unemployment rate shock over the reduced-form COVID-19 unemployment shock.

We consider an alternative identi cation strategy based on ordering unemployment rst in the Cholesky decomposition. In this case, unemployment shocks are allowed to have contemporaneous e ects on the other variables in the system. To facilitate the interpretation, we provide the scale of standard deviation as well as the actual magnitude (%) of the shock.
