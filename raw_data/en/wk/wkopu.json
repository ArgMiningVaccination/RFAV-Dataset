The purpose of the clinical a ssessment is to determine diagnoses and evaluate potential fit for active basic research and treatment studies. Time: Variable. Research Projects: The Grady Trauma Project (GTP) is a large -scale study of the impacts of stress - and trauma -related risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related behavioral and physical health comorbidities in a high risk, highly trauma -exposed urban population of Black adults in Atlanta, GA. This interdisciplinary team of investigators is led by Co -Direc tors Abigail Lott, PhD, ABPP (Director of Treatment Research and Education), Vasiliki Michopoulos, PhD (Director of Translational Neuroscience), and Jennifer Stevens, PhD (Director of Human Neuroscience). The GTP leverages translational techniques, such as neuroimaging, physiology and psychophysiology, to study the underlying biology of adverse health outcomes related to trauma exposure and PTSD. Over the last 15 years, the GTP has conducted trauma interviews on over 12,000 participants recruited from medic al clinic waiting rooms at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, GA. Data from GTP indicate high rates of trauma exposure, with >90% reporting at least one trauma, and 46% meeting lifetime diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Current GTP studies are trying to 1) un derstand the mechanisms by which women are more at risk than men for PTSD and other stress - and trauma -related adverse health outcomes and co -morbidities (e.g. reproductive dysfunction, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, immune dysfunction, infectious d isease, cancer and aging), 2) identify new neurobiological treatment targets following acute trauma exposure, and 3) develop and implement culturally informed evidence -based, accessible interventions 24 for PTSD other stress - and trauma -related adverse health outcomes with the long term goal of reducing health inequities and improving health outcomes in Black communities.

The residents can work closely with Dr. Duncan to develop an individualized plan for research in accord with their interests and skills. They will interact with postdoctoral fellows, junior fa culty, and experienced research staff in the lab as well as working closely with Dr. Duncan. Below are brief descriptions of the areas of ongoing research that are available for resident participation. 1. Toxoplasma gondii and schizophrenia In a large VA funded project we are studying the immune perturbations that may underlie the well -replicated finding of increased odds of schizophrenia in people who are chronically infected with the ubiquitous parasite, Toxoplasma gondii . T. gondii is neuroinvasive, and the majority of people infected are expected to harbor T. gondii cysts in their brains for life. T. gondii is kept in check by an ongoing immune response in which the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN) plays a critical role. IFN prevents T. gondii replication by depletion of the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) that T. gondii must derive from the host. IFN achieves local Trp depletion by shunting Trp degradation along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway through an enzyme -controlled series of steps into KYN and kynurenic acid (KYNA). KYNA in turn is an antagonist at two neurotransmitter receptors that are believed to play a key role in SCZ: the N -methyl -D-aspartate acetylcholine (a7nACh) recep tor. Thus there is a plausible mechanism by which TOXO could cause neurochemical abnormalities leading to SCZ, but the preferential activation of the KYN pathway has not yet been demonstrated in SCZ patients with known T. gondii infection. Furthermore, a growing literature indicates that there are elevated levels of KYNA in the brains of SCZ patients, although the T. gondii status of these patients has not been investigated. TOXO evolved to induce subtle behavioral dysfunction causing infected rodents to h ave reduced fear of cats and psychomotor slowing. In SCZ patients who are T. gondii positive our pilot data indicate slowing of neural processing as indexed by prolongation of latency of the acoustic startle response, and impairment on cognitive testing. This project will investigate the hypothesis that chronic T. gondii infection in SCZ leads to immune mediated activation of the KYN pathway, and that this pathway activation is associated with slowing of neural processing and cognitive deficits seen in T. gondii positive SCZ. We will assess SCZ patients and healthy contro ls in our VA cohort for T. gondii immunoglobulin G antibody (IgG) antibody titers and plasma levels of KYN metabolites and IFN. We will examine the relationship of these neuroimmune biomarkers and acoustic startle responses, P50 gating, and cognitive func tion test scores by comparing four groups of 38 subjects per group): 1) T. gondii -positive SCZ, 2) T. gondii -negative - positive controls, 4) T. gondii -negative controls. 2. Aerobic exercise for cognition in schizophrenia There is a la rge literature indicating that cognition in SCZ has the potential to be enhanced by behavioral interventions. Aerobic exercise (AE) is known to confer many physical health 43 benefits. AE is associated with cognitive gains in healthy aging subjects, and thes e gains correlate with hippocampal volume increases, that in turn correlate with increased BDNF and cardiovascular fitness. AE in rats increases BDNF mRNA, and this occurs prominently in the hippocampus. Taken together, these preclinical and clinical studi es are consistent with the hypothesis that AE, via increases in fitness, induce BDNF increases that lead to brain changes, particularly (but not necessarily limited to) the hippocampus that subserve cognitive gains with AE. There are parallels between the reduced hippocampal volume in SCZ and the hippocampal volume loss seen with normal aging. It is possible that a similar mechanism may underlie potential cognitive gains with AE in SCZ. AE is a potentially important means to improve cognition in SCZ, but w ork on cognitive effects of AE in SCZ is surprisingly sparse. Our VA -funded study will be a randomized rater blind parallel group clinical trial to compare twelve weeks of AE training with a control condition (CONT) consisting of stretching exercises in 40 participants aged 18 -70 with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder. 3. Metabolic effects of antipsychotics A final area of investigation is the metabolic risk associated with atypical antipsychotics. Retrospective studies in this area utilize the computer ized clinical database of the VA system in the Southeast (VISN 7). Techniques have been developed to perform retrospective computerized studies using this very rich and detailed database resource. A wide range of additional clinical questions can be addre ssed using this VA database. Maximum: 1 resident Time commitment: For PGY -2, up to 8 half days/week.

Location: Henderson Mill VA Clinic or other locations as determined by the program Support: VA Stipends 49 Elective: Treatment Resistant Depression Years O ffered: PGY -2 PhD Contact: privapo@emory.edu Summary: Treatment resistant depression, or being resistant to at least two adequate antidepressant trials, occurs in about 30% of patients with depression and is a significant portion of many outpa tient clinical practices and an important target for NIMH research. The Treatment Resistant Depression Clinic evaluates approximately 6 new patients a week and provides follow up care in the Neuromodulation Clinic with advanced somatic treatments includin g ECT, ketamine infusion therapy and TMS. The evaluations are comprehensive and involve assessments by an attending psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker and targeted laboratory and neuropsychological testing as well as neuroimaging. Residents will be involved in the initial evaluation of patients including presenting the patients at the treatment case conferences. Residents will also learn how to assess patient suitability for advanced psychotherapy and somatic treatments. The residents will have an opportunity to follow patients treated at Emory. They will also actively participate in the Neuromodulation Clinic and get close supervision in the correct administration of advanced neuromodulation techniques. Depending on their time commitment t o the program, residents will also have the opportunity to learn about research projects in the Department (e.g., immunotherapy and deep brain stimulation) and will also have opportunities to participate in ongoing research projects and collaborate with th e faculty in academic papers. Maximum: 2 residents Time Commitment: For the PGY -2 elective: 8 half days a week. PGY4's should commit to at least four, and preferably 6, half days a week. PGY4's will be expected to commit at least 6 months to the e lective and encouraged to work in the TRD Clinic for the entire year. The time commitment of at least six months is important in order to provide the resident with a longitudinal experience in the care of a subgroup of the patients. Consideration to comb ining the TRD elective with either of the Emory based chief residencies (Emory inpatient and the OPTP) could facilitate the resident being an active part of the TRD Clinic. The minimum of four half days would also allow the resident to participate in two half days of evaluation clinic and the staffing conference, a half day of ECT and a half day of the ketamine clinic alternating with the TMS clinic. Two additional half days, or a total of six half days, would allow them to obtain more training in neuromo dulation treatments and provide time for them to formulate and develop a research project. Objectives: PGY 2's 1. The resident will be able to understand the definition of TRD in clinical practice. 2. The resident will be able to understand the appropriate work up of TRD patients including diagnostic issues and appropriate somatic treatment options including advanced psychotherapy and medication treatments 50 PGY 4's 1. The resident will be able to understand the components of a TRD evaluation includin g the appropriate options for patients who have failed multiple previous treatments. 2. The resident will participate in ECT, TMS and ketamine infusion treatments and understand the administration protocols, risks and benefits of each procedure.
