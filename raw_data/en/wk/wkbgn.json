By removing and eliminating toxins, then feeding your body with healthy nutrients, detoxifying can help protect you from disease and renew your ability to maintain optimum health through a range of methods including yoga, meditation and more. Read on to learn how to detox your body with 10 body detox tips and understand what come out of your body when you detox. Basically, detoxification means cleansing the blood. This is done by removing impurities from the blood in the liver, where toxins are processed for elimination. The body also eliminates toxins through the kidneys, intestines, lungs, lymphatic system, and skin during a body detox. However, when these systems are compromised, impurities aren't properly filtered and the body is adversely affected. A body detox program can help the body's natural cleansing process by: \"Detoxification works because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the smallest units of human life,\" says Peter Bennett, N.D., co-author of 7-Day Detox Miracle with Stephen Barrie, N.D., and Sara Faye. Bennett suggests that everyone should detox at least once a year. However, Bennett cautions against detoxing for nursing mothers, children, and patients with chronic degenerative diseases, cancer or tuberculosis. Consult your healthcare practitioner if you have questions about whether detoxing is right for you. Today, with more toxins in the environment than ever, \"it's critical to detox,\" says Linda Page, N.D., Ph.D., the author of Detoxification: Programs to Cleanse, Purify and Renew. Page recommends detoxing for symptoms such as: When starting a body detox, you'll first need to lighten up your toxin load. Eliminate alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, refined sugars, and saturated fats, all of which act as toxins in the body and are obstacles to your healing process. Also, minimize use of chemical-based household cleaners and personal health care products (cleansers, shampoos, deodorants, and toothpastes), and substitute natural alternatives. Another hindrance to good health is stress, which triggers your body to release stress hormones into your system. While these hormones can provide the \"adrenaline rush\" to win a race or meet a deadline, in large amounts they create toxins and slow down detoxification enzymes in the liver.

Many programs follow a seven-day schedule because, as Bennett explains, \"it takes the body time to clean the blood.\" His program involves fasting on liquids for two days, followed by a carefully planned five-day detox diet to allow the digestive system to rest. Page recommends a three-to seven-day juice fast (drinking only fresh fruit and vegetable juices and water) as an effective way to release toxins.
