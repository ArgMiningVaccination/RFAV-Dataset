Ecclesiastes 10:16 As it developed in its English-speaking version over the course of the last three decades, global history has mostly been the story of a world peopled by large- scale and relatively resilient entities (such as cultures, civilizations, religions).One specic entity, namely 'imperial polities', has been granted a prominentplace in the grand narrative of how the world became more and more denselyinterconnected. 1Whether one was tracking down diasporic trading networks operating across oceans, religious institutions deploying themselves on apluri-continental stage, or vagrant individuals defying borders and ascribedidentities, empires always loomed large in the picture, as if they were the sturdy contextual bedrock of all individual and institutional histories. Though not easily stored in the same category, huge polities like MingChina and Philip II's kingdom were actually recognized by professional trav-ellers \u2014 whether they be pilgrims, scholars, merchants or ambassadors \u2014 asboth constraining structures and elds of opportunity. 2The aura of might and prestige that imperial elites crafted and projected was often willinglyendorsed by those that had to deal with the legal and moral norms dictatedby these empires. 3 But the fact that empires really mattered does not mean that one has to surrender submissively to their mythologies and propaganda.

What a microhistorical approach may add to our understanding of imperial polities is not simply a better knowledge of how they operated lo-cally, as if the issue at stake was to provide an already existing, yet disembod-ied grand narrative with lively, picturesque details. Practised as a form ofethnography, microhistory has less to do with the question of scale than withthat of how multiple forms of life ( Lebensformen ) come to interact and inter- weave. 5Seen from a microhistorical perspective, rooted in the extensive use of a given set of archival material and implemented through the careful scru-tiny of the shifting yet specic ways in which each and every actor saw theworlds he inhabited and envisioned the possibilities of transforming them,imperial polities no longer look like the Leviathans their dignitaries pre-tended them to be, nor do their overseas outposts continue to resemble radiating centres of a self-condent metropolitan high culture. In microhistorical terms, case studies actually do not provide examples of already spelled-out general laws, nor do they pile up or conflate in order to ll an overall, abstract explanatory pattern with facts and stories. As Jean-ClaudePasseron and Jacques Revel aptly put it, the 'case' under scrutiny is never onlythe symptom of a regularity from which it departs only to a limited andmeasurable extent: its heuristic value rather lies in the way 'it stops theplanned course of a descriptive, argumentative or prescriptive discourse . . . the case is something else, and something more than an ''example''; at the beginning, it does not exemplify anything, neither an already known typenor a previous certainty'. 6This article argues that empires are precisely such a type of planned, self-contained explanatory discourse, and that only by way ofan ethnographical-style case study may one halt this discourse in order toreach out to and reveal what it suppresses \u2014 namely the straddling and clashing of conflicting moral, political and cultural worlds embodied by polyvalent actors and played out on ever-shifting local, spatial-cum-social 4Frederick Cooper and Jane Burbank, Empires in World History: Power and the Politics of Difference (Princeton, 2011). 5Edoardo Grendi, In Passeron Jacques Revel (eds.), Penser par cas (Paris, 2005), 18.84 PAST AND PRESENT SUPPLEMENT 14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/242/Supplement_14/83/5637704 by guest on 05 December 2019 stages.7In order both to escape the grips of the Eurocentric grand narrative of the irresistible westernization of the world and to uncover the plurality of thelived experiences of empires, it draws on the close study of an apparently insignicant affair that took place by the late 1570s in the so-called Spanish Philippines. 8Knowing in minute detail what went on in the shacks and along the back-alleys of an out-of-the-way frontier-settlement of the Hispanic monarchy almost half a millennium ago assuredly will not change the canon- ical causalities and chronologies of universal history. But it may well, to use Paul Veyne's alternative denition of generalization, 'lengthen the historian's questionnaire'9in most unexpected and productive ways. I On 29 May 1577, in one of the large audience rooms of the governor's man-sion, located just below the old Saint John blockhouse, in Manila's southern sea-watching district, Diego Herna \u00b4ndez de A \u00b4vila was compelled to testify, or rather, as the Inquisition procedural code put it, to 'confess'. What he was accused of by the man facing him \u2014 Governor Francisco de Sande \u2014 was no small offence, since he had come under strong suspicion of spreading 'mal- evolent rumours' ( murmuraciones ) by implication, weakening the Crown's authority in this faraway and hard-won outpost of King Philip the Second's pluri-continental empire. 10In the fol- lowing weeks, three more people were indicted by Francisco de Sande: the cooper Juan Gutie \u00b4rrez Corte \u00b4s, on the grounds of 'spreading two Cebu-born native women, Ine for engaging in 'sorcery' ( hechicer \u00b4a).11To understand better what this case was all about, one has to go back in time, and to switch the background from the bustling city of Manila to the remote town of Sant \u00b4simo Nombre de Jesu \u00b4s, located on Cebu's east coast. In this out-of-the-way settlement lived no more than eighty Spaniards, including some thirty encomenderos who, as a 7The theoretical and methodological requirements of this approach are detailed in the introduction and opening chapter of Romain Bertrand, L'Histoire 2011). 8The in-depth study of this affair is to be found in Romain Bertrand, Le Long remords de la conque te: 1978). 10After the 'Union of the Crowns' of Spain and Portugal in 1578, Philip the Second reigned over a vast network of forts, trading outposts, walled settlements and agricultural do- mains spread in the Americas and along the coasts of Asia and Africa. 11Archivo General de la Nacio \u00b4n, Mexico City (hereafter AGN), Inq. 131, 194r, Confession of Herna \u00b4ndez de A \u00b4vila, Manila, 29 May 1577.WHERE THE DEVIL STANDS 85Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/242/Supplement_14/83/5637704 by guest on 05 December 2019 reward for their military deeds at the time of the 'pacication' of the island, had been granted the right to levy tribute and to exact corve \u00b4elabour from the surrounding Indian villages.12 Andre \u00b4s de Villalobos was one of the most powerful of these encomenderos . Having served, in 1565-9, in the infantry company of the eld commanderMart \u00b4n de Goyti, who earned fame by leading the assaults on the city of Maynilad in 1571, Villalobos was granted the right to levy tribute fromsome four thousand Indians living on the adjacent islands of Negros and Capul. 13An absentee landlord, he inhabited a large palm-roofed house, built on stilts, on the outskirts of Sant \u00b4simo Nombre de Jesu \u00b4s, owned two slave women, and kept several servants ( criados ). By early April 1577, it was precisely toward Villalobos's mansion that the prior of the local Augustinianconvent, Friar Alonso Gutie \u00b4rrez, was heading hastily, accompanied by his pupil Diego de A \u00b4vila. Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez had been called up by one of the neigh- bours of Villalobos because the latter and his wife had 'gone crazy by way of anevil spell' ( locos enhechizados ). As on the spot, Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez ordered both the slaves and the servants to dig under the house in order to make sure that 'an evil thing was not hidden there that may have been thesource of the infection'. Diego took part in the search, but was suddenly'struck by craziness', and fainted. Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez brought him back immediately to the convent, shaved his head, and massaged it with 'Castilian vinegar'. Assoon as he recovered, Diego 'expelled through one of his nostrils a small tinduck no larger than a chick-pea'. Now fully convinced that the forces of evilhad been unleashed in Villalobos's mansion, Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez hurried back to the place, and once there, roughly questioned one of the house slaves, a woman in her thirties bearing the Christian name of Ine \u00b4s. The latter soon confessed that she was the one who did cast the spell, and that for that purpose she had used a'livid ointment' that she had kept in district]'. 14She also 12Archivo General de Indias (hereafter AGI), Pat. 23, R 9, Tratado de las Yslas Philipinas by Miguel de Loarca, Manila, June 1582, in Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson (eds.), The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 (Cleveland, 1903-7), v, 27, section 1; AGI, Fil. 339, L.2, fos. 50v-51r, Granting of the title of city to the village of Sant \u00b4simo 731r-732r, List of men of war on the payroll of Mart \u00b4nd e Goyti's company, Rio de Panay, 29 July 1569; AGI, Pat. 24, R 19, fos. 5r,6r,3 5r, Listing of theencomiendas de yndios in Cebu, Panay, etc. granted by M.

By the mid 1570s, their number had increased to several hundreds and they had become the main suppliers of meat and rice for the86 PAST AND PRESENT SUPPLEMENT 14Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/242/Supplement_14/83/5637704 by guest on 05 December 2019 admitted to being in possession of the antidote, to know 'an oil kept in a phial and some seeds kept in a purse, the latter looking like those of the benzoin [tree] ( camangian )'. Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez commanded her to cure Villalobos and his wife. Under the careful watch of Benito de la Cerda, an encomendero acting as Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez's assistant, Ine \u00b4s obeyed docilely: she smoothed the oil on the victims' wrists and burned the benzoin seeds the way one would do withincense sticks. Villalobos and his wife came back to their senses. 15 The case could have been closed at this point, all the more so since what Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez had been dealing with so far was not brujer \u00b4a, witchcraft in the sense of a contract struck with the Devil, but mere hechicer \u00b4a, sorcery in the sense of the healer's art of making poisons and remedies.16Cases of this kind were not unheard of in Cebu. For instance, in January 1567, Miguel Lo \u00b4pez de Legazpi \u2014 the commander-in-chief ( adelantado ) of the Spanish armada that took possession of the island \u2014 had an Indian woman tortured and quartered to death because she had fallen under suspicion of having sold poisoned foodand palm wine to the undernourished soldiers. As a warning to her fellowcountrymen, her dislocated limbs were scattered along the path leading from the camp to the closest village. 17Since she was a slave and Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez was the highest religious judicial authority around, Ine \u00b4s could have been castigated in the same way without anybody starting an inquiry. But the prior decided to push the case further and to hear testimonies. On 16 April 1577, he ques- tioned Diego de A \u00b4vila about 'what he had seen while he was in a state of craziness'. Diego answered that he had seen 'many devils, and among them[the two Indian slaves of Villalobos], and he also said that he had seen the ointment being prepared by making use of many kinds of snakes [and] that Spanish population. By late 1581, a new district, called the Par \u00b4an, was built for them on the orders of Governor G. Ronquillo de Pen alosa, see Manel 10-11, 5https://www.raco.cat/index.php/ IllesImperis/article/view/262123 4(accessed 25 June 2019). Less well known is the fact that there was also a Chinese district \u2014 barrio de los Chinos \u2014 adjacent to Sant \u00b4simo Nombre de Jesu \u00b4s, inhabited by some two hundred people by the early 1590s, see Pedro Chirino, Relacio \u00b4n de las Islas Filipinas de lo ellas han de brujas y su mundo (Madrid, 1997) (1961), 112. 17AGI, Pat. 23, R 22, Relacio \u00b4n muy circunstanciada de lo ocurrido en el Real de la Isla de del Archipie \u00b4lago (Madrid, 1995), doc. 30, p. 259.

Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez therefore decided to lock up the two Indian women, Ine \u00b4s and Beatriz. But since, as he lamented, he lacked both a jail and a jailer, he had no choice but to remit both theaccused and the affair to a higher authority, namely to Governor Francisco deSande. A month later, by the end of May, the governor launched his owninvestigation. In the meantime, something unexpected had occurred: whereas he was deemed a victim of Ine \u00b4s's charms by Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez, Diego de A \u00b4vila was now considered a suspect by Francisco de Sande. By the end of the trial, in June1577, Diego was even sentenced to an incredibly harsh punishment. First, hewas to be paraded around the streets and public squares of Manila 'for hisshame, with the pointed hat [of those condemned by the Inquisition, thecarocha ] and covered with feathers'. Secondly, he had to serve ten years on the king's galleys. Due to storms, privateers and diseases, a strongly built adult man could not expect to survive more than four years on the galleys, whether the latter cruised the Caribbean Sea or the Mediterranean Sea. 19In Diego's case, the governor's verdict amounted to an immediate death sentence, be-cause Diego was still a muchacho . At the time the trial took place, he was no more than 11 years old. This made the governor's decision peculiarly unusual,for according to the Inquisition code, those who had not yet turned 14 wereregarded, judicially speaking, as minors, since 'their reason ( juicio ) was not yet fully formed'. Not only were they not allowed to testify against someone accused of a 'crime against the Faith', but they could also not testify against themselves \u2014 which basically meant that they could not be sentenced, sincethe inquisitorial judicial machinery was based on the extraction of confes-sion. 20Why, then, did Governor Francisco de Sande, the most powerful magistrate of the Spanish Philippines, who also happened to be an expert 18AGN, Inq. 131, exp. 10, fo. 182r, Inquisitor A.

The governor's relentlessness almost certainly had to do with the evolving narrative of Diego's 'craziness'. Indeed, between the time he left Cebu and themoment he reached Manila, the boy's version of what happened to him hadchanged dramatically. As he condently told a mistrustful Sande, he had notfainted, but 'died', then travelled to Heaven, to the Earthly Paradise, to theLimbo and to Hell, only to 'resurrect' and nd himself lying in bed in aconvent's cell. While he was away on his supernatural journey, he saw all the witches walking in the air, higher than the roofs of houses, [in] company of the devils who were in great numbers and whoescorted them while making them dance in the air . . . and [he saw]the witches worshipping the Devil and having carnal intercourse with the devils and mating many black devils, [for] the latter had bodies similar to those of black men, with two horns like those of ahe-goat, and they had a tail without bristles, made of shells [and atthe end of their tails they had] a bell that kept ringing, like those ofthe mules of Mexico's surroundings, and the devils had bulging eyesand toe and hand nails one palm long. 22 The best was yet to come. The story went that the devils started conversing with Diego, trying to lure him away from the love of the Lord. Soon they toldhim that 'they were expecting sooner rather than later the arrival of a gov-ernor of this land, and that they had prepared a room and a seat for himbecause he showed no respect whatsoever to the friars nor to anybody else,and they named women with whom he acted in an improper way, and theykept saying many other things [about this governor], saying that they hadsentenced him [to Hell] because of all he had done'. 23However, it was not just the prophetical narrative of his impending damnation that so infuriated the governor, but the fact that, authenticated by the friars who found Diego's ninos y menores : see J. C. Baroja, El Sen or Inquisidor y otras vidas por ocio (Madrid, 1968), 41. 21Sande also knew perfectly well the Inquisition's procedures, since he had acted fromOctober 1572 to August 1574 as a consultor \u2014 an expert in jurisprudence matters \u2014 for the Holy Ofce Tribunal in Mexico: see Edmundo Herna \u00b4ndez, Manila, 29 May 1577. 23Ibid.WHERE THE DEVIL STANDS 89Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/242/Supplement_14/83/5637704 by guest on 05 December 2019 depiction of supernatural places 'most faithful to the Holy Scriptures', it had already become public knowledge in Manila. Among those who were sum- moned to testify under the suspicion of having heard complacently, if notspread, the 'lies' of Diego, were prominent members of Manila's economic and political close-knit elite, like the members of the municipal council (regidores ) Juan de Argumedo and Francisco Ban ol, fear of becoming the laughing stock of local gossips is worth a sociological rather than a psycho- logical explanation. In late sixteenth-century Spain and the Americas, 'honour' ( honra ) was of paramount importance to the exercise of power. Someone whose reputation could be stained over and again by means ofhearsay or spiteful lampoons was quickly deemed impotent. The question was not whether what your enemies told about you was trustworthy, but what would people think of you if you left the offence unavenged. 24 For Francisco de Sande, the issue of his reputation was all the more sen- sitive because since his arrival in the Philippines, in 1575, he had engaged in aharsh conflict with the veterans of the conquest. Styling himself as a letrado \u2014 an intransigent law graduate in the service of the Crown \u2014 he had tried to curb the power of the conquistadors by any means at his disposal. He hadgone as far as depriving some, such as the factor Andre \u00b4s de Mirandaola, the treasurer Salvador de Aldave and the public accountant Andre \u00b4sC a\u00b4uchela, of their encomiendas , while imposing heavy nes on others (like Captain Juan Maldonado del Castillo) on charges of the mismanagement of public funds. 25 By vociferously insulting those who dared to challenge his orders, Sande also earned himself a terrible reputation. Once, as he was addressing the senior soldiers of Manila, he 'called some Jews, and others drunkards, shake-rags,and rascals'. 26On another occasion, he tore apart one of the royal banners brought from Mexico in 1565 in order to craft himself a ship's flag, purport- edly in order to 'disparage and humiliate' those who had fought side by side 24On the role of rumours and lampoons in the political fabric of the Spanish monarchy, see Antonio Castillo Go \u00b4mez, ' ''Amanecieron en todas las partes publicas'': Un viaje al pa \u00b4sd e las denuncias', in Antonio Castillo Go \u00b4mez (ed.), Escribir y leer en el siglo de Cervantes (Barcelona, 1999), 143-91; and XVIII', and Riccardo Veronese (eds.), \u00b4n 25AGI, Pat. 24, R 35, fo. 17r, Decrees taken by F. de Sande regarding Royal Ofcers, Manila, 16 May 1576; AGI, Pat. 24, R 40, fo. 6r, F. de Sande to the king, Manila, 8 June 1577. 26AGI, Fil. 34, N 22, fo. 1v, Juan Maldonado, Juan de Moro \u00b4nes, Pedro de Chaves Francisco Chaco \u00b4n to the Viceroy M.

Most of the latter \u2014 who wereforbidden to leave the Philippines even after they were released from military service \u2014 had a hard time making ends meet. Living miserable lives in shaky rattan huts, they deeply resented any display of wealth and proprietary rightsby Manila's worthies and had a flickering sense of loyalty to the Crown, hencewere prone to deride power-holders. 28Diego's narrative flew uncontrollably from one place to another \u2014 from the cells of the Augustinian convent of Cebu to the entry porch of Manila's municipal council. To his embarrass-ment, the governor learnt that the rumour had even penetrated his ownmansion, since his page boys testied that when he visited the governor in company of Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez, Diego went down to the kitchen and told all those present the whole story of his supernatural journey. 29 However, the veterans of the conquest were not the sole social enemies that the governor was bent on chastising for the part they had played in the spreadof Diego's tale. In Sande's mind the clerics, who at the time were all members of the Order of Saint Augustine, 30were the real plotters. If Diego's depiction of Hell and Heaven was so conspicuously unremarkable, with horned andclawed devils looking like 'black men', 31damned souls tormented by way of 'incandescent iron sticks', 'the tree of Life and the forbidden tree', this was precisely because he had been steeped in orthodox Christian imagery whileliving inside a convent. 32Born in Mexico the youngest son of 'one of the most 27AGI, Fil. 34, N 27, fo. 2v, Guido de Lavezaris to the king, Manila, 27 July 1578. 28On 'poor soldiers' who sustained themselves only thanks to monthly public food grants, see AGI, Contad. 1200, fos. racio \u00b4n, 1576.

His mother, Isabel de Arias, remarried a man ofPortuguese origin named Juan Rodr \u00b4guez de Aguirre and decided to send her three sons to the Philippines so that her brother, Fr Alonso Jime \u00b4nez, could take charge of their education. 34One of Diego's elder brothers died upon reaching Manila, in 1575, while the other, Juan, became a novice, and later on a soldier.35The boys were therefore raised behind the convent's white walls by their maternal uncle, Fr Jime \u00b4nez, who died in the early months of 1577, just before the whole witches' story began.36Now, as he makes crystal clear in a letter he sent with the whole case le to the Inquisition Tribunal in Mexico City, Governor Francisco de Sande had a very low opinion of Fr Jime \u00b4nez: [Fr Alonso Jime \u00b4nez] got impassioned when he preached and kept talking too much with the people, and was not happy with the way his fellow brothers lived, and he thought he was doing far better than them with regards to [the vow of] poverty, and once he told me convent clerics and devout churchgoers. Diego's narrative of his supernatural travels therefore built upon a long tradition of Bible-inspired imaginary revolts. See, for in- stance, Miguel y ideolo \u00b4gica en (Madrid, 1981); and Richard Kagan, Lucrecia's Dream: Politics and Prophecy in Sixteenth-Century Spain (Berkeley, 1990). 33AGN, Inq. 131, exp. 10, fo. 174r, Life narrative of D. de A \u00b4vila as told to Inquisitor A.

He had rolling eyeslike a madman. 37 Since Fr Jime \u00b4nez experienced angelic visions and inflicted on himself 'harsh penances', he was considered by some of his fellow brothers as a saintlycharacter. But according to Sande, who was infuriated by the boastfulness of his ascetic claims, he was nothing more than 'a Jew and a sorcerer'. 38Peering through the general registry of Philippine Augustinian convents, one quicklygets the feeling that Fr Jime \u00b4nez's blunt criticism of his fellow brothers' covet- ing of mundane riches was no exaggeration, for all through the 1570s, priors had to repeatedly admonish, and sometimes to punish the harsh way those who, in violation of their vows, either engaged in dubious commercial ven-tures or dealt with gold and jewels inside convents' walls. 39However, the condemnation of the breach of conventual rules was of no interest to Sande. In a more down-to-earth assessment of the public behaviour of Fr Jime \u00b4nez, the governor deemed him a troublemaker because he 'always came into openconflict with the soldiers regarding the recovery of the tribute [levied on theIndians]'. 40This last reproach actually targeted not only Fr Jime \u00b4nez, but all the Augustinians, since the latter kept articulating a erce critique of the way the natives were mistreated by the soldiers, and of the inability or unwilling-ness of the governor to put an end to the abuses.

Despite the smooth unanimousstance of ofcial chronicles, which ascribed an undisputed spiritual goal tothe whole conquest enterprise, 46irreconcilable world views were at play among the Spaniards of the Philippines \u2014 world views that the Diego de A\u00b4vila case helps illuminate. II Diego's narrative spread the way it did because the Spanish settlements of the Philippines were small-size enclaves where everyone knew everyone else. In aletter sent to the king a year after he rst set foot in Manila, the governor estimated that there were no more than ve hundred Spaniards in the whole archipelago. 47In spite of the capital letter that ofcial chroniclers attached to the word Conquista , the military deployment of the Spaniards in the Philippines was a modest enterprise. For the 'pacication' of Cebu and Panay, in 1565-70, Miguel Lo \u00b4pez de Legazpi could rely upon no more than 360 soldiers, the great majority of whom had no previous experience of thebattleeld. 48In order to create a nucleus of permanent settlement, the Viceroy of New-Spain, Mart \u00b4n Enr \u00b4quez de Almansa, had promised to send two hundred reinforcement troops every year to Manila, but as he himself acknowledged, it was impossible to recruit so many men, 'even by usingforce'. 49The heart of the Spanish Philippines, the fortied inner city of Augustinians had already made public their determination not to confess unrepentant encomenderos , triggering a flow of indignant reactions from Manila's worthies: AGI, Fil. 29, N 17, fo. 2r, Royal Ofcers to the king, Manila, 17 July 1574.

Like every village, Manila was also an uneven social space fraught with moral fault lines. The study of the Diego de A \u00b4vila case precisely helps us map out conflicting moral worlds \u2014 inconsonant value systems attached to dis-tinct group identities. The interesting point, when it comes to trying to ar-ticulate a microhistorical inquiry with a global history perspective, is that these moral worlds cannot easily be conned to a specic physical area. If Manila was the stage upon which a number of actors performed antagonisticyet well-scripted social roles, those roles \u2014 in the sense of embodied sets ofnorms and expectations 52\u2014 had a history of their own, and that history involves many more places far beyond Manila. For instance, Governor Francisco de Sande thought highly of himself not only as a letrado in the service of the Crown, but also as a hidalgo , a member of the lesser Spanish nobility. This was a social identity that he had learnt throughout his life to endorse and perform, rst as the eldest son of a respectable and well-to-dofamily from Ca \u00b4ceres, 53in Extremadura, then as a law student enrolled in the 50AGI, Fil. 27, N 17, Cabildo secular to the king, Manila, 25 June 1587; AGI, Pat. 25, R 38, Description of the encomiendas of Luzon, Manila, May 1591.

These gentlemen always escorted the governor on foot, because having no horses he always went on foot, and their subsist- ence was provided for by Your Majesty's Treasure. As for me, Ifound it more appropriate, in accordance with the people's wishes, to entrust the safety of my person to each and everybody, and to make sure that only the men chosen by the sergeant-major from among his companies be posted on watch duty in my home, this in order to put an end to all this bustle and to its costs for Your Majesty's Treasure, as well as to put a stop both to the envy that some felt for the others and to that [feeling of] equality born fromthe fact of having common people sit at the governor's table ( esta ynvidia y la mesa hombres comunes ). And when I leave my house on horse, nobody escorts me except my own servants, so as to put a stop to all this parade thing, for this is what was the most necessary [to restate], namely that he who wants to win the loyalty of the sentry has to refrain from making use of a wealth and a reputation that are not his own, and to set a goodexample by his conduct ( qualquiera exemplo ). 55 to do with the fact that the father of the governor, Pedro de Sande, was considered a 'stranger' ( forastero ) since he was born in Galicia.

He actually was the very rst to have mounts \u2014 three stallions and two mares \u2014 shipped from Acapulco to the Philippines. 56Yet the governor's sense of fully belonging to the hidalgu \u00b4awas not just an ascribed identity that he could use as a situational resource: it was also aclaim put to the test during status ordeals. Such an ordeal took place at the start of his overseas career, soon after his arrival in 1567 in Mexico, where he was to serve as public prosecutor ( scal ). The reason he secured such a pres- tigious appointment at such a young stage of his life is that he was a prote \u00b4ge\u00b4of the powerful President of the Council of the Indies, Juan de Ovando, 57who reigned over vast transatlantic networks of letrados , most of whom were, like Sande, former students of San Bartolome \u00b4College (the archenemy of Ovando, he deemed his social inferior: as a not- so-gentle reminder that only higher-ranking noblemen should be in charge ofgovernment, the viceroy did everything possible to lower Sande's status, forinstance by roughly denying him the right to publicly make use of the para- phernalia of power. 59 Yet the worst status ordeal that Sande had to undergo took place neither in Mexico, nor in Manila, but in Spain.

In order to preserve untainted the renown of their lineage, and to keep escaping the payment of the head tax that was due only from commoners, the Sande had to go through a most humiliating procedure, namely a 'litigation to prove noble status'(pleito de hidalgu \u00b4a). After an inquiry was conducted by the Royal Chancery of Granada, whose envoys in Ca \u00b4ceres minutely scrutinized the origins of the main family branch back to two generations, the Sande were provided with a 'royal certicate a meagre victory, since it meant that they belonged to the lowest stratum of the aristocratic world, the hidalgu \u00b4a de ejecutoria being only a pale reflection of the hidalgu \u00b4a notoria .

Yet they were closely linked within one single mindscape, for even from his distant postings, the governor kept a watchful eye on the twists and turns of his relatives' destinies. In 1574,as he still sat as a magistrate on the bench of the Audience of Mexico, he wrotea letter to his brothers to ask them either to marry upwardly or send their ve sisters to the convent. 64By the late 1570s, while he had a hard time fending off mounting criticism over the disastrous outcome of his military campaignagainst the sultanate of Brunei, he sent his brother Juan 1,100 ducats so thathe could buy himself the position of alderman ( regidur \u00b4a)i nC a \u00b4ceres. 65In 1596, while he was about to leave Guatemala City to take up his appointment as governor in Santa Fe \u00b4de Bogota, he asked one of his brothers to buy, from a certain Hernando de Molina, a tiny 'orchard plot' ( huerta ) lying along the banks of the Ribera del Marco, a stream running close to his home town. A few weeks later, he ordered his relatives to sell to the cleric Juan Pantoja an'enclosed garden' district of Ca\u00b4ceres. By the late 1590s, Francisco de Sande, who had been living overseas for more than three decades, had even become one of the richest landowners of the Sierra de Fuentes, where he leased out large tracts of pasture to smallfarmers. 66Thanks to well-maintained epistolary trails67and to an extensive kinship network, the governor acted simultaneously in different places, some located in Spain, others in Asia and still others in the Americas: he was, in a sense, a multi-sited character. Tracing in its minute details the biographical trajectory of Francisco de Sande is not so difcult a task, since like all the literate and the powerful he lefta long paper trail behind him wherever he went.

Yet by focusing more on people-on-the-move than on thelocales that they cross and where they occasionally settle, one runs the risk,not only of forgetting the many ordinary people who could not so easily travelthe globe, but also of drawing too flat a picture of the world. 69At any rate, trying to reconcile a microhistorical inquiry with a global history perspectivemay have little to do with sketching 'global lives', 70since Italian micro- historians have always exhibited a strong deance towards the biographicalframing of their research data. 71Coping with the seemingly subaltern characters of the Diego de A \u00b4vila affair \u2014 namely Ine \u00b4s Sinapas and Beatriz, the two Indian women accused of 'witchcraft' by the governor \u2014offers us the prized opportunity to addr ess the tricky issue of the anthropo- logical asperities of that globalized corner of the earth that went under thename of the 'Spanish Philippines'. III Unlike Diego, Ine \u00b4s and Beatriz were questioned by Sande under conditions of judicial torture. Wholly naked, 'except for a piece of cloth on their shamefulparts', they were tied to a wooden easel and ropes solidly attached to theirwrists and ankles. The ropes were pulled by the executioner up to the pointwhere both flesh and tendons were torn apart. The imposition of demono-logical categories therefore was not just a speech act, but also a bodily process,and a bloody one at that.

They had them say everything they wished'.72One therefore cannot take for granted any sentence the two women uttered while 'confess-ing', all the more so since, expressing themselves in Cebuano, they were probably badly mistranslated by the two interpreters, Juan Cabuten and Juan Tapondo, who were indios ladinos \u2014 converted and Castilian-speaking Indians or mestizos \u2014 but native Tagalog-speakers. The most interesting narrative moments precisely came when there were disruptions, and even spectacular breakdowns, in the translation process, that is to say when the two interpreters found themselves unable to convert native words into Spanishones and the governor's clerk, the escribano Alonso Beltra \u00b4n, had no choice but to transcribe them phonetically: then windows opened on the world of Ine \u00b4s and Beatriz. This happened for the very rst time when Sande asked Ine \u00b4st o list the ingredients she had used in order to prepare the 'livid ointment' withwhich she had 'bewitched' Andre \u00b4s de Villalobos and his wife: This confessant said, by means of the said interpreter, that the in- gredients making up the ointment are chicken feathers and cat tailhairs, and the root of that plant called zilamun zilamun , and the root of the salinbagal which is another plant, and the tanglar and the buyo , and the nails and eggs of the baowhich is like a turtle, and the dangling roots of the dancalan , and the pearl of the said dancalan , and that of the buquia , which is the same thing, and a stone [a vertebra] of the tail of the black lizard ( chaco \u00b4n negro ), and the tail of a snake called bulacan , and the tail of another snake called tagui- gualo , and the tail of another snake which is like an eel and is called casili orbais, and a stone [a bone] from a toad's skull, and one from a white deer, and the hoofs and the tail's hairs of a big game ( dedos y pelos del venado de la parte de la cola ), and a stone from a mouse tail, and many other things that she could not remember, and all thisthey had grinded and mixed with a little bit of beeswax and of benzoin oil that they had fetched at Beatriz mother's place [and they had added to the preparation] the blood and eggs of manylarge-scale spiders, and the blood and legs or fangs of a scor-pion ( manos o bocas del alacran, y fos. 37r-38v, Fr M. de Rada to P.

Whereas onecould think that in order to escape the pain, Ine \u00b4s said anything that came to her mind, there was a hidden logic to her speech, since almost all the plants and resins that she listed had specic therapeutic-cum-ritual properties. Inthe very rst inventory of materia medica to be produced in the Philippines, theLibro de medicinas caseras written by the Franciscan Blas de la Madre de Dios in 1611, the buyo (the betel leaf) is deemed a powerful analgesic while the dancalan (the resinous bark of a mangrove tree) is said to help heal purulent wounds and repair broken bones, the tanglar (wild garlic) to cure the gout disease, the salimbagat 's onion to relieve stomach and pelvic pains, and a 'snake's stone' ( piedra de culebra ) to counter the effects of animal venoms. 74 As in so many cases of 'medicine women' ( curanderas ) brought before the Holy Ofce tribunals for their alleged allegiance to the Devil, what was labelled satanic knowledge by the governor was actually part of the ordinary healer's art of making remedies.75By her own account, Ine \u00b4s was not a pro- fessional 'witch' but an amateur village herbalist and bonesetter \u2014 what wascalled in the Visayas a mangagayoma. 76In one of the most dramatic mis- translations to occur during the trial, the interpreters mistook something that Ine\u00b4s called the tango tango for was the 'Devil's g' ( higuera del diablo a widely spread curative plant, namely the Ricinus communis, used as a plaster to heal kidney stones.77 This knowledge of plants' properties seemingly was the preserve of women: it was handed down from mother to daughter and shared in whispers amonghandmaids in the half-light of nipa shacks. Ine \u00b4s, for instance, remembers that she once asked another servant named Bucbuc to provide her with a plant recovered from the copy sent to the Council of the Indies: AGI, Fil. 34, N 21, fos. 150v- 151r, 'Costumbres de (1589), in Fray Francisco de Santa Ine \u00b4s, Cro\u00b4nica la Provincia de San Gregorio Magno de religiosos descalzos de N.

The 'livid ointment' prepared by Ine \u00b4s may ac- tually have been originally meant to repel Andre \u00b4s de Villalobos's sexual as- saults. When Beatriz was asked, under torture, why Ine \u00b4s was so angry at her master and his wife so as to 'bewitch' them, she answered that 'Ine \u00b4s had told her that she wanted to hurt [Villalobos' wife] because the latter punished herfor sleeping with her husband'. 81As we learn from a number of recorded cases, it was not rare that powerful encomenderos , who also acted as local justice ofcials and consequently could easily conceal their misdeeds, sexually abused their native slaves and handmaids, up to the point that the lattercommitted suicide. 82 If Ine \u00b4s obviously knew quite a lot about a vernacular pharmacology, she may also have been acquainted with another kind of healing art. Juan Me\u00b4ndez, one of the men who helped Fr Gutie \u00b4rrez bring back Ine \u00b4s to the church in order to question her, declared that in order to cure Andre \u00b4sd e Villalobos and his wife from their 'craziness', Ine \u00b4s not only prepared an 78AGN, Inq. 131, de Jesu of the , see also Roma Manila, 16 and de Victoria 23 1617; fo. 436r, Self-denunciation of Miguel Diaz de Monzon, Manila, 27 May 1617; and fo. 435r, Confession of Ybona de Sun o, Manila, 9 June 1617.

And after the night had fallen, the aforesaid Sinapas did what she had said. She burnt some dead man's bones that she had gone tofetch by the late afternoon, and getting back to her bailan she took in her hands a dagger and a shield and started dancing to the sound of the gongs, and according to what this witness [Juan Me \u00b4ndez] man- aged to grasp, she was invoking the devil, for soon she sat down, andhaving made the dagger's blade slide down along her hand palm until it bled, she said everything was over. And grabbing the tibor she had brought as an offering, she threw it in the sea. 84 Ine\u00b4s was then playing the role of another dramatis personae , namely that of a babaylan , a local ritual specialist. In both Luzon and the Visayas, the spirit- invoking ceremony she had hastily set up was usually called a maganito , from the root-word anito designating a spiritual entity whose scope of action was deemed territorially smaller and more case-specic than that ( diwata ). 85Maganitos were trance possession rituals during which the incumbent was 'seized' by a spirit up to the point of losing con- sciousness.86After the spirit had deciphered the cause of the patient's social unease or physical disease, and divulged the appropriate penance or remedy, the ritual had to come to a close with a propitiatory offering \u2014 in Ine \u00b4s' case, a 'jar of Chinese design' ( tibor ).87This kind of ceremony was well known to the Spaniards, as many authors \u2014 including Antonio Pigafetta, the chronicler of 83According to Fr Blas de la Madre de Dios, the ground leaves of the luya bang lay \u2014 mispelled luya tan flay by the governor's clerk \u2014 were used to cure someone who had been either 'bewitched or bitten by a venomous animal/insect' ( of Divinity, the Spirit-World, Sacrices, Rites the Bisayans 83-4, 86. 87Imported from China since the early Ming period, these tibores were highly sought-after prestige items among Visayan displaying a 'snake design' ( inalasan fetched the highest de la lengua bisaya, hiligueina rst pubd 1637), 123.

Her conversion to Catholicism, at thetime the Augustinians were conducting mass baptisms, in the late 1560s, left no deep imprint on her mind, since she was unable to remember the names of her 'godfathers' ( padrinos ). 94Even if Ine \u00b4s was enslaved and tormented by Villalobos, her mindscape was never restricted to the Spaniards' world: her imaginaryhorizons extended to times and places that had not yet been captured by the Europeans and that would stay out of their reach for many decades to come. By not only acknowledging the fact that Francisco de Sande and Ine \u00b4s Sinapas in- habited the same social and physical space of Manila, but also by following totheir ends the thin threads of their formative experiences \u2014 some leading to Spain, others to the South China Sea \u2014 one therefore escapes the ction of a single, unied, monocentric imperial world, a ction all too often uncriticallyendorsed by global history narratives. Even in a dreadful situation such as an Inquisition trial, there may be hope for the weak. If both Ine \u00b4s and Beatriz were ultimately sentenced to 'public dismemberment' by Sande, no document actually brings undisputable evi- dence that the sentence was implemented. On the night of 31 May, and 1 June1577, thanks to the help of her husband Andre \u00b4s and of two Indian accom- plices named Laloyon and Cabalin, Beatriz managed to escape from Manila's public jail and disappeared in the mangrove. She never was to be heard ofagain. 95As for Diego, he was shipped to Mexico in 1579 in order to be and that experienced by the Javanese dukun , all the more so since the Tagalog word employed to designate ritual specialists ( catalona ) is very probably of Malay origins (from keturunan , meaning the 'descent' of the spirit in the incumbent's body). Also, one cannot fail to register the many similarities between Filipino anitos and Burmese nat or Cambodian neakt a, since all are locale-bound tutelary spirits whose cult brings fertility either to crops or to women. See Alain Forest, Le culte des ge \u00b4nies les neak ta (Paris, 1992). 93Villalobos's fleet briefy visited the two islands between January and August 1543 (Consuelo Varela, El viaje de don Ruy a las Islas de Jesu 17 April 1577.

But upon his arrival in Mexico City, he went to visit the ViceroyMart \u00b4n Enr \u00b4quez de Almansa, an old-time enemy of Francisco de Sande who, when shown the governor's sentence by the boy, 'told him to go backto his mother and laughed mockingly about what the aforesaid governor haddone given the age of the muchacho '. Diego then showed up in the ofce of the President of the Holy Ofce Tribunal, Alonso Ferna \u00b4ndez de Bonilla, who, after having briefly questioned him, concluded that 'he was unable to carry on this examination and trial in the Inquisition tribunal' since 'when the case was opened in Manila, the accused could have been no older than 10'.At last, Bonilla told Diego to 'get back home', thereby setting him free fromall charges. 96 IV CONCLUSION In 1577, barely a decade after the start of the so-called Spanish conquest of thePhilippines, Manila was less a global city than a city of many worlds. If it was ahub of long-distance connections, not all those connections could be attrib-utable solely to the actions of the Europeans. Some, like the one with China,best exemplied by Ine \u00b4s' ritual use of gongs and the small glazed earthenware salt-cellar in which she kept her 'livid ointment', could be traced back to thefourteenth century, hence to a time when Europe had no hold on Asia'sdestiny. 97The in-depth study of one single set of archival materials \u2014 the Diego de A \u00b4vila case, by all standards a very parochial affair \u2014 therefore makes it possible to access a host of conflicting moral worlds and distinct livedexperiences that cohabited in the very same, small-scale social space. 96AGN, Inq. 131, exp. 10, fos. 174v-175v, Life narrative of D. de A \u00b4vila as told to Inquisitor A.

Bonilla was an experienced judge, who had taken part in the creation (plantacio \u00b4n) of the Holy Ofce Tribunal in Mexico in 1570 and been promoted to the rank of Inquisitor in 1573. As shown by his very cautious attitudeduring the 1574 trial of several cabin boys who had served on the ships of the British privateer John Hawkins \u2014 and whom he was reluctant to consider guilty of apostasy since they were too young to have known true Catholicism before adhering toAnglicanism \u2014 Bonilla did not take lightly the issue of the age of the accused brought before him.

The sources of these streams often lay far away from the shores ofLuzon, and so did that of the scholastic river that nurtured Francisco deSande's hatred for witches. The very fact that two people who lived in thesame place inhabited different worlds even if they physically interacted on a daily basis \u2014 like Ine \u00b4s Sinapas and Andre \u00b4s de Villalobos, or like Fr Alonso Jime\u00b4nez and the governor \u2014 is something that should ultimately lead us to reconsider any etic understandings of space that we nd in global history. 98It should also alert us to the ethnographic limitations of any purely scale-baseddistinction between the local and the global. Hence, bridging the gap betweenmicrohistory and global history may not mean moving back and forthbetween different levels of contextualization, as if reality was a tiered,multi-layered cliff and the historian an adventurous alpinist, but rather unearthing the fossilized remains of the many worlds that lay intermeshed in one single location.
