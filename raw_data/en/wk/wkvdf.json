However, it can also be a challenging time as your body adjusts to the higher vibrational energies. This is why it's important to pay attention to your diet during this period. Naturally, during this process, you begin to crave a healthier diet, but you may not know where to start. This is where a spiritual ascension diet plan comes in. During a spiritual journey, the physical body is going through changes as it starts to vibrate at a higher frequency. This can cause a variety of ascension symptoms, such as fatigue, headaches, and even digestive issues. An essential part of spiritual growth is learning how to take care of your body so that you can fully embody your higher vibrational state. A major part of this is paying attention to the food you eat. The foods you consume have a direct impact on your physical and energetic bodies. When you eat foods that are [high in vibrational energy](https://clarysagecollege.com/news/my-food-is-vibrating/#:~:text=So%20what%20do%20I%20mean,better%20all%20the%20way%20around.), it helps to raise your own vibration. Conversely, when you eat foods that are low in vibrational energy, it can bring your vibration down. It's extremely common for meat eaters, for example, to begin to experience negative emotions towards animal protein during a spiritual awakening. This is because, on a physical and global level, animal products are some of the lowest vibrational foods you can eat. They are full of low-vibration emotions like fear, pain, and suffering.

There is an intuitive connection between mother nature and the human body, and when we eat foods that are in harmony with nature, it helps us to feel more connected and balanced. Spiritual Ascension Effects On The Mind and Body During spiritual evolution, physical changes occur. As the ascension process begins several systems in the body begin a cellular transformation that changes our DNA. This metamorphosis is a physical representation of our spiritual growth. The awakening process can be very taxing on the body as it makes these adjustments.

This can lead to symptoms such as: - Fatigue - Weight gain - Hair loss - Dry skin - Muscle weakness While the nervous system is also going through changes, the biggest ascension symptom here is anxiety. As we open up to higher levels of consciousness, we can become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that is now available to us. We may feel like we are losing control as our old belief systems start to crumble. As we experience disruption in our thought patterns, it can lead to feelings of anxiety and even panic.

We'll start with a basic guideline that you can use to build your own spiritual ascension diet plan. Remember, the goal is to eat foods that are high in vibration and will support your body during this time of transformation. The we have a sample meal plan for you to follow. Basic Guidelines For Your Spiritual Ascension Diet Plan 1. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. These are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that are essential for good health. They are also full of water, which is important for detoxification. Green leafy vegetables are probably the most vital type of food you can eat during spiritual ascension. These whole foods are grown out of the earth and (when organic) are some of the highest vibrational foods available. 2. Eat whole grains. These complex carbohydrates give you sustained energy and help to stabilize blood sugar levels. Whole grains have a greater density and more fiber than refined grains. This makes them more filling and satisfying. Good choices include brown rice, quinoa, oats, and rye. 3. Include healthy fats in your diet. Healthy fats are necessary for the absorption of vitamins and minerals. They also help to keep you feeling satisfied after meals. Good sources of healthy fats include avocados, nuts, and seeds. You can also use avocado or coconut oil in cooking to replace other oils. 4. Drink plenty of water. Water is essential for flushing toxins from the body and keeping you hydrated. It's best to drink filtered water to avoid exposure to chemicals and other impurities. Clean water is vital for good health and spiritual ascension as it helps to flush out toxins and negative energy. 5. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeine and alcohol are stimulants that can interfere with sleep and contribute to anxiety. They can also dehydrate the body and deplete the adrenal glands. If you do consume caffeine, try to limit it to one cup per day. It's best to completely avoid alcohol during your spiritual ascension journey. If you need an energy boost [raw cacao](https://amzn.to/3Q1PO7e) is a great alternative to coffee. It's also full of antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties. 6. Incorporate herbs into your diet. Herbal teas and fresh herbs have chemical compounds that can improve and accelerate healing and ascension symptoms. They can also help to cleanse and detoxify the body. [Sea moss, bladderwrack, and burdock root](https://amzn.to/3cGTcXx) are particularly good for detoxification. Chamomile, lavender, and lemon balm can help to ease anxiety and promote relaxation. 7. Avoid processed foods, artificial ingredients, and refined sugars. These foods are low in vibration and can actually contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. It's best to avoid packaged and processed foods as much as possible. If you do consume them, make sure to read the labels carefully to avoid ingredients that are harmful to your health. You should be able to read and understand every ingredient on the list. 8. Reduce meat/animal products. Meat and animal products are also low in vibration and can be difficult to digest. If you do eat meat, make sure it is organic and free-range. Grass-fed meat is also a good option. While you don't need to completely eliminate meat from your diet reducing how much you consume and increasing the quality of the meat you do eat is ideal. 10. Avoid fast food. Fast food is full of unhealthy ingredients that can contribute to feelings of low energy and depression. The chemicals in fast food can also be addictive and lead to unhealthy cravings. Greasy foods can also be difficult to digest, so it's best to avoid them if possible. 11. Intermittent fast to increase healing vibrations. Intermittent fasting is a great way to cleanse the body and reset the digestive system. It can also help to increase your vibrational frequency. When you fast, your body has more time to rest and repair itself. There are many different ways to intermittent fast, so find one that works best for you. A good starting point is to fast for 12 hours every day. You can cut off eating a few hours before bed and then eat breakfast a few hours after you wake up. 12. Listen to your body. Your body is a great guide for what you should and shouldn't eat. Pay attention to how you feel after eating certain foods. If you feel tired, sluggish, or bloated, chances are the food isn't agreeing with you. On the other hand, if you feel energized and vibrant, it's a good sign that you're on the right track. Sample Spiritual Ascension Diet Plan This plan was created after researching and studying different spiritual ascension diets. It's based on the premise that the foods we eat can either help or hinder our journey to ascension. The goal of this diet is to consume mostly high vibrational foods that will help to cleanse and detoxify the body, while also promoting healing and self-care. Breakfast Options When we wake up in the morning, our bodies are in a natural state of detoxification. We are usually dehydrated from sleeping and our bodies are working to eliminate toxins that have built up overnight. For this reason, it's important to start the day with hydrating and cleansing options. Always begin the day by drinking water, it can be with lemon/lime or without the key is to just get in some hydration early. Our favorite breakfast is breakfast soup. It sounds weird but it's basically a cooked smoothie. Raw vegetables can be hard on the digestive system first thing in the morning, so we cook them lightly in water or salt-free broth. Then we blend them up into a soup and add some seasonings like turmeric, ginger, and black pepper. This is a great way to get in a ton of nutrients first thing in the morning. Recommended vegetables: - Watercress - Spinach - Kale - Parsley - Celery - Carrots Other options: - Soaked oats with fruit - Green smoothie - Chia pudding - Breakfast quinoa bowl - Acai bowl Lunch and Dinner Options For lunch and dinner, we like to keep things simple and this is where we add some raw foods. We typically eat a big salad with lots of veggies. Marinating your salads overnight can make them easier to digest. You can also like to add some sort of protein to the salad like lentils, chickpeas, or other beans. Another lunch option is a big veggie wrap. We like to use collard greens or nori sheets as the wrap and then fill it with whatever veggies we have on hand. These can be eaten cold or you can cook the veggies before wrapping them up. Some other dinner options include: - Stir-fry - Veggie burger - Roasted vegetables - Saut\u00e9ed greens - Curry - Zucchini noodles with tomato sauce Snack Options: Nuts and seeds are a great snack option because they are high in protein and healthy fats. They will help to keep you full and satisfied between meals. Just be sure to eat them in moderation because they are high in calories. Other snack options include: - Fresh fruit - Dried fruit - Veggies and dip - Hummus - Guacamole - Salsa - Nut butter and apples - Carrot sticks and tahini dressing Supplements: There are a few key supplements that we recommend for anyone following a spiritual ascension diet. These include: 1. Probiotics - These are beneficial bacteria that help to promote a healthy gut. A healthy gut is essential for proper digestion and absorption of nutrients. Probiotics can be found in supplement form or in fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, and sauerkraut. 2. Greens powders - These powders are a concentrated source of nutrients from greens and other fruits and vegetables. They are a great way to get in a lot of nutrients without having to eat a ton of food. Greens powders can be added to smoothies, juices, or water. 3. Vitamin D - Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for bone health. It can also help to boost the immune system and promote a sense of well-being. Vitamin D can be found in supplement form or in foods like egg yolks, fatty fish, and mushrooms. 4. Omega-3 fatty acids - Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of healthy fat that is [essential for brain health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626). They can also help to reduce inflammation throughout the body. Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in supplement form or in foods like salmon, flaxseeds, and chia seeds. 5. Spirulina - Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that is high in protein and nutrients. It is often used as a supplement to boost energy levels and promote detoxification. Spirulina can be found in powder or tablet form. Following a spiritual ascension diet can help you to feel more connected to the world around you and promote a sense of peace and well-being. It is important to listen to your body and eat foods that make you feel good. If you have any medical conditions, please consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet. There is no one-size-fits-all diet for spiritual ascension. What works for one person may not work for another. The best way to find out what works for you is to experiment with different foods and see how you feel after eating them. Be patient and trust that you will find the perfect diet for your journey. "}
