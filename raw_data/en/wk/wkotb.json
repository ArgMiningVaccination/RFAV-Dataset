It represents the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority's current thinking on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicine s and takes into account the country's obligations in terms of international agreements. It is not intended as an exclusive approach. The Authority reserves the right to request any additional information to establish the scheduling status of a medicine i n keeping with the knowledge current at the time of evaluation. Alternative approaches may be used but these should be scientifically and technically justified. It is important that applicants adhere to the administrative requirements to avoid delays in the processing and evaluation of applications.

INTRODUCTION 1.2 General information 1.2.1. The application form is to be used for applications regarding rescheduling of a substance or medicine in line with the SAHPGL -CEM -NS-02_v3_ Guideline on the Scheduling of Substances and Medicine s. 1.2.2. Application can be submitted by applicants who wish to change the schedule status of a registered medicine or applications for rescheduling can be made independent of a registered medicine by any persons or associations. 1.2.3. The same principles as outlined in the SAHPGL -CEM -NS-02_v3_ Guideline on the Scheduling of Substances and Medicine s would be applied in considering an application for rescheduling. Therefore, to justify a rescheduling from Schedule 3 or 4 to Schedule 2 or 1, evidence would need to be provided to justify use without a prescription . If any of the following criteria were met, prescription status would need to be maintained: The substance is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health, even when used correctly, if used without supervision by a medical practitioner or dentist; The substance is frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly or inappropriately, and as a result is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health; The safety and efficacy of the substance has not yet been adequately described and requires further investigation. 1.2.4. Likewise, in order to justify a Schedule 0 status, evidence would need to be provided that show that the hazard to health, the risk of misuse and the need for special precautions in handling are small, and that wider sale would be a convenience to the consumer. 1.2.5. A product is normally assigned the highest scheduling status appropriate to any one of the registered indications of the product. If application is made to reschedule only sele cted indications of a specific product to a lower Schedule, a unique name and a separate registration dossier will also be required for such a product. It must be noted that dual scheduling on printed packaging is not permitted. Only products with indica tions, strengths, routes of administration and/or pack sizes applicable to the lower schedule will qualify for the lower scheduling status. 2. SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION FORM: 2.1 A rescheduling application form (Annexure A) must be submitted to SAHPRA. The completed submission must also include the following documentation and supporting evidence: a. Copies of referenced material b. Proof of Payment c.
