This paper provides evidence to the Committee on the future programme budget proposals in relation to the Local Government budgets within the Finance and Local Government MEG as outlined in the Draft Budget which was laid on 20 December 2021 . Annex A provides a breakdown of the relevant Draft Budget figures for the Finance and Local Government Main Expenditure Group ( MEG ) by Spending Programme Area, Action and Budget Expenditure Line (BEL). These figures are reflected in the table below.

Seek to reform council tax to ensure a fairer and more progressive system I announced my pl ans for the reform of the cou ncil tax system on 7 December. Provision for this work is made through the Local Taxation, Research and Analysis BEL. Further information is provided under the 'Budget Allocations' section of this document . 2 Make the case for clea r and stable tax devolu tion The two local taxes, council tax and non -domestic rates, are integral part of the local government finance system in Wales. Alongside my plans for reforming the council tax system, on 7 December, I set out the need to consider reforms to the non -domestic rates system. Much of the local government finance system predates devolution and, while the policy responsibilities for the two taxes are largely devolved, certain aspects of the system remain closely intertwined with the arrangements in England. One of our objectives in reviewing both the local taxes will be to define the devolved powers more clearly and secure greater autonomy for the Welsh Ministers and the Senedd in relation to decision -making so that we can ensure the local taxes are designed to best meet the needs of Wales. Provision for this work is also made through the Local Taxation, Research and Analysis BEL. Further information is provided under the 'Budget Allocations' section of this document. Strengthen the autonomy and effecti veness of local government to make them more successful in delivering services This Programme for Government commitment will be delivered through the funding for local government sector -led improvement, including around digital transformation (which also delivers against the PfG commitment to deliver the Digital Strategy) , through the Transfor mation and Legislation BEL . Work to improve Community Council financial management and governance is funded by the Community and Town C ouncil BEL and an allocation from the Transfor mation and Legislation BEL. Any direct engagement with local authority specific statutory intervention and support programmes are funded through the Im provement and Support BEL. Other work which will contribute includes our financial reform and work on reforming council tax ; and increasing democratic participation. This will be funded through the Transformation and Legislation BEL and the Local Taxation, Research and Analysis BEL . Reduce the Administrative burden on local authorities There are no funding implications for this commitment in 2022 -23. The intention is to scope the work next year , working with WLGA and across Welsh Government, recognising that the admin istrative burdens could come from a range of portfolio areas. The exercise would then be undertaken in the second half of this term . Explore & develop effective tax, planning and housing measure s to ensure the interests of local people are protected As part of the three -pronged approach announced by the Minister for Climate Change in July, the Welsh Government recently consulted on possible changes to the local taxes to help local authorities in managing the impact of second homes and self -catered accommodation in their areas . The responses are being considered and will inform future policy development. The Local Taxation, Research and Analysis BEL includes provision for implementing any changes and the additional analyses of information on second hom es and self -catering accommodation within the local tax -base. 3 Reform local government elections to reduce the democratic deficit This commitment is being delivered in two phases, the first to May 2022 will pilot a range of flexible voting options for voters in four local authorit y areas. This work will then be evaluated and considered for roll out across Wales in advance of our next scheduled sets of devolv ed elections in 2026 and 2027. The second phase of the work is also looking at how further re forms to voter information and engagement and improved accessibility to the electoral system can encourage more voters to engage with the democratic process. This work is being undertaken in conjunction with work on expanding the access to elected office programme and increasing diversity in democracy. This work will be funded from the Elections Policy BEL and funding provided to principal councils through the RSG , which also recognises the costs of implementing the Local Government and Elections (Wales) A ct 2021 . Expand our Access to Elected Office programme I have established a pilot Access to Elected Office fund which ran in advance of the Senedd electio ns last year and will now be available to candidates with disabilities in the forthcoming principal council and town and community council elections. This pilot will be evaluated and the learning will be used to consider how the fund and other forms of poten tial support could be improved and expanded to encompass people with other protected characteristics. This work w ill be funded from the Transformation and Legislation BEL. Delivery of the Local Government Chapter in the Race Equality Action Plan The We lsh Government is committed to enabling an anti -racist Wales. As part of this I will ensure the legislative and governance framework for local government promotes actions and decision making that is anti -racist. I am taking forward a range of changes to the legislative framework to ensure local authority governance takes place within a statutory framework that supports equality and diversity and actively promotes anti - racism. This will also enable local government to review its own recruitment, internal human resources policies and complaints processes to ensure they are anti -racist. This work will be funded from the Transformation and Legislation BEL. Ensure that each region in Wales has effective and democraticall y accountable means of developing their future econ omies Specific grant funding was provided in 2021 -2022 to help regions put in place arrangements to establish the constitutional arrangements for their Corporate Joint Committees and transition across existing regional governance arrangements as appropriate. Going forward this is reflected in the core funding received th rough the unhypothecated Local Government Settlement , to reflect the fact that undertaking and supporting collaboration between local authorities is part of the core operating model for local government . As set out below, the Local Government settlement has increased significantly to \u00a3 5.1 billion in 2022 -2023. 4 Change the performance framework for local governme nt to better enable innovation, tr ansparency, and local ownership This relates to implementation of the new performance and governance regime in the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. Support for local authorities to undertake self-assessments and panel assessments is provided through the local government sector -led Improvement and Support Programme, funded through the Transfor mation and Legislation BEL. Any direct engagement with local authority specific statutory intervention and support programmes are funded through the Improvement and Support BEL . Budget allocations The Local Government Directorate supports the delivery of a number of Programme for Government commitments as detailed above. In accordance with Welsh Government budget management principles, allocations to support the delivery of these commitments have be en targeted towards interventions that are affordable and offer value for money. Details of the allocations and the PfG commitments they support are provided below. A Strategic Integrated Impact Assessment was published alongside our Draft Budget on 20 De cember; this sets out how our interventions have been targeted to address economic, climate and other impacts. Allocations have been made throughout this portfolio to address impacts that have been identified and with the principles of the Wellbeing of Fut ure Generations Act in mind . These details are provided throughout this paper. The well -being duty in the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 continues to shape our ongoing improvements to our budget process. These are set out in our Budget Improvement Plan, developed through engagement with the Future Generations Commission, where we publish annually a rolling five year plan of continuous improvement to budget ing and tax processes to further embed the sustainable development principle. This year it has influenced the budget because the well -being objectives set by this Government in its Programme for Government have been at the heart of the budget process. Setting the well -being objectives early in this term has enabled these to form part o f the budget discussions. The Well -Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has been taken into consideration when making budget allocations as set out below. 5 Revenue Revenue Support Grant The revenue support grant (RSG) , together with non-domestic rates forms the local government settlement. The increase in the RSG for 2022 -23 is \u00a3 368m (10.2%) leading to an overall increase in the settlement on a like for like basis of \u00a3437m (9.4%). Local government is a key partner in delivering the p rogramme for government. Providing this significant funding un-hypothecated means local authorities have the flexibility to plan, fund and deliver their services in the way that works best for their local populations. The Wellbeing of Future Generations Act requires local authorities, alongside other public bodies, in Wales to think about the long -term imp act of their decisions, to work better with peop le, communities and each other, and to prevent persi stent problems such as poverty, health inequalities and climate change. Local authorities are responsible for considering impact assessments and the Socio Economic Duty in the decisions they make about delivery of their services. The Government has worked closely with Local Government through the WLGA and through the Finance Sub Group , to understand the pressures faced by local authorities and our shared ambitions for local government services . Our funding decisions, reflected through the Local Government settlement , and specific grants, recognise increases in demand, inflation and pay awards for hard working staff as well as our mutual ambitions for essential services for the people of Wales . Social care is one area in particular where there are significant pressures, from increasing and increasi ngly complex demands . This significantly increased funding allows authorities to deliver on our shared commitment to the payment of the real living wage to social care staff. We also know that following the pandemic the way that services are delivered a nd the way people use services have changed and that some of these changes are permanent. There is no separate local government hardship fund for 2022 -23 onwards as there has been no specific funding from the UK Government for Covid recovery. However the increase in the settlement is such that it gives local authorities flexibility to continue to manage additional costs and loss of income. The WLGA estimate d this at \u00a375.5m for the 2022 -23 year. They will also be working with their partners who deliver services, for example arts and leisure trusts to manage the ongoing impact of the pandemic. The increase in in the settlement gives the support for local authorities to start to address these challenges, with funding sufficient to meet increased wage forec asts and inflation. There will inevitably still be pressures and we will continue to work closely with the sector. In addition the provision of overall funding levels for 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 will enable local authorities to plan over a three year basis. Alongside the settlement there is a large number of grant s given for specific outcomes, these include those to recover from the pandemic - for example in education. The total of specific grants for 2022 -23 is over \u00a31.1 billion for revenue and almost \u00a3800 million in capital . 6 Rates Relief and Multiplier Freeze An additional \u00a3105 m has been allocated for non -domestic rates (NDR) support in 2022 - 23 (BEL 875) . This has been allocated to extending our relief scheme for businesses and other ratepayers i n the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. In addition, \u00a335m has been allocated to the Non -Domestic Rates Pool to freeze the multiplier for 2022 -23. The decision to freeze the multiplier will ensure that, before applying any reliefs, there will be no increase in the amount of rates which businesses and other ratepayers pay next year. The funding will be managed through the non - domestic rates pool to ensure that the overall funding which local authorities receive through the local government settlement is unaffected. Our Retail, Leisure and Hospitality Rates Relief (RLHRR) scheme will be extended to provide continued support for the sectors most directly affected by the Covid -19 pandemic. The scheme will provid e an additional \u00a3116m of rates relief for eligible businesses in 2022 -23. The balance between the cost of the scheme and the additional allocation will be met from the existing baseline provision. All retail, leisure and hospitality ratepayers in Wales w ill receive up to 50% relief on their rates bills for the year. Like the equivalent scheme announced for England , our scheme will be capped at \u00a3110,000 of relief per business across Wales. Our approach ensures that businesses in Wales will not be disad vantaged compared to other parts of the UK. Allocation for Local Government Directorate to reform the local taxes As mentioned above, t he updated Programme for Government includes a commitment to 'seek to reform council tax to ensure a fairer and more progressive system'. There are a number of other commitments which are relevant to the development of the local taxes in Wales, including to 'make the case for clear and stable tax devolution' and to 'strengthen the autonomy and effectiveness of local government to make them more successful in delivering services '. The local taxes also have a contribution to make to the commitment to 'e xplore and develop effective tax, planning and housing measures to ensure the interests of local people are prot ected'. Based on extensive work conducted over the 5th Senedd Term, on 7 December , I announced an ambitious package of reforms to council tax as the first steps in redesigning the system so that it becomes more progressive. The package includes the poten tial for a revaluation exercise, a review of the council tax reduction scheme and consideration of whether our system of discounts, exemptions and premiums could help to achieve a fairer system . Work will also continue on exploring longer term ideas such as whether a system more closely linked to land values has potential as a more progressive way of raising revenue and what reforms are needed to the non -domestic rates system. Alongside these plans, the Welsh Government recently conducted a consult ation looking at possible changes to the local taxes which might support local authorities in 7 managing the impact of second homes and self -catered accommodation in their areas . The responses are being analysed with a view to informing future policy develo pments. The allocation of \u00a32.8m to the Local Taxation Research and Analysis budget in 2022 -23 will support the delivery of this package of work , including the technical work required to support a possible council tax revaluation , the assessment of options for reforming non - domestic rates and the detailed exploration of the feasibility of a land value tax as an alternative way of raising revenue for local services . Allocation for Transformation and Legislation The additional allocation of Transformation and L egislation budget of \u00a31.3m in 2022 -23 supports the continued work to implement the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 and the transformation in local government. The planned work includes the further implementation of digital transformation, as well as facilitating decarbonisation initiatives in local government, supporting local government improvement functions, and enabling the development of community councils. The budget will also support work to improve access to elected office and the implementation of the Race Equality Action Plan within local government, as well as support work related to the wider reform of the local government finance system. Allocation for NDR revaluation All non -domestic properties are revalued f or rating purposes according to timetables set out in law. The next revaluation will take effect on 1 April 2023 based on properties values assessed as at 1 April 2021 . The additional allocation of \u00a33.7m in 2022 -23 will support the associated work, including the additional costs of valuation work carried out by the Valuation Office Agency in delivering the revaluation for Wales (BEL 1500) . Revaluation maintains the integrity of the tax -base which raises around \u00a31.4bn of revenue each year for local services in Wales. As well as supporting the statutory functions, the revaluation will reflect market conditions, including the impact of Covid, and will redistribute liability for non -domestic rates across the tax -base. Allocation to r eform LG elect ions Reflecting recently devolved powers to Welsh Ministers, t his allocation of \u00a32m in 2022 - 23 creates a new budget to specifically support the reform of electoral administration for devolved elections by improving the accessibility of the voting process for voters, including through the use of technology and improving voter information and engagement with the democratic process. 8 Capital Local Government The local government supported borrowing allocation of \u00a388.8m continues at the same level as previous years for the period of this budget. This supports authorities to borrow as part of their capital programmes to increase the level of investment over and above that provided by specific grants. The highways refurbishment grant of \u00a320m ended on 31 March 2022, this was a time limited grant introduced in the 2017 -18 supplementary budget and subsequently extended for 4 years. The general capital funding has also decreased in 2022 -23 by \u00a327.8m to enable the overall management of capital budgets and commitments across Welsh Government including specific grants to local government such as Sustainable Communities for Learning (formerly 21st century schools and colleges ). Capital programmes are managed ov er a multi -year period and funding increases again to \u00a3200m from 2023 -24. Recognising the priority which needs to be given to responding to the nature and climate emergency, consideration w ill be given to whether part of this increase should be directed specifically to address decarbonisation and support Net Zero Wales. This will be undertaken in discussion with Local Government as part of the ongoing programme of work overseen through the P artnership Council for Wales, the WLGA and the Decarbonisation Panel. 9 Annex EXTRACT FROM FINANCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAIN EXPENDITURE GROUP (MEG) RESOURCE BUDGET MEG BEL 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3000's Changes \u00a3000's New Plans Draft Budget 2022 -23 \u00a3000's Finance & Local Government Local Govt Gen Rev Funding 3,609,542 354,812 3,964,354 Police General Revenue Funding 88,350 23,985 112,335 Non Domestic Rates - Rates Relief 27,700 132,700 Local Govt PFI Revenue 8,434 Non Collection Costs 5,172 5,172 Emergency Financial Assistance 229,871 -229,870 1 Total Funding Support for Local Government Action 3,969,802 256,054 4,225,856 Valuation Office Agency Services 8,561 3,735 12,296 Valuation Tribunal for Wales 1,039 1,039 Local Taxation Research & Analysis 100 2,800 2,900 Council Tax Reduction Scheme 0 0 Total Valuation Services Action 9,700 6,535 16,235 Total Local Government Funding SPA 3,979,502 262,589 4,242,091 Local Democracy and Boundary Commission 598 598 Local Government Democracy 126 126 Election Policy 0 2,000 2,000 Total Building Local Democracy Action 724 2,000 2,724 Improvement & Support 1,550 1,550 Total Local Government Improvement 1,550 0 1,134 1,134 Total Academi Wales Action 1,134 0 1,134 Community and Town Councils 144 144 Public Services Boards 530 530 Total Supporting Collaboration & Reform Action 674 0 674 Total Improving Services, Collaboration & Democracy SPA 4,082 2,000 6,082 EXTRACT FROM FINANCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEG TOTAL RESOURCE BUDGET 3,983,584 264,589 4,248,173 10 EXTRACT FROM FINANCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAIN EXPENDITURE GROUP (MEG) CAPITAL BUDGET MEG BEL 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3000's Changes \u00a3000's New Plans Draft Budget 2022 -23 \u00a3000's Finance & Local Government Local Government General Capital Funding 197,837 -47,837 150,000 Total Local Government General Capital Funding Action 197,837 -47,837 150,000 Total Local Government General Capital Funding SPA 197,837 -47,837 150,000 EXTRACT FROM FINANCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEG TOTAL CAPITAL BUDGET 197,837 -47,837 150,000 1 Children, Young People and Education Committee Date: 13th January 2022 Venue: Senedd Cardiff Bay Title: Scrutiny of Health and Social Services Draft Budget 2022 -23 1.

These may include movements of 'one off' Covid response funding that was allocated during 21 -22. what proportion any changes to the overall amount previousl y allocated represent; As above, there have been no baseline budget reductions. where exactly this change is being made in the draft budget, and whether money will be returned to/taken from central reserves or allocated to/from other budget lines; and As above, there have been no baseline budget reductions information on the impact Covid -19 has had on allocations. We will continue to maintain our direct COVID response for as long as is necessary. We are setting aside funding to continue our national responses to the ongoing pandemic including the Test, Trace and Protect programme, the ongoing vaccination programmes, and the provision of free PPE to health and social care for as long as is required. This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic. We have provided a significant uplift to the NHS which will provide them with financial stability as they continue to respond. There is also a significant recurrent investment in recovery to enable the NHS to refocus on treating backlog when the impact of the pandemic allows. 3 Commentary on Action and BEL allocations in the H&SS MEG The tables below illustrate s the budget moves from the First Supplementary budget in 2021 -22 to the Draft Budget for 2022 -23 and 2023 -24 and captures the increase in funding for Childcare & Early Years of \u00a328m in 22 -23 and further increase of \u00a32m in 23 -24.

This funding supports Speech, Language & Communication for Early Years , including specialist SLT Services, Early Years Transformation and Adverse Childhood Experiences. The bulk of funding in the Supporting Children A ction supports the childcare offer (which is subject to scrutiny by the CYP&E Committee). This action also contains funding for the Looked after Children Transition Grant (LACTG) which provides funding for a number of initiatives which improve outcomes fo r looked after children so that all children in care have the same life chances as other children.

Allocation of the 'the maximum available resources' for children and young people Impact Assessment We have over recent years taken an integrated approach to impact assessments, which includes consideration of children's rights, reflecting their protected characteristics under the Equality Act, as well as taking into account the impact of decisions and policies on social, economic, cultural and environmental well -being, as set out within the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act , as well as sustainability and the Welsh Language. These conti nue to be an important driver s guiding our Budget considerations. We have continued to embed the WFG Act's five ways of working in our approach and the processes that support it. We believe that an integrated approach enables us to understand more clearly the overall impact of decisions on children and young people . Under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, we have given balanced consideration and due regard to the rig hts set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). 6 Our previous 2021 -22 Draft Budget, published on 21 December 2020, sets out the impacts of our spending decisions as part of the main narratives in chapters four and six, including highlighting spending decisions that directly impact on children and young people. This is complemented by the Strategic Integrated Impact Assessment at Annex C, outlining the contextual evidence that has supported our spending decisions, includi ng the impact of the pandemic on children and young people. Annex C also includes more -detailed case studies on the impacts of specific spending decisions, including one on our support for children and young people's mental health. Detailed impact assessm ents, including Children's Rights Impact Assessment (CRIA) are undertaken as part of our ongoing policy development and review. These assessments will continue to be used to inform budget decisions and the wider impact assessment of the budget. This approa ch, in the context of the budget allocations, ensures that evidence and understanding of impacts are considered from the outset and throughout the course of our budget preparations. Further details on the approach to assessing impacts will be publish ed in conjunction with the 2022 -23 Draft Budget on 20 th December. Information about how the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 has influenced allocations to budget lines within the MEG. The Health and Social Services (HSS) portfolio supports our ambitions to improve the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. In line with our Programme for Government, we are committed to delivering a m ore prosperous, more equal and greener Wales in line with the sustainable dev elopment principle. Our Well -being objectives are designed to support the wellbeing goals established under the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, addressing the extraordinary challenges we face. The Health and Social Services MEG contains the core rev enue and capital funding for NHS Wales, as well as funding to support centrally managed programmed activities in relation to public health, social care and supporting children. We have taken a long term approach in developing our spending plans under this budget, with an emphasis on delivering our vision of integrated health and social care services for the future as set out in A Healthier Wales, our Plan for Health and Social Care. We remain committed to ensuring all children in Wales have the best start in life, and are supported to achieve their full potential, and this is reflected in our allocations. This has never been more important than now as we seek to address the impacts of the pandemic on the social, emotional and cognitive development of child ren and young people. The vision we have established in A Healthier Wales is to place a greater focus on prevention and early intervention which we continue to support through universal, as well as more targeted support. This includes information, advice and support for parents through Parenting. Give it 7 Time which has been expanded to support parents of children aged 0 -18; ongoing support for speech, language and communication (SLC) through the Talk with me SLC plan and campaign; and further investment t o reduce or mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). As well as significant investment in the NHS we are allocating an additional \u00a328m for early years support for childcare and the early years in 2022 -23 and a further \u00a32m in 23 -24. Th is includes \u00a313.5m for the Childcare Offer, \u00a32m to take forward our work on Baby Bundles, \u00a33m to expand the Early Years Transformation programme building on what we know works from Flying Start and Families First and SLC support and \u00a37m to continue the imp ortant work of the Child Development Fund for a further year. Our support for childcare, play and the early years contributes to all of the well -being goals, and specifically to those relating to a prosperous and healthier Wales. Investment in quality childcare and play can help young children develop into healthy, active adults. It develops their cognitive and social and emotional wellbeing and mitigates the harmful effects of adverse childhood experiences. Childcare can also enable parents to work and t rain and lifts families out of poverty. Our Childcare Offer specifically supports the Welsh Government's well -being objectives, in particular to: Support people and businesses to drive prosperity Promote good health and well -being for everyone Support young people to make the most of their potential Build ambition and encourage learning for life We will continue to frame our budget allocations in line with preventative activities, making positive interventions that protect and build on existing foundat ions, including our commitment to children's rights. Policy and legislation allocations Draft Budget 2022 -23 Allocations to deliver all Programme for Government commitments relevant to children and young people and the CYPE Committee portfolio . Details of the assessment made of the value for money and affordability of delivering these priorities and objectives and how their cost -effectiveness will be monitored. Our four main PfG commitments supporting children and Young People are as follows: Fund childcare for more families where parents are in education and training. 8 Continue to support our flagship Flying Start programmes. Roll out baby bundles to more families. Prioritise investment in mental health. All of these commitments are highlighted as part of the wider narrative in this paper and all are benefitting from increased funding allocations as part of this Draft B udget. Either from the additional \u00a350m for Mental Health services in the HSS MEG, the \u00a35.5m for young people's mental health in the Education MEG or the additional \u00a350m for Childcare, Early Years, Flying Start and Families which forms part of the Draft budget settlements for the HSS MEG and Housing and Local Government MEG. These PfG commitments will all have extensive monitoring and evaluation arrangements in place , many in line with existing Welsh Government Grant monitoring arrang ements . Childcare and Flying start especially, are well established programmes with embedded monitoring and reporting mechanisms already in place. Each PfG commitment has a Deputy Director allocated to lead on its implementation and delivery. There will also regular reporting requirements against the full PfG programme. Costs of legislation: Implementation of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill in the run up to March 2022 and in its first year in force. In the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for the legislation, it was estimated t hat direct costs relating to implementation of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act (Children Wales Act) would amount to \u00a3985,000, comprising costs of the awareness -raising campaign, research to track awareness levels and attitudes towards physical punishment of children, and preparation for a diversion scheme. The amount set aside in the budget for implementation costs in 2021 -22 is \u00a31,585,000. The reasons for this increase in budgeted amount, compared to the RIA esti mate, are: Due to the pandemic our planned awareness raising campaign for 2020 -21 changed. This had important impacts including spending less than originally planned; a likely drop in public awareness levels; and engagement work continuing but at a reduce d level. We have therefore allocated an additional \u00a3225,000 for the awareness raising campaign in 2021 -22 financial year - increasing the total budget for that aspect of implementation from \u00a3800,000 to \u00a31,025,000 - to enhance the public awareness raising work and increase engagement with specific groups and communities where there may be barriers to accessing information. In addition, the estimated cost during 2021 -22 of development of a possible diversion scheme alongside an out of court disposal was up to \u00a3143,000. Welsh Ministers have confirmed that up to \u00a3500,000 has been allocated in 2021 -22 to allow local authorities to prepare for the parenting support which will be available alongside an out of court disposal, following the law change. While \u00a3500, 000 has been budgeted for this activity, on the basis of likely costs of preparing for introduction of the scheme, it is possible that 9 actual expenditure will be less than \u00a3500,000 depending on timescales for recruitment of additional skills parenting prac titioners and the scale of training undertaken. The costs of delivering parenting support are not reflected in the implementation costs outlined above. However, parenting support delivered through local authorities and their partners is a key element of t he implementation of the Children Wales Act. Welsh Government contributes funding for parenting support through its Families First and Flying Start programmes (discussed later in this paper) . The availability of parenting programmes and support has been reviewed through an implementation task and finish group (Parenting Expert Action Group) , and further work is being carried out to raise the profile of the parenting workforce and consider implementation of national standards f or the parenting workforce. The Parenting. Give it Time campaign continues to provide parenting information, advice and support u sing a dedicated website, digital advertising and social media channels. To support the implementation of the Children Wales Act, the website has be en reviewed and updated to support parents with children 0 - 18 years (previously, it covered the 0 - 7 age group). Resources to support managing children's behaviour have also been added or updated. Digital and TV and radio campaigns will run before commence ment of Children Wales Act, to signpost information and advice on positive ways to manage children's behaviour, alongside the ending physical punishment awareness raising campaign. \u00a3200,000 has been allocated to Parenting. Give it Time in 2021 -22, and we expect full spend of this. The Children Wales Act will be in force from 21 March 2022. The RIA anticipated expenditure of \u00a3300 ,000 on the ending physical punishment campaign in 2022 -23. We recognise that sustained awareness raising is important, alongside the law change, to help deliver the policy objective of reduced incidence of physical punishment of children, and an increase in support for the principle that all physical punishment of children is unacceptable. The budget allocation for the ending physical punishment campaign in 2022 -23 has therefore increased to \u00a3400,000. In addition, \u00a3400,000 has been allocated to the Parenting. Give it Time campaign to increase the capacity to communicate messages about positive parenting and positive alternatives to physical punishment. The RIA also anticipated that Welsh Government would work with partners to set up a diversion scheme, at a cost of betwee n \u00a3162,000 and \u00a3473,000 per annum. As discussed during scrutiny of the Bill in the Senedd, from 21 March 2022 the physical punishment of children is prohibited in Wales, and a small number of individuals may be charged or prosecuted in circumstances where that would not happen now. The police may decide an out of court disposal, where the focus is on rehabilitation and conditions are attached, is the right approach. Putt ing in place a diversion scheme would allow the police, in cases which they consider ap propriate, to offer an out of court disposal and refer into the scheme. We have worked closely with the police, local authorities and other key stakeholders to work up proposals for a scheme which would enable the police to refer individuals to local auth orities to offer tailored parenting support, as a condition of an out of court disposal. Up to \u00a3810,000 has been allocated to fund the parenting support which will be delivered by local authorities as part of the Out of Court Parenting Support diversion sc heme. 10 We will also continue to fund research to track awareness levels and attitudes to physical punishment during 2022 -23. Allocations across the Ministerial Portfolio as listed below and as relevant to children and young people and the CYPE Committee portfolio: Children's Health NHS Delivery and Performance Delivery and performance of children's services tends to be undertaken through specific policy leads where it is relevant to specific actions. Examples being: eye and hearing screening, childhood immunisation, children adolescent mental health (CAMHs). Welsh Health Specialist Service commissioners (WHSSC) commission and monitor specific specialist children's services. Routine elective care for children's is not specifically c aptured and reported nationally and tends to be reported within the total national data. Following a deep dive into children's service during COVID -19, we agreed the need to change the national data flow into Welsh Government to allow breakdown of waiting lists by age groups 0 -16, 16 -18 and 18 over. This will allow national data to monitor planned care recovery for children's as a sub set. Data from December 2021 will allow this additional breakdown at a national level. Welsh Government has been clear with each HB around their internal responsibility to monitor and report their local children's performance across each of their delivery areas. The new data sub -set to be used to monitor health board performance to track backlog removal in children's elective care this will be supported by the specialist data reported through WHSSC. Research and development in health and social care as relevant to children and young People Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) - the external brand of the collective programmes and initiatives funded and managed by HSS Research and Development Division (RDD) - has a remit to stimulate research excellence, build capacity and capability and support research delivery in transla tional and applied research health and care research in Wales. We have a particular focus on: the prevention, detection and diagnosis of disease and ill health; the development and evaluation of interventions; and the provision of health and social care s ervices. Supporting Welsh researchers to develop new research 11 As part of the Health and Care Research Wales research development infrastructure, RDD has made increased investments in children's research through research centres such as the CASCADE Partnership, DECIPHer and NCPHWR. The Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre Partnership (CASCADE - Partnership) undertakes research related to looked after children and issues affecting children in social care. It currently receives annual funding from RDD of \u00a30.515m. The Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for public health improvement (DECIPHer) undertakes research into healthy behav iours and the prevention of ill -health in children and young people, and runs the School Health Research Network (SHRN), an all -Wales. DECIPHer currently receives annual funding from RDD of \u00a30.526m. The National Centre for Population Health and Wellbeing Research (NCPHWR) has a specific work stream dedicated to early years research and supports the HAPPEN primary school network. It currently receives annual funding from RDD of \u00a30.651m, though this is split between work on children and early years and workforce related activity. RDD also administers a range of Health a nd Care Research Wales -branded open and competitive funding schemes (offering PhDs, Fellowships, project based funding and research time). The schemes, most of which have both health and social care arms, are aligned with Welsh Government policy priorities, with applications initially assessed on the basis of policy, practice and public need. All funding schemes are open to child he alth and care researchers. Our most recent assessment shows that since 2014/15, Health and Care Research Wales has invested \u00a33.7 million across 18 projects specifically related to children and young people's research (though these figures have almost certa inly increased). In order to stimulate paediatric research in Wales, Health and Care Research Wales fund Dr. Phillip Connor as a Wales-wide Research Specialty Lead for Children. Dr Connor's role is to champion paediatric research across the NHS, stimulat ing interest in uptake of research and bringing paediatric research studies to Wales. Support for delivering research across Wales On an annual basis, Health and Care Research Wales provides funding (approx. total \u00a315m) to NHS organisations to enable them to resource a research infrastructure (research nurses, pharmacists, radiologists, clinical research facilities etc.) to undertake clinical trials and other high quality research studies. A new funding model is in place to promote better collaboration between NHS organisations, maximising the value from resources and address challenges from undertaking 'small number' studies in areas such as paediatrics and novel therapies. Health and Care Research Wales recognise the challenges with undertaking research on children within clinical trials in complex NHS treatment setting to - within sensitive social care environments and have worked with the research community to ensure equa lity and diversity as well as noting children's rights are at the forefront of our policy development. Health and Care Research Wales has recently published the 'Discover your role in health and care research' document that outlines plans for further devel opment of public involvement and engagement in health and 12 social care research, and the implementation programme includes a focus on children and young people. Public health: Covid 19 response, screening and vaccination The costs of the regular Covid -19 lateral flow testing programme for schools and childcare are covered under the arrangements in place for the UK testing programme delivered by the UK health Security Agency (UKHSA) across all four nations. Implementation h as only been made possible by the hard work and flexibility of education and childcare workforces both within the settings and in the Local Authorities. The costs of providing symptomatic PCR testing for children and young people via our Regional and Lo cal Testing Sites are also p rovided under the UK Testing programme . A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Welsh Ministers and the Secretary of State for Health sets out the arrangements and services delivered u nder the UK testing programme. NHS Wal es lab oratories process some diagnostic tests required in secondary care and during outbreaks and these costs are included under the TTP budget and funding to PHW. The costs of the Covid -19 vaccine implementation programme are covered from the Covid response funding. The budget for 21 -22 was set at \u00a3100m. Successful delivery of the next phase of the programme will continue to require a flexible approach to respond to the increasing complexity of the vaccination cohorts. The NHS will need to respond promptly and effectively, as it has done throughout the pandemic, proving it has the agility and flexibility, as well as the highly skilled and experienced workforce necessary to continue to successfully deliver our vaccination program me. This will only be possible by continuing to work with our key stakeholders - local government, other public services, businesses, the voluntary sector and volunteers. This multi -agency effort is continuing and our scale of delivery is growing all the t ime so that we can protect more of our population every day. Whilst the future of the coronavirus pandemic is still very uncertain, we have set as ide funding in this budget for ongoing Covid interventions, specifically contact tracing, testing, mass vaccination and provision of PPE to the NHS and social care. This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic. We also anticipate that further conse quential funding will flow to Welsh Government in respect of additional testing funding for 2022/23. Immunisation programmes The national flu programme continues to be provided through health boards via core funding. Currently this includes a large set of cohorts of those prioritised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination & Immunisation ( JCVI ). For 2021 -22 extra cohorts were incl uded to aid the response to the pandemic. Secondary schools were i ncluded for 2021 -22 and currently have an uptake of over 57%. The cost of including the extra group was \u00a3 4m for 2021 -22. There is an 13 intention to continue vaccinating the expanded school age group in future years as a measure to reduce the transmission of flu. Funding for other childhood vaccinations (such as MMR and HPV) is located within health board core budgets. Childhood immunisation programmes continued as essential services during th e coronavirus pandemic, with appropriate assurance to parents and infection control measures put in place by practices. Monthly enhanced immunisation reports developed by the Vaccine Preventable Disease Programme in Public Health Wales were used to monitor the impact of COVID -19 on uptake of routine childhood immunisations across Wales. Data suggests that vaccination uptake in young children and infants has remained stable throughout the pandemic. Vaccination uptake rates on programmes given in secondary sc hool (such as HPV and MenACWY) have been most affected during the pandemic; priority will be given to catch -up programmes in 2022-23. Public Health: Health improvement and wellbeing services Healthy Weight : Healthy Wales A budget of \u00a36.63m will be allocated in 2022 -23 to support the Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy which is the Welsh Government's long term plan to prevent and reduce obesity across Wales. It sets out a 10 year plan to prioritise early intervention and behaviour change at all levels to change our habits and promote healthy activity. The strategy is a key commitment towards a cross -government approach to reducing obesity in Wales on a population scale. The strategy has been developed from evidence of what works. This has indicate d the need for a new approach which combines individual behaviour change with environmental and system change. It will utilise a combination of funding, policies and legislation to develop approaches through our environment, settings and leadership to plac e a strong focus upon prevention. It will also deploy targeted approaches in areas of deprivation and will assist those who are already overweight or obese through a range of prevention, early intervention and specialised services. A 2022 -2024 Delivery Pla n will be published in early 2022 which will set out a cross -government approach. Funding within the programme support s broader engagement across children and families, examples include: A Children and Families Pilot has been funded through the delivery plan and is taking place in three areas Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil and Anglesey. These pilot programmes will adopt a whole systems approach, which is drawing together practice and best evidenc e. A core part of this approach is the implementation of a secondary prevention Home Based Intervention for families of children in the early years from 3 - 7 years of age in line with the foundation phase. \u00a32.9 million per annum until 2023 -2024 in fundin g has been made available for health boards to develop their local adaptations of the All Wales Weight Management Pathway which will support the development and delivery of weight management services in Wales. For the first time there will be children and families specialist level 3 services delivered across Wales and the development of services and approaches based upon 14 early intervention at level 2, including specific approaches through maternity. The revised pathway will provide compassionate support in helping people on their weight management journey and will run alongside our Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy to encourage people to make healthier choices and lead more active lives. Ministers have agreed to the development of a new Welsh Daily Ac tive offer for schools. The offer will adopt an age specific whole school approach, underpinned by behaviour change and range of adaptable approaches, to complement the new curriculum. This will be responsive to evidence, provide flexibility and build in evaluation to assess health outcomes. This will also link with proposals to extend the school day. We have established roles for Healthy Weight Ambassadors across Wales. They are working with us be a champion for the Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy and inspire the delivery of its aims and objectives with partners across Wales, to listen, engage and promote the ethos and positive lifestyle messages of the strategy. This includes a youth Ambassador and a Family Ambassador who are broadening our engage ment across the strategy. Healthy Start Scheme The Healthy Start Scheme 's funding provides a nutritional safety net for our most vulnerable young families. Th e funding of \u00a36.9m in 2022 -23 includes Healthy Start Vouchers for pregnant women, new mothers and children under four from low income households to purchase fruit and vegetables, milk and infant formula plus free multi -vitamin supplement. The funding also includes supporting the Nurse ry Milk Scheme which provides a free drink of milk/infant formula for children under five in two or more hours of childcare. The Health y and Active Fund The Healthy and Activity Fund (HAF) is a 4 year programme with funding of \u00a31.00m in 2022 -23. HAF support s projects with the aim of improving mental and physical health by enabling healthy and active lifestyles . Several of the projects specifically seek to reduce inequalities in outcomes for children and young people. The coronavirus outbreak has com pounded existing health inequalities in Wales, and those groups particularly affected are the same key demographics targeted by the HAF. For example, research commissioned by Sport Wales during the national lockdown suggested that: 26% of children were do ing more physical activity 35% of children were doing less physical activity 9% of children doing no physical activity at all Children from lower socio -economic backgrounds appeared to be experiencing the greatest reductions, with those doing no physical activity at 14%. The HAF programme has funded projects supporting children and young people in intergenerational activities to improve mental and physical health, access to green -space physical activities, and a programme of play activity for children which strengthens the importance of play as central to a child's physical, mental, social and emot ional health and wellbeing. 15 Smoke -free Wales Smoking impacts on the lives of children and young people throughout their childhood, from pregnancy to adolescence. Supporting children and young people to have a smoke -free childhood is key part of our visio n for a smoke -free Wales. We are currently consulting on our new Tobacco Control Strategy for Wales and the first Delivery Plan which sets out the specific targeted actions that will help us to reduce the harms from tobacco in Wales. The draft strategy establishes our ambition for Wales to be smoke -free Wales by 2030 which means achieving a smoking prevalence rate in adults of 5% or less over the next eight years. We will be undertaking engagement activities to support the consultation and we will be workin g closely with key stakeholders to ensure children and young people in Wales have an opportunity to contribute to our consultation. Our experience in dealing with the COVID -19 pandemic has laid bare the costs of tolerating health inequalities in our commun ities in the disproportionate impact we have seen of the pandemic on the less well off in Wales. This experience has highlighted the importance of tackling the causes of these inequalities with renewed urgency and heightened ambition. As such, we are conti nuing our focus on prevention and early interve ntion. We have maintained the \u00a37.20m allocated for Prevention and Early Years funding and will be shifting its focus to ensure it is targeted towards the two leading causes of avoidable death in Wales: obesity and smoking. Using this funding, we will support projects across Local Health Boar ds which support s the rollout of inpatient smoking cessation support in all Local Health Boards and support a reduction in the number of people smoking in pregnancy and support cessation . Mental health services including perinatal mental health Prioritis ing mental health and well -being in 2022 -23 remains a priority and we are providing an additional \u00a350m to support this. Whilst this provision will primarily suppor t front line mental health services and also make a contribution towards the prevention of me ntal ill health in areas of primary public health prevention , substance misuse and employability related support, there are a much wider range of cross - government budgets needed to support our Programme for Government commitment to support the mental heal th and wellbeing of the nation. The impact of Covid has increased the challenges faced by mental health services to meet waiting time targets on a sustainable basis, with particular pressures on CAMHS services , eating disorder services and all -age psycholo gical therapies. The evidence suggests that an increase in referrals and / or complexity will remain for some time to come as we emerge from the pandemic . This will require increased investment and additional funding in future years to support mental healt h service improvements and the implementation of the Mental Health Workforce Plan currently being developed by HEIW and Social Care Wales ( SCW ). We will also continue to support the development of perinatal mental health community services to enable compliance of the Royal College of Psychiatrists perinatal community standards. We will also continue to work towards our commitment to ensur e that mother and baby unit provision is made available for mothers who live in North Wales. Funding will also be used to provide additional support to improve prevention and promotion of a 'no wrong door' approach to mental health support. 16 Suicide prevention Within the context of the total spending on Mental Health, we invest annually in mental health services and, in mental health service improvement, we will continue to specifically support the prevention of suicide and self -harm. We will continue to fund our National lead and regional coordinators along with other nationally supported projects (circa \u00a30.5m). The new allocation earmarked for mental health funding will support the continued development of crisis services including provision for children and young people. It will also support a number of new areas of spend that will focus on issues on suicide and se lf-harm, for example increasing support to voluntary organisations and crisis and out of hours services. It will also include implementing the recommendations from the NHS Delivery Unit's review of crisis and psychiatric liaison services and developing alt ernatives to admission for children and young people, for instance through extending sanctuary type provision. Autism and N eurodevelopmental conditions The introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice on the Delivery of Autism Services is a Welsh Government Programme for Government Commitment. A demand and capacity of all neurodevelopmental services is currently underway and will be completed by March 2022, this review will include recommendations for improvement including workforce development. \u00a3 5.73m is currently delivering the implementation of the statutory code, through supporting the National Autism Team, the Integrated Autism Service, and a demand and capacity review. F urther investment of \u00a35.185m will support future policy development and i mprovement in neurodevelopmental services, to include actions to address assessment and diagnostic waiting times and support and will seek to expand services to include conditions such as ADHD. Substance misuse as relevant to children and young people Support for children and families is a priority within our Substance Misuse Delivery Plan 2019 - 22. In particular, we know through the work on ACEs that children who are raised in homes where substance misuse is an issue are, potentially, more likely to ha ve adverse outcomes in later life. The Welsh Government is committed to ensuring that our services provide early intervention and prevention so that longer -term harms are prevented, before they occur. Children of those affected by ACEs are at increased r isk of exposing their own children to ACEs, creating a cycle of harm, which early intervention needs to focus on breaking. We have set clear actions to ensuring services are joined up and effective for families, in particular those who are \"on the edge of care\". The NSPCC have published data which shows a significant increase (72%) of referrals from their helpline in relation to parental substance misuse. New data by the children's charity reveals it made 572 referrals about this issue in the last 10 months to agencies in Wales - a monthly average of 58 referrals, which is 72% higher than pre -lockdown last year (6 January - 22 March 2020). 17 At an early stage in the pandemic we sought assurance from all Substance Misuse Area Planning Boards (APBs) that servi ces and support for children and families remained in place, and significant work is being undertaken across government to alleviate the impact of Covid -19 on children and young people. Through the APB Substance Misuse Action Fund the Welsh Government in vests \u00a32.75m ring fenced money for children and young people. Recongisnig the rise in demand for support, an additional \u00a31m has been earmarked within the Draft Budget to increase this allocation to \u00a33.75m in 2022 -23. In addition, there are plans to incre ase this amount to \u00a3 5.25m and \u00a3 6.25m in 2023 - 24 and 2024 -25 respectively. The Welsh Government also invests \u00a31.98m per annum in the Wales Police Schools Programme and match funding is provided by the four Welsh Police Forces. The programme delivers educa tion on substance misuse and wider community and personal safety issues at all key stages of the curriculum amongst a range of other lessons. Childhood obesity One of the Welsh Government's key priorities in Prosperity for All is to promote good health and well-being for everyone. We will support people to adopt healthy lifestyles, breaking down the barriers that ill -health place on employment and opportunity, an d tackling the generational cycle of poor health and inactivity. Funding is being used through the Children and families ' pilot programmes, the All Wales Weight Management Pathway and the W hole Systems Approach . These programmes focus on providing preventative measures in increasing physical activities and improving nutrition for children, young people and families. One initiative is the 2022 Eat Them to Defeat Them campaign in Wales. This advertising campaign aims to encourage children to perceive vegetables as fun to increase consumption. In 2022 -23 the aim is to increase the initiative to target all 1225 primary school s to reach an estimated 276,954 pupils. Further evaluation will b e consider ed in 2022 -23 to determine opportunities for further outreach across children and young people. (See section above on Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales Pages 13 & 14) Children's Social Care Safeguarding services Funding for Safeguarding primarily supports the implementation of the Social Services and Well - being (Wales) Act 2014 and promotes a preventative agenda to improve well -being outcomes for children and adults at risk, reflecting the need to adopt a child -centred approach built on collaborati on to meet the care and support needs of children, support them to stay with their families where it is safe to do so and to protect children from abuse and neglect. In order to promote these aims funding supports Safeguarding Policy Development and Implem entation across a range of areas including child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse, Reducing 18 Restrictive Practices , and c ontinued work to support Covid -19 recovery through information, advice and support for children and young people, parents/care rs, practitioners and the public. Safeguarding funding also supports the work of the National Independent Safeguarding Board , which provides support to the Regional Safeguarding Boards and advice to Ministers about the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements in Wales. Together, the operation of the regional and National boards secures that measures are in place to support co nsistent evidence -based practice to safeguard children ac ross agencies and across Wales. Advocacy services The National Approach to Statutory Advocacy (NASA) is a standardised approach to statutory advocacy services being delivered by the six Regional S ocial Services Collaboratives , reinforcing and securing a consistent offer and experience for children and practitioners . It has been in place since June 2017. The implement ation of NASA is monitored by Regional Fora which follows the footprint of the Regi onal Safeguarding Boards , oversee n by a National Forum chaired by Welsh Government and a Local Authority Head of Children's Services. The funding element from Welsh Government will continue (up to \u00a3550k each year). MEIC is the national information, advice and advocacy helpline providing children and young people with a single point of contact via Freephone, instant messaging and text. The Welsh Government does not deliver this activity directly but contracts with Pro -Mo Cymru. MEIC is currently funde d until March 2022 and a tendering process is underway for its replacement . Adoption services Investment will be directed towards local authorities and third sector organisations to continue to strengthen the provision of adoption services in Wales. Providing effective and tailored adoption support to adoptive families is paramount in supporting t he prevention of adoption disruptions and breakdowns, thus reducing the possibility of children re -entering the care system, as far as possible. Investment will also be directed at enhancing matching and placement processes to ensure children who cannot r eturn to live with birth families, are placed as soon as possible , with suitable 'permanent families' that meet their specific needs. Fostering services Funding will continue to be directed at supporting the fostering sector to deliver a programme of work which will empower the fostering community to improve well -being outcomes for looked after children and young people within the national well -being framework. Investment will also be directed to support the Programme for Government commitment to support the national fostering scheme in Wales - Foster Wales. Funding will be utilised to implement a number of recruitment campaigns which will be targeted to meet service needs, as well as further embedding the programme of work undertaken during 2021. The r ecruitment of foster carers is key to the success and development of local authority fostering and the brand will help local authorities in their drive to rebalance service provision and to improve on the quality of placement of choice for children in care . 19 Cafcass Cymru Cafcass Cymru is a demand -led operational service which delivers a statutory service to the Family Court in Wales on behalf of Welsh Ministers. The 2022 -23 budget allocation for Cafcass Cymru has increased to \u00a314.725m and covers staffing and running costs for the organisation but also grant funding to support separated parents, when directed by the Family Court, to have contact with their children. The budget also funds the provision of the court ordered Working Together for Ch ildren programme which supports parents who have separated, or are separating, to better manage their own behaviour to ensure the emotional, practical and physical needs and best interest of their children are paramount. Policy and oversight of the provi sion of all social service activities of Local Authorities in Wales Local Authority service provision continues to be monitored on a fortnightly basis via the Social Service Checkpoint. This provides data around the number of contacts, the number related to safeguarding, children receiving care and support, children looked after and care leavers facing hardship and accommodation issues. In addition to this, the Performance and Improvement Framework for social services data was published on 2nd December. This data provides an annual summary of the provision of services by Local Authorities. Youn g carers and young adult carers Both young carers and young adult carers will be able to b enefit from the \u00a31.245m of funding annually, which we are commit ting to support unpaid carers of all ages in 2022 -23. This will support delivery of actions in the Unpaid Carers Strategy for Wales and its associated Delivery Plan, which was launched on 25th November. This will be alongside funds in the Sustainable Social Services Third Sector grant scheme ( 2020 -23), and support via Regiona l Partnership boards and their funding streams . Using up to \u00a30.2m of the carers funding, we are working in coproduction with local authorities and Carers Trust Wales to roll out the n ational Young Carers ID card project. The voluntary ID card for young people up to age 18, is intended to provide a tool helping local authorities and their commissioned third sector providers support young carers in accessing their rights, including a carers' needs assessment , where appropriate. UN Convention on the Rights of the Child / Children's and young people's rights and entitlements The funding in 2022 -23 of \u00a31.020m support s Welsh Ministers' duties under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, which include: 20 the duty to have due regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) when exercising their functions; and to promote pubic understanding of the UNCRC. This funding enables us to fund Children in Wales to support article 12 of the UNCRC which provides children the right to have their say in matters that affect them, and to have their opinions taken into account. As set out in the Children's Rights Scheme 2021 a ll Ministers will meet with young people every year - highlighting the value we place o n hearing the voice of children and young people. This funding will also enable Ministers to deliver the Raising Awareness of Children's Rights Plan. This supports Article 42 of the UNCRC states that Governments must actively work to make sure children an d adults know about the Convention. Early years, childcare and play, including the Childcare offer and workforce The Childcare Offer for Wales revenue budget in 2022 -23 has an additional \u00a310m added to the baseline figure to reach \u00a385m, based on the very latest projections for estimated take -up rates, and a rate rise indicate the Offer. In addition, the funding for the expansion to Parents in Education and Training will cost \u00a39m by 2024 -25. This commitment recognises the value of education and trainin g in supporting parents to improve their employment prospects. Initial findings from the latest evaluation report indicate that the Offer continues to have a positive impact , helping parents financially and enabling them to balance the demands of work and family life . ESF funding will come to an end in 2023 but the need to support the workforce to upskill will continue, particularly given the expansion of government funded chi ldcare to all 2 year olds planned for this Assembly Term. A replacement scheme will need to be developed to provide the same level of support to the sector during this period of growth. The indicative allocation of \u00a32m for 2023 -24 and for 2024 -25 reflect this continuing need and the end of ESF funds . The CWLWM consortium comprises five organisations representing different parts of the childcare and play sector in Wales. Along with Play Wales , they are key partner s in terms of delivery of Welsh Government priorities and provide invaluable support to their members and non-members in the form of guidance, training and information on all matters relating to play, national standards for regulated childcare, registration and regulation and sustainability/setting management. Both have budgetary increases to reflect their continuing importance and that core funding has not increased in five years. Following a successful pilot, the Programme for Government includes a commit ment to roll out of the baby bundle to more families in Wales. This project aims to provide a universal gift from the Welsh Government to expectant parents living in Wales of a bundle of key items for their new born baby. The new budget is \u00a32m in 2022 -23, and \u00a36m annually thereafter. 21 Early Years Integration Transformation Programme The Early Years Integration Transformation Programme is focussed on developing a more joined -up, responsive early years system that puts the unique needs of each child at its heart, which covers the period of life from pre -birth to the end of the Foundation Phase (0 -7). We have been working with PSBs across Wales to explore how to deliver early years services in a more systematic way, applying the lessons from our existin g programmes such as Flying Start and Families First. The majority of the PSBs are now engaged in the programme as pathfinders . We are investing \u00a36m in 2022 -23 and 2023 -24 to support PSBs across all Health Board regions in Wales, as they test the core c omponents for an early years system and pilot different multi -agency delivery models and approaches, building on what works well in existing programmes such as Flying Start and Families First. Early Childhood Education and Care Our Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) vision for Wales means removing the artificial divide between education and care settings, ensuring all settings which deliver ECEC contribute to a child's wellbeing and development on an e qual basis - one single system with the c hild at the heart. This means looking at the quality of the provision, how we can ensure as many children as possible can access high quality provision and what we need to do to support our workforce. The Welsh Government is embarking upon a ten year journ ey to adopt an Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) approach in Wales for children aged 0 -5. Child Development Fund The Child Develop ment Fund was established in response to the impact of the covid pandemic on some of our youngest children. Funding of \u00a37m will be allocated in 2022 -23 to LAs in Wales to provide additional support to children and families impacted by the pandemic to address concerns around developmental delay, in areas such as speech, language and communication, fine and gross motor skills and personal and social developmen t. Early Help The funding of \u00a37m for Early Help is incorporated within the Children and Communities Grant . It is provided to enable local authorities to continue to drive down waiting lists for early help and support services and provide support as early as possible, to help address the adverse effects of the pandemic on children and young people aged 0 -25, including those who are newly vulnerable. 22 We have provided an additional \u00a340m revenue up to 2024 -25 via the Children and Communities Grant (CCG) for early help and support including for Families First and Flying Start, recognising the importance of su pporting more children and families across Wales. Flying Start for children 0 -3 Flying Start is a Programme for Government (PfG) Commitment. The Flying Start programme was developed based on evidence of 'what works' in providing children with the best start in life. There are four core components including funded, part -time, high quality childcare, enhanced health visiting, parenting support an d speech, language and communication support. It is this combination of integrated support which is critical to its positive impact. We are continuing to invest in our flagship Flying Start programme which reaches around 36,000 children under four living in some of the most deprived areas across Wales. The evidence shows it is making a difference to those children who access the programme. Funding for Flying Start forms part of the Children and Communities Grant (CCG). We have provided an additional \u00a340 m revenue up to 2024 -25 for early help and support including for Flying Start, recognising the importance of supporting more children and families across Wales and to ensure we support our youngest children to have the best start in life. Families First Families First provides early intervention and prevention services to families across Wales that need additional su pport , often through advice or more intensive support on parenting. The programme supports some of our most vulnerable children and families. It works to improve outcomes so that every child gets the best possible start in life. Families First provides coherent, multi -agency packages of support which can have a transformative effect on families' live s. The evidence shows that it is building stronger, more resilient families, providing families with effective support which can have a transformative effect on families' lives. The support helps to prevent families needing far more intensive and expensi ve support and needing to be taken into care. Funding for Families First forms part of the Children and Communities Grant (CCG). We have provided an additional \u00a340m revenue up to 2024 -25 for early help and support including for Families First recognising the importance of supporting more children and families across Wales. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Wales is a world -leader in its approach to preventing and mitigating ACEs with the research from P ublic Health Wales instrumental in guiding the direction of policy and delivery in this area. The work to raise ACE awareness is already demonstrating an impact across a range o f public services . These include: improved attendance rates in schools, reduced number of pupils 23 expelled, reduced calls to emergency services and a reduction in tenants evicted in housing services. The impact of this work has been recognised by Estyn and incorporated into its inspection framework. Preventing and mitigating the impact of ACEs is also key to reducing the number of children becoming looked after. The \u00a31m budget on ACEs is split betwee n: the ACE Support Hub who provide expert advice, information and support to a range of public services to help them become more ACE aware and trauma -informed; and programme delivery on the ground, including community based provision to prevent and mitigate the impact of ACEs . Funding of \u00a31m p.a. for this Spending period will continue to support work that prevents and mitigates ACEs, including work led by the ACE Support Hub. Important projects in this area include the development and implementation of the new Welsh Government ACEs plan and trauma informed knowledge and skills framework. Impact of COVID -19 Pandemic on Draft Budget 2022 -23 allocations Information on the impact of the pandemic on the Health and Social Services MEG in both 2021 -22 and 2022 -23, including movements in and out of budget lines, the gross contribution to -and receipt from - the Welsh Government's COVID -19 budgetary response, as well as the net effect of this. This budget covers a three period from 22 -23 to 24 -25. The settlement is front loaded with a much larger increase in 2022 -23 and lower relative uplifts in the second and third years. There are no specific Covid allocations but MEG settlements have been assessed through the budget setting process with agre ement to prioritise delivery of the Programme for Government, funding for health, social care and local authorities; and to undertake a zero based review of capital to align capital budgets to the new Wales Infrastructure Investment Strategy (WIIS). The H SS MEG will increase from a revenue baseline of \u00a38.597 billion up to \u00a310.05 billion by 2024 -25. The HSS MEG settlement for provides for an increase in baseline NHS revenue budgets in 2022 -23 of \u00a3824m, with further increases of \u00a3250m and \u00a3200m in 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 respectively. In addition to the \u00a3824m NHS funding uplift allocated for 22 -23, the HSS MEG settlement also includes specific allocations for: Mental health \u00a350m, increasing to \u00a390m by 24 -25 Social care \u00a345m, increasing to \u00a360m by 24 -25 and; Childcare and early years \u00a328m, increasing to \u00a330m by 24 -25. 24 The core investment in the NHS will increase by an additional \u00a31.274bn in this budget, taking our total baseline investment in 2024 -25 to \u00a39.683bn. This significant increase will provide the foundation for the NHS in its ongoing response to the pandemic and to support addressing the legacy on health and wellbeing. Recurrent revenue funding of \u00a3190m for NHS recovery has been committed, including \u00a320m a year to support the implementation of a v alue-based approach to recovery over the medium term, with a focus on improving outcomes that matter to patients. We will also allocate \u00a3180m recurrently from 2022 -23 onwards to help the NHS manage the financial impact of the pandemic on their underlying financial position, including recognising the impact the pandemic has had on productivity and efficiency. We expect the NHS to return to pre-pandemic efficiency levels as the impact of COVID on core services eases. Whilst the future of the coronavirus pa ndemic is still very uncertain, we have set aside funding in this budget for ongoing Covid interventions, specifically contact tracing, testing, mass vaccination and provision of PPE to the NHS and social care. This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic. In 21 -22, the HSS MEG was allocated \u00a31.157 billion of additional Covid response and recovery funding. This covered a range of areas from direct NHS and social care response to NHS recovery and additiona l support for Children and Families. Information on the availability and use of the COVID Local Government Hardship Fund for children and young people The local government hardship fund has been used to support the full range of services during the Covid pandemic. The children's social services area was supported in 2020 -21 with \u00a316.3m for additional costs and \u00a32.3m for loss of income. In 2021 -22 the area has been supported to date with \u00a38.4m for additional costs and \u00a30.6m for loss of income.

Details of all transfers are shown in Annex A to this paper. 2 4. Approach to Budget proposals The Health and Social Services MEG contains the core revenue and capital funding for NHS Wales, as well as funding to support public health, social care and supporting children. It supports our wellbeing objectives to provide effective, high quality and sustainable healthcare, and to protect, re -build and develop our services for vulnerable people. It a lso support the ongoing implementation of A Healthier Wales, our long term plan for health and social care. This budget covers a three period from 22 -23 to 24 -25. The settlement is front loaded with a much larger increase in 2022 -23 and lower relative up lifts in the second and third years . There are no specific Covid allocations but MEG settlements have been assessed through the budget setting process with agreement to prioritise delivery of the Prog ramme for Government, funding for health, social care a nd local authorities; and to undertake a zero based review of capital to align capital budgets to the new Wales Infrastructure Investment Strategy (WIIS). The HSS MEG will increase from a revenue baseline of \u00a38.597 billion up to \u00a310.05 billion by 2024 -25. The HSS MEG settlement for provides for an increase in baseline NHS revenue budgets in 2022 -23 of \u00a3824m, with further increases of \u00a3250m and \u00a3200m in 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 respectively. In addition to the \u00a3824m NHS funding uplift allocated for 22 -23, the HSS MEG settlement also includes specific allocations for: Mental health \u00a350m, increasing to \u00a390m by 24 -25 Social care \u00a345m, increasing to \u00a360m by 24 -25 and; Childcare and early years \u00a328m, increasing to \u00a330m by 24 -25. (See below for further information on these areas) The core investment in the NHS will increase by an additional \u00a31.274 bn in this budget, taking our total baseline inves tment in 2024 -25 to \u00a39.683bn. This significant increase will provide the foundation for the NHS in its ongoing response to the pandemic and to support addressing the legacy on health and wellbeing. Recurrent revenue funding of \u00a3150m for NHS recovery has already been committed fro m the NHS funding increase; this combined with \u00a320m from baseline budgets will make up \u00a3170m per annum for recovery through this budget period . This funding will be allocated to the NHS to support the implementation of plans to strengthen planned care services. To demonstrate our further commitment to addressing the impact of the pandemic on routine care, we will be investing a further \u00a320m a year to support the implementation of a value -based approach to recovery over the medium term, with a focus on improvin g outcomes that matter to patients. This allocation will support NHS recovery, with a focus on delivery of high value interventions that ensure improved outcomes for patients and support service sustainability and reducing waits for treatment over the me dium term. This investment will give greater focus on 3 delivery of outcomes that matter for patients and will complement the implementation of plans currently being developed to tackle the immediate backlog of patients waiting for treatment. Taken together , these investment s ensure we are on course to deliver against our commitment to invest \u00a31bn for NHS recovery over the course of this Senedd. We will also allocate \u00a3180m recurrently from 2022 -23 onwards to help the NHS manage the financial impact of the pandemic on their underlying financial position, including recognising the impact the pandemic has had on productivity and efficiency. We expect the NHS to return to pre-pandemic efficiency levels as the impact of COVID on core services eases. Whilst the future of the coronavirus pandemic is still very uncertain, w e have set as ide funding in this budget for ongoing Covid interventions, specifically contact tracing, testing, mass vaccination and provision of PPE to the NHS and social care. This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic . There will be a \u00a331m increase in funding to support the Education and Training commissioning plan, investing in the future workforce of NHS Wales . We will also continue to provide \u00a37m towards meeting our commitment to establish a new medical school in North Wales. We are also investing a total of over \u00a3800m general capital for Digital Infrastructure, NHS Equipment, and NHS Infrastructure up to 2024 -25. Programme for Government The Programme for Government (PfG) has underpinned our approach to budget setting, with significant budget allocations for some of our k ey commitments on NHS recovery , Mental Health support , Childcare, Social Care and the Real Living Wage for social care workers . NHS Recovery The NHS recovery programme started this year with an alloca tion of \u00a3200m of revenue and \u00a348m of capital in 21 -22. In addition to this there was an early commitment of recurrent revenue funding of \u00a3150m for recovery which has already been committed from the NHS funding increase. This was added to \u00a320m from baseline budgets making a recurrent total of \u00a3170m per annum for recovery of planned care. This investment will be complimented by a further \u00a320m recurrently from 2022 -23 to support NHS recovery, with a focus on delivery of high value interventions that ensure im proved outcomes for patients and support service sustainability and reducing waits for treatment over the medium term. When these are all combined this will mean a total of \u00a3818m will have been allocated towards NHS recovery over 4 of the 5 years of the current government. Mental Health We will continue to prioritise mental health and well -being in 2022 -23 and we are providing an additional \u00a350m to support this. Whilst this provision will primarily suppor t front line mental health services and also make a contribution towards the prevention of mental ill health in areas 4 of primary public health prevention , substance misuse and employability related support, there are a much wider range of cross - government budgets needed to support our Programme for Gover nment commitment to support the mental health and wellbeing of the nation. Childcare and Early Years Within the HSS MEG allocation there is additional funding for Childcare and Early Years of \u00a328m in 22 -23, rising to \u00a330m recurrently from 23 -24 onwards. T his is part of a package of funding for Children & Families which also encompasses Flying Start and Families First in the Housing & Local Government MEG. In total across the two MEGs, there is \u00a350m of additional funding in 22 -23, rising to \u00a370m by 24 -25. In the HSS MEG the additional \u00a328m in 22 -23 will be allocated to support our P rogramme for Government commitment on Early Years and Childcare , which includes supporting more families with the costs of childcare where parents are in education and training, and to increasing early year's provision to include all two year olds, with a particular emphasis on strengthening Welsh medium provision. Alongside the impacts on early years , we have also recognised the disproportionate effect on gender particularly link ed to childcare. Our Childcare Offer already provides 30 hours of funded education and childcare to working parents of 3 and 4 year olds for 48 weeks a year. Social Care - Reform Fund A new Social Care Reform fund of \u00a345m has been created. The Social Care Reform Fund will rise to \u00a355m in 2023 -24 and \u00a360m in 2024 -25 and will increase the funding available to promote reform and improvement in social care, to complement the uplift provi ded in the Local Government settlement . We will use this funding to suppor t the reform set out following our 'Rebalancing Care and Support ' White Paper , to improve delivery and increase the sustainability of services across the social care sector. The funding will be used to help deliver the Programme for Government commitments to reform social care for looked after children and to protect, re -build and develop our services for vulnerable people The Real Living Wage for Social Workers One of our key pledges in the Programme for Government was to pay social care workers the Real Living Wage. We are now taking the necessary steps to ma ke that happen. Social care providers still face considerable challenges in both recruiting and retaining people with the skills needed to u ndertake these important roles. Improving the terms and co nditions of the workforce is an important step towards impro ving recruitment and retention. The uplift will be for registered social care workers in adults and children's services. That is, domiciliary care workers and social care workers in care homes. We intend that it will also reach personal assistants funded through direct payments. We hav e provided funding, through the local government s ettlement and through the HSS MEG budget to enable local authorities and health board commissioners to commence 5 implementation of a Real Living Wage uplift. The funding will be available from April 2022 with workers beginning to feel the benefit in the following months. In the New Year, we will be working closely with partners including local authority commissioners, complex care leads and others to work through all of those details about how the commitmen t will be implemented. Well-being of future generations Prioritise prevention/early intervention in Health and Social Care Our focus in this budget is to protect the Welsh population by continuing to invest in our core NHS services for the long term. We are also continuing and increasing our investment in sustainable social services. Ensuring the long term stability of our health and care services is our priority for preventative investment in this budget. The NHS Planning Framework, which is also the Minister's Direction to the NHS, always seeks to align with the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act and to continue to strengthen how organisations work to deliver their plans using the five ways of working. Since the beginning of the pandemic there has be en a strong focus on four harms that have been the key quality context within which services and care must be provided. In June 2021, on the advice of the Technical Advisory Cell, a fifth harm was also recognised - the introduction or exacerbation of new o r existing inequalities, either directly or indirectly from COVID -19. All harms are relevant to the well -being of future generations but the need to prevent harm \"from wider societal actions/lockdown\" together with the new fifth harm relating to inequalit ies, provide a broader and longer term context to planning and investment in health and social care. The NHS Planning Framework sets an expectation of a broad approach to prevention to be applied in all aspects of planning. This is supported by Welsh Government policy that is set out from a perspective of prevention, whether that is a more traditional public health perspective or in unscheduled care or planned care. Health Board Integrated Medium Term Plans, for example, also consider prevention in te rms of models of care and decarbonisation including active travel schemes. Harm from 6 Preventative approaches to all physical and mental health and wellbeing will ultimately avoid escalation of conditions and illness. Opportunities for investment must be considered t hat will support future generations and inform future service provision. We have sadly learned throughout this public health crisis that those with underlying conditions have suffered disproportionately. Learning from COVID should provide foundations for the implementation of preventative initiatives that can make an impact on reducing all five harms. Our aim is to take significant steps to shift our approach from treatment to prevention. The vision we have established in A Healthier Wales is to place a greater focus on prevention and early intervention. Capital The overall NHS capital budget for 2022 -23 will decrease by \u00a348m to \u00a3335m from the \u00a3383m provided in 2021 -22. It is important to note that this reduced figure for 2022 -23 include s \u00a350m identified for Social Care which has not previously received capital funding through this budget. As a result, the NHS specific capital budget has reduced by \u00a398m against the 2021 -22 position - a 26% reduction. The capital funding available will c ontinue to be invested in infrastructure to support the delivery of sustainable and accessible high quality services and to take forward the transformation of healthcare provision. The new \u00a350 m capital fund for social care will support delivery of key programme for government commitments to include the development of 50 local community hubs and the strengthening of arrangements to support the integration of health and social care and rebalance the residential care estate. This s ocial care capital allocation will enable the Welsh Government to directly influence the transformation of social care infrastructure in line with aspirations of the Social Services & Wellbeing (Wales ) Act and 'A Healthier Wales'. NHS c apital investment next year will include the on -going redevelopment and modernisation works at Prince Charles Hospital along with the continued investment in primary and community care schemes across Wales to develop a new generation of integrated health and care centres. The reduced capital allocation will restrict the opportunities available to the NHS around decarbonisation but , where possible, these will be incorporated into scheme designs so we will continue to make progress against the net zero target. Schemes that c an deliver significant carbon reductions will be targeted through joint working with the Welsh Government Energy Service and the Carbon Trust. 7 Annex: request for information from the Welsh Government to inform scrutiny of the Draft Budget 2022 -23 Commentary on actions and detail of Budget Expenditure Line (BEL) allocations. 1. A breakdown of the 2022 -23 Health and Social Services MEG allocations by Spending Programme Area, Action and Budget Expenditure Line (BEL). 2. Indicative 2022 -23 Health and Soc ial Services MEG allocations. 3. Commentary on each of the Actions within the Health and Social Services MEG, including an analysis and explanation of changes between the Draft Budget 2022 -23 and the First Supplementary Budget 2021 -22 (June 2021). 4. It woul d be of assistance if the analysis could highlight what, if any, changes are additional resources specifically for the response to COVID in 2021 -22 (consequential and guaranteed funding from the UK Government). See attached annex which covers the request s above. Local health boards' financial performance 5. Please provide an update on the overall financial performance of health boards. This should include: a. Those that have continued to fail to meet their financial duties. b. Those that have been in receipt of additional end of year and in -year financial support. c. Details of how the Welsh Government is supporting and working with those health boards to both address short -term challenges, improve their underlying position, and secure sustained improvem ent. With the exception of Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay Health Boards, all other NHS organisations broke even at the end of the 2020 -21 financial year. The net outturn for NHS Wales in 2020 -21 was a deficit of \u00a348m, an improvement from the deficit of \u00a389m r eported at the end of 2019 -20. The improvement is due to the fact that Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board broke even for the first time in several years following the package of structural support announced by the former Minister for Health and Social Services i n November 2020. Four Health Boards failed to meet their statutory duty to break even over three years at the end of 2020 -21. In addition to Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay, Cardiff and Vale Health Board failed the duty due to their deficit in 2018 -19. Providing they deliver the ir forecast break even outturn at the end of this current financial year, they will have achieved their three year break even duty at the end of 2021 -22. Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board is also forecast to break even in 2021 -22, but will again fail their thre e year duty at the end of this financial year due to the deficit they incurred in 2019 -20. 8 Welsh Government provided Hywel Dda Health Board with \u00a316m strategic cash support in 2020 -21 to finance their deficit. In line with the announcement by the former Minister for Health and Social Services in July 2020, this support is not repayable. The objective during the last two financial years has been to ensure that NHS organisations have the funding they need to respond to the Covid -19 pandemic, and therefore to ensure financial stability is maintained or improved. Welsh Government provided an additional \u00a31.1bn revenue funding to the NHS in 2020 -21, and have allocated a further \u00a31.1bn in 2021 - 22. This has enabled all organisations to maintain or improve on the financial positions for 2019 -20 before the impact of the pandemic. With the exception on Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay, all organisations are forecast to break even again at the end of this financial year. Welsh Government is providing a range of support to all NHS organisations to manage the short term challenges as well as focusing on medium and long term financial sustainability. These include: Support from the NHS Finance Delivery Unit (FDU) , we continue to develop and improve our financial planning and monitoring mechanisms. This includes providing clear and consistent planning assumptions, monthly monitoring, and mid -year reviews to confirm forecast positions. Monthly peer forums for NHS Directo rs of Finance, Welsh Government officials and the Finance Delivery Unit to keep appraised and manage emerging risks and issues The production and development of system level insight on opportunities to improve resource utilisation, whilst recognising some of the constraints of the pandemic in the ability to translate these opportunities into realisable savings in the last couple of years. We expect organisations going forward to maintain or improve on their forecast savings delivery for the current financia l year, and we intend to extend the national supporting mechanisms to assist with the delivery of that expectation. Where necessary, the Finance Delivery Unit provides targeted support for individual organisations in higher levels of escalation. A Value F inance Leadership Group has been established, led by the Finance Delivery Unit and attended by all Health Board Finance Directors. This Group is providing a collective leadership to embed a value -based health care approach in the development and implementa tion of plans, with a focus on improving outcomes for patients with sustainable use of resources. We are due to receive NHS plans covering 2022 -23 to 2024 -25 by the end of February 2022. Our package of financial support for the NHS outlined in this budget , and conf irmed in the revenue allocation, provides financial stability for the NHS as well as providing support for NHS recovery and other Programme for Government commitments. As a consequence, we expect organisations to develop a pprovable financial sustainable medium term plans. 6. Please indicate the level of health reserves allocated within the Draft Budget, and how you anticipate the reserves being used. 9 We have not allocated health reserves within this budget. All funding will be deployed to deliver NHS financial stability, meet the ongoing costs of responding to the pandemic, and support delivery of Programme for Government commitments. We are holding funding centrally within the Health and Social Services MEG to support the ongoing planning deficits within Hywel Dda and Swansea Bay into 2022 -23. 7. Please outline your expectations for how health boards should seek to reduce their fixed costs, and what guidance the Welsh Government is providing to assist with this. As outlined above, we expect NHS organisations to plan to deliver cash -releasing efficiency savings year on year. Organisations are currently forecasting that they will deliver over \u00a3100m savings - equating to around 1.5% - in 2021 -22, despite the ongoing impa ct of the pandemic. We expect organisations to plan to deliver this level as a minimum in 2022 -23 and going forward. The Finance Delivery Unit have developed a toolkit for organisations to benchmark their costs and outputs across a wide range of service areas. They are working with Finance Directors to ensure this information is used proactively in the development of sav ings plans to underpin their medium term financial plans. In addition, organisations are being encouraged to identify ambitious decarbonisation opportunities linked to all capital schemes. These schemes are looking at how both carbon and financial savings can be maximised. The impact of COVID -19 on allocations 8. Please explain how the pandemic has influenced allocations to budget lines within the Health and Social Services MEG, and provide examples of any changes made to allocations as a result of COVI D-19. In answering this question, please address: a. The assumptions underpinning allocations made as a result of the pandemic. b. Allocations that have been made to support additional service capacity or additional staff resource as the response to the pandemic continues, including primary, community and hospital services, social care, public health, and the vaccine programme. As stated above, we will continue to maintain our direct COVID respon se for as long as is necessary. We are setting aside significant funding to continue our national resp onses to the ongoing pandemic including the Test, Trace and Protect programme, the ong oing vaccination programmes, and the provision of free PPE to health and social care for as long as is required. This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic. We have provided a significant uplift to the NHS which will provide them with financial stability as they continue to respond . There is also a significant recurrent investment in recovery to enable the NHS to refocus on treating backlog when the impact of the pandemic allows. 10 c. Allocations for mental health support services for the health and social care workforce. In April 2020 we expanded the Health for Health for Professionals Wales Service. Staff experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, alcohol -use disorder, post -traumatic stress disor der and other conditions can benefit from the service provided. I n its original form , this service was only provided to NHS doctors , but in April 2020 it was expanded in response to Covid -19, to cover the w hole of the NHS workforce. Further contract develo pments mean that the service will be extended even further in to the social care sector for 2022 to 2025 an d will be provided with \u00a34.5m of funding for that period. The pandemic has had a significant impact on workplaces and the workforce in Wales. As the pandemic continues, a key priority is to offer support, to anyone in need, for their short and longer -term physical and mental wellbeing. The Healthy Working Wales programme provides universal support including specific Mental Health and Wellbeing across a ll of the public and private sector. The programme has recently updated and strengthened advice and information in the context of the pandemic and in response to insight from the literature that outlines the significant impacts the pandemic is having on me ntal wellbeing. Healthy Working Wales has also developed a mental wellbeing podcast for employers, to help address the key challenges and sets out how employers can best support the mental wellbeing needs of their wor kforce. The programme is allocated \u00a32.3m funding for 2020 to 2023. d. Allocations that have been made to ensure the maintenance of an adequate and appropriate supply of PPE. The supply and distribution of high quality Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to frontline health and social care workers continues to be a critical part of the global response to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and we will continue to secure sufficient PPE to meet our needs. In our Programme for Government , we have committed to provide free PPE for health and social care staff , for as long as is needed to deal with the pandemic . This, along with the maintenance of a usable contingency stockpile (currently 16 weeks based on the highest issue rate during the pandemic) will help to ensure Wales is fully resilience against future COVID -19 surges and/or future pandemics. The future costs associated with this commitment are difficult to pred ict with strong dependencies on the course of the pandemic, evolving I nfection, Prevention & Control (IPC) guidance as well as Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) advice on future pandemic preparedness . We are setting aside funding to continue our national responses to the ongoing pandemic including the provision of free PPE . This funding will be kept under review as we work through the current challenges of the pandemic. 11 Addressing the waiting times backlog 9. Please provide details of how the Draft Budget will support the delivery of more routine care, and contribute to addressing the waiting times backlog. This should include how any consequential and guaranteed funding from t he UK Government will be used. As stated above, we have a llocated \u00a3170m of revenue funding recurrently from 22 -23 as well as \u00a320m focussed on high value interventions. When combined with the allocations in 21 -22, this will mean a total of \u00a381 8m will have been allocated towards NHS recovery over 4 of the 5 years of the current government. Our aim is to focus on rapid, clear and targeted work, firstly to stabilise the current volume increase and then to treat the number of patients waiting for review, assessment and treatment. This will involve: Service transforma tion, to deliver now and sustainably for the future based on prudent and value -based principles including the development of regional hubs NHS activity levels to return to and then exceed pre -pandemic levels Workforce availability and expertise to be maxi mised and strengthened Treatment and diagnostic capacity to be developed at both local and regional level, including altering, repurposing and adding infrastructure The ability to work with other providers to enable more rapid access to facilities and in some cases staff. Integrated workforce plans that maximises recruitment opportunities (domestic and overseas), innovative ways of developing and extending existing workforce, whilst supporting wellbeing. Increased commissioning and capital. The \u00a3248 million allocated in 2021 -22 (\u00a3200m revenue and \u00a348 m capital) is aimed at helping health boards reduce the backlog of patients waiting that has built up due to the pandemic. Health boards have been working to reduce the backlog by using alternative provi ders, either through outsourcing to independent providers, or by using insourcing companies to carry out the work locally. Health boards have also used their own staff in local independent facilities, as these are safe green pathways for services and hire d mobile units that have been used to carry out a number of day case procedures. Some of these actions in 21 -22 have been short term , and we know they have not been sufficient to replace th e capacity lost due to COVID -19. With the confirmation of the recu rrent recovery funding Health Boards can now plan effectively for the medium and longer term. Over the last 18 months, a number of transformational actions have been put in place, with more outpatient appointments being carried out virtually and group ses sions being held to help reduce waiting lists . The scale and scope of these changes however will need to increase to support value based and sustainable planned care service for the future. 12 In October 2021 , we confirmed the recurrent allocation of \u00a3 170m, split across health boards to support planned care recovery, with details to be articulated in their 2022 -25 Integrated Medium Term Plans (IMTP's) due in February 2022 . The specific areas of focus for the plans, which the allocation should support are: Implementation of the recommendations of the National Endoscopy Programme Regional c ataract services in line with advice from the Planned Care programme. Regional plans for aspects of orthopaedic services based on the clinical strategy work current ly underway and due to report in February 2022. Strengthened Diagnostic and Imaging services based on advice commissioned from the National Imaging Programme. Implementation of the Critical Care Plan developed by the Critical Care Network. Plans for imp roving cancer and stroke services The aim is to not only support recovery of planned care services (remove the bac klog), but also to build sustainable models of delivery for the future . Health and social care workforce 10. Please explain how the Draft Budget will contribute to the delivery of a sustainable health and social care workforce, and will reduce and control spend on agency staff. The success of the NHS in Wales relies on developing a sustainable workforce, which responds effectively to the health and wellbeing needs of the Welsh population. The Welsh Government continues to increase investment in the education and training of healthcare professionals in order to provide effective, high quality and sustainable heal thcare in Wales . More than \u00a3260m will be invested in 2022 -23, a 15% increase from 2021 -22 which will result in the highest number of training opportunities in Wales. The investment will further boost the NHS workforce and help reduce the need for agency staff. The Health Education and Improvement Wales and Social Care Wales workforce strategy, launched in October 2020, sets out plans for a transformed and sustainable workforce for the future. The Draft Budget includes a significant increase in the Local Government settlement which reflects our commitment to meeting the pressures we are seeing in soc ial care and provides for our current estimates of the cost of introducing the real living wage in 2022 -2023 which will contribute to a sustainable social care workforce. Primary care 11. Please provide details of the budget allocated for primary care services and investment in the primary care estate, and how this compares to amounts allocated in the last three years. In answering this question, please address the extent to which these all ocations will achieve the policy aim of shifting care from hospitals to primary care or community settings. 13 We continue to invest in primary care through the delivery of the Primary Care Model for Wales, and in 2022 -23 will build on the agreed investment provided in 2021 -22 for the primary care contracts. Planning and implementing the rebalancing of the health and wellbeing system is complex and cannot simply be tracked in terms of budgets and recording of expenditure, but through demonstrating the shift of services being delivered in both primary and community settings. We will continue to support health boards to strengthen their whole system planning through the IMTP process. Our definition of primary care is broad as set out in the Primary Care Mode l for Wales. As well as those services contracted from GPs, dentists, community pharmacists and optometrists, our definition also includes the wide range of services, care and support for people's health and wellbeing in the wider community. The NHS He alth Board accounts for primary care report spend for the last 3 years of: 2020 -21 \u00a3989.422 million 2019 -20 \u00a3947.338 million 2018 -19 \u00a3911.739 million These figures exclude GP prescribing and are net of dental patient changes recover ed Primary Care Capital Some \u00a372m (including \u00a34.5m as part of the 2020 -21 budget) has been made available for investment in a pipeline of 19 primary and community care projects as part of the implementation of the Taking Wales Forward commitment. This und erpins the key messages set out in A Healthier Wales - the long term plan for health and social care and delivers the commitment in Prosperity for All, to invest in a new generation of integrated health and care centres . Since the inception of the progra mme in 2017, some \u00a354m has been allocated against projects, \u00a348m of this over the last t hree years (see profile below). As of December 2021, of the 19 schemes, 7 are complete, 5 are on site and 7 are in various stages of business case development. The programme has taken longer than expected to deliver , given the time to develop business cases and the inevitable impact of Covid on progress. This programme of work continues to evolve in terms of the way in which a mix of services both health and others are delivered in a collaborative way. Whilst there has been a focus on the existing GP estate, the range of schemes have seen joined up working across portfolios, health, local authorities, housing, not only in terms of new developments but re -utilising and redeveloping existing assets. Considering the impact of delivering services closer to people's homes in a range of settings including town ce ntres. To fully enable this programme, we are exploring the potential for borrowing arrangement s in order to facilitate further tranche s of capital spend over a five year period. 14 General Medical Services (GMS) The GMS allocation to health boards funds the contractual commitment they hold with GMS contractors for the provision of GP practice services to patients. Welsh Government support the movement of services out of centralised secondary care into local primary and community settings as part of our p rudent healthcare agenda. Health boards should be planning and supporting the movement of services with funding following from unified allocations into primary and community care. Cluster Funding We show commitment to cluster level planning by allocating \u00a320 million a year for clusters to invest in their own solutions to meeting the health and wellbeing needs of their local population. Cluster -level planning and delivery is the key to unlocking innovative solutions to sustainable local services and impro ving access to the right care, at the right time from the right source. Social care 12. Please outline the planned allocation for social care, including: a. Any additional funding identified for 2022 -23, and how such funding will be targeted. As stated above, a new Social Care Refo rm fund of \u00a345m has been put in place for 22 -23. The fund will rise to \u00a360m by 2024 -25 and will increase the funding available to promote reform and improve ment in social care. This comple ments the significant uplift pro vided through the Local Government settlement. Through the Fund we will invest: \u00a310m in 2022 -23 in preparation to deliver our commitment to eliminate private profit from the care of looked after children during the next Senedd term; and an additional \u00a33m in Social Care Wales in 2022 -23, to continue the expansion of the professional registration of the social care workforce and provide ongoing support for the stabilisation and recovery of the sector through delivery of the Health and Social Care Joint Workf orce Strategy. We will also invest in the establishment of health and social care community hubs to contribute to the prevention and early intervention agenda, as well as in the ongoing work under the Chief Social Care Officer for Wales to take forward ac tion complementary to the Race Equality Action Plan, and provide further support for groups such as unpaid carers. As stated above, i n 2022 -23 a new \u00a350m capital fund will be launched for social care to support delivery of key programme for government comm itments to include the development of 50 local community hubs and the strengthening of arrangements to support the integration of health and social care and rebalance the residential care estate. This social care capital allocation will enable the Welsh Go vernment to directly influence the transformation of social care 15 infrastructure in line with aspirations of the Social Services & Wellbeing (Wales ) Act and 'A Healthier Wales'. b. How the allocations will ensure the ongoing viability and stability of social care services, including residential and domiciliary care. Funding will support greater understanding and policy direction with regard to models of delivery and commissioning with respect to domiciliary care; connecting with equipment and assistive technology and the interface with reablement and allied health professionals. c. What support the Draft Budget will provide for unpaid carers, including evidence of specific spend o n respite care. In 2022 -23, \u00a33million will be allocated specifically to increase opportunities for unpaid carers to access respite and take a break. Building on this year's \u00a33million respite funding to local authorities, this money will encourage innovat ion and support more unpaid carers to focus on their own health and well -being. Unpaid carers will also benefit from our annual \u00a31.245m funding allocation; the continuing Social Services Third Sector Grant and support from Regional Partnership Boards. We are also continuing to work in coproduction with local authorities and Carers Trust Wales to roll out a national Young Carers ID card project with funding of \u00a3200,000. This will be alongside funds in the Sustainable Social Services Third Sector grant scheme for 2020 -23 and support via Regional Partnership boards and their funding streams where they benefit all ages of unpaid carer. d. Measures in the Draft Budget that will improve the sustainability of the social care workforce, including contributing towards achieving parity of esteem, pay, and terms and conditions with the health care workforce. The significant increase in the Local Government settlement reflects our commitment to meeting the pressures we are seeing in social care. It provides for our current estimates of the cost of introducing the real l iving wage in 2022 -2023. We have also transfer red \u00a35m of the funding from the workforce grant in the HSS MEG which was uplifted last year to support Local Authorities moving towards paying the RLW. In addition to the new \u00a345m Social Care Reform Fund, we will also retain a baseline budget of \u00a345m for the Social Care Workforce Grant. 16 e. The anticipated impact of the UK health and social care levy, in particular any additional or consequential funding. The Welsh Government's settlement for the next 3 years was set out in the UK Government's budget and sp ending review on 27 October. This reflected Barnett consequentials arising from expenditure decisions in England, including those financed by the new health and social care levy. The Welsh Government draft Budget for the next 3 years will determine how any additional resources are utilised in Wales in line with our devolved priorities, whilst confirming that funding for health and social care will remain a core priority of our budget preparations. 13. Please confirm whether the allocation for social care is adequate to meet all local authorities' standard spending assessments for 2022 -23, and outline how you will monitor local authorities' spend in year. The funding provided through the settlement for 2022 -23 in recognition of social care pressures is adequate to meet local authorities' funding pressures for the forthcoming financial year. The local government settlement is unhypothecated, meaning it is up to authorities how they spend this funding, to meet local needs and priorities. Acknowledging this, however, through this settlement we are directing an amount through the social care element of the formula that is equal to the sum of the pressures outlin ed by the WLGA and the assessment of the additional costs to local authorities of introducing the R eal Living Wage for care workers . This ensures that the funding is distributed in the most equitable way, to meet the pressures across the 22 local authoriti es. As the local government settlement is unhypothecated, there are no plans to specifically monitor any element of local authority spend in relation to the funding included within this settlement. Mental Health and W ellbeing 14. Please explain how your priorities for mental health and wellbeing are reflected in the Draft Budget, and where the allocated/projected spend for these priorities can be found. In particular, the Committee would welcome details of allocations in the Draft Budget relating to: a. Mental health services (including the Mental Health Service Improvement Fund, and how the Draft Budget will facilitate earlier intervention and improved access to mental health services). b. Children and young people's mental healt h and wellbeing c. Dementia. d. Autism. e. Obesity/implementation of 'Healthy Weight, Healthy Wales'. a & b. Mental Health Services & Children and Young People's We will continue to prioritise mental health and well -being in 2022 -23 and to support this will be allocating an additional \u00a350m in the Health & Social Services portfolio. This increase will rise to \u00a390m by 24 -25. Included in this for 22 -23, will be appro ximately \u00a325m that will support direct mental health policy and service integration, this will include a significant amount being investe d in the NHS. Supporting front line mental health services is only one element of a wider system that also 17 supports pri mary prevention in public health, education, social services, substance misuse and other protective factors such as supporting people to stay in employment. The \u00a350m allocated will make a significant contribution to support our Programme for Government co mmitment to prioritise service redesign to improve prevention, tackle stigma and promote an approach to mental health support that ensures people will be directed to the right advice and support at the right time. As part of the \u00a350m increase in funding in the HSS MEG , we will be providing around \u00a38m next year to support the implementation of the UK Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019/ Liberty Protection Safeguards which support the rights of people who lack mental capacity (for instance due to brain inj ury, a stroke, or dementia) to consent to their health and/or social care and treatment. There is also an increasing investment in supporting young people's mental health and well - being within t he Education portfolio, a \u00a35.5m increase is allocated for 2022-23, rising to \u00a311.5m by 2024 -25. This additional resource will include directing support to the whole systems approach across health and education. We will continue to work across government to ensure that we maximise the impact from supporting mental health across portfolios, ensuring that supporting and protecting mental health is a key factor in any investment decisions we consider. The Covid pandemic has put increasing pressure on a number of mental health services, in particular for young people ( CAMHS) and all -age Psychological Therapies. The evidence suggests that an increase in referrals and complexity will remain as we emerge from the pandemic. Across the Health and Social Services and Education portfolios, we are committing to further increa ses in Mental Health fund ing, over the next three years, that will total over \u00a3100m by 2024 -25. Mental health continues to be the highest area of spending by the NHS in Wales. In 22 -23 the ring-fenced Mental Health budget provided to Local Health Boards will be over \u00a3760m. c. Dementia The Dementia Action Plan published in February 2018, outlines our vision for dementia care and support in Wales. However we recognise that the pandemic and the required response has had an impact on both people living with dementia and their carers. As such o fficials worked closely with members of the Dementia Oversight and Implementation Group to consider the impact of the pandemic and to agree priorities over the coming months. This 'companion document' to the Dementia Act ion Plan was published on the 21 September 2021 , affirms our priority areas for action over the coming months. We have seen pressures across the system, including access to diagnostic support services, and we will earmark support to provide increased capac ity in areas of demand. d. Autism and N eurodevelopmental conditions 18 The introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice on the Delivery of Autism Services is a Welsh Government Programme for Government Commitment. A demand and capacity of all neurodevelopmental services is currently underway and will be completed by March 2022, this review will include recommendations for improvement including workforce development. \u00a35.73m is currently delivering the implementation of the statutory code, throug h supporting the National Autism Team, the Integrated Autism Service, and a demand and capacity review. F urther investment of \u00a35.185m will support future policy development and improvement in neurodevelopmental services, to include actions to address asses sment and diagnostic waiting times and support and will seek to expand services to include conditions such as ADHD. e. Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy \u00a36.63m will be allocated in 22 -23 to support the Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy which is the Welsh Government's long term plan to prevent and reduce obesity across Wales. It sets out a 10 year plan to prioritise early intervention and behaviour change at all levels to change our ha bits and promote healthy activity. The strategy is a key commitment towards a cross -government approach to reducing obesity in Wales on a population scale. The strategy has been developed from evidence of what works. This has indicated the need for a new approach which combines individual behaviour change with environmental and system change. It will utilise a combination of funding, policies and legislation to develop approaches through our environment, settings and leadership to put a strong focus on prevention. It will also deploy targeted approaches in areas of deprivation and will assist those who are already overweight or obese through a range of prevention, early intervention and specialised services. A 2022 -2024 Delivery Plan will be published in ea rly 2022 which will set out a cross -government approach. Through the funding there is a specific allocation which will support broader engagement across children and families, examples include: A Children and Families Pilot has been funded through the de livery plan and is taking place in three areas Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil and Anglesey. These pilot programmes will adopt a whole systems approach, which is drawing together practice and best evidence. A core part of this approach is the implementation of a s econdary prevention Home Based Intervention for families of children in the early years from 3 - 7 years of age in line with the foundation phase. \u00a32.9 million per annum until 2023 -2024 in funding has been made available for health boards to develop their local adaptations of the All Wales Weight Management Pathway which will support the development and delivery of weight management services in Wales. For the first time there will be children and families specialist level 3 services delivered across Wales and the development of services and approaches based upon early intervention at level 2, including specific approaches through maternity. The revised pathway will provide compassionate support in helping people on their weight management journey and will run alongside our Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy to encourage people to make healthier choices and lead more active lives. Ministers have agreed to the development of a new Welsh Daily Active offer for schools. The offer will adopt an age specifi c whole school approach, underpinned by behaviour 19 change and range of adaptable approaches, to complement the new curriculum. This will be responsive to evidence, provide flexibility and build in evaluation to assess health outcomes. This will also link w ith proposals to extend the school day. We have established roles for Healthy Weight Ambassadors across Wales. They are working with us be a champion for the Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy and inspire the delivery of its aims and objectives with partners across Wales, to listen, engage and promote the ethos and positive lifestyle messages of the strategy. This includes a youth Ambassador and a Family Ambassador who are broadening our engagement across the strategy. 15. The Committee would also we lcome details of: a. The percentage/proportion of the Draft Budget that is allocated to mental health and well - being, and how this compares to previous years. Draft Budget 2022 -23 \u00a3m Draft Budget 2021 -22 \u00a3m Draft Budget 2020 -21 \u00a3m Mental Health ring fence in main Health Board allocation 760.885 726.782 711.930 Mental Health central budget It is important to note that whilst this represents a picture of what is visible at the Draft budget stage each year, Health Boards will spend more than the ring fenced amount on Mental Health services, as they also commit funding from their discretionary allocations. b. Any reductions or increases relating to specific areas of the Draft Budget compared to previous years (e.g. grants being reduced or increased, or being introduced or ceasing to exist). There have been no baseline reductions across the HSS MEG. Budget chan ges at BEL level are detailed in the annex attached. Transformation, innovation and integration with social care 16. Please outline how the Draft Budget will support the development of a 'whole system approach', with greater integration of health and social care, as described in A Healthier Wales. In particular, please explain how the Draft Budget balances the need to me et existing service pressures with the need to transform services and develop new models of care. How will service transformation and integration be supported in the longer term to achieve sustained progress on the transformation agenda, ensure a focus on rolling out and mainstreaming the learning from successful pilots, and avoid reliance on continued additional funding. 20 In 2022 the current Integrated Care Fund (ICF) (\u00a389m) and the Transformation Fund (TF) (\u00a350m) , administered through regional partners hip boards (RPBs) , will come to an end. A new 5 year 'Health and Social Care Regional Integration Fund' will be launched form the 1st April 2022 to build on the successes of the ICF and TF, learn from experiences to date, and continue to drive the integra tion and transformat ion of health and social care. This new fund, which will also be administered through RPBS to ensure an integrated cross sector approach, has been co-designed with a range of partners and will include mechanisms such as match funding to promote sustainability and embedding of new ways of working. The fund will be rooted in driving integrated, preventative models of care and support as close to home as possible. Cross -government/sector working on prevention 18. Wales has high levels of chronic disease and significant concerns around unhealthy lifestyles. The pandemic has further highlighted and exacerbated this. Can you demonstrate how the Draft Budget: a. Ensures that focus on prevention and early intervention is not being lost as a result of the pandemic. Whilst we have to acknowledge that the delivery of some programmes have been affected by the events of the last 18 months we are maintaining investment in baseline budgets in the HSS MEG and planned programme spend in 22 -23 can return to pre pandemic levels , where possible. Current action s to address health inequalities are embedded across all activity owing to the strategic planning required by the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and through our health in all policies approach (supported by the Health Impact Assessment ('HIA') process). Consequently, it is often not possible to disaggregate budget which is specifically allocated to tackling health inequalities from the totality of government spending. However, some specific examples of government spending which contribute greatly to tackling health inequalities include interventions such as the Welsh Government's Flying Start programme . Flying Start is a Programme for Government (PfG) Commitment. The Flying Start programme was developed based on evidence of 'what works' in providing children with the best start in life. There are four core components including funded, part -time, high qual ity childcare, enhanced health visiting, parenting support and speech, language and communication support. It is this combination of integrated support which is critical to its positive impact. We are continuing to invest in our flagship Flying Start programme which reaches around 36,000 children under four , living in some of the most deprived areas across Wales. The evidence shows it is making a difference to those children who access the progra mme. Funding for Flying Start forms part of the Children and Communities Grant (CCG) in the Housing & Local Government MEG . An additional \u00a340m revenue has been allocated up to 2024 -25 for early help and support including for Flying Start, recognising the i mportance of supporting more children and families across Wales and to ensure we support our youngest children to have the best start in life. 21 We will also continue to invest in a range of other preventative approaches , some examples of which are deta iled below: Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales The ten year Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy wa s launched on 17 October 2019, with \u00a36.63m funding per annu m being made available for 2022 -23 to 23 -24. This will support the develop ment of the plan and conti nue current funding commitments. The funding allocations below support children's health and wellbeing: Healthy Weight Pathway Transformation Fund (\u00a32.9m) Children and families work with National Governing Bodies (\u00a30.6m) Delivering a Systems Based Approa ch (\u00a31.2m) Targeted Children and Families Intervention (\u00a30.6m) Early Years Integration Transformation Programme The Early Years Integration Transformation Programme is focussed on developing a more joined -up, responsive early years system that puts the u nique needs of each child at its heart, which covers the period of life from pre -birth to the end of the Foundation Phase (0 -7). We have been working with PSBs across Wales to explore how to deliver early years services in a more systematic way, applying t he lessons from our existing programmes such as Flying Start and Families First. The majority of the PSBs are now engaged in the programme as pathfinders. We are investing \u00a36m in 2022 -23 and 2023 -24 to support PSBs across all Health Board regions in Wales , as they test the core components for an early years system and pilot different multi -agency delivery models and approaches, building on what works well in existing programmes such as Flying Start and Families First. Healthy and Active Fund (HAF) in the HSS MEG. Our \u00a35.9m Healthy and Active Fund (HAF) available over 4 years (2019 -2023) is funding 16 projects aiming to improve mental and physical health by enabling healthy and active lifestyles, with a particular focus on strengthening community assets. Priority has been given to projects that seek to reduce inequalities in outcomes for one or more of the following groups: - Children and young people - People with a disability or long -term illness - People who are economically inactive or who live in area s of deprivation - Older people and those around the age of retirement from work. b. Reflects a 'whole system' joined up approach to improving people's health and well -being, and targeting key areas of concern. Screening 22 National population screening programmes are a good example of effective equitable preventative health interventions as they are offered to all the eligible population across Wales. Approximately 45% of Public Health Wales' core budget is spent on national population screening programm es. This equates to around \u00a335m in 2022 -23. Approximate costs are provided as Public Health Wales' core funding is not ring -fenced, allowing the organisation flexibility to allocate resources according to need. All national population screening programmes are assessed for cost effectiveness by the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) before recommenda tion. The cost assessment includes testing, diagnosis and treatment, administration, training and quality assurance costs to ensure all are economically b alanced in relation to expenditure on medical care as a whole (i.e. value for money). Screening policies are subject to review by the UK NSC on a three -yearly basis unless new evidence comes to light in the intervening period. Once a recommendation is made by the UK NSC the Wales Screening Committee considers how best to implement in Wales. Breast screening, bowel screening, cervical screening, abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and diabetic eye screening were paused for a few months at the start of the C ovid-19 pandemic. Public Health Wales has received an additional \u00a31m to support the recovery of the screening programmes and reduce backlogs. Cervical Screening Cervical screening is available to all people with a cervix who are aged 25 to 64. Currently, people aged 25 to 49 receive invitations every three years. People aged 50 to 64 receive invitations every five years. The UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) recommended the use of high -risk human papilloma virus (HPV) screening as the primary screen in the cervical screening programme in November 2015. This is a more sensitive and specific test which means that a negative result is more accurate. There are over 100 different types of HPV, but only around 13 types are associated with cancer and these are known as 'high -risk' types. The new test looks for the 13 known high -risk HPV types, which cause 99.8% of cervical cancers. Public Health Wales (PHW) fully implemented HPV primary testing into the Cervical Screening Wales programme in September 2018 an d Wales was the first UK nation to do so. In January 2019 the UKNSC recommended a programme modification to extend screening intervals from three to five years for women who test HPV negative as part of their routine screen test. At its meeting on 21 July 2020, the Wales Screening Committee (WSC) agreed to preparations being made for the extension of the screening interval for HPV negative women. Once implemented in 2022, women aged 25 to 49 who have a negative result will be considered lower risk and reca lled in five years rather than three. This policy change is being made in the best interests of women's health and is not related to cost. Bowel Screening Bowel Screening Wales (BSW) sends a bowel screening kit to men and women aged 60 to 74 every two year s. The UKNSC first recommended bowel screening between the ages of 60 and 74 in 2011 which was subsequently implemented in Wales. However, in 2012 the UKNSC 23 recommended that the bowel screening programme should be expanded to include people between 50 and 74 years of age. At the time, the Wales Screening Committee (WSC) agreed that no expansion to the bowel screening programme could occur without increased health board colonoscopy capacity. Following a review of the evidence in 2018, the UKNSC recommended FIT (faecal immunochemical testing) replace the existing gFOBt (guaiac faecal occult blood test) and be offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 years at as low a threshold as possible (down to 20\u00b5g/g). The expectation is that the sensitivity threshold will be set at a level according to the available colonoscopy capacity but with the aspiration to drive the threshold down with time. Since January 2019, BSW has been providing FIT at 150\u00b5g/g as part of the routine screening programme. This new screening test f ully replaced gFOBt in September 2019. Preparation was underway to reduce the starting age of the eligible screening population from 60 to 55 years from April 2020. However, the Covid -19 pandemic stopped this preparation and the optimisation progress of the bowel screening programme was halted in March 2020. Plans to optimise have now resumed with the intention to reduce the age range in smaller increments, which started by reducing to age 58 in October 2021. The intention is to implement the next stage by reducing the starting age for screening from 58 to 55 years during 2022 -23. Uptake of the screening programme has increased significantly since 2019 when the new easier to use and more accurate Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) was introduced, with the programme now achieving approximately 65% u ptake (standard is 60%). Immunisation programmes (non -Covid) The national flu programme continues to be provided through health boards via core funding. Currently this includes a large set of cohorts of those prioritised by the J oint Committee on Vaccination & Immunisation (JCVI) . For 2021 -22 extra cohorts were included to aid the response to the pandemic . Secondary schools were i ncluded for 2021 -22 and curren tly has an uptake of over 57%. Other expansions to the programme in 2021 -22 were the inclus ion of healthy 50 -64 year olds and primary care workers. The cost of including the extra groups was \u00a37m for 2021 -22 which was transferred to health boards. There is an intention to continue vaccinating the expanded school age group in future years as a mea sure to reduce the transmission of flu. Funding for other adult vaccination programmes (such as shingles) and childhood vaccinations (such as MMR and HPV) is located within health board core budgets. Childhood immunisation programmes continued as essentia l services during the coronavirus pandemic, with appropriate assurance to parents and infection control measures put in place by practices. Monthly enhanced immunisation reports developed by the Vaccine Preventable Disease Programme in Public Health Wales were used to monitor the impact of COVID -19 on uptake of routine childhood immunisations across Wales. Data suggests that vaccination uptake in young children and infants has remained stable throughout the pandemic. Vaccination uptake rates on programmes g iven in secondary school (such as HPV and MenACWY) have been most affected during the pandemic; priority will be given to catch -up programmes in 22 -23. 24 Speech, Language & C ommunication - Early Years We know Speech, Language and Communication (SLC) development is an important predictor of later progress in literacy. Children's poor SLC skills have an impact on a wide range of outcomes including behaviour and mental health, wellbeing and employability. That is why we have prioritised children's speech, language and communication skills as they are essential for positive lon g term outcomes. The Talk W ith Me: Speech, Language and Communication (SLC) Delivery Plan , published on 20 November 2020, seeks to dr ive improvement in the way in which children in Wales are supported to develop their SLC skills. We are investing an additional \u00a33.9m over three years to support the commitments in Talk with me the Speech, La nguage and Communication Delivery Plan to deliv er our overarching commitment to improve outcomes for children through a fresh approach to promoting and supporting children's speech, l anguage and communication needs. Reduction of health inequalities 19. Please outline how the Draft Budget will contribute to the reduction of health inequalities, including those exacerbated by the pandemic, or those resulting from a disproportionate impact of the pandemic or lockdown measures on the health or wellbeing of p articular groups (such as older adults, BAME communities, or people on low incomes or who are otherwise financially insecure). The Committee would also welcome details about how the Draft Budget will ensure that the most disadvantaged are prioritised, and that there is fair access to health and care services in rural areas. Reducing health inequalities across Wales, including rural areas, remains a Ministerial priority and the COVID pandemic has brought reducing health inequalities into even sharper focus . Rural areas often depend on wider collaborative arrangements for delivery of care and services for its patients and to create equity of access. For example Hywel Dda and Powys health boards have developed strong relationships with partner health boards to ensure patients have access to the services they need. Technology enabled care and digital innovation, including video consultations and remote working, have become an integral part of primary, secondary and community care, supporting people in receivi ng care and advice safely in their own homes. For those patients and their families, who live in rural parts of Wales, this has been especially welcome, reducing time and travel costs. Learning Disabilities We are continuing our investment of \u00a31 million to support services to support individuals with a learning disability. The pandemic impacted significantly on securing all of the improvement gains of the Improving Lives cross -government programme . 25 This additional investment will address the health inequalities that people with learning disabilities experience , resulting in a poorer quality of life and wellbeing outcomes than the general population. In particular, people with a learning disability are 6 times more likely to die of a treatable condition than the general population. The key priorities will be : Increasing access to health checks which reduces morbidity and mortality rates; Implementing the recommendations of the review of learning disability specialist in- patient provision, i .e. reducing the length of stay in in -patient provision and supporting people to live in their communities ; Reduce avoidable deaths due to diagnostic overshadowing; Improve the health of people with a learning disability through ear lier identification of health conditions to which they are pre -disposed, eg, respiratory, gastro, cardiac, epilepsy, diabetes and early on -set dementia (from age of 40); and Improve community services and reduce the occurrence of crisis which leads to long term in-patient admission. ICT 20. An assessment of the costs of delivering the Welsh Government's vision for digital and data, as described in A Healthier Wales, and including increased support for digital and virtual care. Welsh Government continues to work closely with Digital Health & Care Wales and digital leaders across NHS Wales to forecast the cost of delivering the Welsh Government's vision for digital and date, as described in A Healthier Wales. This has delivered a significant inc rease in digital investment since A Healthier Wales was published in 2018, through the Welsh Government's Digital Priorities Investment Fund (DPIF). The DPIF supports digital and data transformation at the all -Wales level, through revenue and capital funding, aligned to Ministerial priorities. It is managed by Welsh Government as a portfolio of digital programmes and activity. Funds are awarded to NHS Wales organisations through a scrutiny process. The total allocation over the last three years is a s follows: o 2019 -20 \u00a350m (\u00a325m \u00a325m capital) The costs of delivering digital transformation are not 'one off costs' and they are forecast and planned on a year by year basis. The DPIF is only part of wider digital transformation, alongside investment through Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW), the national digital services delivery organisation established in April 2021. Additio nally, NHS Wales organisations invest in digital transformation through their discretionary revenue and capital allocations. At the strategic planning level, digital investment is informed by the National Digital Architecture, by the All Wales Digital In frastructure Programme, and by other planning tools such as the Cyber Assurance Frameworks prepared by each organisation. These provide common assessment criteria and a consistent target operating model for all NHS Wales organisations, which enables a stru ctured approach to forecasting and planning investment requirements. 26 Digital investment is discussed regularly at the national level through the NHS Wales Leadership Board and Chief Executives Group, and across NHS Wales, for example through Directors of Finance and Directors of Planning peer leadership groups. Digital has been an important part of the response to the pandemic, which has accelerated digital transformation and the development of new digital services. For example: national systems to support contact tracing and vaccine delivery; tools to support remote working; video consultation services; and improvements to digital infrastructure. Welsh Government is determined to maintain the pace of digital transformation, as part of recovery and to drive the future sustainability of health and care services. It is committed to supporting several major digital programmes over the coming years. For example: the Welsh Nursing Care Records Programme, Welsh Intensive Care Information Services Prog ramme, National Data Resource, All -Wales e -Prescribing Programme, and a new NHS Wales App through the Digital Services for Public and Patients. The committee will wish to note that capacity of the digital profession and wider NHS workforce is limited, a nd has been stretched to its limit by the pandemic. In the short term NHS Wales organisations are working hard to recruit and to secure the capacity needed to deliver against increased funding and inv estment. In the medium term, a strategic review of the d igital health workforce and its future requirements is under way and will make recommendations in the first half of 2022. Withdrawal from the European Union 21. Information about any budget allocations within your portfolio as a result of the UK's exit from the EU. Food Standards Agency for Wales In 2022 -23 we will invest some additional \u00a31,500,000 (on a recurrent basis) to meet the additional functions and res ponsibilities required following EU Exit. The funding is split between Core funding and law enforcement . This funding will ensure that the continued pressures on the organisations in areas such as surveillance, regulated product claims, border controls, po licy development and risk assessment can be successfully delivered.

The spending plans are set out in the draft Budget for 2022 -23, published on 20 December 2021 . This paper also provides an update on specific areas of interest to the Committee. Culture, heritage, the creative industries , the historic environment and sport are essential components of our national life and an integral part of our individual and collective mental and physical well-being. Museums, archives, libraries, art s and sports clubs, facilities and historic sites are the focal point for many communities throughout Wales. Almost all of our support for these sectors helps people to access and enjoy the best of Wa les, enhancing quality of life , as well as our education , history, visitor economy and our place in the world. Culture is one of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Goals, and critical to the delivery of the six other goals, in what it can contribute towards wider life and the economy . What we will do and how we will do it Our Programme for Government 2021 - 2026 recognises the crucial role that thes e sectors deliver. Over the next three years, we are allocating \u00a3 533.311 m to the arts, culture , sport and heritage sectors. This includes investment in significant specific projects - for example, Theatr Clwyd, the Football Museum for Wales, the National Contemporary Art Gallery , a number of Cadw monuments and the Museum of North Wales. We are also committed to investing in sports facilities to increase participation levels to support the nation's health and wellbeing, particularly as we recover from the pandemic. This expenditure will support a broad set of themes, including decarbonisation and digitisation, equalities and supporting our local sectors, as well as delivering our statutory obligations in respect of health and safety. We will be tackling majo r inequalities in terms of access and participation, not least racial inequalities and for communities in North Wales - ensuring that our cultural and heritage organisations are both more accessible, that they properly reflect our communities and histories , add value to the lives of people right across Wales and promote the visitor economy . We remai n committed to engaging with the arts, culture , sport and heritage sectors to develop a new culture strategy, a priority explicitly set out in the Programme for Government update in December 2021. This will set the framework for our priorities going forward and how we will sustain and develop the sectors. Work on updated cultural priorities was paused during the pandemic to focus resources on the response to Coron avirus. When the initial Programme for Government was published, the Deputy Minister agreed that work to develop a new culture strategy should wait until public health conditions had improving sufficiently, to allow it to be taken forward as a priority in 2022. Officials are currently considering options for the scope of the new strategy, set in the context of the updated Programme for Government and recovery from the pandemic, considering the extent to which we can build on the work undertaken previously a s we move forward. 2 Investment is primarily delivered through our internal agencies (Cadw and Creative Wales) and sponsored bodies (the National Library of Wales , Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales (7 museums) , the Arts Council of Wales , Sport Wales and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales ). Cadw and the National Botanic Garden of Wales investment also deliver our heritage ambitions, alongside c apital in vestment in local museums, archi ves and libraries sector via our Capital Transformation Grant programme. Creative Wales leads on , and coordi nates, activity and policy for the creative sectors. These organisations deliver on the cross government priorities to support the delivery of key strategies including Net Zero Wales , the Race Equality Action Plan and Cymraeg 20 50. Each of the sponsored bodies are committed to carbon efficiency providing detailed sustainability reports in their annual accounts. Cadw will complete the current major investment at Caernarfon and Caerphilly castles that will enhance the visitor exp erience and make the monuments more accessible. Further capital investment will also allow Cadw to continue its statutory responsibility to conserve and maintain the monuments in its care, keep them safe for people to visit and reduce the carbon footprint of its visitor centres. Sport is an intrinsic part of our nation's identity. It brings our communities together and provides people with transferrable skills to enhance their learning and find a job or career. Through the many thousands of activities a cross Wales, sport also supports the growth of Welsh speaking communities by providing opportunities for people to use it on a daily basis as a living, modern language. We will continue to support our communities, clubs and facilities to address the impac t of the pandemic, to enhance our sense of identity, physical and mental well -being, and to ensure the sector adds value to our health and happiness . The spending plans for sport maintained investment levels in the three - year capital budget, enabling the Welsh Government to continue to invest, through its delivery partner, Sport Wales, in the people and places to provide inclusive and equal opportunities for people to lead healthy and active lives, and to realise their sporting potential. We have a statut ory responsibility to continue to support our national cultural sponsored bodies, as well as the local culture sectors, who all play a key role in delivering government priorities and Programme for Government commitments, resulting in better quality of lif e for so many of our population. Alongside our regular statutory obligations, we have asked these bodies to all prioritise improving access and tackling inequalities, decarbonisation and digital improvements over the next three years. Capital investment is provided to the local museums, archives and libraries sector via our Capital Transformation Grant programme, and via the Arts Council of Wales to the arts sector, including theatres. We propose to extend and develop these schemes to address the range of P rogramme for Government commitments, enabling a greater range and diversity of applications and better alignment with Programme for Government priorities. We are revisiting these schemes to put decarbonisation and digital at the centre, to ensure that inve stments are sustainable and that they tackle inequalities, particularly race inequalities and disability discrimination. The rationale for investing in culture, heritage and creative sectors The Economic Resilience and Reconstruction Mission (Mission) , published in February 2021, established the fundamental recovery p rinciples and direction for the economic policy of the previous administration . The Programme for Government i ncludes a commitment to Progress that Mission and significant cultural commitments, recognising the important role of culture for well -being and providing employment opportunities. As the response to the pandemic testified, culture and heritage are central to what matters to people, what they enjoy doing, their mental wellbeing and physical health. 3 The culture, creative and heritage sectors play a vital role in supporting the economy of Wales. They create jobs in the creative industries (media, journalism, and publishing ), heritage, traditional building construction and repair, and the arts and cultural sectors . Our cultural attractions help sustain 11,500 bus inesses in the tourism industry and creative industries employ 56,000 people . They demonstrate strong economic benefits in terms of the visitor economy , regeneration and place - making and strong environmental benefits through decarbonisat ion and support for biodiversity and the natural environment. Our culture, heritage , sport and creative industries are central to the Wales brand and promoting Wales internationally. These sectors have faced significant challenges both this year and last year as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. The impact of these challenges will continue into the future as we aim to support our sectors in recovery. The Welsh Government's support measures, such as the Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) , Sport and Leisure R ecovery Fund and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF), have clearly enabled our sectors to survive. However, further action is needed now, and over the course of the next few years, to help these vital sectors return to sustainable operation and contribute t o Wales' recovery. 4 2.0 Commentary on Actions and detail of Budget Expenditure Line (BEL) allocations The 2022 -23 Draft Budget provides \u00a3533 .311m for the three year spending plan for both revenue and capital.

Decarbonisation i s a priority for the budget decisions to achieve Net Zero Wales will enable the organisations to address environmental concerns, particularly CO2 emissions and 8 energy efficiency. During the pandemic the organisations have adapted their offer to the public by making more of their collections available digitally , and moved to offering educational and entertainment programmes on line so that individuals and families could enjoy culture and heritage at home. The capital budgets will enable further investment in technology for recovery , wider access and preservation of the collections . Internal agencies: The Creative Wales brand supports the international strategy in raising Wales' profile to the world, not only as a centre for creative excellence, but as a great place to visit and live. Creative and cultural investment is vital for regeneration across Wales and the funding of \u00a315m over three years will support productions and initiatives in b oth Welsh and English. Significant development and conservation programme s are planned for our heritage sites with a Cadw budget of \u00a330m over three years, including at Caernarfon Castle and Caerphilly Castle.

Addressing accessibility issues is a continuing priority at all sites. Indicative funding for the establishment of the Museum of North Wales is included in the Local culture and sport budget, and is subject to a business case. The National Library of Wales is an iconic cultural building located in Aberystwyth which presents similar challenges in terms of capital costs.

It will also ensure Wales is well positioned to compete internationally an d 9 to help host international events, providing a unique opportunity to promote Wales brand on the international stage in the future. 2021 -22 Forecast There are no significant variances anticipated for the capital budget with the overall forecast capital outturn currently reported as \u00a339.021 m compared to \u00a338.866 m First Supplementary budget in Annex A . 2020 -21 Final Outturn Final out -turn figures for 2020 -21 of \u00a329.667 m is in line with the Th ird Supplementary budget \u00a330.166 m. 3.0 Response to Specific Information Requested by the Committee 3.1 Information on how the delivery of the Arts, Culture and Heritage portfolio and their associated outcomes are monitored and evaluated to demonstrate value for money. Key priorities for each sponsored body are set out in their remit letters, which they use as a basis for their operational plans and key performance indicators. The Deputy Minister meets at least biannually with all bodies, and officials formally monitor progress against these plans at quarterly monitoring meetings and more regularly through close working relationships with the senior executive teams at the sponsored bodies. At the invitation of the bodies, o fficials also attend Board meetings, allow ing Welsh Government to maintain a good o verview of potential issues. Monthly grant in aid claims are also scrutinised to ensure that progress is being achieved against specified lines of expenditure. Cadw has its own internal agency board with non -executive members. It meets quarterly and part of its role is to scrutinise Cadw's performance against its business plan and financial reporting. Each major project has governance related to the specific project. Major capital investments are supported by business cases which are scrutini sed to ensure they are robust b y the Welsh Governm ent Treasury team and officials . Smaller capital and revenue grants and contracts are awarded based on either an open application process or a direct commission, and monitored by officials throughout the project life cy cle, with agreed deliverables and check in points. Major projects and activity are monitored using the Business Information Report Tool. An Evidence Plan presents the research, evaluation and data collection projects that the Culture Division is either undertaking or committed to. It is updated yearly, based on discussions with staff and wider stakeholders, to ens ure activity is supporting key d ivisional priorities and Programme for Government commitments. 3.2 Details of specific policies or programmes within the relevant MEGs (relevant to Arts, Culture and Heritage) that are intended to be preventative and how the value for money and cost benefits of such programmes are evaluated. The Culture Strategy will set out which policies and programmes are intended to be preventative and ensure that the cost benefits of these programmes are considered. All proposals are considered to determine that they represent value for money. 10 Arts, culture , sport and heritage play an important role in tackling disadvantage and preventing poverty. Participating in cultural activities (such as volunteering at a museum or playing music) can boost skills, self -esteem, learning and aspiration, particularly in areas experiencing economic disadvantage. Health and wellbeing The importance of culture on promoting positive wellbeing and physical health has been dramatically underlined by the pandemic, with culture and heritage providing an outlet for many during these difficult and uncertain times to individuals, households and communities. We are working with health colleagues to deliver the framework for Social Prescribing and with education colleagues on pilots about transforming the sch ool day and support for children in responding to the pandemic, for example through the School Holiday Enrichment Programme and the Winter of Wellbeing activities . Funding for these activities is provided by the relevant ministerial budgets. Examples of pr ojects that will be funded directly, include that we have commissioned a Welsh language version of the House of Memories App, which uses museum collections to support people with dementia, and extending the books on prescription offer. HARP - Health Arts R esearch People is one arts example of interventions to prevent ill -health, a collaboration with the NHS to develop new approaches to health, wellbeing and creativity. Sport can be the nation's most effective preventative health tool but greater cross -sector prioritisation is needed to create the long -term sustainable shifts in participation. The Healthy and Active Fund and Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales Delivery Plan are two examples of success in this area. In 2022 -23, we will continue its support in the Healthy and Active Fund, supporting organisations who actively promote and enable healthy activity for population groups with little or no levels of physical activity in their lives. Sport Wales will also continue to invest funding and resource in the Wel sh Government's 'Health Weight: Healthy Wales' delivery plan, including the delivery of the 60+ Active Leisure scheme. The Fusion programme The budget makes provision for continued support for the Fusion Programme and its work in engaging with individuals and communities in areas of deprivation. Despite the difficulties presented during the pandemic, the Fusion programme has proved resourceful in finding new ways of engaging and encouraging cultural activities. We intend by the end of 2024 -25 to have rolled Fusion coordinators out to all local authorities who wish to participate. The Fusion programme aims to tackle poverty and wellbeing issues through cultural activity, and has continued to drive forward engagement with communities coming up with innovative and bespoke solutions to engage with individuals and communities, by using digital resources and providing packs of cultural information the programme continues to provide a cultural lifeline for individuals and communities to improve the impact s of poverty, health and well -being. People's Collection Wales (PCW) We will continue to support the People's Collection Wales digital heritage programme. This programme is delivered via a federated partnership of three sponsored bodies: Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, the National Library of Wales and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. The programme encourages, empowers and supports individuals and community groups to create and upload their own digital content to the PCW website, alongside material contributed by the lead partners and other cultural heritage organisations. Going forward we will be focusing on better engaging with our diverse 11 communities across Wales, including our ethnically diverse communities and commitments in the Race Equality Action Plan. Employment Opportunities The Economic Action Plan and the Employability Plan are underpinned by the evidence that well paid work is the best route out of poverty and the greatest protection against poverty for those at risk. By support ing jobs and sustainable growth, particularly with Creative Wales investments and opportunities to work in the wider arts, culture and heritage sectors and taking action to try to alleviate some of the challenges faced by people when accessing jobs, we aim to reduce the likelihood of families experiencing poverty and avoid the long term costs that poverty bring to society. We continue to create opportunities for individuals and families with initiatives and targeted investment across Wales. 3.3 Information on allocations (and their location) in your portfolio to provide for legislation which has the potential to impact in the financial year 2022 -23 as relevant to Arts, Culture and Heritage . The Welsh Government has identified Wales' historic environment law as a suitable subject for one of its first projects in an ambitious programme to improv e access to Welsh legislati on. The Bill will consolidate the main pieces of primary legislation for t he historic environment. Although the structure and expression of the law may be different after consolidation, its legal effect will remain unchanged. There will be no policy changes in the Bill. As a result, the financial implications of the Bill are transitional and minimal and made up of updating guidance, forms, websites and promoting awareness of the new bilingual legislation . Currently there is no new legislation requiring budget provision in 2021 -22. 3.4 Implications of the ongoing effect of the COVID -19 pan demic and the UK exit from the EU on the Arts, Culture and Heritage portfolio and how the Welsh Government will manage ongoing impact. Cadw, the National Museum, the National Library , the National Botanic Garden of Wales and Arts Portfolio Wales organisations may be adversely affected from less visitors, particularly overseas visitors. This position will con tinue to be monitored closely. For example, t he restrictions due to the pandemic have had a significant impact on the number of visitor s and commercial income levels at Cadw sites over the last two years. However, there has been a strong recovery in these figures from the summer of 2021 onwards with a good tourism season in Wales , and we expect this to continue as long as there are no fur ther significant restrictions. The delivery has been protected with additional Covid allocations. The local arts and culture sectors have benefitted from the Cultural Recovery Fund, and other sources of Covid relief funding including the Economic Resilien ce Fund and the furlough scheme. It is too early to assess the full impact of the pandemic on the cultural and arts sectors. The sector was amongst the last to re -open and the impact of the pandemic is likely to be felt for some time and until public con fidence returns. We have seen reductions in visitors and volunteers. Many parts of the sector, such as theatres, are predicting that they expect 12 -18 months before audience levels return to pre -pandemic levels. The portfolio has greatly benefited over the years from EU funding for certain projects. For Cadw only limited European funding has been secured in very recent years; but more generally 12 clarity is awaited from the UK Government about the degree to which baselines will be augmented to replace EU funding, and how arrangements for the Shared Prosperity Fund will work. The UK Government announced in December 2020 that a replacement for the Creative Europe programme would not benefit from direct funding as part of the comprehensive spen ding review, the Culture element has not been supported directly however the creative f ilm and screen element has. Opportunities still remain to access a very limited fund via the Shared Prosperity Fund. The Creative Europe programme has been superseded b y the Global Screen Fund (GSF) which ran as a \u00a37m pilot in 2021-22 under the Internal Market Act. While a small number of welsh business have benefited from this programme, officials have consistently provided feedback to DCMS about the need for devolved n ations to be more involved in the programme set up and delive ry. Within the recent Spending R eview a further \u00a342m has been allocated to the creative industries over the next 3 years which includes the continuation of the GSF . Oficials are continuing to lia ise on the set up and delivery of this to ensure it has maximum impact for Wales. There has been no direct replacement to date for the Creative Europe cultural sub -programme and that the Welsh Government continues to engage with DCMS and other devolved nations to raise issues and identify options for support for the sector. Since the first lockdown in March last year, the sport and leisure sector has been severely impacted. Sport across Wales came to an abrupt halt with all sports venues, activities, co mpetitions and events closed, cancelled or postponed with an immediate impact and loss of income for most. All individuals, clubs, and organisations have been adversely affected by the pandemic . Some impacts of Covid -19 on the sport sector have been mitigated by scale or speed by compensation packages announced by the UK and Welsh Governments. Throughout the pandemic to date Welsh Ministers agreed over \u00a340m in s upport package s the sector including : Specific funding for s pectator sports as a contribution towards the revenue losses that resulted from the restrictions preventing spectators from attending events ; and Sport & Leisure recovery fund which provided to provide essential ongoing support to clubs and organisations, local authority leisure centres and leisure trusts , independent providers (including freelancers) and sporting events who saw a significant loss of revenue 3.5 Information on any COVID -related contingency funding for the cultural sector should the public health picture deteriorate. The Welsh Government is working closely with the UK Government, Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive, including on options in this scenario. For the sponsored bodies in the cultural sector, being open and able to maintain their commercial operations without restriction is key to delivering against their commercial and fundraising targets. Restrictions relating to operating in a Covid -secure environment has negatively imp acted on their ability to generate commercial income. In 2021 -22, the UK Job Retention Scheme was helpful in mitigating the impact of Covid , especially as a large percentage of the grant in aid offered by Welsh Government to WGSBs relates to staffing costs . WGSBs were unable to access emergency funding such as the CRF schemes. 13 Consideration is ongoing, in close discussion with our sponsored bodies and affected stakeholders, regarding whether and how much additional funding might be needed should the challen ges contin ue or the situation get worse. Specific areas Historic Environment Strategy and Implementation of Historic Environment Act 3.6 Allocations and commentary in respect of the implementation of the Historic Environment Act. The implementation of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2016 was planned to last for five years 2016 to 2021. Budgeted expenditure for implementation finish ed in 2020 -21. While there will still be some annual costs associated with the Act, we have moved out of our planned implementation phase and any costs will be covered as routine expenditure from normal Cadw budgets . Cadw 3.7 Allocations and commentary in respect of Cadw including revenue generation targets, and recent annual income generation figures. Income figures increased very significantly from the 2013 -14 figure of \u00a34.8m. This was the result of a number of initiatives to attract more visitors to sites, including investment in the facilities, together with price increases. The commercial income figure for 201 9-20 was \u00a3 8m - a record for Cadw . As a result of the restrictions due to the pandemic, the figure fell to just \u00a3 1.2m in 2020 - 21. In 2021 -22, a ll Cadw sites were closed to visitors at the beginning of the financial year and only began to parti ally re -open as restrictions started to be lifted. Consequently, visitor numbers and commercial income were very low during the early part of the year. Most staffed sites were able to fully reopen from 7 August when we moved to Alert Level 0. Since then, c ommercial income figures have recovered more strongly than originally expected, perhaps as a result of the continuing restrictions on international travel and therefore the large numbers of people holidaying in Wales. The revised forecast income figure for the year is currently \u00a36.2m although of course there remains uncertainty, particularly given the possibility of the re -introduction of some restrictions . Cadw is currently undertaking major work at Caernarfon and Caerphilly castles which includes investm ent in new cafes, aimed at increasing the number of visitors and therefore commercial income figures in the future. The capital budget of \u00a310m per annum going forward will enable the completion of this work; together with significant investment in some of Cadw's other sites. Cadw were successful in retaining the majority of its members during 2020 -21, with a retention rate of 91% , together with securing some new members, despite the pandemic and the fact that sites were closed for the majority of the year . This was achieved by offering extensions to memberships or discounted prices. This protected income streams for the future, and the number of members has increased to some 47,000, compared to 44,500 at the end of March 2021. The deficit in 2020 -21 and p rojected deficit in 2021 -22 is being covered by additional funding from the Welsh Government. 14 More broadly, Cadw is working for an accessible and well-protected historic environment for Wales. It looks after, and provides access for the public to, 130 monuments across Wales. Of these, 29 are staffed sites and the remainder are free open -access sites. Capital expenditure on the conservation of monuments also remains an important priority. 3.8 Allocations towards funding for owners of historic assets There are more than 30,000 listed buildings and 4,200 scheduled monuments in Wales, and the majority are in private ownership. Most of those owners conscientiously care for their properties, which constitute a precious legacy for present and future genera tions . Cadw has published an extensive range of guidance and signposting to available grant funding which can be d ownloaded without charge from the Cadw website. My Cadw officials are always happy to provide advice on general queries relating to historic assets, but specific enquires relating to the management of listed buildings are the responsibility of the local p lanning authority. However, if proposed works or other matters raise difficult questions, my officials are happy to offer advice in pre -application discussions involving all parties. The listing of a building or the scheduling of a monument brings no en titlement to grant assistance. As with any building, the maintenance liability is a matter for the owner. However, Cadw does have grant schemes which are underpinned by the core objectives of our national strategy - Prosperity for All . Value for money j udgements are made on the submission of costed estimates by the applicant, assessed by Cadw's Inspectors. Cadw has the following capital grant schemes: Listed Building Grants - for the repair and restoration of listed historic community assets such as village and community halls, institutes, libraries, and historic places of worship which are open for wider community use. Ancient Monument Grants - Ancient monuments can range f rom Neolithic burial chambers to buildings of the industrial revolution. Many are vulnerable and we recognise that repair works may be costly or may not always be in the financial interests of the owner of the monument. 3.9 Allocations and commentary in respect of the National Museum of Wales and the National Library of Wales, including any revenue generation targets. The National Library of Wales and Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales are both important and high profile cultu ral organisation s. They are pro -active in delivering Government priorities and engaging the people of Wales in cultural activities as well as important facilitators for projecting Welsh culture internationally. After a long period of standstill budgets, w e were able to increase the baseline revenue grant in aid for these two national organisati ons in 2021 -22 and also provide a small uplift in funding to support the delivery of the cultural strategy from 2022 -23.3 3 To note that in 2021 -22 additional non recurrent funding of \u00a30.750m was made available to the Library to support the implementation of the recommendations from the Tailored Review. 15 National Library - Total Budget \u00a344.231 m - revenue \u00a333.981m, non cash \u00a33.750m and capital \u00a36.5m over three years The capital budget will enable the Library to progress the important work commenced to address the carbon footprint of the national institution. There is provision to meet the statutory obligations of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 . The National Lib rary's commercial annual income generation target is \u00a3 0.7m. The Library does well in attracting charitable donations and bequests but finds the commercial income generation target challenging, with less on -site options for generating revenue when compared to the Museum with its shops and cafes across seven sites. One of the recommendations of the Tailored Review was that the Library commissioned a report into its commercial potential. This is now underway but the findings are not yet available. The Library has commissioned reports on the contribution it makes to the local economy and to its potential as a cultural tourism destination. National Museum - Total Budget \u00a3 98.724 m - revenue \u00a377.074 m, non cash depreciation \u00a37.2m and capital \u00a314.5m over three years Total c apital funding of \u00a314.5m over three years will support decarbonisation and digital priorities and help address the challenges of operating in historic buildings, the need to keep our national collections safe, and the requirement to provide contin ued and safe public access whilst maintenance work is ongoing. The National Museum has to manage these challenges across seven different sites. Capital maintenance funding is not just about fixing existing issues - although there is currently a backl og of capital maintenance work, i t is also about supporting work streams which will improve visitor experience and increase the bodies' ability to generate additional revenue from their refreshed and upgraded public spaces. The Museum's gross target for incom e generation is \u00a35.5m, with a net target of \u00a31.3m. The National Museum does not charge - free entry to the National Museum of Wales sites remains a Government commitment. This is an important policy in terms of removing barriers to participation in cultura l activities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds and/or those on low incomes. It encourages repeat visits and community use of our National Museum of Wales sites and facilities. Royal Commission for Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales - Total B udget \u00a35.632 m - revenue \u00a3 5.080m, non cash depreciation \u00a30.402m and capital \u00a30.150 m over three years The Commission has a leading national role in developing an appreciation of Wales' archaeological, built and maritime environment. The Commission cares for a vast and unique collection of photographs, maps, images, publications and reports supported by a team of expert staff and p provides high quality digital content, services and resources which is easily accessible to national and international audience s. All three of these national organisations are part of the Historic Wales Partnership. Given the extreme pressure on our revenue budget s, there will be an even greater need in 202 2-23 for collaboration between all the bodies within the Historic Wales partnership and to explore what efficiencies c ould be gained through effective joint -working: via commercial partnerships and potential shared management of back -office functions. 16 3.10 Allocations and commentary in respect of the Libraries and Museums Strategies. We will create and publish a new culture strategy for Wales , which will define our priorities for the years ahead, including funding allocations. Funding is provided in the L ocal Culture and Sport budget over the next three years. The libraries and museum sectors in Wales will feed into the process to develop the new culture strategy . We will extend our Capital Trans formation Grants programme to fund a greater range and value of projects, including digital projects, to support decarbonisation and those to promote equalities. Funding for this is included within the local culture and sport budget. 3.11 Funding allocated to take forward recommendations in the Review of Local Mus eums Consideration of the recommendations from the Expert Review of Local Museum Provision in Wales - 2015 will be included within the culture strategy. The viability of the key recommendations hinged on implementation of the cre ation of three regional bodies . This remains a decision for local authorities across Wales. The Welsh Government explored the recommendation further via the feasibility study 'To Create and Run a Regional Museum Structure', completed in summer 2019. Both the original Review and this feasibility study recognised that the recommendation s had sig nificant cost implications and since 2015 the creation of re gional bodie s was not deemed a priority by l ocal authorities. We will explore a Welsh scheme to identify objects of national significance within local museum collections, in line with the recommendation on 'Collections Wales'. This will enable a better understanding and protection of the collections that the local sector holds in trust for the public, some of which are on a par with those held by our national organisations in their significance. Currently, there is no way to map, understand and identify th ose important cultural assets. 3.12 Allocations and commentary in respec t of the Arts Council of Wales 3.13 Allocations and commentary in respect of funding to promote access to the arts Arts Council - Total Budget \u00a3101.127m - revenue \u00a399.570 m, non cash \u00a30.357m and capital \u00a31.2 m over three years Our primary investment in the arts sectors is via Arts Council Wales. Working with Arts Council of Wales, will continue to support and promote the vital contribution that the arts make to Wales, to foster a n environment in which the arts are able to flourish - an environment which identifies and nurtures creative talent, wherever it is found in Wales, to its full potential. Specific priorities for the year include promoting equalities as the foundation of a clear commitment to reach more widely and deeply into all communities across Wales and strengthening the capability and resilience of the sector, enabling creative talent to thrive. In this budget we are maintain our investment in the Arts Council of Wa les and enabled a slight increase to support the culture strategy from 2022 -23. Before the pandemic more than four million people attended events presented by members of the Arts Council' s Arts Portfolio Wales. In 2019 -20, 87% of the adult population in Wa les had attended arts events, and 86% of children and young people had taken part in arts activities. 4 Funding will help generate the cultural 4 Annual Surveys | Arts Council of Wales 17 capital for recovery that nurtures the creative industries with knowledge, skills and ideas and continue to stab ilise the sector, maintaining employment and work opportunities. Increasing and diversifying levels of access and participation in the arts continues to be a priority in the Government's Remit letter to Arts Council. The Arts Council of Wales uses the majority of its grant -in-aid to core fund 67 key strategic arts organisations and we expect them to continue to prioritise access and engagement work. The five year Corpor ate Plan 2018 -23: For the Benefit of All emphasises the commitment for an increased focus on access, equaliti es and diversity and identifies, including via the upcoming Investment Review. Our investment in major culture capital projects, especially Theatr Clwyd and the National Contemporary Art Gallery is designed to tackle inequalities and provide better access, including to north and mid Wales. Funding for the se projects is provided in the Local Culture and S port budget, and is subject to consideration o f relevant busine ss cases. Further detail provided in section 4. 3.14 Allocations and commentary in respect of funding aimed at using arts and culture to tackle poverty. The Arts Council of Wales is a key strategic partner in the Fusion programme, suppor ting organisations to participate by providing practical advice and brokering introductions between Fusion partners and artists/arts organisations in their areas. Where relevant, it publicises opportunities and disseminates information via its e -news, web site and to Arts Portfolio Wales clients. The Arts Council continues to reach out to those disadvantaged communities via the Arts Portfolio Wales clients and is also seeking to directly engage with those communities. Further information on Fusion is provided at section 3.2. 3.15 Allocations and commentary in respect of funding aimed at encouraging/enabling arts organisations to generate more of their own income. The Arts Council of Wales Resilience Programme has been significantly tested during the pandemic with substantial funds being required to keep a number of the Arts Portfolio Wales Organisations solvent. The resilience programme will require further monitoring and support until the Arts sector is able to r eturn to normal operating circumstances. The Arts Council of Wales's Resilience Programme ensures that cultural organisations are more business -focused, professional in their management and operation, and able to develop and manage their activities to ens ure long -term stability and financial security in a challenging financial climate. This \u00a32m fund has supported 57 of the 67 Arts Portfolio Wales organisations to share best practice, models of delivery and pilot different approaches to long term sustainabi lity. This has proved hugely beneficial for the 85% of the Art Council of Wales's core revenue portfolio who are signed -up to the programme. We will continue to support Arts and Business Cymru, as it provide a vital link between business and the arts, g enerating funds to support artists. 18 Media and broadcasting 3.16 Allocations and commentary in respect of any funding for the media and broadcasting. In 2021 -22 a total of \u00a33.760m was awarded to the Books Council of Wales to support the publishing sector in Wales. This included revenue funding for Golwg Ltd and the Digital Welsh - language News Service, Golwg 360. Publishing organisations have also been supported through the Cultural Recovery Fund. A Memorandum of Understand ing was announced between Creative Wales and the BBC to build on the existing positive relationship between both parties and to capitalise on opportunities to work jointly and with partners to support the further growth of the creative industries in Wales. A key focus of the BBC MOU is ensuring maximum benefit to Wales from public service broadcasting activity and investment. In 2022 -23 an annual budget of \u00a33.760m has been set aside for the continued funding of Books Council of Wales initiatives, including the Digital Welsh -language News Service. Work to develop Memorandums of Understanding with other public service broadcasters in Wales will continue, to support increased partnership working on broadcasting issues and funding opportunities for Welsh organisations. The Wales Public Interest Journalism Working Group will also provide an important mechanism for identifying further opportunities to support the sector through additional ta rgeted investment in -year. We will also explore the creation of a shadow Broadcasting and Communications Authority for Wales, particularly how it would support the Welsh language. Additional funding for these initiatives has been made available from the Co-operation Agreement. 3.17 Details of spend from the Independent Community Journalism Fund, including how these funding decisions were made, and what outcome they are intended to achieve. The Independent Community Journalism Fund is now closed and no funding has been provided in the financial year 2021 -22. The Fund was open to applications between April 2019 and March 2020, and emergency COVID -19 funding was provided to cover the period April 2020 to October 2020. 3.18 Allocations and Commentary i n respect of any funding for the development of Creative Wales (including fun ds to be distributed by Creative Wales) The Draft Budget total allocations over three years for Creative Wales are revenue \u00a321.364m and capital \u00a315m (including the Books Council of Wales). In 2021 -22 Creative Wales total budget allocation is \u00a3 12.427m. Creative industries in Wales including film and television production, digital and musical production representing one of Wales' fastest - growing sectors, with an annual t urnover of more than \u00a32.2bn and employing over 56,000 people, 40% more than 10 years ago. Film and TV companies spent around \u00a355 m in Wales in 2018, supporting local businesses and also contributing to tourism and awareness of Wales. As one of the pillars for the international strategy the budget, the additional investment of \u00a31m will strengthen the offer and further promote our int ernational reputation as a centre of excellence for production and high end TV drama, with major studios such as Disney , Netflix and HBO all choosing Wales for their productions. The creative industries sector is extremely well placed to support the post -COVID economic recovery and it is estimated that the number of new creative jobs created in Wales by 2025 would be 8,051. 19 Based on the 22% growth rate of creative industries jobs in Wales between 2011 and 2020 and whilst still considering the impacts of Cov id-19 on the sector, this figure could increase to 12,386 by 2029 with enough spend and investment. Creative Wales capital and revenue budgets will be targeted to ensure Wales capitalises on the growth opportunity, as well as ensuring wider cultural, socia l and wellbeing benefits are maximised. The last decade has seen a 125% growth in production spend, with the Film and TV industry being one of the fastest growing sectors in the UK economy. UK film production alone reached a national spend of \u00a32billion in 2019, shooting some of the biggest globa l hits. Amazon, Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix and others are all making new content with billion \u00a3 budgets and Wales is seen as a very favourable location to produce these shows. The potential to secure these major international brands with a guarantee on inv estment of at least 10:1 while also providing significant training and apprenticeship opportunities is a real opportunity for Wales. Since March 2020 Wales has invested circa \u00a311m in productions with a return of \u00a3117m spend on the local supply chain, crew and locations. Investments in productions, provide significant benefits to Wales, providing work for our large freelance community, but also to include young people and new entrants to the industry in a variety of roles such as craft, hair, make up, costum e, accounting and electrical. As a relatively new body, Creative Wales continues to develop its approach to measuring success. A KPI Framework is in development, in consultation with the Creative Wales Non -Executive Board, mapping our actions to the shorte r term outputs and longer term outcomes we are seeking to realise as a result of our interventions. The Framework will also link our activities to the Wellbeing Goals and Objectives. All recipients of Creative Wales support will be expected to adhere to su stainability principles and provide evidence of practices that aspire for a zero -carbon + zero -waste future for scripted film, high - end TV drama and studio -based production. Projects that do not meet our funding principles that are aligned to the PfG will not be taken forward. Each investment programme will be expected to meet a set of key scoring criteria that will be weighted to reflect the ambitions of the PFG (Skills, fair work, sustainability). We will ensure the Young Person's Guarantee is built into all future funding offers thereby facilitating a firm commitment to investment in skills, training, best practice in recruitment and ensuring opportunities are open to all. Our production funding will also be expanded in 2021 to include projects in the c omputer games, animation and immersive genres. Diversity and inclusivity is embedded in all our activity and the Creative Wales Non -Exec Board have set this as their number one priority. Creative Wales' ambitions for a more diverse and inclusive creative i ndustries sector in Wales clearly align to the Programme for Government's commitments to maximise fairness for all, eliminate equality and to celebrate diversity. We will support delivery of the vision set out in the draft Race Equality Action Plan. We wan t more equal outcomes for protected characteristic groups, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Creative Wales will deliver against a number of the goals and actions set out in the document. The additional funding for broadcasting and media w ill support action to strengthen the media in Wales and explore the creation of a shadow Broadcasting and Communications Authority, as set out in the Labour Co -operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru. Further work is required to agree the how additional fundi ng will be spent, but its aim will be to support a plurality of media and access to effective, accurate and relevant content for Welsh citizens across media platforms in the Welsh and English language. We will seek input on our use of the additional invest ment from the Wales Public Interest Journalism Working Group and use learning from t he pilot fund delivered in 2021 -22 to provide recommendations to Ministers on how additional funding should be allocated. The additional investment for skills will support the development and delivery of a creative wales skills fund . This new fund will align to the Programme for Government commitment for a creative skills board structure, with the new structure having a role in the design of the fund and recommending projec ts to be supported to Ministers. The investment will address an identified need 20 for skills support in the sector and activity will be aligned to evidence, including the findings and recommendations of the Screen Survey Wales report. An important focus of t he fund will be addressing under -representation and supporting accessible pathways to support a more diverse and inclusive bilingual sector in Wales. Alongside the skills work Creative Wales has committed to increase workplace standards and practices. 3.19 An update on plans to provide further support to English -language journalism \"similar to the Welsh Language model\". Creative Wales is exploring options to allocate the \u00a3100,000 revenue set aside in the 2021 -22 budget and future years to support an increase in news provision in Wales. This has included engagement with key stakeholders in recent months, in line with the requirement for this funding to be delivered on an arms -length basis from government. Potential approaches to allocating this funding were discussed at the first meeting of the newly established Wales Public Interest Journalism Working Group in November. The intention is to announce further detail on the use of this funding in the New Year . Support for film and television production 3.20 The latest revenue and projected revenue figures, and occupancy rates for Pinewood Studios /Seren Studios since the commencement of the Management Services Agreement in November 2017. As referred to in the last response to the committee on this matter, the agreement with Pinewood came to an end on 31 March 2020, with Welsh Government temporarily managing the space until a longer term tenant was found. Following a successful period of negotiation, on 1st October 2020 Welsh Government entered into a 10 year lease agreement with Great Point Media, a London based investment company with a portfolio of existin g studio developments in the U.S.A. The lease is on commercial terms, the details of which are confidential. However, the Studio has recently been home to Havoc, a Netflix production being directed by the Welsh film Director Gareth Evans. It is anticipat ed that this production will spend circa \u00a320m on the local economy in Wales. 3.21 T he latest figures for the Media Investment Budget, including total investment, return on investment and Welsh spend (broken down by project). A summary of the individual loans investments, the funding recouped to November 2021 , and the balance of each project that has been supported by the Media Investment Budget is included at Annex B. 3.22 The latest figures for the Wales Screen Fund including total investment and Welsh spend (broken down by project).

A list of the projects is provided at Annex C. 21 3.23 The latest figures regarding the Welsh Government's loan to Bad Wolf Studios including total repayments and Welsh spend (benchmarked against Welsh Government targets). The total investment value in Bad Wolf is \u00a320.447m (with \u00a32.1m yet to be drawn down). At November 2021 actual Welsh spend is \u00a3133.496m against original target of \u00a3133m. Total interest due on the loan arrangement is \u00a31.064m with repayments commencing in 2020 -21. The latest financial detail is provided at Annex D . 3.24 Sport Our work and the work of Sport Wales contributes to many of th e wellbeing goals but primarily those of creating A Healthier Wales and a Wales of Vibrant Culture and a Thriving Welsh Language. The benefits to our mental and physical health of healthy and active lifestyles are clear. By increasing our levels of activity and adopting other good lifestyle behaviours, we can all not only reduce our risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease but also improve our mental well -being and reduce the risk of developing dementia. Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent a nd treat non - communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer. It also helps to prevent hypertension, overweight and obesity and can improve mental health, quality of life and well -being. Sport and active r ecreation can help promote physical activity for people of all ages and abilities. Active play and recreation are important for early childhood as well as for healthy growth and development in children and adolescents. Quality physical education and suppor tive school environments can provide physical and health literacy for long -lasting healthy, active lifestyles. Older adults can benefit from regular physical activity to maintain physical, mental and social health and enable healthy ageing. Sports Wales' strategic plan; Vision for Sport is very clear that Wales can transform into an active nation, leading to population level improvements in health outcomes, educational attainment and wellbeing. However, for this to be achieved it requires cross -sector enga gement. Neither sport, nor Sport Wales, can achieve this alone. Whilst the work undertaken by Sport Wales is aimed at multiple sector outputs, there are key areas of collaboration across government initiatives for aimed at tacking inequalities, education and young people and health and well -being). This collaborative approach includes action at a number of levels including : Collaboration across the sport system (for example, investment into the Urdd and their work across local sport partners and National Governing Bodies of Sport to support \"Towards a million Welsh speakers and enable our tourism, sports, and arts industries to thrive \" Multi sector collaboration at a local and regional level (for ex ample, Sport North Wales includes all primary partners in the sport, health, education, housing and third sector who are working on an agreed collective plan to maximise sport and physical activity opportunities and tackle inequalities); and Multi sector collaboration on a national level - for example our targeted work with WG Health Improvement Division, Public Health Wales, and Natural Resources Wales in tackling physical inactivity and promoting improved mental and physical health. 22 There is a need to re move the barriers to participation to those wanting to access sporting opportunities and the provision of facilities to encourage transgender and ethnic minority participation is a priority. Additionally we have commitments to end period dignity and existi ng facilities need to be upgraded to address these barriers as well as ensuring any new facilities incorporate this thinking within their designs across all aspect of the equality agenda. Our budget plans for 2022 -23 also include an investment in the Arme d Forces Free Swimming Scheme delivered by local authorities and a contribution to the Urban Games which will be delivered by the Urdd . 4.0 Programme for Government commitments On 23 September 2021 the Chair wrote to you asking you to set out the funding allocations for commitments outlined in the Programme for Government under the heading 'Push forward towards a million Welsh speakers, and enable our tourism, sports and arts industries to thrive'. That is ensuring that Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic histories are properly reflected throughout our cultural and heritage sectors including in National Museums [and Ensure the history and culture of our Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic communities are properly represented by investing further in our cultural sector and museum network\"] ; Officials are work ing with equality colleagues, sponsored bodies an d sector stakeholders to develop final goals and actions for culture, heritage and s port following the consultation on the draft Race Equality Action Plan. We intend to go forward with key priorities, as set out in the Action Plan: accountability; funding; celebrating cultural diversity; setting the historical narrative and education. The goals and actions we are finalising are intended to acknowledge and combat past and present disadvantages experienced by Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups; to eliminate discrimination and barriers to the full enjoyment of rights in all aspects of culture, heritage and sport; and to recognise and celebrate past and present racial a nd ethnic diversity in Wales. The intention is that these goals and actions will no t simply be transactional in their ambition but transformational and able to deliver demonstrable changes - leading to equal outcomes for ethnic minority people , particularly ethnic minority women , and equitable access to cultural, heritage and sporting ac tivities that will improve outcomes for all protected groups and support best practice. Discussions are continuing with our sponsored bodies, local sector and other partners, and with community organisations and stakeholders, to identify and agree specific roles. These will vary, on a case by case basis . As an example they could involve discussions to inform the scope or development of work needed, or leading / participating in delivery activity, or in some cases taking responsibility for specific goals or action s. We are funding projects in 2021 -22 year to the value of \u00a3 0.6m , as a first step to delivering our commitments in the Action Plan and will build on this over the next three years. There is further provision in the Local Culture and Sport budget for future years ' revenue and support for capital investments . The main focus of initial project activity is to create a platform whereby a greater understanding of the collections held by cultural institutions across the country is established, the ethnic min ority histories they represent are better understood and the gaps in representation are recognised. This will enable more meaningful, respectful and impactful projects and programmes in subsequent years. The grounding laid this financial year will help to ensure that work over the next few years can be led by our diverse communities and address known underrepresentation. Stakeholders such as Race Council Cymru have been directly involved in ensuring that the 23 proposals funded are relevant and beneficial for our diverse communities, and are also developing further proposals. creating a Creative Industr y Research and Development Fund With regards to the establishment a creative industries R&D fund. We are currently proposing to support a programme of R&D funding available across Wales, to be delivered between 2022 and 2026 by the recently announced 'media.cymru' project. This is a UKRI funded programme being led by Cardiff University, supporting the growth of the media cluster in the Cardiff city region. WG funding of \u00a3500k is being utilised to extend the programme to all of Wales. This is an accessible programme where any creative business can apply for support to develop their R&D, at various stages, under a managed structure. At present it is proposed that \u00a33.5m will be allocated to this activity. The broad plan is for the Innovation Pipeline to have three key funding mechanisms: Ideas Lab - 120 projects - \u00a330k total cost Seed Fund - 60 projects (up to \u00a310k per award) - \u00a3420k total cost Development Fu nd - 60 projects (up to \u00a350k per award) - \u00a32.25m total cost The remainder of the funding, around \u00a3800k, is for bespoke, strategic funds that can be developed as media.cymru progresses. Delivering this funding is considered to meet the programme for govern ment objective of establishing a creative industries R&D fund. Welsh Government officials will play a key role in defining the programme and also in the selection of projects which complement our existing strategies and support. The activities of media.cym ru and Creative Wales are complementary. The provision of and R&D fund also provides essential early stage support for creative businesses that is not easily delivered via existing structures in innovation. Businesses will be able to access follow on fun ding from other complementary CW funding programmes. establishing a National Music Service The Minister for Education and the Welsh Language will be investing an extra \u00a33m per annum over this Budget period to support the Programm e for Government commitment to establish a national music service . This additional investment will take funding support to establish the Service to \u00a34.5m per annum, from the Education and Welsh Language MEG. The model for the National Music Service, in de velopment, is designed to link directly with the Curriculum for Wales, with the aim of ensuring that learners can access and engage in enhanced opportunities for music tuition and experiences. Key features of the model include a core offer of tuition suppo rt for primary and secondary schools with a focus on e -FSM learners, and professional learning provision for practitioners. investing in Theatr Clwyd Investments in our major culture capital projects is subject to consideration of full business cases. Indicative funding is included within the Support for local culture and sport budget. 24 The investment in Theatr Clwyd is a programme for government commitment. To date funding of \u00a33m to progress t he re -development to RIBA stage 4 and preparation of the Final Bus iness Case has been overseen by the Arts Council of Wales. This is due to be presented to Ministers for consideration shortly. The Local Culture and Sport capital budget includes earmarked funding to develop Theatr Clwyd subject to consideration of the business case . establishing a Football Museum for Wales Wrexham Borough Council has been awarded a grant to develop the concept and content of the Football Museum for Wales to RIBA stage 3. The results of this work will then determine the full costs of the project to create a new Football Museum for Wales, and it is recognised that this development will require capital funding from a variety of sources. There is expected to be an ongoing revenue requir ement . The timing of this project is dependent upon the business case and other funding applications. The Local Culture and Sport budg ets include earmarked funding to establish the Football Museum subject to consideration of the business case . establishing a Na tional Contemporary Art Gallery The feasibility study carried out by the Rural Office for Architecture in partnership with t he Arts Council of Wales and Amgueddfa Cymru suggested that a distributed model with 8 -10 sites offering local access to bespoke or touring collections would be the preferred delivery model for the National Contemporary Art Gallery. A key outcome would be to provide local access to the national collection of contemporary art held by Amgueddfa Cymru and the National Library . Further detailed work on developing the distributed model has been carried out and has identified a requirement for a one off capital i nvest ment of circa \u00a35m over 4 years, plus a potential ongoing revenue requirement. The Local Culture and Sport budgets include earmarked funding to establish the National Contemporary Art Gallery , subject to consideration of a business case . Initial work to digitise the collection held by Amgueddfa Cymru is progressing well. These digital assets have been used in a number of innovative ways during the pandemic to increase access to the collection , for example online articles and a participator y website where people can curate t heir own 'top 100' collections and NHS staff selecting items to be reproduced in large formats for display in field hosp itals and vaccination centres. develop plans for a Museum of North Wales The redevelopment of the Nat ional Slate Museum at Llanberis is a key area of capital investment. Amgueddfa Cymru will develop the site into its headquarters in North Wales, and the Museum of North Wales will be located at this site. This will enable collections relating to the region to return to North Wales . The recent announcement of the UNESCO World Heritage status for the Slate Landscapes of North West Wales also places the National Slate Museum in a unique position of being able to operate as the gateway to the dispersed slate l andscapes across Gwynedd. The Local Culture and Sport budgets include earmarked funding for the development of plans for a Museum of North Wales , subject to consideration of a full business case. investment in sport The priorities for sport and physical activity outlined in the programme for government will continue to lead the sector and collaborate with others to encourage and facilitate a population increase in physical activity and to invest effort and resources w here it is needed most; where there are significant variations in participation and where there is a lack of opportunity or aspiration to be active. We will also continue to support the development of community sport across Wales and help 25 sport to nurture , develop and support sporting talent to deliver success that inspires people and reinforces our identity as a sporting nation. The Sport Wales strategy is driven by a person -centred approach to equality, diversity and inclusivity and listening to the l ived experiences of under -represented people will be a key feature of its future work. Sport Wales' investment approach will drive action within the sector to proactively promote equality of opportunity. The related capital investment that we propose plays an integral role in the delivery the above PFG commitments through our primary delivery vehicle is via Sport Wales. The utilisation of Sport Wales' existing capital funding streams through the CrowdFunder and Be Active Wales ensures capital investment across the grassroots network for both on field, and off -field improvements. These funds, targeted on deprivation and wider inequalities, are not only proven to promote equal access to sport, but have demonst rably delivered against this agenda. Whilst this continues for 2021 -22 in building back from the impacts of the pandemic, future investment will allow a transitioning to this building greater resilience and collaboration across these funds. Their existing capital streams also allow investment in 3G pitches through the ATP collaboration group, whilst we continue to scope, plan and deliver against the elite facilities agenda. This is in addition to the proposed direct investment in the National Centres at Ca rdiff and Plas Menai. 26 Annex A - Overview of Culture and Heritage Finances 2020 -21 to 2024 -25 2022 -23 Draft Budget Allocations -23 2023 -24 2024 -25 TOTAL \u00a3'000 Action Supp Budget \u00a3'000 2020 -21 Final Outturn \u00a3'000 2021 Budget \u00a3'000 First Supp Budget \u00a3'000 Forecast \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Support for Culture and the Arts Arts Council Wales 3,730 3,730 3,730 3,730 3,730 Media and Publishing consolidated with Total Media and Publishing -23 2023 -24 2024 -25 n \u00a3'000 2020 -21 Final Outturn \u00a3'000 2021 Budget \u00a3'000 First Supp Budget \u00a3'000 Forecast \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Support for Culture and the Arts Arts Council of Wales 4,702 4,301 1,575 1,575 1,575 400 400 400 of Wales 4,267 3,857 6,697 6,697 6,697 4,500 5,000 Wales 3,095 3,067 3,695 4,695 4,695 2,500 2,000 2,000 6,500 Support for Local Culture & Sport 2,513 2,168 1,430 1,430 1,430 11,700 21,500 Fund) 5,989 6,747 6,989 6,989 6,994 5,000 5,000 5,000 15,000 Total Publishing Books Council of Wales 780 630 30 30 180 Media and Publishing consolidated with Creative Wales WEF 2022 -23 Total Media and Publishing 780 630 30 30 180 Support the Historic Environment Cadw 5,011 5,063 8,731 8,431 8,431 10,000 10,000 10,000 30,000 National Botanic Garden of Wales 195 195 375 375 375 1,200 200 200 1,600 Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments for Wales 35 44 15 15 15 50 50 50 150 Total Support for the Historic 3,595 8,629 8,629 8,629 8,000 8,000 8,000 24,000 Total Sports and Physical Activity 3,579 3,595 8,629 8,629 8,629 -23 2023 -24 2024 -25 n BEL Description Third Supp \u00a3'000 (Feb 21) 2020 -21 Final Outturn \u00a3'000 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3'000 (Mar 21) First Supp Budget \u00a3'000 Forecast \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 New plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Sponsored Bodies Pensions Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museums of Wales Pension Provision - AME 9,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 27,000 National Library of Wales Pension Provision - AME 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 15,000 Sport Wales Pension Provision - AME 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 6,000 TOTAL AME 16,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 48,000 29 Annex B - PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE MEDIA INVESTMENT BUDGET (11 November 2020) Project Investment Value \u00a3m Amount recouped \u00a3m Net Gain / (Loss) to date \u00a3m Targeted Welsh spend \u00a3m Welsh spend to date \u00a3m Pinewood Management Take Down 3.144 1.11 (2.034) 1 1.089 Their Finest 2 2.05 0.05 1.3 1.618 The Collection 1.750[1] 0.556 1.6 1.621 Eternal Beauty 1.05 0.877 (0.173) 1.214 1.255 Bang 0.35 0 (0.35) 1.5 2.562 Tiny Rebel 0.318 0.03 (0.288 ) 0.25 0.26 Goose Green 0.025 0 (0.025 ) N/A N/A[7] Almost Never (formerly True Believers) 0.622 0 2.118 Six investment value includes \u00a3600,000 of grant funding from the Media Investment Budget [2] The investment value includes \u00a3362,000 of grant funding from the Media Investment Budget [3] Don't Knock Twice also received \u00a375,000 of grant funding under the Welsh Government's Business Finance scheme [4] Development funding does not include a Welsh Spend commitment [5] Development funding does not include a Welsh Spend commitment [6] Trampires also received \u00a3652,572 of grant funding under the Welsh Government's Business Finance scheme.

This confirms the final outturn for Welsh Language budgets in 2020 -21 was \u00a337.5 m (\u00a337.1m resource and \u00a30.4m capital) and the forecast outturn (as at period 7) for 2021 -22 is \u00a340.2m (\u00a339.9m resource and \u00a30.3m capital) . 1.3 It is important to note that the aim is to mainstream Cymraeg 2050 into all Welsh Government portfolio areas and there is already expenditure on the lang uage embedded in delivery within many other ministerial portfolios. However further detail is provided below on the specific Budget Expenditure Lines (BELs) within the Education and Welsh Language MEG that directly support delivery of the Welsh Language po rtfolio. Welsh Language BEL 1.4 The purpose of the Welsh language BEL is to support Cymraeg 2050 in relation to increasing the use of Welsh and securing the right infrastructure. Funding within the Welsh Language BEL has increased by almost \u00a31.4m to \u00a322.449m per annum from 2022 -23. 1.5 Additional funding of \u00a31.2m from 2022 -23 has been allocated for the Urdd to provide continued support for the rebuild ing of their services as a result of the Covid -19 pandemic. It will ensure a network of development offic ers are employed to support children and young people in communities across Wales. The funding will also provide a specialist programme that provides Welsh - medium apprenticeship s for young people within our most deprives communities. 1.6 A further \u00a30.3m per annum will support the National Eisteddfod to recover following the financial challenges of having to cancel the Eisteddfod in 2020 as a result of the Covid -19 pandemic. Funding will allow the Eisteddfod to have the necessary resources to help plan fu ture eisteddfodau. With the success of the AmGen Eisteddfod in reaching new audiences not only in Wales but also internationally , there is an opportunity for future eisteddfodau to include a more 3 In Draft Budget 2022 -23, a further \u00a345m is also being invested over three years within the Education Infrastructure BEL to support the Welsh Medium Capital Grant. 3 blended approach, which includes further investment in digit al interaction in parallel with the traditional element of the Eisteddfod. This provides a unique opportunity to showcase and further promote our culture , heritage and Welsh language to a wider audience. 1.7 Finally, there has also been a technical change to transfer out of \u00a30.116m to correctly allocate the Welsh Language Commissioner's non -cash depreciation budget (allocated in draft Budget 2021 -22) to the Welsh Language Commissioner BEL. 1.8 The remaining budget has been maintained from 2022 -23 to support partn ership activities including: Cymraeg i Blant (Cymraeg for Kids) - to support parents, prospective parents and other family members in using Welsh at home, transmit Welsh to their children, and to support children's linguistic development in a social and educational context. Further detail is provided at paragraphs 2.15-2.16; Delivery of Welsh -language training through the National Centre for Learning Welsh. Further detail is provided at paragraphs 3.1.1 -3.1.7 ; Delivering the Welsh Language Technology Action Plan ; Increas ing the use of Welsh , for example through providing grants to the network of Mentra u Iaith, Merched y Wawr , yr Urdd, Eisteddfod Genedlaethol and the Young Farmers Clubs ; Fund ing for the Welsh Language Tribunal ; and Research, evaluation and marketing in respect of the strategy. Welsh Language Commissioner BEL 1.9 This budget (re source of \u00a33.32 7m and capital \u00a30.50m) supports the Welsh Language Commissioner , with further detail on the Commissioner's budget provided in section 3.2 . The Commissioner has wide ranging functions and powers which include: Working towards ensuring that the Welsh language is treated no less favourably than the English language ; Implementing the Welsh language standards system ; Conducting inquiries into matters relating to the Commissioner's functions ; Investigating alleged interference with an individual's freedom to communicate in Welsh ; and Promoting and facilitating the use of the Welsh language with a view to increasing language use - especially within the third and private sectors. Welsh in Educ ation BEL 1.10 The Welsh in Education budget has increased by \u00a34.3m in 2022 -23 to \u00a317.775m , with further increases \u00a33m 2023 -24 and \u00a33.5m in 2024 -25, to \u00a320.775m and \u00a324.275m respectively. 1.11 As part of our Co -operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru, we will be investing an additional \u00a38m by 2024 -25 (\u00a31.5m in 2022 -23, with further increases of in 4 2023 -24 and \u00a33.5m in 2024 -25), to e nsure that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol can increase the proportion of apprenticeships and further education that are Welsh -medium, and for the National Centre for Learning Welsh to provide free Welsh language learning for 16 -25 year olds. This builds on the existing budget for the Coleg which supports Welsh -medium provision across universities, together with F E colleges and tra ining providers by providing training and mentoring through Sgiliaith, to enable tutors and assessors to gain confidence in teaching bilingually and support for the apprenticeship sector to build teaching capacity. The Coleg already has a close working rel ationship with the National Centre and further collaboration will strengthen the support to the Welsh language post -16 sector. 1.12 In addition to the funding outlined in the Co -operation Agreement, f urther investment has also been identified through the repurposing of funding within the Education and Welsh Language MEG to provi de an extra \u00a32.2m from 2022 -23 to support our Programme for Government commitment to expand Welsh immersion provision. This ensures we are able to maintain funding following the additional funding of \u00a32.2m allocated in 2021 -22 for the programme. Further detail is set out in paragraph 2.36 and section 3.1 . We will also provide an additional \u00a30.35m to support the e -sgol programme which will provide total funding of \u00a30.6m per annum from 2022 -23, to further develop the project and provide opportunities for schools and pupils to access this flexible and valuable teaching model . 1.13 The Welsh in Education BEL also supports actions related to Welsh -medium and to childcare provision as a pathway into Welsh -medium education ; The planning of Welsh -medium education to include preparatory work for the implementation of the new 10 year Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs) in line with the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (Wales) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020, which came into force on 1 December 2020. Further detail is provided at para graph 2.33-2.35; Commissioning of teaching and learning resources. Further detail is provided at paragraph 3.1.15 ; Funding for the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and the development of post - 16 Welsh -medium provision is an ongoing process and is part of the targets included in the Cymraeg 2050 Work Programme for 2021 -26 to increase linguistic progression between statutory and further education and to develop apprenticeships. 2. Other Information Information on how the delivery of the Welsh Language portfolio and associated outcomes are monitored and evaluated to demonstrate value for money. 2.1 In terms of ensuring value for money, clarity over how we use our resources effectively is central to delivering the priorities set out in the Programme for 5 Government and the Co -operation Agreement. We have well -established processes in place to ensure th at resources are used effectively for the purposes intended. 2.2 Progress against the Cymraeg 2050 Work Programme for 2021 to 20 26 is monitored annually through a process which includes th e publication of an annual Action Plan at the beginning of the financial year, followed by an Annual Report at the year end to report back on the actions detailed in the Action Plan. Regular reviews to monitor expenditure and outcomes are undertaken to ensure that any available resources are reprioritised to deliver the strategy. 2.3 The Welsh Language Partnership Council plays a role in advising on progress towards the 2050 target and the efficacy of our programmes and interventions. Sub-groups work alongside the Partnership Council and undertake more detailed work and scrutiny for example in the field of community language use, equality and the e conomy. The Cymraeg 2050 Programme Board within the Welsh Government is tasked with assessing risks and identifying steps to mitigate them and mainstreams the strategy in each of the Government's policy areas. 2.4 In terms of research and evaluation, we have an annual Evidence Plan in place that identifies gaps in the evidence on the Welsh language and sets out a programme of analytical work to address these needs. In July 2020, we published an evaluation of the Siarter Iaith and associated programmes, with t he findings and recommendations aimed at informing the future development of the programme. In March 2021, we published the findings of an evaluation of the Welsh Language Sabbatical Scheme for education practitioners. Our analytical work during 2021 has included two research studies on Welsh -medium immersion provision. These focused on published evidence around late immersion provision internationally as w ell as in Wales, drawing on key themes and similarities (report published in June 2021) as well as mapping late immersion provision across Wales (report published October 2021). Both studies have supported discussions around expanding late immersion provis ions around Wales in line with WESP planning, which also led to the commitment of \u00a32.2m revenue funding to support Welsh immersion provision. 2.5 On 10 December 2020, we published a research repor t The effects of COVID - 19 on Welsh language community groups - survey findings . Based on the findings, a Sub Group of the Welsh Language Partnership Council, chai red by Dr Simon Brooks, submitted a number of recommendations . 2.6 I published our response to th ose recommendations in July 2021. We will encourage our grant funded partners to work closely with Welsh language community groups that have been effected by COVID -19 by helping them to restart. We will also look at ways of empowering local communities and support the development of community -led co -operatives and social enterprises. 2.7 Linked to this, we are currently undertaking a Review of the Grant Scheme to Promote and Facilitate t he Use of the Welsh Language. The aim of the review is to assess how the current Scheme has been designed and implemented, and to 6 offer guidance as we plan a funding model to support the future use of the Welsh language. 2.8 We have used the findings of a re search study we published in 2017: Welsh Language Transmission and Use in Families to inform our new policy on Welsh language transmission and use in families , which we published in January 2021. Our Policy provides a basis for a ten -year programme of work. The policy aims to enable those families where there is already an ability to use Welsh to use whatever Welsh they have with their children. One of the first steps in implementing the policy will be to examine work with families in non Welsh language -related fields which uses the behavioural sciences so that we look at what lessons we can learn from this and develop interventions for our language based on these. 2.9 As well as these evaluations, in February 2020, we published The Welsh language and the economy: a review of evidence and methods . The review provides an assessment of the evidence available on the relations hip between language and the economy, and of the methods and approaches that have been used in these studies. As a result of the report, my predecessor established an economy and Welsh language sub -group within the Welsh Language Partnership Council. The s ub-group considered the findings of the report as well as other evidence of the relationship between the Economy and Welsh Language. The aim of the sub -group is to advise Ministers on how the relationship between economic development and the Welsh language can be strengthened and what economic interventions could be implemented to strengthen the Welsh economy, which will in turn also support the Welsh language. 2.10 We have undertaken work to gain insight about what our target audiences think about our language . We are increasing the amount of behaviourally -scientific work we do to increase the use of Welsh and understanding language behaviours and attitudes towards Welsh is one part of this. What we find out will shape our marketing work, the way we target our audience, and ensure that we are engaging with the right audience with the right way of speaking. Together with many of our partners, we are working towards creating a 'one voice' approach to promote the Welsh language, thereby reducing duplication of work . The aim is that this work will also feed into other work, and contribute to creating more favourable attitude toward the use of Welsh. 2.11 Furthermore, our target of increasing Welsh language early years provision by 150 nursery groups by 2028 has the pote ntial to reduce spend on promotion among older age groups, as they help individuals establish robust language practices at an early age. In this respect, Cylchoedd Meithrin contribute to nurturing the conditions which create new Welsh speakers by immersing children in the language and its culture, and by helping to feed Welsh -medium schools. This spend on the early years prepares the ground for further interventions in the shape of, for instance, the Siarter Iaith (which has the aim of encouraging informal Welsh -language use among school children from an early age) . 7 2.12 The digital landscape is also a game -changer for the Welsh language, several elements of which could be considered as preventative or 'once -for-Wales' spend. Our Welsh Language Technology Action Plan involves ensuring Welsh language digital components are created and maintained so that they can be used and reused under a suitably permissive licence by all. The spread of Welsh language technology is also essential for the normalisation of the Welsh language and enabling people to use it in their day to day lives. We launched the Plan on 23 October 2018. In December 2020, my predecessor published a report on progress to date on the Plan . This noted that we had completed, or were implementing 19 of the 27 work packages the plan set out. 2.13 We are committed to using the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act to improve how we make decisions about the social, economic, environmental and cultural well -being of Wales. Our goal is to ensure we reflect the sustainable development principle a nd our spending plans aim to achieve a balance between short and long -term priorities. Information on allocations (and their location) in your portfolio to support Cymraeg 2050 Welsh language strategy, in particular, allocations to achieve the 'milestone s' as set out in the Work Programme 2021 -2026 2.14 Since launching Cymraeg 2050 in 2017, we have been working towards a series of milestones to achieve our targets of a million Welsh speakers and doubling daily use of Welsh by 2050 . We follow a trajectory that was developed based on the 2011 Census. The world has changed dramatically during the past two years and we have committed to review all targets once the 2021 Census data has been released. In the meantime, we are following our detailed Work Plan for 2021 -26 which takes into account how Brexit and Covid -19 have changed society and includes 58 areas of action. Set out below is our progress against the high level milestones. Milestone : a small increase in language transmission rates in families by the 2021 Census, continuing the trend seen between 2001 and 2011 2.15 To support this aim, we will continue to invest in the Cymraeg for Kids programme from 2022 -23 with funding of \u00a30.73 m being maintained . The objectives of the programme are to support parents, prospective parents and other family members in introducing and using Welsh at home and transmitting Welsh to their children, and to support children's linguistic development in a social and educati onal context. This is achieved through series of free sessions for parents and their children, a network of officers support families to introduce and use Welsh at home, transmit Welsh to their children, and support children's linguistic, social and educat ional development. In 2019 -20 before the pandemic nearly 4,000 support sessions were delivered to over 30,000 parents and children. When the C obid-19 restrictions were introduced , the face to face sessions had to stop but the programme responded by moving to online support. In 2020 -21, despite the pandemic, nearly 4,000 live support sessions were delivered to over 7,000 parents and 4,000 children in addition to over 3,700 recorded support sessions. Face -to-face sessions are beginning to be re -introduced wit h the 8 easing of restrictions, but the virtual elements developed continue to be an important element of support. 2.16 Cymraeg for Kids supports our new national policy on Welsh language transmission and use in families. Encouraging families to choose Welsh is an important part of Cymraeg 2050 and this policy outlines how we plan to make sure parents and carers are given the best possible support and encouragement to choose to use Welsh with their children. The Welsh langu age transmission and use in families Programme works in collaboration with Cymraeg i Blant officials to design interventions based on lessons learnt. Milestone: Increasing language use 2.17 All of the interventions in my portfolio, and therefore all corresp onding budget allocations, ultimately have the aim of increasing the use of the language, and are evaluated and monitored to ensure that they are fit for this purpose. This is true of both the Welsh Language and W elsh Language Commissioner BELs . Under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Welsh Government and Welsh Language Commissioner, as well as regulating the standards, the Commissioner has the role of increasing use of the language. 2.18 Projects and partners funded under the Welsh Langu age BEL to increase the use of the language include: Eisteddfod Genedlaethol (The National Eisteddfod) ; The Urdd ; The network of mentrau iaith; Young Farmers Clubs Cymdeithas Eisteddfodau Cymru ; y Wawr ); Bangor U niversity's ARFer pro ject, to increase interpersonal, communication and confidence in the use of Welsh in the wo rkplace via behavioural pledges; A fund to promote the use of the Welsh language in the post -16 sector. The Welsh Cymru; and Our Leading in a bilingual country programme (developed jointly with Academi Wales) . 2.19 While Covid -19 has dramatically changed the world around us, it is encouraging to see how people have positively responde d to the challenge. The new 'Eisteddfod T' and Eisteddfod AmGen were examples of creative responses to the pandemic. The Young Farmers and Merched y Wawr undertook exceptional effort in developing a bespoke voluntary service to support local communities. Many events and activities were held online by the network of mentrau iaith. We've seen more learners than the past three years combined, signing up for the National Centre for Learning Welsh's online taster courses since March 2020. 9 This all shows the impo rtant work our partners have been doing, driving Welsh language policy and delivering Cymraeg 2050 's aims during this difficult time. 2.20 As the pandemic remains with us , we continue to adapt to it. In this financial year we have allocated a n additional \u00a30.2m from the Covid -19 Reserve for the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol , which is being used to support the Eisteddfod to rebuild and support the planning of the Eisteddfod in Tregaron and Pen Lln during 2022 and 2023. As outlined in paragraph 1.6 , we are providing the National Eisteddfod with a further \u00a30.3m per annum from 2022 -23 to support them to recover following the financial challenges as a result of the Covid -19 pandemic . 2.21 In 2020 -21, \u00a31.3m was provided to the Urdd to help the start the rebuil ding of their services and provision. The Urdd faced severe financial challenges in response to Covid -19, with the loss of income from their activities and the residential centres. The additional funding helped the Urdd to establish a network of community and cultural development officers, as well as create a Welsh - medium apprenticeship infrastructure to create new job opportunities for young people. This funding, combined with \u00a3 0.527m provided in 2021 -22 to facilitate free entry to the 2022 Urdd Eisteddfod, a Programme for Government commitment, puts the Urdd on a much stronger footing for the future. As outlined in paragraph 1.5, we are going further by providing the Urdd with an extra \u00a31.2m from 2022 -23 to enable their continued recovery and se cure the community and culture services and provision they provide to children and young people which is vital to our Cymraeg 2050 ambitions. 2.22 Activities funded from the Welsh in Education BEL include the development of Welsh -medium and bilingual early yea rs provision, the development and implementation of the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs), support for FE colleges and training to enable tutors and assessors to teach and train learners bilingually, support the development of Welsh -medium HE prov ision and lead on post -16 development. Other activities include the development of teaching and learning resources to support the teaching of Welsh and other subjects through the medium of Welsh, as well as bilingual resources to support the new curriculum . All of these activities have an impact on language use. 2.23 The Siarter Iaith supports and promotes the informal use of Welsh amongst school -age young people with the aim of creating bilingual citizens of the future, who will: be instinctive, natural, comfortable, confident Welsh speakers. want to use the Welsh language of their own volition. speak Welsh with each other whether they come from Welsh speaking homes or not. be confident to use their Welsh and have a positive attitu de towards it. be assertive about their Welshness and language use. 2.24 There are four projects secondary schools respectively. Cymraeg Campus operates in English medium primary schools. 10 Cymraeg Bob Dydd operates in English medium secondary schools. 2.25 We will allocate \u00a3713,000 to the programme for 2022 -23. We provide \u00a3138,200 to the Urdd to deliver Cymraeg Bob Dydd and \u00a3 518,770 is allocated to the regional consortia (or in the case of mid and West Wales to the relevant local authorities) to work with schools to deliver the programme. The remainder funds national activities such as the publication of the Seren a Sbarc books and other resources. This project is a key part of our work to increase language use and will be maintained in 2022 -23. 2.26 It's very difficult to measure language use. One way is by conducting language use surveys. Work began on a new Welsh language use survey in July 2019, and was due to continue until the end of March 2021. However, due to C ovid-19, the survey ended earlier than planned, during March 2020. The Welsh language use surveys are the official source for reporting progress against one of the national indicators set ou t in the Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) . According to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2019 -20, 10% of people aged three or older spoke Welsh daily and could speak more tha n just a few words (it should be noted that Welsh speakers who can only speak a few words are not included here, no matter how often they speak the language). This is the same percentage as in the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013 -15. However when looking spe cifically at Welsh speakers aged three or olden in Wales, over half (56%) spoke the language daily (regardless of their levels of fluency) compared with 53% in the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013 -15. There was also a small increase in those who considered t hemselves fluent in Welsh (up to 48% from 47%) and two thirds of Welsh speakers agree (strongly or tend to agree) that speaking Welsh is an important part of who they are. 2.27 Cymraeg 2050 is a cross -cutting policy, supported not just through the Welsh Language and Welsh in Education BEL s. For example, the Sabbatical Scheme and CYDAG are supported by the Teacher Development and Support BEL of the Education and Welsh Language MEG. An additio nal \u00a31m was also allocated to the Curriculum and Assessment BEL in last year's Budget for bilingual resources to support effective implementation of the new Curriculum for Wales. Milestone: Aim to support the expansion of Welsh language early years by 60 new groups by 2026 2.28 Annual f unding of \u00a33.031m to Mudiad Meithrin has enabled it to support its membership of Cylchoedd Meithrin and Cylchoedd Ti a Fi to strengthen and expand its services. The COVID -19 pandemic has intensified the need for this support, p articularly for Cylchoedd Ti a Fi who were unable to meet due to C ovid- 19 restrictions. 2.29 From 2022 -23 we will continue the support for Mudiad Meirthin to expand and strengthen this provision. Despite the pandemic, funding has also enabled Mudiad Meithrin to continue with a programme focusing solely on establishing new Welsh -medium early years provision in areas of Wales where there is a current lack of such services as an access point to Welsh -medium education. 11 2.30 Through this work, 43 new groups were establ ished over the first 3 years of the programme up to 2021 with a target of establishing a further 60 groups set for the subsequent 5 years. The work to develop staff and volunteers at its member settings has also continued, and has this year included sessio ns tailored to respond to the challenges the early years sector has faced during this year. This budget will be maintained in 2022 -23 and Mudiad Meithrin will continue to build early years capacity to provide a path into Welsh -medium education. 2.31 Mudiad Mei thrin continues to promote Welsh -medium education and childcare. One notable example of this is through the Baby Steps into Welsh 'podcast series. Presented by Nia Parry, the podcast provides an opportunity for parents to openly discuss and share their real -life experiences around Welsh -medium education. Milestone: Increase the percentage of year 1 learners taught in Welsh from 23% (2020 to 2021) to 26% in 2026. 2.32 The percentage of Year 2 children (usually 7 year olds) assessed through Welsh as a first language increased by just under 1 percentage point (from 22.0% in 2015 to 2016 to 22.8% in 2020 to 2021). Although the target set in the first Cymraeg 2050 Work Programme of 24% year 2 children in W elsh-medium education by 2021 has not been met, there are encouraging signs in younger cohorts, where 23.8% of Reception class children (usually 5 year olds) were taught in Welsh in 2020 to 2021. Work in this policy areas inclu des a number of different str eams. Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs) 2.33 We have allocated funding of \u00a30.1m from the Welsh in Education BEL to support work on the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs). Under this work stream, new Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 came into force on 1 December 2020 setting out new arrangements for the preparation and implementation of Welsh in Education Strategic Plans. New provisions include the introduction of longer term Plans (10 years) as well as Pl ans that are prepared on the basis of clear, ambitious targets. These targets have been calculated in such a way as to demonstrate the contribution individual local authorities need to make in order to support the Welsh Government's Cymraeg 2050 education milestone targets. 2.34 Our efforts in 2022 -23 will concentrate on supporting local authorities in their preparation of new 10 year Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs). This will include: Advice and guidance around communication and promotion of Welsh -medium education (including a package of digital resources for LAs to use). Procurement of Welsh language and education consultants to advise LAs on aspects of WESP implementation, such as progression from Welsh -medium primary to secondary provision and wo rk around school categorisation and immersion . Support to implement the new WESPs. 12 2.35 We'll also develop proposals during this Senedd term for legislating to support the strategy for the acquisition and lifelong learning of Welsh through the Welsh - medium Edu cation Bill. Late immersion 2.36 Late immersion plays an important park in our work to increase the percentage of learners who attend Welsh -medium education. Further detail is included in paragraphs 3.1.8 -3.1.11. Categorising schools according to Welsh -medium provision 2.37 Furthermore, we held a consultation on guidance around categorising schools according to Welsh -medium provision which ended on 26 March 2021. This is to enable schools and local authorities, as part of our Cymraeg 2050 commitments and delivering the Curriculum for Wales, to identify themselves in the right category of school and develop a clearer plan for moving along the language continuum by increasing the amount of Welsh offered. For many local au thorities, this policy will support their WESP targets by improving the planning of Welsh - medium education in their areas and enable more learners to follow a Welsh - medium education and / or learn Welsh successfully. We aim to publish the revised guidance around school categories in December 2021. Welsh -medium Education Bill 2.38 We'll also develop proposals during this Senedd term for legislating to support the strategy for the acquisition and lifelong learning of Welsh through the Welsh - medium Education Bil l. Milestone: support growth in the number of teachers in Wales who can teach Welsh or teach through the medium of Welsh by 20 31 as follows. 2.39 The Education and Welsh Language MEG will continue to provide support for activities that aim to increase the number of teachers able to teach Welsh or through the medium of Welsh. The Teacher Development and Support BEL includes the following funding from 2022 -23: incentive scheme targeted at Welsh speaking student teachers to encourage them to undertake an eligible postgraduate secondary ITE programme enabling them to teach through the medium of Welsh. The line is demand -led and is highly dependent on recruitment levels into ITE programmes (QTS). In addition, the incentive scheme is paid at two points in a teacher's early career (on award of QTS and completion of Induction) and applicants have a number of years in which to claim each instalment. Therefore each year's budget allocation covers a number of cohorts up until their respective deadline dates and the final allocation and spend varies depending on demand in the previous year. Additional funding will be invested ov er the next three years to implement the forthcoming 10 -year plan for the Welsh in education workforce. A total of 13 \u00a31.845m will be allocated in 2022 -23 (an increase of \u00a31m) with further increases of \u00a30.5m in 2023 -24 and \u00a32m in 2024 -25. This funding will be prioritised to support the aims of the plan, and is likely to include funding for the following amongst other developments that are still under consideration: - expansion of the primary -secondary Welsh -medium conversion programme to provide support for tea chers to transfer from teaching in the primary sector to teach in secondary. - work with Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and other stakeholders to increase the number of learner choosing to study Welsh at A Level in order to increase the future number of Welsh te achers. 2.40 I will be publishing figures in relation to progress against this target in the Cymraeg 2050 Annual Report for 2020 -21. 2.41 The National Centre for Learning Welsh is leading on a pilot project to incentivise young Welsh speakers to return from univer sities to help teach Welsh in schools. They will be working with partners in the education sector to offer a training course for students at the end of the academic year. In future years the project will also include a placement period in a secondary schoo l. It is hoped that this project will attract young people to teaching, and the Learn Welsh sector whilst also helping to increase the use of Welsh in schools. 3. Specific Areas 3.1 Updates on allocations in 2021 -22 budget Information on the allocation of \u00a313.01 million for the National Centre for Learning Welsh, and an update on the \u00a30.2m of funding that was redirected to fund Welsh language infrastructure projects. 3.1.1 We allocated a total of \u00a313.01m from the Welsh Language BEL to the National Centre for Learning Welsh (the Centre) in 2021 -22. This allocation was split as follows: \u00a38.660m to fund the 11 providers who deliver the training courses, \u00a32.5m for the Cymraeg Gwaith (Work Welsh) initiative and \u00a31.85m to maintain the running costs of the Centre. 3.1.2 Following an in -year reduction in funding during 2020 -21 due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the allocation for 2021 -22 reinstated the Centre's budget to the pre - COVID -19 level (2020 -21 final budget) with the exception of \u00a30.2m. Th is \u00a30.2m was redirected to fund Welsh language infrastructure projects. 3.1.3 In relation to linguistic infrastructure, a number of steps were taken during this financial year including establish ing a panel to tackle issues of orthography, and a task and finish group to standardise terms in the field of equality, race and ethnicity. Between 16 March and 6 July 2021, we conducted a consultation on a draft national policy for Welsh language linguistic infrastr ucture. This groundwork is a great step forward in this policy area and was required before we could progress further. 14 3.1.4 The reduction of \u00a30.2m in the Centre's funding did not affect the levels of service to learners and did not result in any job losses wi thin the sector. The reduction was made possible by operational savings brought about by a large reduction in face-to-face lessons taking place, and due to the Centre developing different ways of working during the COVID -19 crisis. 3.1.5 Due to COVID -19, the v ast majority of the Centre's Learn Welsh provision is being delivered on line during 2021 -22. Approximately 1,500 classes were moved to on line platforms, and around 500 tutors delivered lessons from home to 13,000 learners in on line classrooms. This shift i n learning was made possible by the Centre reprioritising its work programme and accelerating the development of digital resources to facilitate the on line learning. 3.1.6 The Centre also invested in developing new blended courses which were launched in May 20 20. These courses allow learners to do some independent learning using online resources but also have formal regular contact with a tutor and other learners. 880 learners have registered on these blended courses. The Centre has also continued to invest in developing self -study online resources, some of them developed for staff working in specific sectors. 3.1.7 Cymraeg Gwaith's funding was fully reinstated to \u00a32.5m in 2021 -22 which has allowed that important initiative to return to its full capacity and to enh ance the support it can give to specific sectors. Some face -to-face Cymraeg Gwaith courses have also restarted in the Nant Gwrtheyrn language centre. An update on applications for, and distribution of, the additional \u00a32.2 million fund announced to suppor t school -level late immersion Welsh language learning. 3.1.8 The Cymraeg 2050 Work Programme for 2021 -26 and the Programme for Government include our commitment to extend the Late Immersion Programme to ensure that all newcomers to the language are able to acce ss Welsh -medium education when and where they need it, wherever they are on their language journey. 3.1.9 On 14 September 2021, we announced an investment of \u00a32.2m in this financial year to support Welsh learners undertaking late immersion in schools and to support Welsh learners' progression in light of COVID -19. This grant funding is dedicated to expanding Welsh -medium late immersion provisions in schools and centres and each local authority had the opportunity to apply for funding of up to \u00a3100,000 for expend iture before the end of March 2022. This grant funding is specifically aimed at projects that will contribute to reaching the million Welsh speakers target. It will support investments that facilitate the development or growth of Welsh -medium immersion pro vision in particular: Support the development of latecomers centres / new immersion provision or expansion of existing provision. Training for staff in the provision of a Welsh -medium immersion teaching methodology. 15 Projects that mitigate the effects of COVID -19 on learners in Welsh -medium education, having identified groups in need of additional language support. 3.1.10 In order to support the local authorities to prepare their bids, officials hosted two local authority meetings. This led to the submission of strong bids by all local authorities for the \u00a32.2m funding. Key funding requests include: additional teaching time to expand current immersion provision or COVID related learner support; pilots for 'pop up' immersion provision; procurement of specialist training in immersion methodologies and resources; scoping projects to establish latecomer provision based on other LA models. Grant letters based on the bids submitted were issued to all local authorities on 1 December. This funding has been welcomed by loc al authorities and school practitioners across the board. 3.1.11 In this Budget, an additional \u00a32.2m has been allocated from 2022 -23 onwards to further enhance late immersion provision across Wales and w e will monitor progress closely. Information on the \u00a31.6 5 million within the Teacher Development and Support BEL to support the Sabbatical Scheme, and an update on the additional \u00a31m allocated for bilingual resources to support effective implementation of the new Curriculum for Wales. Sabbatical Scheme 3.1.12 We pro pose to continue to support the Sabbatical Scheme from 2022 -23 with an approximate budget of \u00a33.6m per annum , to retain the same level of funding as previous years. The budget for the Sabbatical Scheme was previously drawn from the Teacher Development and Support BEL and the Raising School Standards BEL. From 2022 -23 onwards, all funding will be allocated from the Teacher Development and Support BEL. 3.1.13 Following the publication of the evaluation of the Sabbatical Scheme in March 2021, we have been working with providers and the regional consortia and local authorities to address the recom mendations and plan the provision for the 2022/23 and 2023/24 academic years to ensure that we are supporting local needs for improving the teaching and learning of Welsh. We have also worked with the providers to ensure that the courses can continue to be held via blended learning models, to provide more flexibility for schools and practitioners. 3.1.14 In addition to the Sabbatical Scheme, a total of approximately \u00a32.7m has been allocated annually to the regional consortia and local authorities to support the local and regional delivery of Welsh language support for practitioners. We have also worked with the National Centre for Learning Welsh during 2021 -22 to develop self -study courses tailored for education practitioners. 16 \u00a31m bilingual resources 3.1.15 Work is well underway developing resources and supporting materials for schools and settings linked to the Curriculum for Wales. We are prioritising development linked to notable changes in curriculum requirements and agreed priorities. These include new b ilingual resources covering aspects of curriculum and assessment design and development, as well as those covering curriculum areas, including: Reading Mathematics and numeracy International languages British Sign Language Careers and work related experiences Media literacy and misinformation Politics Children's rights Welsh history, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic histories and contributions Global citizenship Music Dance Details regarding the allocation of \u00a3 0.73 million for 'Cymraeg for Kids' and how it has been utilised. 3.1.16 Details regarding the \u00a30.73m allocation for Cymr aeg for Kids is outlined in paragraphs 2.15 -2.16. 3.2 Welsh Language Commissioner Allocations and commentary in respect of the budget allocation for the Welsh Language Commissioner in 2022 -23. 3.2.1 The resource allocation for -23 is \u00a33.327m, maintaining the revenue funding at \u00a33.207m and providing a non - cash depreciation budget of \u00a30.120m. 3.2.2 In his budget estimate for 2022 -23, the Commissioner requested additional revenue funding to allow him to fund legal cases relevant to his work and functions. However, we recognise that it is impossible for the Commissioner to accurately predict whether he will need to fund legal cases during a financial year and what the costs will be. We will therefore work with the Commissioner to monitor this situation during the financial year. 3.2.3 In 2021 -22, the Commissioner received an additional capital allocation of \u00a30.138m to sup port essential upgrades to the IT system. Although some of this was planned expenditure, this allocation also helped the Commissioner to recover from a serious cyber -attack in December 2020. We will provide capital 17 investment of \u00a30.050m in 2022 -23 to help the Commissioner to continue with work to upgrade the IT system following the cyber -attack. 3.3 Capital expenditure in relation to the Welsh language Detailed progress on expanding capacity in Welsh -medium schools and the distribution of the Welsh Medium Capital Grant across local authorities in Wales. 3.3.1 This budget is located within the Education Infrastructure BEL of the Education and Welsh Language MEG . The first round of Welsh -medium capital funding during 2018 has supported 46 projects across 20 local authorities, leading to 2,818 additional Welsh -medium childcare and education places. Most of the 46 projects are progressing well , however, t he pandemic has had some impact with the completion dates of some projects moved to later in 2022. 3.3.2 A further \u00a330m was announced in March 2021 to support capital projects dedicated to growing the use of the Welsh language in education according to local WESP needs. The funding is a second tranche of investment from the Welsh -medium Capital Grant, established in 2018 t o support capital projects dedicated to supporting and growing the use of the Welsh language in education. This is on top of the existing allocation announced for Band B of the 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme. The Expressions of Interest window closed on 22 October 2021. Bids in excess of \u00a3125m were received are they currently being assessed alongside draft WESPs and immersion grant proposals. 3.3.3 This draft Budget outlines an investment of \u00a345m over the next three years (\u00a315m per annum) to provide continued support for our Welsh -medium capital programme to increase in opportunities for learners to be taught through the medium of Welsh . The funding required to support outstanding commitments against the first round of investment will continue to be managed as part of the 21st Century Schools and Colleges programme. Summary The budget as relevant to the Welsh Language in the Education and Welsh Language MEG Draft Budget for 2022 -23 is presented to the Committee for consideration.

The First Minister has been clear that Climate Change is at the heart of the Government's agenda. On 28 October, the Welsh Govern ment launched its Net Zero Wales plan, which sets out the next stage in our pathway (202 1 to 2025) to net zero by 2050. The plan contains more than 120 government policies and proposals, covering every area from peatland restoration to active travel, and f rom green skills to renewable energy. The portfolio's mission is to deliver net zero and to manage climate risk for Wales. Our statutory advisors, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), suggest that the costs to Wales of transitioning to Net Zero will be sub stantial (in the order of \u00a31.4bn in 2025) and that investment in low -carbon technologies needs to increase significantly over carbon budget 2, which coincides with this Government term. Llwybr Newydd - Wales Trans port Strategy sets out a long -term vision for an accessible and sustainable transport system. It contains four high -level cross -cutting 20-year ambitions that can deliver wider benefits to people and communities, to the environment, to the economy and places, and to culture and language. These ambitions will be delivered through a set of five year priorities, targeting ways to reduce the need to travel and encourage modal shift. It changes our approach to the way we make decisions and investments. The sustainable transport hierarchy gives priority to meeting the demand for travel by walking, cycling and public transport ahead of private motor vehicles. The investment hierarchy's focus is on measures to manage demand, make better use of existing infrastructure (including joined up planning b etween transport and land use), and on widening and promoting sustainable travel choices. Preventative Spend Our interventions across the portfolio action primary intervention, building resilience and creating the conditions to prevent future problems. A number of measures are being delivered across the Strategic Road Network (SRN) in relation to maintenance and safety considerations. These are more fully described within the Economic Infrastructure at section 3 . 2 Flood and coastal risk management is f ocused on reducing risk to life. It does so by preventing incidents of flooding and erosion which would otherwise cause damage to homes and businesses. We have improved the way we prioritise alleviation schemes to help target funding towards projects in t he highest risk areas which demonstrate the most effective preventative spend. By investing into tackling fuel poverty, we make a contribution to tackling a range of negative impacts including cold related health conditions, excess winter deaths, educatio nal attainment of children and time off school and work due to sickness. The findings of research shows the Warm Homes Nest scheme is having a clear positive impact on the health of recipients with a reduction in the use of the NHS by those receiving ener gy efficiency measures through the scheme. Evidence -based policy making Evidence from a wide range of sources underpins our financial decisions such as published research, engagement with stakeholders, previous policy evaluations and statistics. The evidence and scope of the appraisal undertaken during policy and programme development are assessed on the basis of risk, size and scale, existing evidence base and other factors. Feasibility studies are undertaken prior to the commencement of key project s to assess suitability in delivering against our goals, whilst gateway reviews for large projects are completed to challenge all aspects of a business case including the essential value for money assessment. Whilst the reviews are project specific, they h elp to build up a useful source of information for considering other projects. Internal and external audit reports can be helpful in a similar way. We also modelled the carbon value (\u00a3/tCO2e) of a range of individual transport policies as part of the development of Net Zero Wales - Carbon Budget 2, as well as other wider benefits using a Cost Effectiveness Indicator. We are developing a monitoring and evaluation framework for the Wales Transport Strategy t hat will be used to track progress against achieving the priorities and ambitions and identify any areas where further interventions may be required to meet our targets. Our approach to Climate Change continues to be led by evidence. We are led by the science through the work of the Inter -governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and we are advised by the Climate Change Committee (CCC). The ambition set in the Net Zero Wales Plan was informed by our own emissions calculator and we are improving our appr oaches to evaluating carbon impact in our policy development. The Net Zero Wales plan was accompanied by a Sustainability Appraisal and the existing policies captured within the document have all been through rigorous engagement processes, alongside our co mprehensive Integrated Impact Appraisals. These combined approaches then enable us to better target our budgets, to not only reduce carbon emissions, but also deliver on the range of wellbeing goals. We must however continually improve our approaches. 3 A significant number of single use items, usually made of plastic, are provided to consumers at low, or no cost, with an accompanying purchase of food or drink. These items are very small and are of low individual value, both to the end consumer and the retailer. The cost and effort of separating, cleaning and processing them for recycling is often deemed not to be worthwhile. Consequently, a high volume of these products are discarded into general waste, either by the end consumer or the retailer, or are li ttered. In its Programme for Government Welsh Government commits to legislate to abolish more commonly littered single use plastic items. The intention is to influence consumers so they begin to adopt more sustainable behaviours (for example using reusable products) and to prevent the subsequent environmental impacts associated with single use items. The Resource Efficiency & Circular Economy Division is updating key elements of its evidence base for the next 18 months including: New compositional anal ysis of household waste Performance & Efficiency Reviews of all Local Authority Waste & Recycling Operations Piloting DRS operations in a number of local authorities. Consultation with stakeholders The Wales Transport Strategy (WTS) was developed through significant consultation and co -creation with a broad range of stakeholders, over 100 meetings were held during the development period and therefore the strategy itself strongly reflects their views. The draft budget will help us work towards delivering the policies and actions contained within. We will put people and climate change at the front and centre of our transport system and we will help Wales reach net zero, driving wider benefits across health, air quality, accessibility and the economy. The environmental, economic and social impact of commonly littered single use plastic items has been assessed at both a European (via research undertaken by the European Commission) and national level (via Welsh Government commissioned research). We have also undertaken a full public consultation on the proposed regulatory approach and engaged with a range of stakeholders to supplement our evidence gathering process. The success of the legislation will be m onitored through compliance and annual surveys of littering levels across Wales. Well-being of Future Generations Act My draft budget preparations shows how I have sought to reflect the framework of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in setting our spending priorities. We reviewed current trends and future projections and their potential impacts in the short, medium and longer term. We did this to ensure, as far as possible, that short term responses do not have longer term detrimental impacts. For example, our Warm Homes Programme makes significant contributions across many of Welsh Government's wellbeing objectives under our National Strategy 4 \"prosperity for all\" including promoting good health and wellbeing. This is achieved through the creatio n of jobs and business opportunities, long term improvement of the housing stock, reducing carbon emissions and tackling fuel poverty and its range of associated negative impacts on health, wellbeing and educational attainment. The Welsh Government is com mitted to safeguarding our marine environment for future generations, through the sustainable management of our natural resources. A key tool in achieving this objective is our network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) which cover 69% of Welsh inshore water s and 50% of all Welsh offshore waters. The National Forest will take place over many decades, helping to tackle the climate emergency, enhancing nature recovery, providing wellbeing benefits and generating economic benefit for Wales. It will be a lastin g legacy for future generations in line with the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act (2015) . LPfN funds Local Authorities and National Parks to create places for nature where people live, work and access public services. This contributes to goal for a Resilient Wales and a Healthier Wales. Action to halt and reverse the decline in nature contributes t o a Globally Responsible Wales. Through its community led projects, LPfN intends to involve people and communities in the work to restore and enhance biodiversity. The Breaking Barriers fund looks to enable a more diverse range of communities to engage wi th nature. The W ales Transport Strategy (WTS) is fundamentally based around the five ways of working set out in the Act and contributes to all of the goals, all objectives, projects and program mes to be delivered as a result of the strategy are therefore influenced by, and reflective of the F uture Generations Act. The Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy budget will be increased next year to support Wales' transition to a more circular economy that keeps resources in use and delivers the Beyond Recyc ling Strategy. The Strategy was developed using the five ways of working and a separate Goals Assessment was published alongside the final document to demonstrate the contribution of this work to all of the seven goals. The transition to a more circula r economy is key to the delivery of key environmental outcomes - because it can significantly reduce our carbon emissions and our over - exploitation of natural resources, and help to reverse the decline in biodiversity. But crucially it can also improve eco nomic and social outcomes. Economically, through taking a circular approach which shortens supply chains, it can improve efficiency, create employment and increase competitiveness. In terms of social benefits, shortening supply chains and reducing emission s will reduce the health impacts caused by pollution and help to more fairly distribute resources. This will also provide more opportunities for communities to come together to share resources and revitalise where we live. 5 Equality, Welsh language and children's rights assessment The WTS was fully impact assessed through the integrated impact assessment process and representatives all of those groups who share protected characteristics were involved in the process both at drafting and consultation stag e, this included children, older people and all of the commissioners, including the welsh language commissioner. The WTS is therefore reflective of their views and involvement and the budget broadly delivers on the aims and objectives in the strategy. After reviewing the key changes to budget allocations , a number of key programmes were subject to Integrated Impact Assessments covering equality, Welsh language and Children's Rights. Integrated impact assessments are mainstreamed into policy setting as well as budgetary decisions. Some examples are below; The Warm Homes Programme will support improvements in wellbeing as better insulated homes improve educational outcomes for children, decrease mortality from respiratory illnesses, and give people a hig her quality of life. By actively targeting the homes in greatest need the programme will help people from lower -socio -economic backgrounds and people with protected characteristics. Wales is the first country in the UK, and one of only a few countries in the world, to enshrine the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law with the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011. The duties within the Measure are implemented in two stages and place duties on Welsh Ministers to: give balanced consideration to the rights in the UNCRC and its optional protocols when formulating or reviewing policy and legislation; give balanced consideration to the rights in the UNCRC when they use all their legal powers or duties. Across my portfolio, each member of staff is required to consider how their work affects children's rights, and this process has informed the Integrated Impact Assessment. No significant impacts on children's rights have been identified in the se tting of this budget. Covid -19 Reconstruction: Challenges and Priorities The Economic Infrastructure revenue budget has received an increase against the previous 'baseline' of circa \u00a3137m. The primary use of this funding will be to continue to support public transport services to offset the continued impact of Coronavirus on travel patterns and significant reductions in passenger fare -box. We continue to support these areas as part of our long term ambition to deliver modal shift and decarbonise the Transport sector. The funding will be split into 3 key areas Rail services (\u00a3 72m) - This will support TfW Rail Limited in meeting its running costs whilst passenger journeys and farebox continue to be impacted by coronavirus. 6 Bus services BES (\u00a328m) - As with rail this will be used to support the bus industry whilst its passenger numbers and services continue to be impacted by coronavirus. Concessionary Fares (\u00a337m) - This is to offset a reduction in funding available through capital budgets for supporting concessionary travel. This does not equate to an overall increase to the Concessionary Fares budget but ensures that the overall budget envelope (which is funded from both revenue and capital sources) remains consistent with previous years . The Welsh Government's COVID -19 Reconstruction: Challenges and Priorities put the circular economy at the heart of our approach to reconstruction and this has also been reflected in our Programme for Government and more recently the Net Zero Wales Plan. Additional funding was allocated to the circular economy work within last year's budget and this funding has been retained along with an additional increase. The funding is already supporting action across Wales and going forward it will include the funding of the Programme for Government commitments to repair and re -use facilities and co mmunity recycling hubs. Around 60 repair cafes have been set up in communities throughout Wales over the last three years and 11 Benthyg Cymru sites - libraries of things - are now operational where people can borrow items we only tend to use occasiona lly for a nominal cost. Repair and re -use hubs have been supported in several town centres including the Repair and Reuse Centre in Buckley, The Hive in Llandrindod Wells and the recently opened Waste Not hub in Newtown. We have also been working with aca demic partners too including supporting the development of the Remakerspace at Cardiff University, which looks at innovative product design and materials use, to use the equipment funded by the Welsh Government to produce PPE for frontline workers. The Circular Economy Innovation Communities (CEIC) at Swansea University has also been supported to work with the public and third sectors in Wales to support them to introduce more circular practices into their work, like being more resource efficient. The Cir cular Economy funding will also continue to support improved economic resilience through the shortening of supply chains, by for example taking advantage of our world class recycling and supporting businesses to use the recycled materials. The Circular Eco nomy Fund for business has been expanded to \u00a310million over the next three years to increase the support for these opportunities and is an example how circular economy action can deliver both economic benefit and skills opportunities in areas like resource efficiency, whilst also delivering environmental benefits crucial to tackling the climate and nature emergencies. Case studies from businesses already funded includ e businesses such as Capital Valley Plastics, who are producing damp proof membrane from pl astic film, and Heathpak who are producing food packaging from recycled content and innovation including a partnership between Ecodek and Nextek in Wrexham to find new use for single use coffee cups which are being turned into waterproof building materials - finding value in materials which would otherwise be considered waste. 7 Legislation Single use plastics The Programme for Government commits to legislate to abolish more commonly littered single use plastic items. Specific funding has been designate d to support legislative development and implementation. This includes funding for evidence gathering, communication, and awareness raising. Legislation will include banning or restricting the sale of a number of commonly littered single use plastic items and potential charges for unnecessary single use items of any material. The Programme for Government commitment to introduce extended producer responsibility reforms will initially focus on measures to tackle packaging waste and a deposit return scheme for drink containers. This will include bringing forward legislation during 2022 using powers from the UK Environment Act 2021 to implement these measures. Programme for Government Economic Infrastructure directorate are directly responsible for the delivery of 36 Programme for Government commitments and contribute to a range of commitments across the Government. Core to our deliverables in transport is the implementation of the Wales Transport Strategy and the associated modal shift and Net Zero targ ets. The approach to the budget has been to prioritise action that maximise delivery against these two ambitions, while delivering against the Programme for Government. The Environment Directorate is directly responsible for t he delivery of 20 Programme f or Government commitments and also contribute to a range of commitments across the Government . A core part of the Directorates objectives is to ensure we tackle both the Nature and Climate Emergencies and move towards a more Circular Economy. I have approa ched this budget to ensure I allocate budgets to prioritise these Programme for Government Commitments. The Energy and Planning Directorate is directly responsible for t he delivery of 4 Progr amme for Government commitments, however contribute to a range o f commitments across the Government including Housing. A core part of the Directorate objectives is to reduce carbon emissions to meet the net zero commitment by 2050. I have approached this budget to ensure I allocate budgets to prioritise these Programme for Government Commitments and also our statutory duties and to maximise the economic and social value from renewable energy investment in Wales. Biodiversity and green spaces This investment will directly help address the Programme for Government ambition to tackle the nature and climate emergencies, enhance green spaces at all scales, whilst also ensuring we meet our existing and emerging international commitments for biodiversity. Funding initiatives over the next three years such as the Nature N etworks programme, Local Places for Nature, the National Peatlands Action programme and Natur am Byth will not only ensure that our most precious habitats and species are able to thrive, but 8 also help to deliver nature to wherever people live through engag ement with local communities. This funding will also help to build capacity within the sector to help deliver action on the ground benefitting not only our environment but also our health and well -being. Responding to the climate and nature emergencies , and working with Cabinet colleagues Climate change and the environment are at the heart of this government which is why the Climate Change Ministry has been created, bringing together the big policy areas to help Wales reach its legally binding target of reaching Net Zero by 2050. The Transport chapter of Net Zero Wales sets out a range of policies that were developed in the context of the Wales Transport Strategy, as part of that work steps were taken to estimate the carbon impact of policies. This evid ence has been used to shape spending in transport to align our expend iture to Net Zero targets. The new 3 year Infrastructure Finance Plan includes a \u00a31.8billion targeted investment in our response to the climate and nature crisis emergency including the n ational forest, biodiversity, active travel, deca rbonising housing, the circular economy , renewable energy, and flooding. Delivery of the Net Zero Wales Plan will be overseen by myself and other Ministers, including at Cabinet. Many aspects are captured as part of our Programme for Government. Delivery will be tracked by a Business Information Reporting Tool and monitored by a Cabinet sub -group. Supporting these discussions, the senior official led Climate Change Portfolio Board provides strategic governance for the development and delivery of climate policy, taking an informed and joined up view. It is chaired by the SRO, A ndrew Slade. The Board includes all areas of Welsh Government that can contribute to tackling, or are impacted by, climate change and offers opportunity to create synergies. This of course enables opportunities to ensure budgets cohere to drive the change we need, when we need it. Decarbonisation The majority of the costs in meeting our climate targets over the period of the second carbon budget (2021 -25) will not fall directly to Government. However we do fully accept we focus our financial resources to stimulate investment from others. Almost 40% of the total additional capital investment over this period is expected to be in the surface transport sector. This investment will predominantly be delivered by consumers, the private sector and UK Governmen t. The Transport element of this document in section x below provides further details of Welsh Government investment. Just under 30% of total additional investment is expected to be in buildings, with the majority of this investment going into improving e nergy efficiency via retrofitting and 9 installing low carbon heat in existing residential homes and non -residential buildings. We have a long -standing commitment to improve homes in Wales through our Welsh Housing Quality Standards and Warm Homes, Innovativ e Housing and Optimised Retrofit Programmes. This approach is being continued and strengthened. The Warm Homes Programme will receive \u00a3100m capital over 3 years. We will consult shortly improved targeting of this investment. We are investing \u00a3108m per annum via the Welsh Housing Quality Standard to support social landlords to provide good quality warm social homes, to some of Wales' most vulnerable households. WHQS2 will include a focus on decarbonisation of social housing whilst WGs Optimised Retrofit programme will continue to facilitate test and learn to inform long term wider retrofit of all homes, across all tenures in Wales. On - going WHQS 2 investment from 2022 together with Optimised Retrofit Programme funding will continue to boost local prosperi ty through SME growth, and supply chain development. The 1.4m homes in Wales are responsible for 27% of all energy consumed in Wales and 15% of all our demand -side Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The retrofitting of these homes is a primary preventative m easure as it seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes to reduce their carbon emissions to help Welsh Ministers to meet legally binding carbon targets, as well as PFG commitment to decarbonise residential homes through retrofitting. Total cost of dec arbonising the housing stock based on WSA estimates is circa \u00a315bn, of which more than \u00a310bn is for the social housing stock and for homes in fuel poverty. Capital funding of \u00a372m in 22 -23 rising to \u00a392m in 23 -24 and 24 -25 through the Residential Decarbon isation BEL will predominantly be used to support the social housing sector, through the Optimised Retrofit Programme, which will facilitate test and learn to inform long term wider retrofit of all homes, across all tenures in Wales including the developme nt of a survey mapping on a home by home basis the optimum route to retrofit, and then undertaking the measures required to enable the decarbonisation of homes across Wales. Our ambition is to ensure that all social housing landlords participate in this sc heme over the next three years so that they can integrate the decarbonisation agenda within their plan ned maintenance programmes. Finally, approximately 20% of the total additional investment is expected to be in electricity supply, installing low -carbon generation, mostly in variable renewables such as wind and solar photovoltaics. We continue to invest through our Welsh Government Energy Service to stimulate community and publicly owned renewable projects. We will invest a further \u00a365m of capital throug h the Welsh Government Energy Service. We are currently reviewing the service to ensure we target the funding in areas of greatest need. The Net Zero Wales Plan puts the transition to a Circular Economy at its heart with actions for a more resource effic ient Wales found across every part of the Plan from decarbonising the refuse vehicle fleet to supporting businesses to get advice on being more resource efficient. This recognises the critical link between unsustainable consumption and the climate and natu re crises. We have been undertaking more work to decarbonise the waste sector. In 2020 -21, Wales achieved its highest ever recycling rate - 65.4% - avoiding over 400,000 tonnes 10 of CO2 emissions in that year. We have also been working with our delivery pa rtners at Wrap Cymru to develop the evidence base highlighting the environmental and economic opportunities from a more resource efficient country. The budget will support the continued delivery of the Beyond Recycling Strategy which will work to build o n our foundational and globally leading success in recycling to transition to a more circular economy which keeps resources in use. Higher interim emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2040, and a net zero target for 2050 and budget allocations. The Net Zero Wales Plan is focused on 2021 -25, but looks ahead to how we will deliver longer term targets and our investment reflects that. We are targeting investment in areas where technology and supply chains exist today, such as through our public transpor t and active travel investments or where evidence is required to inform future investment, for example through our investment in Local Area Energy Planning and the Optimised Retrofit Programme. Work undertaken to estimate the carbon impact of spending de cisions and how this has influenced the approach to allocations Through the budget -setting process, we sought to further understand both the whole -life direct emissions from construction, operation and decommissioning of our capital investment area, as well as anticipated indirect changes in carbon emissions from behaviour changes and supply chain impacts from the investment. These assessments are difficult and our capability is improving. However a single methodology for assessing is not established. We therefore assessed budgets against a range of methodologies, to ensure we were able to use the best data available, rather than slavishly following a single methodology: 1. We encouraged specific analysis of the carbon reductions associated with the proposed investment area, drawing on the available evidence from Wales, the rest of the UK and beyond. 2. Where available we took data from comparable projects where relevant data existed and scaled accordingly to give an indicative value for the investment a rea as a whole 3. Alternatively, where project -specific information was limited or of uncertain reliability, evidence assembled by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) on marginal abatement costs by type of intervention were used to help to provide indicati ve estimates of cost effectiveness and provide some assurance on orders of magnitude of carbon savings and costs. Work to align the fiscal and carbon budgets Our investments continue to be guided by where evidence outlines the areas in which Welsh Government investment can have the greatest impact. 11 Recognising it is the Net Zero Delivery Plan 2021 -25 which contains the assessment of carbon impacts and actions we are taking utilising all levers at our disposal, with the role the budget to then consi der funding of those actions where evidence supports the need to invest. We must also remain mindful that some of the biggest levers that will drive decarbonisation - for regulatory change for road vehicles - are not devolved to Wales, and remain the resp onsibility of the UK Government. We have built on the work we commissioned and published as part of the Chief Economist's Report in the 2021 -22 Draft Budget package. Through the fundamental zero-based approach of general capital budgets to establish a new 10 year Wales Infrastructure Inve stment Strategy, we focused on better understanding the impacts of our investments on Net Zero. Published in our new Infrastructure Finance Plan are a range of assessments undertaken in each capital assessment area. This is aligned with the Net Zero Delivery Plan which contains further analysis on the impact of the policies and actions of Welsh Government and our partners on greenhouse gas emissions. 12 2.0 Budget Structure 2.1 Summary of Budget Allocations and Changes The 2022 -23 Draft Budget provides a three year spending plan for both resource and capital. The tables below provide an overview of the changes in planned resource funding compared to the prior year baseline, and details of allocations of capital budgets following a zero -based approach to capital allocations in line with the Wales Infrastructure Investment Plan. The resource budgets are compared to 2021 -22 budgets as requested , with the specific Covid related allocations having been removed. Allocations for the financial yea rs 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 also shown . The Fiscal R esource 2022 -23 is \u00a3 703.021 m (not inclu ding Non -Fiscal and Annually Managed Expenditure (AME)). T his represents an increase of \u00a3174m. The N on-Fiscal Resource budget remains at the level of the revised baseline of \u00a3239.121 m. The AME budget has increased by \u00a31.6m to \u00a396.6m, providing cover for charges that are outside the control of the portfolio, such as impairments to the roads and rail network s.

Compared to the 2021 -22 final budget, there is an increase in the Fiscal Resource allocation of \u00a3137m to \u00a3476m, representing that additional \u00a3100m allocation to public transport and a further \u00a337m to maintain the budget envelope for concessionary fares. Th is includes a specific additional allocation to public transport to support reduced fare boxes under the continuing Covid pandemic situation. This will provide a degree of certainty for the sector while restrictions are likely to continue and to help provi de confidence to the sector. The zero -based total capital allocations for 2022 -23, 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 are \u00a3683m, \u00a3557m and \u00a3494 m respectively. The capital allocations support continued delivery of the current National Transport Finance Plan as well as laying the ground for the successor delivery document which will be set in the context of the new Wales Transport Strategy. It is still necessary however to prioritise activity and manage budgets, to ensure that the delivery of schemes within the Nationa l Transport Finance Plan are both affordable and deliverable. The Non Fiscal Resource budget has been increased by \u00a338m to \u00a3229m, compared with 2021 -22 Final Budget, to recognise an additional allocation for depreciation on Core Valley Lines rail infrast ructure.

This infrastructure is the foundation on which we build good quality digital connectivi ty to support everything we do digitally' The ICT Infrastructure budget supports the delivery of this strategy by providing funding to connect premises and to install and upgrade backhaul networks needed to ensure sustainable, resilient connections fit for the future. The main areas of funding supporting this are: Next Generation Access Broadband Wales - a project to connect 39,000 premises to enable access a future proofed fibre to the premises solution enabling gigabit broadband speeds to be achieved Local Broadband Fund - a grant scheme aimed at local authorities and social enterprises to help local communities get access to fast broadband.

We have increased bus support to reflect the 22 continuing challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition allocations have been made to the susta inable and active travel line reflecting an alignment of activity previously funded under the network management BEL where there is offset. The allocation to smartcards are now included in integrated ticketing as part of our wider support for the bus indus try. The concessionary fares envelope of funding is unchanged, the revenue increase shown here is to offset a reduction in funding available through capital budgets for supporting concessionary travel. This does not equate to an overall increase to the Co ncessionary Fares budget but ensures that the overall budget envelope (which has been funded from both revenue and capital sources) remains consistent with previous years. In 2021/22 active travel funding was \u00a376.65m. There is a reduction in Active Travel funding in 22/23 to \u00a360m. We will use the short term reduction in funding to work with Local Authorities and Transport for Wales to develop a high quality, high impact pipeline of schemes to maximise the benefit from record active travel funding 23/24 and 24/25 where funding will be \u00a380m in both years. Also included in the sustainable and active travel BEL is funding for Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) which will be invested in the delivery of our ULEV charging strategy and action plan. Funding for the local transport scheme is reduced in the next financial year in part reflecting a focus on implementing a reduction of speed limits to 20MPH on residential roads, this is now reflected in the road safety BEL, the other element of the reduction reflects th e end of short term funding for roads resilience, further resilience schemes will be considered as part of the LTF.

Revenue funding suppo rts the en gagement and funding of external partners in the public, private and third sectors achieve casualty reduction 3.1 Transport How the draft budget supports the Welsh Government's transport priorities, particularly delivery of the new Wales Transport Strategy and the associated delivery plans and strategies, including how you have prioritised funding, the affordability of your pri orities and any areas of concern. In March 2021 we published Llwybr Newydd: the Wales Transport Strategy 2021. The Strategy sets a vision for an accessible, sustainable and efficient transport system that is supported by 20 year ambitions that are good for people and communities, good for the environment, good for the economy and places and supports a thriving Welsh language and culture. It focuses on three priorities: The first priority is about how we manage travel demand and to bring services to peopl e in order to reduce the need to travel . This is not about preventing travel altogether, it is about planning ahead for better physical and digital connectivity to support access to more local services, more home and remote working. If more people can walk and cycle for everyday trips, we will reduce our dependency on cars. Second priority is about more sustainable services and infrastructure . The Strategy explains how we will allow people and goods to move easily from door-to-door by sustainable transport and how we will invest in reliable, efficient and affordable transport services that people want to use, can use and do use and in the transport infrastructure to support those services. The third and final priority is about encouraging people to make the change to more sustainable transport . Meeting our climate change targets will need people to travel differently. This means making it easier to do the right thing by making low carbon sustainable transport more attractive and more affordable, and by ad opting innovations that make it easier to use. The climate emergency is one of the biggest defining issues of our time. To meet our net zero emission target by 2050, we must act now. Not doing so will leave a greater problem to future generations. Respond ing to climate change requires a change in the way we travel. We need fewer cars on our roads, more people using public transport and more walking or cycling. We won't achieve that level of change unless we take people with us, listening to users and invol ving people in designing a transport system that works for everyone. At the heart of the strategy was the Sustainable Travel Hierarchy, which provides a framework for meeting the demand for travel by walking, cycling and public transport 24 ahead of private motor vehicles, the principles of this hierarchy are fundamental to the allocation of our investment decisions. We have announced a freeze on the development of all new road schemes as part of our efforts to reach our NetZero climate change targets. This isn't necessarily the end of road construction in Wales but it will certainly raise the bar in terms of what is justified as we plan for a future where we make better use of active travel and public transport. It can only be delivered if the limited finan cial resources available are used efficiently and effectively. Hence the need for this Review of both our current pipeline of roads projects and how we approach road construction decisions in future. There is a reduction in Active Travel funding in 22/23, We will use the short term reduction in funding to work with Local Authorities and Transport for Wales to develop a high quality, high impact pipeline of schemes to maximise the benefit from record active travel funding 23/24 and 24/25. Funding will also be increased for road safety to support the roll out of a 20MPH speed limit on residential roads, this will also support the take up of active travel. Alongside continued investment to support public transport in recover from the COVID -19 pandemic, we wi ll continue to invest to complete the transformation of the Core Valleys Lines (CVL) and put place funding for the transition of the bus fleet to electric vehicles. We will continue to support Cardiff Airport. How the draft budget provides for: The impact of, and recovery from, the Coronavirus pandemic, including support for transport providers. The Economic Infrastructure revenue budget has received an increase against the previous 'baseline' of circa \u00a3137m. The primary use of this funding wi ll be to continue to support public transport services to offset the continued impact of Coronavirus on travel patterns and significant reductions in passenger fare -box. We continue to support these areas as part of our long term ambition to deliver modal shift and decarbonise the Transport sector. The funding will be split into 3 key areas: Rail services (\u00a372m) - This will support TfW Rail Limited in meeting its running costs whilst passenger journeys and farebox continue to be impacted by coronavirus. Bus services BES (\u00a328m) - As with rail this will be used to support the bus industry whilst its passenger numbers and services continue to be impacted by coronavirus. Concessionary Fares (\u00a337m) - This is to offset a reduction in funding available through capital budgets for supporting concessionary travel. This does not equate to an overall increase to the Concessionary Fares budget but ensures that the 25 overall budget envelope (which is funded from both revenue and capital sources) remains consistent wit h previous years Specific allocations made in relation to Brexit to mitigate impact on transport services / sectors. This draft budget makes no allocations specifically to mitigate the ongoing impacts of leaving the European Union. However, all our tr ansport sectors continue to feel the consequences of the UK Government's withdrawal agreement, especially through their supply chains and workforce. This is the unfortunate new reality and operating environment we have been put into. All of our budget all ocations will have to accommodate the additional costs that transport services and infrastructure projects now face as a result of the combined disruption of Covid and border friction with the EU. We will continue working with devolved transport services to mitigate the ongoing impact of the withdrawal agreement as far as we can, and with UK Government to press them to ensure that reserved transport sectors, especially freight, are able to keep operating as effectively as possible. Delivery of the rail franchise. The Wales and Borders Rail Service came into public control following the transfer of staff from KeolisAmey to TfW in February 2021 as a result of the impact of Covid 19, and the Core Valley Lines (north of Cardiff) transf erring to Welsh Government ownership and control in 2020. This funding allows for the delivery of the Rail franchise by TfW on behalf of Welsh Ministers. Delivery of the North East Wales, South West Wales and South East Wales Metros. We will continue t o invest in our metro programmes but in a way that is integrated with our core service delivery in bus, active travel and rail, therefore budgets are not separately identified. Short term focuses are completing the transformation of the CVL and investing i n areas that maximised potential modal shift. Delivery of the Welsh Government's rail infrastructure priorities. The Core Valley Lines Transformation Programme commenced in Summer 2020 and will deliver the upgraded track, signalling and electrification work that will allow for increased and faster services to be provided improving access and connectivity to and from valley communities and Cardiff. Welsh Government has committed \u00a3800m for new rolling stock that will provide new, faster, more comfortabl e trains, and allow for increased frequency of services and new routes to be established. We will complete the procurement and introduction into service of whole new fleets of trains by 2024. This will have a significant positive impact by not only encoura ging a greater number of people to make a change by 26 use rail rather than car, but the new South Wales Metro fleet will improve the accessibility of rail by delivering level boarding across the network. The development of Transport for Wales - including a breakdown of TFW's budget allocation, itemising its corporate budget alongside allocations for delivery of specific programmes. This budget makes no specific allocations to Transport for Wales outside the delivery of rail (identified above). Whilst ther e are programmes that we will ask Transport for Wales to deliver on our behalf, including the rail franchise and infrastructure improvements, officials are still in discussions with them about their business plan for next financial year. That business pl anning process will, as usual, confirm the funding allocations available to Transport for Wales and the programmes they will deliver on our behalf. We will be looking for them to demonstrate that they are doing so as efficiently as possible and considering all opportunities for savings to maximise the impact our investment in transport services is able to have for the people of Wales. The recommendations of the South East Wales Transport Commission. We will continue to invest in the delivery of the Sout h East Wales Transport Commission recommendations and the South East Wales Metro in a way that is integrated with our core service delivery in bus, active travel and rail. Investment in the trunk road and motorway network. There are a number of programmes being delivered across the Strategic Road Network (SRN) intended to be preventative. They include: Ash Dieback - Proactive measures to identify and remove diseased trees that could cause safety issues on the SRN. Surfaci ng preventative Treatments - Surface dressing treatments that extend the life of the wearing course of the carriageway, increasing maintenance intervention frequency, lowering cost and carbon. Community Safety Programme - proactive safety programme listeni ng to and responding to communities' needs to improve safety on the SRN. Street lighting renewal - changing lamps to LEDs to reduce costs and carbon. In order to future proof and prepare for the digitisation of the Strategic Road Network we are investing o ver \u00a340m in delivering broadband fibre along 152km of the network. In order to address an estimated \u00a31bn backlog of capital maintenance across all asset types on the SRN officials have developed a Major Asset Renewal (MAR) programme which could be deliver ed over a 5 to10 year period with time scales adjusted to match to availability of funding. 27 The programme would not only address the maintenance backlog but could also deliver many of the ambitions and priorities in the new Wales Transport Strategy particularly around road space reallocation for active travel and public transport and reducing carbon by carrying out maintenance in an efficient holistic manner, using materials with long service lives sourced locally. This programme is currently unfunded . Officials will continue programme development, which will be subject to independent review, whilst managing and operating a safe network. This will be achieved by focusing on prioritising essential maintenance and managing risks whilst delivering on th e WTS objectives such as road space reallocation as budgets allow. Delivery of active travel policy - including a table detailing total and per capita allocations for active travel for 2022 -23, compared with each of the preceding three years. Revenue and capital allocations should be clear and broken down by individual funding stream (active travel fund, local transport fund, safe routes in communities etc). The majority of the active travel budget is used for the Active Travel Fund. It has been established to enable local authorities to develop their local active travel networks which have been planned and are being revised as a result of the Active Travel Ac t. The aim is to achieve a mode shift from cars to active travel and enable shorter journeys to be made routinely by walking and cycling and longer trips in combination with public transport. These carbon emission free modes offer very significant health a nd wider societal benefits beyond their transport function. Since the fund was introduced this has led to a growing pipeline of ambitious schemes that have now either reached or are approaching readiness for construction. Many of these have the ability t o transform many people's travel choices and enable safe walking and cycling trips where these have not been possible before. For 2021/22 the original \u00a356.65m earmarked in the draft budget received an additional boost of \u00a320m with the final budget, whic h allowed to accelerate scheme delivery and development and make more funding available for small scale improvements to ensure tangible change takes place in towns and cities across Wales. The Active Travel Fund is complemented by the Safe Routes in Commu nities Grant, which focuses specifically on enabling active travel to schools, with a particular emphasis in the most recent years on the introduction of school streets, which remove traffic around schools in the morning and afternoon to encourage walking, scooting and cycling, and improve air quality and road safety. Revenue funding is primarily used to maximise the benefits from our capital investments through supporting local authorities in planning and delivery of networks and schemes and through promo ting active travel. 28 The allocations for the current, coming and previous three financial years are shown below. The 2021/22 budget reflects current intentions, but the final position will not be known until the end of the year. Please note that these figures reflect specific funding identified for Active Travel activity. Other elements of active travel delivery form part of wider project costs that cannot be separately broken down, e.g. active travel provision within wider road, public transport and mu lti-modal schemes.

Support for local transport priorities. The duty to prepare Local Transport Plans is transferring from Local Authorities to the four Corporate Joint Committees in 2022. The new Regional Transport Plans will set out how the Wales Transport Strategy - Llwybr Newydd, will be delivered in the region s. CJCs will be required to develop RTPs - the transport planning duty transfers from Local Authorities to CJCs on 28th February 2022 for South East Wales and 30th June 2022 for North, Mid and South West Wales. The new RTPs will replace the existing 32 Local Transport Plans, which were approved in 2015. The duty to deliver the policies set out in the RTPs will remain with local authorities. These plans will be developed in tandem with The National Transport Delivery Plan which is being developed by Transport for Wales. This will set out specific projects, schemes, initiatives or interventions that will identify expenditure, based on the Strategy's priorities, including the delivery of projects that are already underway. It will also support the implementation of Future Wales - the National Plan 2040, and the Wales Infrastructure Investment Strategy . The NTDP will replace the current National Transport Finance Plan, 2015 (and updated in 2017 and 2018). It is intended that this will be published for formal public consultation in May 2022. The RTP will be split in to two parts. The Plan, which will s et out the policies for implementation of the WTS in the region, and the Programme, which should list the planned interventions over a 5 -year period (2023 -24 to 2027 -28). These plans will be used to allocate funding to local and regional priorities. In th e short term and while the plans are being developed funding will be focused on Active Travel, the roll out 20MPH. 3.2 ICT Infrastructure Details of the total Welsh Government contribution to the Superfast Cymru successor scheme, including relevant contract targets for BT/Openreach and performance towards these targets.

This funding is anticipated to meet the funding overhead requirements of PEDW in full, for statutory functions delivered on behalf of the Welsh Ministers. Certain case types determined by PEDW on behalf of the Welsh Ministers, including Developments of National Significance and examination of LDPs, attract a fee which recovers the cost of service provision, and renders those case types cost neutral to the Wels h Ministers. Sufficient resourcing for local planning authorities to carry out their functions adequately The Welsh Government raised planning fees above the rate of inflation less than 18 months ago to enable Local Planning Authorities to better fund and improve their development management functions. The draft budget provides Local Authorities with suffic ient funding to fund core activities. It is for local authorities to allocate their budgets between the services they are responsible for. The Welsh Government commissioned research to provide a more sustainable fee structure, which is reflective and rea ctive to changing costs and challenges. The Welsh Government is currently considering how to best implement this research to ensure those services are supported and improved in the future. Environment Delivery of the Nature Recovery Action Plan, including management and monitoring of the National Sites Network This investment will directly help address the Programme for Government ambition to tackle the nature and climate emergencies, whilst also ensu ring we meet our existing and emerging international commitments for biodiversity. It will directly contribute to the delivery of key priorities and actions identified in our Nature Recovery Action Plan (NRAP - https://gov.wales/nature -recovery -action -plan-2015 ) relating to the protection of our habitats and species of principal importance and the creation of resilient ecological networks. 43 The National Sites Network will benefit from fundin g through the delivery of our Nature Networks Programme (NNP) over the next 3 years being key to improving the condition and connectivity of our terrestrial and marine protected sites, creating resilient ecological networks which will allow our most endang ered habitats and species to thrive. It will also help to deliver nature to wherever people live through engagement with local communities building capacity within the sector to help deliver action on the ground benefitting not only our environment but als o our health and well - being. Robust monitoring and evaluation will be an integral part of the Nature Networks Programme. Following the design phase, mechanisms to deliver the Nature Networks Programme will be developed in early 2022 building on the succes s of current initiatives such as the Nature Networks Fund and delivery of Land Management Agreements by NRW. Replacement for EU LIFE funding following the UK's departure from the EU Match funding will be made available for 2 successful NRW led projects (Quaking bogs and Rivers4LIFE) from the final round of EU LIFE funding over the next 3 years further helping to restore our protected sites network and contributing to tackling the nature and climate emergencies. The UK Government has not provided any EU LIFE replacement funding failing to honour its promise of Wales being 'not a penny' worse off after leaving the European Union. Discussions are ongoing with the UK Government and the devolved administrations on any potential replacement scheme that may op erate at a UK level. It is not clear at this stage how any potential replacement scheme would be funded. Development of the new National Park The budget provides funding to help deliver the Programme for Government commitment to designate a new National Park to cover the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley. Designating a National Park is a significant undertaking and this funding will enable Natural Resources Wales, our statutory advisors in this area, to undertake the necessary programme. NRW has commenced work on the preparation of an updated and streamlined process for assessing the case for new landscape designations in Wales within the context of Welsh legislation. Alongside this, NRW will develop the evidence base required to inform the assessment of the case for the new National Park. NRW will also develop an engagement and consultation process to ensure all stakeholders have a voice. 44 Delivery of the Clean Air Plan The aim of the Clean Air Plan for Wales: Healthy Air, Healthy Wales, is to improve air quality and reduce the impacts of air pollution on human health, biodiversity, the natural environment and our economy. The Plan sets out a 10-year pathway to achieving cleaner air, structured around four core themes: - People - protecting the health and well -being of current and future generations Environment - Taking action to support our natural environment, ecosystems and biodiversity Prosperity - Working with industry to reduce emissions, supporting a cleaner and more prosperous Wales Place - Creating sustainable places through better planning, infrastructure and transport We are undertaking a wide range of work with Government departme nts and sectors, and the public, to drive forward the ambitious actions in the Plan. Funding will support the delivery of key commitments, including the development of new air quality targets, the introduction of a new air quality monitoring and assessmen t service to support targeted action to improve air quality, and enhancements to the Local Air Quality Management regime. Measures in the Plan will also help to achieve the UK's emission reduction commitments for all pollutants in 2020 and 2030, and will support our decarbonisation aims. The additional f unding will support the introduction of a Clean Air Act for Wales, consistent with World Health Organisation guidance, and will also enable the roll out of an enhanced air quality monitoring and assessment service. The commitments will enhance both national and local government's ability to tackle poor air quality. Measures to set legally binding targets and control emissions will drive improvements to the management of air quality, providing direct benefit s for public health, habitats and biodiversity. Implementation of the Woodlands for Wales Strategy, including the National Forest Strategy On 12 March 2020 the First Minister officially launched the National Forest Programme. He described an ambition fo r a National Forest that extends the length and breadth of Wales; that can provide many opportunities by planting, growing and protecting trees: contributing to decarbonisation goals and the climate change emergency; halting the decline of biodiversity; im prove health and wellbeing of our people; supporting commercial business activity . In this budget we will be taking forwards the learning gained in the first 2 years of the programme, including through creating 30 new areas of National Forest. We will a lso offer every household in Wales a tree to plant or have planted and create 100 Tiny 45 Forests. This will add to the 14 exemplar sites that we already have. We will also offer every household in Wales a tree to plant or have planted on their behalf. The National Forest is a whole country approach based on a set of 6 outcomes which are the guiding principles of the National Forest. Woodlands will need to meet the three essential and at least one highly desirable criteria to be in the National Forest Network. Its main aims to connect woodlands across wales and enhance environmental, social and economic benefits for future generations a consultation will be launched in January 2022 to consult on the long term strategy of the National Forest On 13 July 2021 the Deputy Minister for Climate Change issued a written statement outlining his findings from a deep -dive exercise into how to remove the barriers planting trees in Wales, and how we can use more Welsh timber in construction. Recommendations include ways to support individuals and communities to plant trees, a new funding scheme for woodland creation and an industrial strategy to coordinate the timber supply change and construction se ctors. The additional funding will support the Programme for Government commitment to create a National Forest to extend from the north of Wales to the south. The National Forest will create areas of new woodland and help to restore and maintain some of Wales' irreplaceable ancient woodlands. In time it will form a connected network running throughout Wales, which will bring social, economic and environmental benefits. It also provides the budget to deliver the commitment to create a timber based industrial strategy that can develop and sustain the high value production and processing of Welsh wood. As set out in Net Zero Wales, the Welsh Government wants to create 43,000 hectares of new woodland by 2030. The trees and timber deep dive run earlier this year identified actions to deliver this, including a new woodland creation offer to be launched in 2022. This will include working with the farming community to encourage woodland creation on less productive land and through agro - forestry, as set out in the Co -operation Agreement. Implementation of the National Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management, including the take up of the Coastal Risk Management Programme The National Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management sets out how we will manage risk from flooding and coastal erosion over the next decade with the objectives to prioritise investment, improve our understanding of risk, build resilience, prevent more people becoming exposed to risk and respond to events. The additional funding will help meet the objectives of this Strategy as well as contribute towards our Programme for Government commitments by investing through our Risk Management Authorities in new and improved defences, maintenance and minor works to e xisting assets, investigation of flood events, awareness raising activities, forecasting and warning and mapping and modelling of flood risk. 46 Additional funding in the Flood budget will also help deliver the schemes in the Coastal Risk Management Programm e which when complete will reduce the risk from flooding and/or coastal erosion to over 17,400 homes and businesses. This will help deliver almost 40% of our Programme for Government commitment to fund additional flood protection for more than 45,000 home s Additional revenue will allow for additional flood protection for more than 45,000 homes, to deliver nature based solutions in all major catchments in Wales and to establish a targeted scheme to support restoration of seagrass and saltmarsh habitats along our coastline. Initiatives to reduce plastic pollution, including the development of a Deposit Return Scheme and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for plastic packaging The Programme for Government commitment to introduce extended producer respo nsibility reforms will initially focus on measures to tackle packaging waste and a deposit return scheme for drink containers. The budget allocation for this activity includes funding for finalising policy development along with support to local authoritie s and Natural Resources Wales who will be required to adapt and, in the case of Natural Resources Wales, take on new duties as the principle regulator of these reforms. Development of permanent environmental governance arrangements, and the work of the Interim Environmental Protection Assessor We have been clear in our commitment to apply the environmental principles to policy and law making; establish an environmental oversight body for Wales; and introduce a statutory duty and targets to protect and restore biodiversity in Wales. Budget will be allocated within the Environment, Legislation and Governance BEL for the development of permanent environmental governance measures. Costs incurred for the Interim Environmental Protection Assessor are met fro m the EU Exit BEL. These interim measures provide a route for people to raise concerns about the functioning of environmental law. Delivery of the Marine Protected Area Network Management Plan Budgetary allocations to support Marine Protected Area (MPA) management will be comparable to last year's budget with no reductions anticipated. Proposed actions continue to be invited annually and where appropriate can be considered for funding through the MPA Network Management Grant Scheme. Accepted actions will meet the criteria set out in the MPA Network Management Framework for Wales 2018 -2023 and will deliver against wider Programme for Government commitments to improve and enhance resilience of the marine environment. 47 Natural Resources Wales (NRW) The NRW budget for 2022/23 has limited changes when compared to the 2021 -22 budget. There has been no change in core Grant In Aid (GIA) (\u00a360m) for NRW in 2021 -22 as NRW and Welsh Government officials are in the process of undertaking an exercise that examines the allocation of NRW resources against its statutory functions and PfG commitments. This exercise will inform how NRW allocates its funding to meet its statutory obligations whilst achieving Ministerial priorities for the coming year (2022 -23) and the re mainder of the current term of Government. I will work closely with NRW over the coming months on this matter to ensure the funding is sufficient to boost their efforts in tackling climate change and its impact in Wales. This is through more renewable ene rgy generation on public sector land and more natural flood management. NRW have been allocated an additional \u00a31.5m Capital (\u00a32.4m in total) next year to help support funding for Welsh reservoirs, a significant Capital increase. One of the biggest challenges for the Welsh Government is tackling the effects of climate change . It is imperative NRW continues to respond to our climate emergency and the increased ambition of at least a 95% emission reduction. With NRW at the forefront , delivering actions across multiple sectors aims to ensure Wales' environment will be more resilient to climate change impacts. We will consider the ask from NRW, along with their review of the 2020 floods which sets out the need for additional funding. This must be considered alongside the needs of our local authorities and wider flood and coastal risk management to support our communities. We hope to be in a position to be able to provide additional revenue next year to support this vital work We wil l be looking at more specific allocations over the coming months and hope to be able to provide a 3 year settlement, allowing our risk management authorities to plan ahead more effectively and help deliver on the ambitions set out in our National Strategy. In addition to Grant in Aid (GiA) funding, NRW is in receipt of commercial income. NRW also receives several amounts of grant funding from various parts of WG, year on year, for proje cts which are outside their GIA, such as; The National Peatland Actio n Programme (NPAP) is a 5 year programme (2020 - 2025) funded by Welsh Government and delivered by NRW. The budget allocation to NRW for delivery of Year 3 (2022/23) of the NPAP is: - 1. \u00a31,000,000 = Capital spend on peatland restoration activity on approximately 600-800ha 2. \u00a3500,000 = Revenue funding for i) the dedicated NPAP delivery team of 6 in NRW; ii) peatland research and evidence projects so support delivery of the NPAP. 48 The NPAP aims to increase the ec osystem resilience of Welsh peatlands, and in doing so contribute to help address both the Climate and Nature Emergencies as well as contributing to achieving Net Zero. \u00a31.5m of match funding will be provided covering the 2 successful NRW led LIFE project s (Quaking bogs and Rivers for LIFE ) and Natur am Byth project for the next 3 years. These projects will contribute to help address both the climate and Nature emergencies. It is expected that NRW will receive an allocation to deliver a proportion of the Nature Networks programme (NNP) over the next 3 years. The amount TBC subject to outcomes of the design phase. Designating a National Park is a significant undertaking and funding TO NRW will allow them to undertake the necessary programme. Additional areas of Committee interest Implementation of recommendations made by the Green Recovery Task Force The Green Recovery Task and Finish Group was tasked with identifying actions for the Welsh Government's Recovery Plan to Covid -19 and developing a shared plan to stabilise the environment third sector, highlighting the need to strengthen financial resilien ce, governance and community engagement. In relation to the first objective above, the Group published the Green Recovery: Priorities for Action Report on the 3rd December 2020 and in 2020/2021 the Welsh Government financed a package of these priority proj ects to support biodiversity, totalling \u00a31.030m capital and \u00a3105k revenue in total. The Welsh Government committed an additional \u00a34m capital and \u00a3300k revenue to the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) on the 25th February 2021.This funding was for onward distribution to Local Authorities for projects that delivered against the Priorities for Action report's five priorities. Under the second objective, the Group published the Green recovery: supporting the environmental sector in Wales report. The We lsh Government subsequently worked in partnership with National Lottery Heritage Fund, launching a \u00a3920k Capacity Building scheme for the environmental sector in November 2020. More recently, Sir David Henshaw met with the Deputy Minister for Climate Chan ge in November 2021 to discuss the Group's next steps, which includes the development of a business case in relation to the National Nature Service. Within this year's budget we have expanded funding to relevant areas which are key to accelerating the deli very of the Green Recovery, such as our Circular Economy Fund, and taking forward the delivery of the Net Zero Wales Plan. We are also looking to provide further investment, building on the capacity building scheme helping Environmental Non - Governmental Or ganisations (eNGOs) retain and develop capacity to effectively contribute to their ability to tackle the nature and climate emergencies. 49 Delivery of the Welsh Government's Warm Homes Programme, including priority actions for 2021 -2023 set out in its Tack ling Fuel Poverty Plan, 2020 - 2035 The Fuel Poverty Warm Homes budget directly addresses the PfG commitment to \"Continue to improve existing homes, helping us tackle fuel poverty, create much needed jobs, training opportunities, and supply chains\" and sup ports \"decarbonise more homes through retrofit, delivering quality jobs, training and innovation using local supply chains.\" The funding supports the Warm Homes Programme (WHP ) which has been the Welsh Government's main intervention in efforts to reduce fuel poverty since its launch in 2009/10. Welsh Ministers published its statutory plan to tackle fuel poverty in March 2021 whilst the current iteration of the WHP is due to end in May 2023. The next iteration of the Warm Homes Programme will be subject to a public consultation which will open December 2021. Delivery of renewable energy and public sector energy efficiency programmes, including funding for the Welsh Energy Service The budget provides capital and revenue to support the operation of the Welsh Government Energy Service. This offers commercial, financial, and technical expertise to the public sector and local energy sector to develop energy efficiency and renewable energ y schemes. The service also undertakes a strategic leadership role across the sectors, with a focus on increasing ambition, capacity and capability. The commitment to Expand renewable energy generation by public bodies and community groups in Wales by ove r 100MW by 2026 is in addition to the target of 1 gigawatt of locally owned generation by 2030. Work will begin this year to set up a development function, Ynni Cymru, in order to expand community owned renewable energy generation. The programme's Benefit Realisation Strategy indicates the unit will deliver significant revenue and environmental benefits to Wales. The budget allocations will enable us to establish a small team to develop the concept of a Welsh public developer, as described in the Cooperatio n Agreement, and in parallel actively develop an initially small number of projects for Welsh Government, and in support of communities and public bodies where capacity is a challenge. The Welsh Government Energy Service is engaged to support these proje cts and wider public sector and community based activity to increase the opportunities and scale of renewable energy in Wales. The Service provides support, advice and expertise to projects together with significant investment in projects which, without support, wo uld not be financially viable. The funding also supports the Wales Funding Programme which provides zero interest capital loans to the public sector, with commercial loans and development grants provided to the local energy sector. 50 The Nationa l Infrastructure Commission for Wales The Deputy Minister recently appointed Dr David Clubb as Chair of NICW. The Deputy Minster will soon begin a public appointment process to refresh the membership of the commission. The Co -operation Agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru commits NICW to assessing how the nationwide likelihood of flooding of homes, businesses and infrastructure can be minimised by 2050. Dr Clubb has written to the Deputy Minister with proposals for a 3 year work programme. In the near future, this will lead to a funded work programme agreed between the Deputy Minister and the Chair. Project proposed by NICW include: the renewable energy challenge; to be tightly integrated with the outcomes from the Welsh Government 'Deep Dive' into renewable energy the long -term risks to infrastructure, focusing on coastal flooding and erosion, river flooding, and heat -related impacts; and for sectors that are hard to adapt (such as transport, energy and housing) the long -term skills needs to support a distributed energy, housing and transport system that will need to withstand or recover from significantly increased weather/climate impacts a regional or national conversation on climate -related risks to a range of (l ikely coastal) communities, citing Fairbourne and other highly vulnerable communities as an example. 51 5.0 DIGITAL DELIVERY - FUNDING OF ACTIONS Delivering the Digital Strategy 2021 - 22 Final Budget \u00a3'000 2022 -23 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change \u00a3'000 Change % 2023 -24 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 2024 -25 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Fiscal Resource 4,900 4,900 0 0% 4,900 4,900 Non-Fiscal Resource 0 0 0 0 0 Total Resource 4,900 4,900 0 0% 4,900 4,900 BEL 2021 - 22 Final Budget \u00a3'000 2022 -23 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change \u00a3'000 Change % 2023 -24 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 2024 -25 New Plans Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Centre for Digital Public Services 4,900 4,900 0 0% 4,900 4,900 Total Resource 4,900 4,900 0 0% 4,900 4,900 The Programme for Government commitment of building \"a stronger, greener economy as we make maximum progress towards decarbonisation\" contains an action to \"deliver the Digital Strategy for Wales \". The strategy includes actions based around wide-ranging Missions including: designing services around users, inclusion, skills, the economy, connectivity and data. Tak en together, the Missions will deliver digital transformation across Wales to deliver the vision set out in the strategy. Responsibility for delivering the Digital Strategy for Wales and the accompanying Delivery Plan is a cross -portfolio issue. Much of t he digital policy and delivery activity is delivered across Ministerial portfolios but, together, contribute to the overall objective of delivering and modernising services so that they are designed around user needs and are simple, secure and convenient. Welsh Government's overall draft budget allocations will enable a wide suite of actions, set out in the Delivery Plan, to be taken forward across all Missions. The Centre for Digital Public Services (CDPS) is key to achieving our vision by improving digital leadership and skills as well as driving forward transformation in public services. It is already making public services more joined up, effective and using common standards. Allocations in the draft budget within the Climate Change portfolio will enable the CDPS to deliver agreed outcomes and plan for longer term work based on identified priorities. Providing budget certainty enables the CDPS to continue to work at pace, driving momentum for collaboration and digital transformation across public services in Wales. 1 Memorandum on the Rural Affairs Draft Budget Proposals for 202 2-23 Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee - 20 January 202 2 1.0 Purpose This paper provides information to the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee on the Rural Affairs (RA ) (MEG) proposals outlined in Draft Budget 202 2-23, published on 20 December. It also provides an update on specific areas of interest to the Committee. The summary of the budget structure can be found at section 3 of the evidence paper. 2.0 Strategic Context 1. Ministerial Responsibilities 1.1 Agriculture Sector Development The Agriculture and Sustainability Division leads Welsh Government activities through all phases of producing, processing and marketing farm, food and bio -based products, from the farmer to the consumer, from the farm to global markets. The team is responsible for: developing and delivering agricu ltural policy on sustainable farming, sector development, trade, contingency planning, and agricultural tenancies ; supporting the industry through advice, guidance and schemes to improve resilience, innovation, wellbeing, health and safety. We also sponsor the Levy Bodies; providing funding through Glastir, the Farm Business Grant (FBG) and the Sustainable Production Grant (SP G); and developing agricultural regulations including Agricultural Pollution Regulations, livestock identification and movement controls, and Local Authority animal health and welfare enforcement. 1.1.1 Livestock Identification and Movement Policy I laun ched my consultation on Changes to Livestock Identification, Registration and Movement Reporting on 30 September. The consultation will look to harmonise some of the movement reporting and registration rules across all livestock. It also includes agreed changes on Bovine EID tag specifications and the mandatory use of RPWOnline's Manage My CPH system. The proposals in the consultation provide increased traceability for all livestock and introduce electronic efficiencies to enhance farm performance , alongside the development of EIDCymru. The consultation will be open until 2nd January 2022 and I will update the Senedd on the results of the consultation and publish my decision on the changes and the provisional implementation date for Bovine EID. 2 1.1.2 Nitrate Vulnerable Zone Management Nitrate Vulnerable Zones no longer exist in Wales. Through the Rural Development Programme 2014 -20 (RDP), which runs until the end of March 2023, we are continuing to support farm businesses in implementing the requirements of the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) Regulations 2021. We are developing our proposals for replacement EU funding. As farmers and land managers transition towards the Sustainable Farming Scheme, future support wil l include a focus on environmental improvements, farm scale land management, productivity, and diversification. Enhancing water quality and supporting farms to become compliant with the new regulations will be an element of this support. Further details of future funding plans will be announced once I have had the opportunity to consider proposals put forward by my officials. As a result of the continued demand for the Farming Connect Advisory Service and the significant increase in the number of applicatio ns following the introduction of the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) Regulations in January 2021, the Advisory Service secured an additional \u00a31,125,000 which was awarded to ensure the continuation of the Service up until March 2 023. The total budget allocation for the Farming Connect Programme as a whole for FY 22/23 is \u00a39,621,575.00. The programme provides a range of knowledge transfer support services, not limited to, but including advice, factsheets, workshops and videos, to s upport the sector to implement the Regulations. \u00a3358k has been allocated to Technical Advice Services, which includes demand -led expenditure associated with the Regulations, including legal advice, a farm advice service provided by RSK ADAS Ltd and for other expenditure associated with the implementation of the Regulations. 1.1.3 Equines The Equine Identification (Wales) Regulations 2019 require all horses in Wales to be identified with a microchip from 12 February 2021 and hold a valid passport. Altho ugh Defra is planning to consult on changes to Equine ID's before the end of 2021 we are not proposing any changes at present. 1.2 Agri-food Sector Development The Food Division advises me on all matters of food policy and strategy. The team : engage directly with the food and drink industry on a daily basis; deliver a suite of industry support programmes and interventions that enable the sustainable growth of the food manufacturing sector in Wales - driving growth and productivity gains throu ghout the food chain; fund programmes across the food spectrum, leveraging financial resources from wider Welsh Government including RDP, EFF, ERF and a number of smaller initiatives as well as external funding sources such as Growth Deals; support bu siness survival and resilience post Covid -19 and EU exit by leveraging funds to support food sector growth, working with retailers to encourage increased Welsh food and drink product listings, helping to secure an increased online presence of Welsh produce rs and promotion activities to increase the Welsh food manufacturing's share of supply into the food service sector, tourism and the public sector; and 3 promote the Welsh food industry through international events and networks designed to increase inward investment. 1.2.1 Food and Drink Wales On 19 November the Welsh Government launched 'A Vision for the Food and Drink industry from 2021'. The intention is to build on the food and drink industry's success in Wales with an overarching objective to ensure a n environmentally and socially responsible food and drink supply -chain which has an international reputation for excellence. A key ambition is to sustainably grow the industry at a rate higher proportionally to the rest of the UK areas, while future busine ss support will be linked to the aims and ambitions of the Economic Contract. The new UK GI scheme has ensured continued protection in the EU for our 16 Welsh products originally registered under the EU schemes, as well as automatically transferring to ne w UK GI scheme protection. Wales represented the first nation to successfully register two new products under the UK GI scheme, taking the Welsh GI family of protected products up to 18 members. Wales is now in a unique and differentiated position of pro tected food areas and will continue with this momentum. It is therefore Wales' ambition within the food and drink industry vision from 2021, to ensure up to six other key Welsh product areas are registered under the UK GI scheme by 2025. Wales recognises the importance of these protections, which demonstrates the links to our food heritage, our communities and culture. The marketing and communications are linked to a Sustainable Futures and will be built on BCORP environmental and other accreditations. The Well -being and Future Generations Act underpins the legislation and Food for Future Generation's themes. This sustainable message differentiates the Welsh food and drink journey and now widely shared in both national and international markets. During BlasCymru/TasteWales 2021 the National Geographic Traveller and Food Supplement covered these areas and was accompanied by an online video outlining wales and its sustainable ambitions - this coverage was a first for any UK nation. We will continue to sup port the industry as we recover from the effects of the Covid - 19 pandemic. The recently launched 'A Vision for the Food and Drink industry from 2021' will play a key role in positioning the industry and has the capacity to be flexible so that it can respon d to changing circumstance. I announced the postponement of the 'premier' BlasCymru/TasteWales event due to the Covid -19 pandemic last March. We were able to hold a covid secure hybrid event on the 27th and 28th October 2021. This event was held at the In ternational Convention Centre (ICC) in Newport. The theme of the vent was sustainable and food for Future Generations. Initial feedback from all delegates were strongly positive and the initial business brokerage secured \u00a314million in contracts for Welsh b usinesses. The event demonstrates our clear determination to continue to promote the very best that the Welsh food and drink industry has to offer nationally and internationally and further develop the global reputation of Wales as a sustainable Food Natio n. 4 1.3 Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Since April 2015 the majority of bovine TB skin tests have been undertaken by private veterinarians via two -contracted Veterinary Delivery Partners (VDP). Procurement rules require the market to be re -tested and new '2nd generation' contracts commenced in July 2021. Re -testing the market has inevitably increased the cost of this significant Wales / England contract. The budget cover s APHA running cost increases, agile TB policy development and delivery required in response to disease prevalence, additiona l border controls and checks for exotic animal and avian diseases. Failure to demonstrate effective control on animal disease and biosecurity, including import controls, could undermine the perception, by external trading partners of the assurance of Wales' official controls. This could have an impact on the ability for the UK as a whole to trade with other countries. 1.3.1 Bovine TB Eradication Programme (including Delivery Plan, testing and compensation) The TB Eradication Programme sets out the W elsh Government's long term vision for the eradication of bovine TB in Wales. The programme is based on the four key principles of infectious disease control: Keep it Out, Find it Fast, Stop it Spreading and Stamp it Out. We have seen good progress since o ur programme was first established, with long term decreases in incidence and prevalence. Between 2009 and 2020, there was a 48% decrease in new incidents and it is worth reminding ourselves that 94.8% of herds in Wales were TB free at end of June 2021. As part of its Programme for Government 2021 - 26 commitments the Welsh Government continues to prohibit the culling of badgers as part of the TB Eradication Programme. Funds continue to be made available to support private vaccination schemes across Wal es, whilst assessing the most appropriate, cost effective deployment of the Badger BCG vaccine as a protective measure. A regionalised approach to TB eradication was launched in 2017 creating Low, Intermediate and High TB Areas and policies have continued to be refined, reacting dynamically to the changing disease picture, whilst responding to the particular challenges resulting from the Covid -19 pandemic The Minister made a Statement on 16 November on the TB Eradication Programme and also launched a cons ultation on enhanced measures, seeking views of aspects such as payment for TB affected cattle, TB testing and informed purchasing. The consultation will last 12 weeks with responses due in by 8 February 2022 and will inform a refresh of the TB Eradication Programme. TB Testing In Wales a skin test ( SICCT ) to the neck of cattle is used to identify infected animals. This compares the reactions to the injection of both bovine and avian tuberculin. In general animals that react to the bovine more than the av ian tuberculin are considered as skin test reactors. 5 This is a long established test, and is used worldwide as the main surveillance test for TB control programmes. The test is likely to identify only one 'false positive' animal in every 5000 non -infecte d cattle tested. But, at best it may only identify 80% of infected animals. There is currently no test, or combination of tests, that will: identify all cattle infected with TB; and identify all non -infected cattle as negative animals. An Interferon -gamma blood test is also used in some herds (as a supplementary test) to help identify other infected animals. In Wales we test: each herd every year any animal before it moves off farm, except for low risk cattle in the Low TB Area any animal moving from a herd outside the Low TB area to a herd in the Low TB Area We inspect animals at the abattoir to identify any infected with TB, not identified in the testing surveillance programme (they become \"slaughterhouse cases\" and result in follow up testing in the source herd). TB compensation Welsh Government has a statutory commitment to pay TB compensation. This is a demand lead area of expenditure that is directly linked to the amount of animals slaughtered because of TB. Variables such as the amount of animal s slaughtered, market value of each animal and the amount of salvage value applicable to each animal has an effect on the level of expenditure and salvage receipts received. Animal owners are paid by the Welsh Government for cattle slaughtered because of TB as set out in The Tuberculosis (Wales) Order 2010 (as amended) (The TB Order). This Payment is currently calculated based on the market value of each individual animal. A number of alternative payment options are outlined in the consultation. Followi ng some negotiation, the European Commission approved the UK TB Eradication Plan for 2019 and associated co -funding of \u20ac8.99m to be split between Wales, England and Northern Ireland. 1.4 Animal H ealth and Welfare The Wales Animal Health and Welfare Framework sets out our plan for continuing and lasting improvements in standards of animal health and welfare for kept animals, whilst also helping to protect public health and making a contribution to the economy and the environment. The implementation o f the plan is supported and monitored by the Wales Animal Health and Welfare Framework Group. The eight publically appointed members bring a wealth of experience and knowledge and are drawn from a broad range of sectors and areas of expertise. 6 This plan addresses several key PfG commitments in addition to ongoing Wales - based policy work and UK/GB policy collaborations: Develop a national model for regulation of animal welfare, introducing registration for animal welfare establishments, commercial breeders for pets or for shooting, and animal exhibits; Improve the qualifications for animal welfare inspectors to raise th eir professional status ; Require CCTV in all slaughterhouses ; and Restrict use of cages for farmed animals . Ongoing Wales -based policy work: Statutory Guidance for the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (Wales) Regulations 2021 ; Update statutory Guidance for the Animal Welfare (Breeding of Dogs) (Wales) Regulations 2014 ; Local Authority Enforcement Project (2020 -23); Licensing of Animal Exhibits & Animal Establishments ; Microchipping of Dogs and Cats ; and Codes of Practice . UK/GB p olicy collaborations: Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill ; and Welfare in Transport . 1.5 European Union (EU) Exit and Strategy The EU Exit & Strategy Unit coordinates, supports and drives ERA's EU exit and transition activities (including operationalisati on of new cross -cutting functions and structures). The division also facilitates, co -ordinates and delivers strategic evidence, modelling and their practical application to support ERA's wider policy making. We have responsibility for: intergovernmental relations in Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (EFRA) space; strategic evidence, modelling and monitoring to support ERA policy development ; Northern Ireland Protocol issues, including business readiness for EU transition changes ; coordination of finalisation of common frameworks including legislative scrutiny ; resourcing and capability to ensure WG effectively discharges its responsibilities in relation to circa 3,500 new powers post EU transition ; and advice on environmental aspects of trade agreements . 1.6 Future Farming Policy and Direct Payments to Farmers The Land Management Reform Division is responsible for designing a new policy framework and programme to replace the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP ) in Wales following the UK's exit from the European Union. 7 The programme is strategically aligned to key Welsh Government priorities around responding to the climate emergency, reversing the loss of biodiversity and ensuring Welsh farming is sustainabl e for future generations. It includes the design of evidence based policy, the development of the underpinning legislative framework and all aspects of stakeholder engagement and business change within the agricultural industry. 1.7 Marine and Fisher ies The Marine and Fisheries Division works to ensure our seas are cleaner, healthier, safer, more productive and biologi cally diverse. More broadly, its work is about protecting and improving the marine environment, and sustainably managing our diverse fi sheries. Their work covers: The division has responsibility for a very wide variety of policy areas and is facing a number of policy challenges and opportunities as a consequence of EU exit , including the production of a Joint Fisheries Statement . Development of replacement for EMFF. The funding we have received at \u00a32.1m will go some way to support the maritime and fisheries sector, which is particularly vulnerable to changes as a result of our exit from the EU. The funding for fisheries and farm s upport is reflected in the MEG revenue allocations. Welsh Ministers are the competent Fisheries Administration for Wales and the division is responsible for a number of statutory functions in this area - this accounts for approximately two thirds of the divisions work. These functions include Fisheries Control and Enforcement, Domestic and International Fisheries Management, Coastal State Negotiations (determination of fishing opportunities of shared stocks), Fish eries Science, Quota Management. 1.8 Ru ral Development Programme (RDP) The Rural Economy and Legislation Division deliver s the Welsh RDP which was formally adopted by the European Commission on 26th May 2015, and last modified in December 2021, outlining the priorities of Wales for using the nearly \u20ac 977 million of public money that is available for the 7 -year period 2014 -2020 (\u20ac 651.6 million fr om the EU budget, including \u20ac 288.2 million transferred from the envelope for CAP direct payments, and \u20ac 325.4 million of national co -funding). Through the Rural Development Programme 2014 -20 (RDP), which runs until the end of 2023, we are continuing to deliver a wide range of schemes which support priorities within my own portfolio, as well as others. By the end of the programme we will have invested \u00a3838m1 into rural Wales. The RDP focuses mainly on restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to agriculture and forestry and enhancing farm viability and competitiveness of all types of agriculture and promoting innovative farm technol ogies and the sustainable management of forests. With 56% of the support allocated to better management of 1 Subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate. 8 natural resources and encouraging climate -friendly farming practices, the aim is to protect 270,000 hectares of farmland through environmental land management targeted to specific biodiversity, water management and soil erosion objectives. The productivity of farming and forestry will be boosted, which will result in economic growth and more jobs. Support will also target tourism and renewable energy as well as improving ICT and broadband infrastructure for about half a million people. In addition, the programme will promote genuine local economic partnerships and the LEADER approach, covering almost half of the rural population. Moreover, 34,000 training places will be created to foster innovation, knowledge transfer, co -operation, more sustainable farming practices and stronger rural businesses. 1.8.1 Continued agricultural payments ahead of transition to the new scheme - both the Basic Payment Sch eme and Rural Development Plan schemes The Rural Economy and Legislation Division is responsible for co -ordinating the delivery of schemes replacing the RDP. The Welsh Government continues to provide significant funding to farmers, land managers and rural communities. We have signalled our intention to maintain our support for farmers through the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) in 2022 and 2023. I will consider future levels of BPS funding in due course. Through the Rural Development Programme 2014 -20 (RDP), wh ich runs until the end of 2023, we are continuing to deliver a wide range of schemes which support priorities within my own portfolio, as well as others. By the end of the programme we will have invested \u00a3838m2 into rural Wales. As farming businesses an d rural industries transition away from support through the RDP we will use resources which are replacing EU funding to invest in our rural communities. For the first time, activity will respond directly to domestic commitments rather than EU priorities. The interventions support the transition to the new farming scheme through: maintaining and enhancing activity most closely aligned to sustainable land management principles, where schemes in EU RDP end before the launch of the new farming scheme. This is to ensure continuity of support during the transition period ; and funding new activity aligned to sustainable land management principles, where this is already enabled through domestic policy. The revised Programme for Government, following the Labour -Plaid Cymru Co - operation Agreement, reflects the need for sustainability payments for farmers as they transition to a new system of farm support. I have signalled my intention to maintain BPS at th e current level 2022 and 2023. Through the RDP I have extended Glastir agri -environment contracts until the end of 2023 at a total cost of approximately \u00a370m to ensure the gains made through these schemes are maintained, ahead of the introduction of the SFS. These extensions will support our commitments to move to Net Zero and tackle climate change. 2 Subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate. 9 In line with our commitments to significantly increase tree planting, our Glastir Woodland schemes provide capital funding to create and sustainably manage woodlands. The Timber Business Investment Scheme provides finance to private forest owners, local authority or other public sector forest, which can be used for improvements that add value to forests for woodland management activities, timber harvesting an d/or timber processing. The RPW IT platform is expected to support several schemes including; to enable communities to create 30 new woodlands; deliver nature -based flood management in all major river catchments to expand wetland and woodland habitats; an d establish a targeted scheme to support restoration of seagrass and saltmarsh habitats. Thereby a number of Programme for Government commitment will be supported, in particular, carbon reduction and biodiversity. We will target replacement EU funding at farmers and land managers as they transition towards the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) - this will include a focus on environmental improvements, farm scale land management, productivity, and diversification. We will also target landscape scale land man agement and food supply chains. All of these priorities support PfG commitments. I will announce more details of future funding plans once I have had the opportunity to consider proposals put forward by my officials. 1.8.2 Update on discussions with the UK Government about future funding for agriculture support Discussion with UKG are ongoing, although UKG is still not matching previous levels of agricultural funding provided to Wales by the EU. WG is considering whether to invoke the as yet untested dis pute resolution process to try to progress this matter. 1.9 Rural Payments Wales Rural Payments Wales (RPW) is the largest division in the Welsh Government (with 350 FTE staff) operating as the paying agency for the European Union, among other schemes . We operate the domestic Basic Payment Scheme and over 30 different schemes under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), with annual payments worth approx. \u00a3340m validated and processed to over 17,000 Wels h farmers, fishers, businesses and rural communities every year. Under the EU Withdrawal Agreement, the RDP and EMFF programmes will operate under EU law in the UK until December 2023 and continue to be administered by RPW. An RPW Change Programme has been set up to formally and compliantly close the CAP and EMFF programmes in Wales whilst simultaneously planning and implementing the transition from EU programmes to the new schemes to be introduced under Welsh Government policies as set out in the Welsh Agricultural Bill and Fisher ies Bill . 10 1.10 Minister for North Wales and Chair of the Standing Committee for Cabinet on North Wales As the Minister for North Wales, I am determined to ensure that North Wales has a strong, fair and bright future that leaves no one behind. Our government has been working steadfast to bring forward a series of exciting developments for the region, from investment into our national parks and AONBs, through to the establishment of a North Wales medical school, to targeted interventions that help to address the challenges we have faced as a result of the pandemic. I'm excited about the future of North Wales and the developments to come. In my role as Chair of the Standing Committee for Cabinet on North Wales, I lead the Committee and its members in the consideration of such matters relating to sustainable and inclusive social and economic development, post -pandemic recovery, and improving the health and quality of life of Welsh citizens in North Wales . 2. Withdrawal from the European Union 2.1 Agricultural Policy (including the proposed Sustainable Farming Scheme for Wales ) The UK Government has adopted the same methodology to replacement EU funding in this Spending Review as they did this year (2021/22). We disagree with this approach, which nets off outstanding EU spending. It led to a shortfall in expected funding of \u00a3137 m this year, and the same approach will see Wales receive at least \u00a3106m less than expected over the period of this Spending Review. Along with her counterparts in the Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, the Minister for Finance and Lo cal Government has written to the Chief Secretary of the Treasury outlining our objections to this approach. 2.2 Bovine TB eradication It has been confirmed by DEFRA that the UK Government has decided not to participate (as a third country) in the EU's S ingle Market Programme from 2021. This means there will be no opportunity for further EU funding for the UK Bovine TB Eradication Programme after 31 December 2021. The final payment of \u00a31.09m EU funding was received in August 2021, this relates to the 202 0 Eradication Programme. Current bovine TB policy is driven by a European Union framework, formed by legislation (77/391/EEC and 78/52), which requires Member States to develop eradication programmes in order to accelerate, intensify or carry through the eradication of bovine TB. Our Eradication Programme is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the submission of the UK TB Eradication Plan to the EC and has received endorsement by the EC for nine years running. The UK Plan covers Wales, England and Northern Ireland. Scotland achieved Officially TB Free Status. Council Directive 64/432/EEC states that a Member State or 11 part of a Member State may be declared officially tuberculosis -free if it meets the following co nditions: The percentage of bovine herds confirmed as infected with tuberculosis has not exceeded 0.1 % per year of all herds for six consecutive years. At least 99.9 % of herds have achieved officially tuberculosis -free status each year for six consecutiv e years. The calculation of this latter percentage to take place on 31 December each calendar year. After leaving the European Union, we will not be relaxing the controls we are currently implementing. As we progress towards eradication it is highly likel y that we will need to implement more stringent measures in order to further bear down on disease. Welsh Government colleagues have provided the EU Finance Task & Finish Group with details relating to the historic level of EU funding that TB received from the EU (approximately \u00a33 - 4m per financial year) in an attempt to ensure that Welsh Government receive this level of funding from HMT post EU transition. Defra have confirmed that there is no additional funding agreed from HMT, and that spending reviews with treasury would need to try to account for this. Historically, EU funding has been capped at \u20ac31m for the UK. For 2017 the EU allocated the UK \u20ac27.64m in funding and for 2018, 2019 and 2020 this amount has been further reduced due to reprioritisation of funding within the E C. The history of funding can be seen in the table below. Following some negotiation, the European Commission approved the UK TB Eradication Plan for 2020 and associated co -funding of \u20ac3.00m to be split between Wales, and Northern Ireland. We expect to receive the final instalment of \u00a31.13m EU funding in late 2021, this will relate to the 2020 Eradication Programme. It has been confirmed by DEFRA that the UK Government has decided not to participate (as a third country) in the EU's Single Market Programme from 2021. This means there will be no opportunity for further EU funding for the UK Bovine TB Eradication Programme after 2021 2.3 Fisheries P olicy (including the delivery of a Joint Fisheries Statement and Fisheries Management Plans ) We have a statutory commitment to deliver a Joint Fisheries Statement (JFS), with the other UK administrations, which will set out our policies to achieve, or contribute to the achievement of, the UK Fisheries Objectives. The Objectives reflect th e cornerstone of good fisheries management and therefore a large proportion of our existing policies and future strategic approach will deliver against them. The majority of fisheries management is devolved and implementation of JFS policies will be taken forward by each fisheries policy authority in line with the devolved settlements. The JFS will set out a list of Fisheries Management Plans (FMPs), to be delivered over the lifetime of the first Statement. All necessary impact assessments will be carried o ut during the development of any new policies over the lifetime of the JFS, including for the development of the Fisheries Management Plans. 12 Some of these FMPs will be joint approaches with other Administrations to reflect the geographic extent of the particular fish stocks. Others will be regional Wales plans and will reflect and support the considerations I am undertaking in relation to our o wn policy aims and ambitions. I will be seeking views on the specific proposals and timings for publication of FMPs through the JFS public consultation in January. The JFS will also be subject to scrutiny in the Senedd in the New Year also. The JFS mus t be published within two years of royal assent of the Fisheries Act 2020, by 23 November 2022 2.4 Post -Brexit Food and D rink Strategy Welsh Government's strategic vision for the food and drink manufacturing and processing industry was published on 29 November 2021 and is to create a strong and vibrant industry with a global reputation for excellence, having one of the most environmentally and socially responsible supply chains in the world. It is focussed on goals to: generate business growth and r aise productivity; to spread Fair Work for employees; to reach higher levels of environmental sustainability; and to raise and promote the industry's reputation and professional standards. The approach builds on the work achieved over the last decade, rec ognises the disruption of EU -Exit and Covid -19, and is predicated on a partnership with businesses and stakeholders in which Welsh Government support will increasingly be conditional on shared values and actions. The industry operates within a context of socio -economic issues such as the heightened concern to address the environmental and health impacts of food production and diet, a changed UK trading environment, the urgent need to decarbonise and minimise waste and environmental impact. With businesses located across Wales, the food and drink industry is part of a foundational economy and integral to supply chains which connect, in some sectors, to Welsh farming and fishing, and to retail, wholesale and the service sector where the industry's product of fer is increasingly valued by consumers and is a USP for tourism. Welsh Government intervention will focus on ten main areas: basing decisions about policy and support on evidence, using research, evaluation and market insight to inform and guide, and ass isting businesses and stakeholders to develop knowledge capability to help themselves; growing stronger businesses which can sustainably grow and have market leading productivity; building networks, driving collaboration through networks, clusters, integra ted with technical support, to spread best practice and find opportunities to add value; tackling systemic weaknesses such as supporting small businesses to become medium, and medium to become large, improving the infrastructure of business premises, aggre gators and wholesalers and connecting these to create strong, local networks and supply chains. 13 providing strong technical back -up, building on the success of Food Innovation Wales; finding and exploiting opportunities in the UK market, furthering our Reta il Plan, making inroads into the service and wholesale sectors, and seizing the opportunities of growing Direct to Consumer sales channels; increasing our exports and using our products and businesses to showcase Wales, with Blas Cymru our flagship event t o champion the industry to a UK and international audience; buildings a strong brand, focussing on products and businesses which represent the best of Wales, expanding our Protected Food Names family; attracting investment into businesses and our food infr astructure; ensuring our support is leverage for driving the Welsh Government's core priorities such as for sustainability, prosperous communities, decarbonisations, and fair work. Complementing our industry strategy we have commenced work on a Community Food Strategy which we envisage will guide and empower grass roots activity and interest in food. Through capacity building we aim to localise food supply chains where that is practicable. 2.5 Sufficient staffing resource for the development of policies and legislation associated with Brexit Welsh Government has nominally recruited to deal with critical new areas of work arising from the UK's withdrawal from the European Union - for example preparing our borders. However, this is about more than staff resource. It is also about how we adapt and continue to respond to a c ompletely new way of working for Wales, our role in the UK and our engagement with the EU and other trading nations. For example, the Minister for Climate Change and I are part of a formal Inter -Ministerial group with UK Government (Defra), SG and NIE, in which we now have to agree how we work together to further policy where powers have flowed back from the EU. This work is supported by a series of common frameworks which will be scrutinised by committee after upcoming publication. These set arrangeme nts for how we come together across the UK in subject areas. Furthermore, the machinery of the EU TCA is still evolving and requiring us to think differently about how we respond, in the same way as we need to understand an evolving trading environment. 3. Legislation We will introduce an Agriculture Bill in the first year of the Senedd. This will be an ambitious piece of legislation reforming decades of EU farm support and represents a significant change to the sector. The Bill will focus on the key a reas needed to support farmers in the coming years and, crucially, establish a new system of farm support based on the principles of Sustainable Land Management. Alongside the legislation, we will publish an outline of the proposed Sustainable Farming Scheme. This will not be the final Scheme, but it will include detail on the structure and the specific actions which we are proposing farmers will be asked to under take. The actions in the Scheme will have undergone a range of analysis to 14 estimate the economic cost to the farm business of undertaking them and the resulting environmental benefits. This will allow us to have detailed conversations with farmers on the p roposals and test our thinking. This will be facilitated through our second phase of co -design. We will also launch a range of interventions which will help both prepare the ground for the new scheme and pilot the process which will be used to deliver it. The budget allocation supports this activity. 4. Preventative Spend 4.1 Details of the proportion of portfolio budget allocated to preventative spending measures and how this has increased compared to last year's budget. Funding allocated to the RDP and replacement funding is preventative - targeting agri - environment improvements through Glastir; improved productivity and viability of businesses through BPS, the Food Business Investment Scheme, and the Rural Business Investment Scheme; the creation an d restoration of woodland; and many other schemes being delivered and being developed. We have maintained the match funding element of RDP through to the end of the programme, ensuring we will spend all of the resources available to us. All of the replace ment funding provided by the UK Government is being transferred to my budget, which will be used to support transition to SFS and for other Programme for Government priorities. 4.2 Details of which specific policies or programmes in the portfolio are int ended to be preventative. RDP and replacement capital funding programmes are designed in such a way to promote sustainable practices and drive reduction in carbon emissions (and therefore work to prevent the impact of climate change). For example, through the Sustainable Production Grant, delivered through the RDP, g rants range from \u00a312,000 to \u00a350,000 as a maximum 40% contribution to project costs. The items supported will include, amongst other things, covered and uncovered slurry storage and management equipment. This will give more farmers the opportunity to take the lead in tackling agri - pollution to improve water, soil and air quality. 5. Evidence -based policy making 5.1 An explanation of how you have used evidence in prioritising your draft budget allocations and how you will monitor and evaluate programmes to ensure they provide value for money and inform future budget setting processes. The Welsh environment underpins the agriculture, fisheries, tourism and forestry sectors, and is of importance to other policy areas including health and well -being, energy and infrastructure. In order to inform the development of policies that build social, economic and environmental resilience and to evaluate programme implementation we are investing annually in the Environment & Rural Affairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP). 15 ERAMMP is delivering a programme of environmental monitoring and modelling; it collects and assimilates data, undertakes analysis and modelling and supplies policy teams, NRW an d stakeholders with targeted evidence. With regards to the Rural Development Plan (RDP), I acknowledge the importance of the evaluation of the current Programme to provide an evidence base for any future arrangements. The evaluation plan for the current RDP was formally agreed with the European Commission as part of the Programme approval, the evaluation plan and delivery against this is a mandatory component of the Programme. I will ensure robust monitoring and evaluation are put in place to assess the impact and effectiveness of schemes to be delivered with replacement funding, which are currently being developed. We will seek to learn from the monitoring and evaluation framework in place for RDP funding. Value for money will be cornerstone of all evaluation. 5.2 Details of how the development of the draft budget has been informed and influenced as a result of consultation with stakeholders. 6. Well-being of Future Generations Act 6.1 How the Act has informed decisions on specific budget allocations My draft budget preparations shows how I have sought to reflect the framework of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in setting our spending priorities. We reviewed current trends and futu re projections and their potential impacts in the short, medium and longer term. We did this to ensure, as far as possible, that short term responses do not have longer term detrimental impacts. Through the Sustainable Management Scheme (SMS) we are suppo rting collaborative landscape -scale projects delivering action that improves our natural resources in a way that delivers benefits to farm and rural businesses and rural communities. It will also support and facilitate co -ordination with other schemes to undertake the vital action needed to improve the resilience of farm and rural businesses and rural communities to climate impacts. The SMS is designed to support the de livery of our commitment to sustainable development as set out in the Well-being of Future Generations Act . The need to tackle inter -generational challenges, such as climate change and declining biodiversity, means that interventions and actions need to be undertaken t o enable Wales to grow, to improve resilience and to manage our natural resources sustainably and efficiently. All replacement funding for rural development will need to align with the priorities for the sustainable management of natural resources. These priorities are framed around the ways that natural resources can support our well -being goals and address both the risks to the environment an d the social and economic benefits they provide. 16 6.2 How has the impact assessment process has influenced the de velopment of the draft budget, including examples of where a decision has been assessed against the Welsh Government's well -being objectives After reviewing the key changes above, a number of key programmes were subject to Integrated Impact Assessments cov ering equality, Welsh language and Children's Rights. Integrated impact assessments are mainstreamed into policy setting as well as budgetary decisions. I am pleased to note we've not made any budget reductions in this draft budget, and so any impact ass essments were carried out on a number of new budget and policy initiatives. All of the schemes and projects we will take forwards have been assessed through the lens of our well -being objectives, and all will need to undertake impact assessments to secure funding. The results from the impact assessments show that there are no disproportionate impacts on the identified groups due to these budgetary decisions. 7. Equality, Welsh language and children's rights assessment 7.1 Impact of the draft budget on groups with protected characteristics and the Welsh language, including details of any relevant impact assessments The results from the impact assessments show that there are no disproportionate impacts on the identified groups due to these budgetary decisions. 7.2 How children's rights have been considered in the budget decisions for the portfolio Wales is the first country in the UK, and one of only a few countries in the world, to enshrine the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into domestic law with the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011. The duties within the Measure are implemented in two stages and place duties on Welsh Ministers to give balanced consideration to the rights in the UNCRC : and its optional protocols when formulating or reviewing policy and legislation; and when they use all their legal powers or duties. Across my portfolio, each member of staff is required to consider how their work affects children's rights , and this process has informed the Integrated Impact Assessment. No significant impacts on children's rights have been identified in the setting of this budget. 8. Budget 8.1 Details of the evidence base for budget decisions. We are committed to delivering a strategic approach to Fisheries, working with stakeholders. A clear focus will be on delivery of sustainable fisheries, managed in 17 an adaptive way, for which we have budget allocated for in the financial year. I intend to work with stakeholders to establish the priorities for delivery. A key enabler will be the underpinning of our strategic approach by a clear plan for investment in our seafood sector, and crucial to this investment will be the support we provide through a replacement to the EMFF scheme. We will design and develop a funding scheme, which will help us to deliver our strategic goals. The JFS must be published within two years of royal assent of the Fisheries Act 2020, by 23 November 2022. FMP and policy d evelopment associated with the JFS will be managed and prioritised within existing DRC and budget allocation for financial year 2022 -23. The Environment & Rural Affairs Monitoring and Modelling Programme (ERAMMP) is supporting the development of the proposed Sustainable Farming Scheme (see para 5. 1). In addition, the work estimating the economic effects of the proposed Scheme is being undertaken by a consortium of academics and consultants led by ADAS. This work represents an independent assessment of the economic effects of our proposals. The work is estimating the economic effects of key actions that we anticipate will form an important part of the proposed Scheme. These actions include habitat management; woodland management and creation; and land a nd nutrient management. 8.2 Details of the processes in place for monitoring budgets throughout the year, identifying potential deficits and surpluses, and taking remedial action to get the budget back on track or allocating additional funds to cover any shortfall All budgets continue to be monitored and challenged on a monthly basis during 2021 -22 and will continue in 2022 -23, to consider the latest forecasts and budget movements as necessary. I receive regular financial updates on the forecasts for the MEG to ensure that budgets remain on track to deliver my priorities. We maintain very close monitoring to ensure funding is being invested where best needed whilst supporting our priorities - in the right place, at the right time. Governance arrangements an d structures remain in place around the COVID -19 pandemic . 8.2 How the draft budget provides for the implementation of legislation passed in the Senedd, as well as any relevant UK legislation. WG have committed to introducing the National Minimum Standards (NMS), Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS), and Civil Sanction (CS) within the Agricultural White Paper and have two Bills scheduled within this term. These policies, while there is a link, are d istinct policies which stand on their own. NMS provides a regulatory baseline that applies to all farmers, SFS allows WG to support those who exceed this baseline, and CS provides a range of proportional enforcement tools for those who fall below the basel ine. Delivering this strategy will both meet Ministerial commitments and ensure a joined - up and consistent agricultural policy. 18 3.0 Budget Structure Summary of Budget Changes The table below provides an overview of the plans summarised a t a high level by business area for the Rural Affairs MEG. The total revenue budget is summarised in Table 1 below: The total capital budget is summarised in Table 2 below: 3.1 Resource The increase in the resource budget of \u00a3100m over the next three financial years is set out in Table 3 below: 19 In 2022 -23 the Revenue budget increases by \u00a315m against the 21 -22 baseline. The \u00a35m allocation supports my statutory obligations to fund TB compensation, which I have been managing as a pressure in previous years across my MEG. The other baseline allocations are to support Animal Health & Welfare and support the delivery of the co mmitments in the Co-operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru. The Farm funding replacement from the UK is direct EU replacement funding received for BPS and the RDP (if we remained in the EU) and therefore the available budget for farm funding has not increas ed. Capital The capital budget allocations of \u00a337m per annum is set out in Table 4 as follows: 1.0 Agriculture, Food & Fisheries - FUNDING OF ACTIONS The detailed breakdown of Actions by BEL activity is explained in the following sections. 20 Develop and deliver overarching policy and programmes on Agriculture, Food and Marine The Technical Advice Services BEL (2864) supports the delivery of a range of statutory duties, policy development and support services in relation to agriculture and the environment including, but not limited to, TB valuations, Environmental Impact Assessm ent (EIA) Agriculture Regulations, Agricultural Land Classification, plant health, Agricultural Land Tribunals, Agricultural Wages, the Agricultural Advisory Panel for Wales and the Control of Agricultural Pollution Regulations. BEL 2831 Funding is allocated to Welsh Local Authorities via the Heads of Trading Standards to deliver targeted and additional animal health and welfare enforcement activities via a local authority agreed Partnership Development Plan. The Plan delivers outcomes over and above the local authorities' statutory responsibilities as well as outcomes to improve animal health and welfare standards and the prevention of, and a more efficient response to, any animal disease outbreak. This contributes to the mitigation of the significan t expense and resource pressures for government and industry of such an outbreak. BEL 2860 This budget is the key mechanism for communicating and engaging with farming customers and the wider industry on Welsh Government administered schemes, policies and initiatives including the production of hard -copy updates to all BPS claimants and supporting farmers to become compliant with the Control of Agri Pollution Regulations. The budget also supports activities associated with the mental health and wellbeing of farmers including the Wales Farm Support Group and the continued promotion of FarmWell Wales. 21 The budget covers direct funding to the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society as well as other show Societies across Wales. Funding towards the implementation of recommendations from an independent review of the resilience of agricultural shows in response to Covid 19 will be supported from this budget. BEL 2861 - The allocation funds the CPH Project, which is rationalising and cleansing the CPH landscape in Wales . The allocated budget (\u00a3200,000) will ensure RPW continue to administer and develop the current IT platform with the other \u00a3300,000 being needed to support case work and other costs associated with the changing of CPH numbers for example amending APHA rec ords BEL 2862 EIDCymru is the sheep movement database for Welsh farmers, which meets the standards as set out in European Council Regulation 21/2004 where there is a requirement for member states to establish the basis for a European system to identify an d record movements of sheep, goats and deer. Non -compliance with these regulations could lead to infraction and impact on future post EU exit trade agreements. EIDCymru provides increased traceability, helping to mitigate against the significant expense to both government and industry of an animal sheep disease outbreak. CAP administration and making Payments in accordance with EU and WAG rules BEL 2787 Direct Payments are 100% Domestic funded Common Agricultural Programme payments. Payments are made directly to farmers who use the money to meet their business and other expenses. Payments for 2021 will be made in October (advance) and December (balances) Direct Payments for Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 (c.2), BEL 2790 RPW ICT systems comprises three main components: CAPIT : A rules bases application validation and payment system. 22 Scheme Editor : A Geographical Information System (GIS) based Lan d Parcel Identification System (LPIS) used to map all land farmed and claimed in Wales either for BPS or Glastir RPW Online : An online portal for farmers (claimants) to apply and claim for various CAP and RDP schemes. This system supports a 100% digital se rvice within RPW. Rural Economic and Sustainability Programme The purpose of this BEL is t o support the development of a domestic rural development programme from 2024, and develop and implement transitional schemes for farmers and land managers from 2021 to 2024 through EU Replacement Funding. The funding will provide programme support to develop the longer term programme. The outcomes and performance measures for schemes being developed through EU replacement funding will be developed at programme and scheme level. Welsh Government Rural Communities: Delivering the programmes within the Rural Development Plan 2014 -20 23 BEL 2949 - The Welsh Government Rural Communities - Rural Development Programme 2014 -2020 is a 7 year investment pr ogramme suppor ting a wide range of activities. Evidence based development for Rural Affairs This BEL funds important research and evaluation activity in relation to Welsh agriculture. This comprises two strands: 1) The Farm Business Survey (FBS) is an annual survey of farm businesses in Wales. It is conducted with the primary purpose of collecting detailed physical and financial data about the economic position of farm businesses throughout Wales. The survey is the p rimary source of information on the economics of farm businesses. The survey provides evidence on the levels of income in different agricultural sectors in Wales, financial performance, and farms' financial situation (assets, liabilities, net worth). For e xample, the Farm Business Survey is the source of the commonly quoted figure: on average, 80% of Welsh farmers' income derives from the Basic Farm Payment. 2) The FAPRI -UK economic modelling research project involves the development and maintenance of an eco nomic modelling system which captures the dynamic inter-relationships among the variables affecting supply and demand in the main agricultural sectors of Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The FAPRI -UK research project will provide a key source of evidence on domestic agriculture policy. Fisheries and aquaculture including the enforcement of Welsh Fisheries 24 BEL 2830 - This BEL supports the co -financing of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) which offers financing to industry and directly to Welsh Government to implement the revised Common Fisheries Policy through the development of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture. The scheme combines data collection, integrated maritime policy and control / enforcement funding elements directly to Welsh Government. The EMFF is a UK fund with a core allocation of \u20ac145m. The intra UK split was agreed, following negotiati ons between the UK Administrations at both Ministerial and senior official level. BEL 2870 covers funding for the following; Marine Biodiversity working with the eNGOs to develop a short term recovery plan which leads to a longer term programme of resto ration Marine Planning (inc Renewables) To support implementation of the Welsh National Marine Plan and compliance with statutory duties under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, specialist technical support is provided by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) to the marine planning project. The \u00a3168,000 budget is an existing, signed contractual obligation for CEFAS staff to provide this support. Fisheries Science and Evidence Fisheries Digital Systems - Digital fisheries management systems include a range of IT systems for catch recording, vessel monitoring, recording fisheries and marine licence inspections, fish sales records and health and safety systems for enforcement officers. Domestic Fisheries Policy The Domestic Fisheries Policy and Management Branch will continue to meet statutory obligations to manage permitted fisheries and deliver longstanding commitments to introduce secondary legislation for fisheries. This work will ensure our fisheries are sustainable by protecting the environment whilst, at the same time, maximising the economic and social benefits of fisheries to Wales. Marine & Fisheries Trade - core funding for Welsh Fisherman's Association (WFA ) Control & Enforcement -The Control and Enforcement budget covers all operational costs around Control and Enforcement staff, Fisheries Patrol Enforcement Team and Fisheries Patrol Vessels including maintenance, fuel and insurance. 25 Stakeholder Engagement - Marine and Fisheries has two ove rarching stakeholder groups. Wales Marine and Fisheries Advisory Group (WMFAG) has a publicly appointed chair and represents the Fisheries sector. The Wales Marine Action and Advisory Group (WMAAG) has a contractual facilitator and represents the marine sector. Costs are contractual obligations with remaining funds for venue hire, catering and associated subsistence costs. Developing and Marketing Welsh Food and Drink BEL 2970 funds programmes across the food spectrum, leveraging financial resources from wider Welsh Government including RDP, EFF, ERF and a number of smaller initiatives as well as external funding sources such as Growth Deals; support business survival and resilienc e post Covid -19 and EU exit by leveraging funds to support food sector growth, working with retailers to encourage increased Welsh food and drink product listings, helping to secure an increased online presence of Welsh producers and promotion activities t o increase the Welsh food manufacturing's share of supply into the food service sector, tourism and the public sector; and promote the Welsh food industry through international events and networks designed to increase inward investment. Protect and Impr ove Animal Health & Welfare - FUNDING OF ACTIONS The detailed breakdown of Actions by BEL activity is explained in the following sections. Support and Delivery of the Animal Health and Welfare programme / strategy 26 This budget covers a range of Government expenditure on animal health, welfare, disease prevention and control as well as surveillance and proactive management/contingency planning for exotic diseases. It includes on -going support to the Wales Animal Healt h and Welfare Framework Group and the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Animals and the Environment Delivery Group. This enables us to work in partnership with industry to raise standards of animal health and welfare, promote the responsible use of antibio tics and take effective action to manage animal disease outbreaks. Management and delivery of TB Eradication and other Endemic Diseases The majority of funding supports the delivery of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) services in Wales. The funding helps safeguard animal health and welfare as well as public health, enhances food security through research, surveillance and inspecti on. The majority of funding is to meet costs of delivery services provided by APHA including contribution to GB wide APHA surveillance activity. Funding is also provided for the statutory work undertaken by Food Standards Agency and funding to cover stat utory TSE compensation payments should need arise. The large proportion of APHA activity implements statutory requirements and Welsh Government policy relating to the TB Eradication Programme (in addition to BEL 2273) as well as applying controls to ensu re the protection of human health and the human food chain. The budget is in place to mitigate: The failure to take effective action in the event of an exotic animal disease outbreak has wider repercussions given that the Welsh Government has contingent (financial) liability for unbudgeted costs in those circumstances e.g. cost to Government in Wales was estimated at around \u00a3100m in the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease Outbreak when it was a non -devolved issue. In today's terms that cost could be significantly more without estimating damage to industry and 27 tourism in Wales where there would be a severe detrimental impact to household incomes. The failure to demonstrate effective control on animal disease could undermine future negotiations on a single market w here requirements for having in place animal disease controls at least equivalent to other Members States may be a position heavily emphasised as part of any trade agreement with the European Community. Reductions in levels of animal disease control will impact on current and future UK trade negotiations as the UK will be expected to be able to demonstrate levels of control at least equivalent to European Member States. BEL 2272 is a 'demand led' budget and as previously mentioned the Welsh Government has a statutory duty to pay TB compensation. The amount of animals removed and therefore the pressure on this budget is inextricably linked to the progress of TB Eradication and the TB Eradication Programme budget (BEL 2273). Any interruption to eradication policies may result in disease spread, which in turn is likely to result in increased TB Compensation spend. If overspends occur there would be a consequence on wider OCVO and ESNR budgets, as these may also be called on to offset any overspend as seen in previous years . BEL 2273 This budget covers a statutory commitment to the UK TB Eradication Plan. This BEL supplements the activity undertaken by our delivery partner The Animal an d Plant Health Agency (APHA) to deliver TB policies, including annual testing, and initiatives and projects such as Cymorth TB and epidemiological work to help underpin the evidence and approach to the TB Eradication Programme. This work is partly funded b y this BEL and also by BEL 2271 (Animal Health and Welfare Delivery and Payments). Rural Affairs Monitoring and EU Exit Strategy - FUNDING OF ACTIONS The detailed breakdown of Actions by BEL activity is explained in the following sections. Rural Aff airs Monitoring, EU Exit Strategy 28 This BEL supports the EU Exit and Strategy Unit. The EU Exit & Strategy Unit (EESU) was created to coordinate, support and drive our exit from the EU and transition activities. The Unit works across the Climate Change and Rural Affairs portfolios, to facilitate, co -ordinate and deliver strategic evidence, modelling and their practical applications to support the portfolios' wider policy making. With the completion of a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU th e Unit's primary focus is to support the operationalisation of new cross -cutting functions and structures arising from leaving the EU, with the primary responsibility for developing, delivering, managing and communicating policies resting with each of the respective policy teams Summary The RA MEG Draft Budget BEL table for 2022 -23 is presented to the Committee for consideration.

The AME draft Budget figures reflects the forecasts submitted to the Office for Budget Responsibility in August 2021. 1.2 Commentary on Actions & Detail of Budget Expenditure Line (BEL) Allocations 1.2.1 A breakdown of changes to the Education and Welsh Language MEG by BEL for 202 2-23 is provided at Annex A . The report provides detail on 202 1-22 First and Second Supplementary Budget allocations, 202 1-22 forecast outturn and 20 20-21 final outturns as requested by the Committee. A commentary expla ining the changes to each Action within the MEG is also provided at 5 Annex B . A transparent narrative explanation has been provided to explain increases and reductions, where not covered in the evidence paper, and confirmation of where the transfers have been al located to/from. 1.2.2 For Draft Budget, Final Budget 2021 -22, rather than the First Supplementary Budget 2021 -22, has been used as the baseline budget for comparative purposes, with a series of minor adjustments (covered u nder paragraph 1.1.2 for revenue and 1 .1.5 for capital ). 1.3 Education Priorities & Other Strategic Priorities 1.3.1 Our ambitious Programme for Government sets out our continued commitment to implementing our long-term programme of education reform , and ensuring educational inequalities narrow and s tandards rise . Our government programme recognises the impact of the coronavirus pandemic - we cannot allow the pandemic to exacerbate the impact of poverty on education outcomes . Above all else, our national mission is to t ackle the impact of poverty on educational attainment and set high standards for all so we can support every learner. 1.3.2 The Draft Budget supports priorities and key areas of work under the government programme including: Our e ducation reforms with Curriculum for Wales at the centre as a shared national endeavour. To support all learners to reach their potential, we will also implement our Additional Learning Needs Act . Covid recovery - the draft budget sets out the funding we are directing t o Covid recovery through our Renew and Reform plan published in June 2021. Whilst it is clear the pandemic has had a significant impact on our schools and settings and on our learners and communities, we must ensure that the emphasis placed on well-being , flexibility and digital in the education system over the last year is built on and closely aligned with our exciting new curriculum . Supporting all learners - working with children and young people, our education workforce, parents and guardians and school communities to ensure the best outcomes for all learners, further closing the attainment gap and raising the aspirations of all lear ners to achieve their potential. Welsh language - strengthening our Welsh language education provision to support our ambitions of creating one million Welsh speakers who can enjoy using the Welsh language in their daily lives and support thriving commun ities across Wales where our unique language is owned by everyone in Wales. The language belongs to us all, regardless of ability, and we want to encourage everyday use by everyone , however much they have. 6 1.3.3 This Budget reflects a number of allocations to support delivery of our Programme for Government commitments , including: \u00a337.5m in 2022 \u00a323m in 2024 -25 to support the continuation of our Recruit, Recover & Raise Standards (RRRS) Programme funding up to 1,800 additional staff in schools; \u00a320m increase to the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) from 2022 -23 to support our most economically vulnerable learners, including funding to continue PDG -Access (see section 2.3); an additional \u00a37m per annum from 2022 -23 to support for Additional Learning Needs (see section 2.8); \u00a36.5m from 2022 -23 to support our International Learning Ex change (ILE) programme (see section 1.5); \u00a33m in 2022 -23, with funding rising in future years to support the reform of the school day and school year, together with community schools; an additional \u00a33m from 2022 -23 to establish a National Music Service, taking total funding to \u00a34.5m per annum; \u00a32m extra in 2022 -23, rising to \u00a34.9m by 2024 -25, to develop and take forward the proposals of the Interim Youth Board for Wa les (see section 2.15); additional funding of \u00a32m in 2022 -23, increasing to \u00a34m by 2024 provide additional counselling provision (see section 2.6); \u00a32.2m per annum from 2022 -23 (identified from funding within the MEG ) to expand our Welsh section 2.13); \u00a31.5m in 2022 -23, with further funding in 2023 -24 and 2024 -25, to take forward post -16 ref orm, including any costs associated with the Tertiary and Education Research Bill (see section 1.5); \u00a31m in each of 2022 -23 and 2023 -24 for a review of adult learning in preparation for an increased funding duty and additional \u00a318m in 2024 -25 (this is part of the post -16 increase of over \u00a350m which also covers demographic and renew and reform increases ); and General capital of \u00a3300m per annum from 2022 -23 to transform learning environments through our 21st Century Schools Programme ( Sustainable Communities for Learning from 1 January 2022), including the creation of net zero carbon schools. 1.3.4 It also reflects additional investment to support the Welsh Government Co - operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru announced on 22 November , including : \u00a340m in 2022 -23, \u00a370m in 2023 -24, rising to \u00a390m by 2024 -25 to support the commitment to extend free school meals to all primary school pupils; \u00a31.5m in 2022 -23 and up to to ensure that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and the National Centre for Learning Welsh can increase the proportion of apprenticeships and further education opportunities that are available through the medium of Welsh, and to provide free Welsh langua ge learning for 16 -25 year olds; and 7 1.3.5 As part of preparations for draft budget, a number of discussions have been held with the Minister for Finance and Local Government regard ing the necessary level of resources to deliver our key priorities , including schools core funding through the Local Government settlement (see section 2.1) . In terms of the cross -cutting impacts of our spending plans, f unding to support children and young people's physical, emotional and mental health wellbeing remains a priority for this Government. In this Budget, we are increasing our investment in supporting young people's mental health and wellbeing in the Education and Welsh Language MEG by an extra \u00a35.5m in 2022 -23 rising to \u00a310.5m by 2024 -25. Taken with the additional funding being allocated to the Health and Social Services portfolio, it takes additional mental health funding in this Budget to \u00a3100m by 2024 -25. 1.3.6 We will work across government to de liver a number of cross -cutting commitments including around the Welsh language, tackling inequalities and ensuring equity, and tackling the impact of climate change through changes we can make in our education estate including around net zero carbon. 1.3.7 Value for money and clarity over how we use our resources effectively is central to delivering our priorities, particularly as we move to recover from the pandemic . Once expenditure is planned in line with priorities, we have well - established processes in place to ensure that resources are used effectively for the purposes intended. The governance and monitoring procedures in place reflect the nature of our relatio nships with delivery partners. These budget proposals reflect my continuing commitment to protect and prioritise investment that supports preventative measures as far as possible. 1.4 Children's rights and other cross -cutting considerations Impact Assessments 1.4.1 We have over recent years taken an integrated approach to impact assessments, which includes consideration of children's rights, reflecting their protected characteristics under the Equality Act, as well as taking into account the impact of d ecisions and policies on social, economic, cultural and environmental well -being, as set out within the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act which continues to be an important driver guiding our Budget considerations. We have continued to embed the WFG Act's five ways of working in our approach and the processes that support it. 1.4.2 We believe that an integrated approach enables us to understand more clearly the overall impact of decisions on children and young people. Under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, we have given balanced consideration and due regard to the rights set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). 1.4.3 In line with previous years, a specific Children's Rights Impact Assessmen t (CRIA) has not been undertaken for the Education and Welsh Language MEG as part of draft budge t. Detailed impact assessments, including Children's 8 Rights Impact Assessment (CRIA) are undertaken as part of our ongoing policy development and review. These assessments will continue to be used to inform budget decisions and the wider impact assessment of the budget. This approach, in the context of the budget allocations, ensures that evidence and understanding of impacts are considered from the outset and th roughout the course of our budget preparations. 1.4.4 Our Draft Budget, published on 20 December 2021 , sets out the impacts of our spending decisions as part of the main narratives in chapters four and six, including highlighting spending decisions that directly impact on children and young people. This is complemented by the Strategic Integra ted Impact Assessment (SIIA) , outlining the contextual evidence that has supported our spending decisions, including the impact of the pandemic on children and young people. The SIIA a lso includes more -detailed case studies on the impacts of specific spending decisions, including Free School Meals . Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 1.4.5 In this unprecedented context we continue to be guided by the five w ays of working in the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 to improve how we make decisions. We recognise the need to collaborate with our partners and to use our collective resources effectively to plan for the tough choices ahead. 1.4.6 We continue to work with the Future Generations Commissioner and a range of experts to assess how we are addressing the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act. Our National Mission has the well -being of future generations at its heart; and will see i mplementation of a new curriculum that is broad, balanced, inclusive and challenging. We also recognise that curriculum reform in isolation will not provide sustainable change. The new curriculum is being designed so that it maximises its contribution to e ach of the well -being goals. 1.5 Costs of Legislation Details of any allocations within the 2022 -23 budget intended for the implementation of the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 and associated qualifications reform 1.5.1 Continued investment to support Curriculum for Wales implementation is essential to realise our ambitions. We are maintaining 2021 -22 funding levels in this area (which included an extra \u00a38.3m over 2020 -21 provision) to provide ongoing support for the effective implementation of the new Curriculum for Wales from September 2022. While this update is necessarily focussed on financial aspects, curriculum reform and the implementation of the Act involves a more multi -faceted approach to roll out. For example, the work undertaken to lift unnecessary requirements on schools and settings during the pandemic as non -financial ways of creating space for reform. In addition, we recogni se the focus on wellbeing as a precursor for high quality learning. The emphasis we place on learner progr ession under the Renew and Reform 9 programme also provides for significant steps towards curriculum reform in schools and settings. That is why additional Renew and Reform funding (\u00a36m provided in 2021 -22) for learning progression, will be extended to cover three academic years of support for schools, settings and learners (\u00a35.33m in 2022 - 23, \u00a35m in 2023 -24 and \u00a31.66m in 2024 -25 to the Curriculum Reform BEL ). 1.5.2 The updated Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Act published in April 2021 highlighted the complexities of cost anal ysis for these reforms. We have been clear on our ambition to ease the burdens on schools and settings where possible, so they can better focus their time on meeting the needs of their learners, and within that undertake the necessary preparations for esse ntial reforms. For 2021 -22 financial year support of curriculum implementation is at some \u00a334.85 m, covering central costs (resources and supporting materials, research and evaluation, communications, National Network etc), schools' and settings' direct cos ts, work on progression and wellbeing, Professional Learning and new qualifications development. RIA estimates for comparable activity range between \u00a3 23.75 m and \u00a336.53 m. Provision in our budget for 2022 -23 is at some \u00a335 m reflecting the priority we are placing on supporting schools and settings in their implementation of these reforms. 1.5.3 We continue to closely monitor the funding and support requirements of schools and settings through our Evaluation and Monitoring appr oach (see section 2.5) , regular ongoing discussions with middle tier stakeholders and through the National Network for curriculum implementation. On the National Network, while still in its first term of operation it has run three separate 'conversations' on key aspects of implementation, offering 60 engagement sessions facilitated by practitioners, for practitioners. Take up has been good, with very positive initial feedback. Analysis of outputs from National Network conversations is a feature of the appro ach, and resulting reports will be published as part of that ongoing support process going forward. 1.5.4 Work is well underway developing resources and supporting materials for schools and settings linked to the Curriculum for Wales. A National Network conversation in the autumn term also focused on needs in this area. We are prioritising development linked t o notable changes in curriculum requirements and agreed priorities. These include new bilingual resources covering aspects of curriculum and assessment design and development, as well as those covering curriculum areas, including: Reading Mathematics and numeracy International languages British Sign Language Careers and work related experiences Media literacy and misinformation Politics Children's rights Welsh history, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic histories and contributions 10 Global cit izenship Music Dance 1.5.5 We have also produced a range of modules particularly to support early learning, but which can support learners of any age. These modules have been co -constructed with stakeholders from the early education and childcare sectors and include: Outdoor learning Child development Transitions Observation Play and play -based learning Authentic and purposeful learning We are considering what additional support is required to ensure these training modules are best employed to support learning. 1.5.6 Our ongoing and ground breaking investment in Professional Learning (PL) remains essential to supporting schools and settings implement their curriculum reform, which is why we have prioritised that ongoing investment over the three years of our draft budget. Details of provision in this key area is set out in section 2.4 . 1.5.7 Regarding the development of new qualifications that reflect the Curriculum for Wales, the expected costs for those were included in the RIA (para 8.213). To date, there has been no change to those cost projections and we have made provision for this forward funding within our draft Budget. This year, Qualifications Wales is continuing to work with stakeholders to agree the design of reformed GCSEs and other made -for-Wales qua lifications. As part of that work it is undertaking a range of impact assessments to inform proposals for the content and assessment of new qualifications. This includes integrated assessments of potential impacts on learners, schools and colleges, and par ticularly awarding bodies, including the WJEC. An example of this integrated approach can be found in their Qualified for the future decision report published in October, which includes a high level impact assessment summary. 1.5.8 More detailed impact assessment analysis will take place (and be reported on) as part of the next phase of Qualifications Wales's work as they co - construct the content and assessment arrangements for new made -for-Wales qualifications in each area of learni ng and experience. That process will involve input from schools, experts and awarding bodies. The approach will include looking at the potential impacts of changes in the round, as well as at individual qualification level, and will include an assessment o f whether new content and assessment will lead to changes in qualification fees charged by awarding bodies. Members can expect to see the outcome of this further analysis in late 2023 when Qualifications Wales will be seeking feedback on the proposed desig n of new qualifications. At that point, Qualifications Wales 11 will review the timing and overall costs of curriculum -related qualification reforms. 1.5.9 In addition to reforming a new suite of made -for-Wales GCSEs and related qualifications, Qualifications Wale s is also gathering views to inform a review of the wider qualifications offer for learners aged 14 -16. It is not yet known whether any changes proposed as a result of this work would be likely to lead to additional costs to those already included in the R IA (para 8.213). Based on the findings of its review, Qualifications Wales will consult on proposed changes to the wider 14 -16 qualification offer at the end of 2023. As part of that consultation, it will seek views on its assessment of the potential impac t of any proposed changes, including their likely cost. Details of any allocations within the 2022 -23 budget intended for the implementation of the PCET reforms , including any costs associated with the Tertiary and Education Research Bill 1.5.10 The table below summarises the funding allocated in this Bud get to support the PCET reforms, including the transitional and recurrent costs of establishing the Commission for Tertiary Education and Research (CTER) . \u00a3000 Establishment costs for the creation of the Commission for Tertiar y Education and Research (CTER) 1,500 7,000 6,000 Internatio nal Learning Exchange Programme4 6,500 6,500 6,500 1.5.11 The Commission is due to be established in 2023, with implementation to take place in 2024 and into 2025. Costs increase from 2023-24 onwards as this is when recurrent costs will be incurred alongside transition costs. 1.5.12 In this Budget we are allocating \u00a36.5m per annum as part of our Programme for Government commitment to put in place a \u00a365m I nternational Learning Exhange programme. This \u00a365m, 5 -year programme, set out in the Programme for Government, is ensuring that as we overcome the pandem ic, all the opportunities young people would have had before it are available again. However it will go further, providing more opportunities, and bringing new benefits to our education providers. 1.5.13 The programme will support international mobilities acros s all educational settings across Wales, including Youth Work, and includes support for learners and staff at all levels. It sends a clear message: that despite the challenges of the EU Exit and COVID -19, Wales will continue to be an outward -looking, welc oming nation that values international collaboration and partnerships. We are ambitious about how many can benefit from this new scheme. The possibilities this Programme offers are vast. However, we expect at least: - 15,000 participants in outbound mobil ity exchanges by 31 August 2026 4 PCET reforms go wider than just CTER so ILE Programme has been included. 12 - 10,000 participants in inbound mobility by 31 August 2026 - 50 new partnerships - 40 countries total involved in the Programme An update on any ongoing c osts to the Education and Welsh Language MEG of implementing previous l egislation from the Fourth and Fifth Senedd s, and any financial implications for the 2022 -23 budget 1.5.14 There are no costs associated with legislation passed in the Fourth Assembly for the Education and Welsh Language MEG . This includes: Qualifications Wales Act 2015; Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015; Education (Wales) Act 2014; and the Further and Higher Education (Governance and Information) (Wales) Act 2014, as all provisions within the Acts have now been implemented. 1.5.15 The costs associated with implement ing the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 and the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 within the Fifth Assembly are covered separatel y within section 1.5. Budget Provision for implementing the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 and the wider ALN Transformation Programme 1.5.16 The costs associated with the ALNET (Wales) Act 2018 and the wider ALN Implementation Programme are the total direct budget for ALN of \u00a36.936m in 2022 -23, to be met from the Additional Learning Needs BEL (this includes a transfer of \u00a34.4m from the Raising School Standards BEL representing the fundin g within that BEL that supports ALN). The budget will fund implementation support; workforce development; awareness raisi ng; and supporting policy. 1.5.17 We have made an extensive investm ent in the Additional Learning N eeds transformation programme to ensure that the education system is ready to implement the ALNET Act. We now move from transformation to implementation. Further detail on ALN funding is set out in section 2.8. Information on the financial impact of any relevant UK Parliament legislation 1.5.18 There is currently no UK Parliament legislation that impacts on the Education and Welsh Language MEG from 2022 -23 onwards . Financial Implications 2022 -23 of any relevant s ubordinate legislation 1.5.19 The budget continues to take account of relevant subordinate legislation in 2022 -23. Assessing the costs of implementing legislation and the impact on those it affects is an essent ial part of ensuring that the principles of \"Good Law\" are followed. This is why draft regulations are subject to a robust assessment of costs and benefits, achieved through consultation and engagement with our stakeholders, in the development of the regul atory 13 impact assessments (RIAs). This is to ensure our decisions are informed by the people who will be affected by them. 1.6 Impact of COVID -19 pandemic Impact of the pandemic o n the Education and Welsh Language MEG in both 2021-22 and 202 2-23, including movements in and out of budget lines, the gross contribution to -and receipt from - the Welsh Government's COVID -19 budgetary response, as well as the net effect of this. 1.6.1 There is a wealth of emerging evidence on the negative impact of the COVID - 19 pande mic on children and young people in Wales. Over the coming months and years we will need to continually monitor, review and assess the evidence and impacts of the pandemic. 1.6.2 Annex C provides a summary of the net impact of COVID -19 on the Education and Welsh Language MEG in 2021 -22, as a result of allocations from the Central COVID -19 Reserve (as at end November 2021 ). This confirms transfers in 2021 -22 totalling \u00a3169.4m (\u00a3151.9m resource and \u00a317.5 m capital) from the COVID -19 Reserve to the Education and Welsh Language MEG in 2021 -22. Unlike 2020 -21, there has been no contribution to the C OVID -19 Reserve from the Education and Welsh Language MEG in 2021 -22. Details and breakdown of the funding allocated for the education sector's response to the pandemic, quoted as \u00a3220m in 2020 -21 and \u00a3150m in 2021 -22, plus any allocation in 2022 -23 1.6.3 The Welsh Government provided over \u00a3220 m in financial year 2020 -21 to support the education system's response to COVID -19. The Renew an d Reform plan, published in June , outlines our commitment to supporting learners' wellbeing and progression in re sponse to the COVID -19 pandemic . The programme's key focus is to support a revitalised, reform -focused and resilient educational system that puts learners' physical and me ntal health and wellbeing at the heart of its approach. The Renew and Reform plan, at this stage, has been supported by \u00a3189 m (increase from \u00a3150m previously quoted) in 2021 -22, to address to support education. It is expected that \u00a3189m will increase as fu rther allocations are agreed for 2021 -22. 1.6.4 Funding for 2020 -2021 included : \u00a359.1m to support the Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards (RRRS) programme; \u00a320.9m for schools and colleges to provide learning support for Years 11, 12 and 13 moving on to schools , FE, HE; \u00a311.9m for educational technology in schools; \u00a361.2m additional funding for free school meals provision during the school holidays; \u00a336.5m to support learners to complete vocational qualifications with the current academic year; \u00a39.8m for additi onal learning needs, in response to pressures arising from the Covid -19 pandemic; 14 \u00a32.5m to support the increased mental health issues experienced in FE colleges and WBL providers; \u00a38.1m for provision of digital learning equipment and connectivity equipment for FE and WBL learners; and \u00a311.1m capital funding for making digital equipment available to learners across the FE and WBL networks; and to allow FE institutions to invest in IT infrastructure. 1.6.5 Funding of \u00a3189m (to date) for 2021 -22 funding is made up of: \u00a335.9m to support the RRRS programme; \u00a312m for schools and colleges to provide learning support for Years 11, 12 and 13 moving on to schools, FE, HE; \u00a323m to fund a range of activities in the 'summer of fun' and 'winter of wellbeing' programmes; \u00a37.7m to enable up to 1,400 teachers to confidently complete their qualifications and move into teaching; \u00a30.2m to extend the Creative Learning through the Arts (CLTA) programme; \u00a315m for educational technology in schools; \u00a333m to support post -16 learners enter ing new courses of study in schools, sixth form and FE; \u00a30.65m for e -resources to support blended learning and revision; \u00a313m to support Foundation Phase provision and non -maintained settings; \u00a323.8m additional funding for free school meals provision durin g the school holidays; \u00a32m to increase the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) Access scheme; \u00a34.85m to support the School Holiday Enrichment programme; \u00a36.25m to support learner wellbeing and progression in schools, and to establish resilience for future COVID -19 outbreaks and longer -term planning; \u00a32.4m to support Welsh Language, including late immersion provision and the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol; and \u00a310m to increase PLA opportunities. 1.6.6 Allocations for 2022 -23 are in the process of being finalised but is expect ed to include the following funding: \u00a337.5m for continuation of RRRS Programme; \u00a35.33m to support learner wellbeing and progression in schools (see paragraph 1.5.1) ; \u00a37m for Additional Learning Needs (see section 2.8) ; \u00a32m for additional counselling provision ( young people's mental health ); and \u00a33.5m for attendance to support and encourage learners who are disengaged or at risk of disengaging. Information on the availability and use of the COVID Local Government Hardship Fund for education purposes 1.6.7 The hardship fund has been available throughout 2020 -2021 and 2021 -2022 to support a wide range of additional costs and loss of income relating to Local 15 Authority education services . The fund has been managed under a set of principles which have been updated throughout the pandemic to reflect the rules and restrictions at the time. The table below shows the level of funding provided for education purposes (as at 13 December 2021). 2020 -21 \u00a3000 2021 -22 \u00a3000 Additional costs 40,684 2,5665 Total 135,468 28,885 1.6.8 The key areas of support in respect of education are: Extra cleaning costs; Cover for staff self -isolating or caring for a dependent self -isolating; Additional staff costs to create bubbles; Additional resources for home learning; Free school meals; and Loss of income from catering, lettings, music services. 1.6.9 No hardship fund is currently planned for 2022 -23 onwards as no additional funding for Covid has been provided by the UK Government . This was established as a short term fund to respond to the pandemic. The Minister for Finance and Local Government has provided funding through the local government settlement for 2022 -23, recognising the ongoing impact of the pandemic on local authority services which they will need to manage accordingly. Details of the allocations in 202 1-22 and 202 2-23 to further education institutions to support provision for learners whose course completion has been delayed, and the number of unique learners impacted. 1.6.10 Because of the pandemic related disruption, some learners require further support to successfully transition to the next stage of full -time learning, into apprenticeships, training, or directly into work. In 2020/21, \u00a38.5m was allocated to FE colleges and school sixth forms to provide dedicated transition support for those who were moving to the next steps in their educational journey. Anxiety in this group of learners is high and the Renew & Reform Post-16 and Transitions Proje ct will further explore ways of enhancing support for these young people. 1.6.11 Renew and Reform activity has been included within the over \u00a350m additional funding allocated to post -16 provision with decisions on what activity this will fund still being conside red with stakeholders. 5 Delay in processing claims for 2021 -22 so funding , once approved , will increase significantly 16 1.7 Impact of Brexit Information on any i mplications for the Education and Welsh Language MEG following the UK's withdrawal from the EU 1.7.1 There are currently no European projects within the EWL MEG. For the school milk scheme, which is administered by Rural Payments Agency on behalf of Welsh Government, the EU subsidy which was in the region of \u00a30.4m to \u00a30.5m per annum, ceased with effect from 15 October 2020. As a result there will be a requirement to fund the additional costs from t he school milk budget of \u00a33.2m per annum, which is within the Food and Nutrition in Schools BEL. As this budget is demand led we anticipate this budget will be sufficient to fund the scheme from 2022 -23, despite the withdrawal of EU subsidy. 1.7.2 Further detail on the ILE Programme, announced following the UK Government's decision to withdraw from the Erasmus+ scheme , is set out under section 1.5. Information on the amount of EU funding the 202 1-22 Education MEG has drawn on and the amount it is forecast to rely on in 2022-23 and the purposes for which it is put 1.7.3 As outlined above there are no European projects in the EWL MEG and therefore no funding has been drawn down in 2021 -22, or forecast for 2022 - 23 onwards. 1.8 Budget monitoring 1.8.1 All budgets continue to be monitored and challenged on a monthly basis during 202 1-22, to consider the latest forecasts and budget movements as necessary. This includes the monitoring of additional funding allocated from the COVID -19 Reserve this financial year. I rec eive regular financial updates on the forecasts for the MEG to ensure that budgets remain on track to deliver my priorities. We maintain very close monitoring to ensure funding is being invested where best needed whilst supporting our priorities - in the r ight place, at the right time. Governance arrangements and structures remain in place around the COVID -19 pandemic . 1.8.2 There are a number of provisional transfers planned for the Second Supplementary Budget 202 1-22 which will impact on the Education and Welsh Language MEG . These total a net increase to the MEG of \u00a3 170.4 m (\u00a394.4m resource and \u00a3 76m capital) and are summarised in the table at Annex D (reflect ing the position at the time of writing) . 17 2. Specific areas This section provides an update on specific areas requested by the Committee. 2.1 Funding for school budgets An explanation of how the Welsh Government has prioritised funding for schools in the 2 022-23 Draft Budget (in both the Finance and Local Government MEG and the Education and Welsh Language MEG) and taken account of the Sibieta review of school spending 2.1.1 The main source of funding the Welsh Government provides for schools is to local authorities through the Local Government Settlement, made up of Revenue Support Grant (RSG) and non -domestic rates within the Finance and Local Government MEG. Providing local government with the best possible settlement has been central to budget preparations again this year. 2.1.2 The review of school spending in Wales provides valuable evidence for policy makers to inform future funding and policy decisions . This evidence has been considered as part of th e 2022 -23 budget preparations. A number of areas were identified in the repor t where additional funding should be directed. Deprivation funding was a key area, with the recommendation that this should be delivered through specific grants such as an extended Pupil Development Grant (PDG). Funding for PDG BEL in 2021 -22 is over \u00a3110m , taking into account increases in eligibility for FSM during 2019. In this budget, a further \u00a320m has been allocated to support the PDG. 2.1.3 We continue to work closely with PDG regional representatives to identify those areas where funding can have most im pact, particularly in the context of the recommendations from the Review of School Spending in Wales report; in particular prioritising additional funding for schools in more deprived areas, and working with local authorities on ensuring more consistent an d transparent school funding formulae. 2.1.4 In this Budget, the increase to the Revenue Support Grant (RSG) for 2022 -23 is \u00a3368m (10.2%), leading to an overall increase in the settlement on a like for like basis of \u00a3437m (9.4%) to support front line services , including schools and social services. This builds on a significantly improved settlement in the current year. 2.1.5 Whilst local authorities are responsible for setting school budgets and this accounts for the vast majority of the funding schools receive, the Welsh Government continues to provide significant additional grant funding from the EWL MEG to support improved outcomes for learners in Wales. For example and further to the above increase in the PDG, an increase of \u00a37m to support ALN has also allocated in this draft budget. 18 An update on how the Welsh Government intends to respond to the Sibieta review 2.1.6 The Cov id pandemic has had a huge strain on public services, both financially and operationally. Welsh Government priorities adjusted to respond to the urgency of the situation and this has of course affected our ability to take forward some of the recommendation s in the time frame we originally anticipated , however, much has still been progressed and we continue to be committed to ensuring our schools receive the appropriate levels of funding. 2.1.7 The Review of School Spending, certainly highlighted the complexity o f the funding system and that work is needed to make this system not only more efficient but also more transparent. We are working with stakeholders at all levels to work through these complexities. 2.1.8 We are currently developing an ongoing programme of res earch into the effect of funding outcomes to support policy decisions, alongside a review of funding regulations to improve the transparency, consistency and comparability of data. 2.2 Funding for school improvement An explanation of how the Draft Budget 2022 -23 supports school improvement and raising standards of education 2.2.1 Budgets across the Education and Welsh Language MEG support school improvement and the raising of school standards; raising school standards is an underlying objective of education re form. School improvement services provided through local authorities and regional consortia are also funded directly through the Revenue Support Grant. 2.2.2 We delivered on our commitment from the Fifth Senedd to provide an additional \u00a3100m to raise school st andards. A further \u00a325.5m was allocated from the Raising School Standards BEL in 2021 -22 to maintain the commitment to raise school standards. In this Budget, funding within the Raising School Standards BEL is now being mainstreamed into the BELs within th e MEG that funding supports, as summarised below. Activity Budget Expenditure Line(BEL) \u00a3000 Leadership and Professional Learning Teacher Development and Support 14,740 Additional Learning Needs ALN 4,400 Curriculum (Books Trust, coding and digital skills, Primary LNF Oracy Scheme) Literacy & Numeracy 800 Foundation Phase Excellence Network (FPEN) Curriculum & Assessment 60 Repurposing of Class sizes grant - attendance support Tackling Disaffection 3,000 Repurposing of Small and Rural Schools grant - e-sgol and immersion provision Welsh in Education 2,500 Total 25,500 19 Details of the Regional Consortia School Improvement Grant (RCSIG) allocations in 202 1-22 and previous years, as well as any available indicative allocations for 202 2-23, broken down by consortium and 'objective' (or other heading, whichever is applicable) 2.2.3 The table at Annex E provides a breakdown of the RCSIG for 2021 -22 and the previous two years. This includes total funding by consortium or local authority. An indicative breakdown for 2022 -23 is not available at this stage. 2.2.4 During 2021 -22, local authorities in South West an d Mid Wales have formed new school improvement partnerships. The ERW regional consortium ceased operating at the end of August 2021. Therefore, the Welsh Government has provided the six local authorities who were formerly part of ERW with separate grants t o provide the support and services to its schools that Welsh Government funds through RCSIG. In most cases, these activities will be delivered through their new partnerships (Neath Port Talbot local authority are not currently part of a consortium or new p artnership). Information on the Education Improvement Grant element of the RCSIG and an update on how the Welsh Government is ensuring this is strategically used and its impact evaluated. 2.2.5 The Education Improvement Grant (EIG) remains part of RCSIG, whic h is used to support the regional consortia in delivering our priorities for schools and education outlined within Our National Mission and its update in October 2020. At the centre of this is a transformational curriculum, supported by four enabling objec tives, which the consortia's work must support. 2.2.6 While there is scope for the EIG to be used flexibly by regional consortia to support our national priorities, it remains predominantly focused on the Foundation Phase, support for Welsh in Education Strateg ic Plans and improving teaching and learning. A minimum delegation rate to schools of 80% must be maintained and assurance on this is sought by Welsh Government. 2.2.7 The terms and conditions of the grant are the mechanism for ensuring adherence to staff to pu pil ratios in schools. Consortia are required to determine their distribution formula to schools to support them to deliver the recommended ratios to deliver a high quality Foundation Phase. The funding must also be used to support Foundation Phase practit ioners in non - maintained settings to deliver high quality education provision. 2.2.8 Regional consortia are expected to evidence additionality of the funding and its impact. Delivery of the funding is monitored through milestones and key performance indicators outlined in consortia business plans. 20 2.3 Reducing the impact of deprivation on educational outcomes Information on how resources within the Education and Welsh Language MEG are being used to meet the Welsh Government's long -term commitment to reduce the impact of deprivation on educational outcomes. 2.3.1 Every learner, wherever they live, must have the opportunity to reach their potential. The PDG provides funding to mitigate the effects of deprivation on education by delivering \u00a31,150 per learne r to schools and early years settings. Additionally, PDG Access directly supports families by providing funding for the purchase of uniform, sports kit and other extra -curricular activity resources at key points in a learner's education including transitio n from primary to secondary school. 2.3.2 Furthermore, every child in Wales - including those who are looked after and formerly looked after - has the right to expect an excellent education regardless of their circumstances. We continue to support looked after children in education by over \u00a35m annually through PDG -LAC. The Regional Education Consortia administer this grant in collaboration with local authorities and schools. PDG -LAC funding is based on \u00a31,150 per looked after child; however the funding is not ri ng-fenced for each child. This approach enables Consortia, working with partners, to determine the most effective, strategic interventions to support care experienced young people regardless of care or school placement changes. 2.3.3 Allocations for Local Auth ority (LA) Sixth Forms and FEIs include a deprivation uplift for learners who come from the top four most educationally deprived areas as defined by the WIMD. A 40% uplift is applied to learners from the most deprived decile, 20% to the second most depriv e, 10% to the third and 5% to the fourth. For 2021 -22, the deprivation allocation to LA Sixth Forms and FEIs totalled \u00a319.839m (\u00a33.265m and \u00a316.574m respectively). This will be varied for 2022 -23 in line with changes to allocations. 2.3.4 The post-16 Provision budget now includes funding of \u00a36m for the F inancial Contingency Fund (FCF) , following the transfer of funding from the Targeted Student Support Awards BEL. This funding supports FE learners who are experiencing financial hardship and who might otherwise b e unable to attend college. It provides help with a range of course -related costs such as childcare, transport, free meals and equipment and learning materials. 2.3.5 Additional funding a llocated via COVID -19 Reserve will also naturally be allocated to those l earners most in need. Data is currently being collected to identify what proportion of the learner recovery and progression funding is being used by those domiciled in areas of educational deprivation . 2.3.6 In line with our Programme for Government commitment we have protected the Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA) for young people which is funded from the Student Support Grants BEL. The allowance remains at \u00a330 per week for the academic year 2021 -22, to encourage young people (aged 16-18) from lower inco me households to continue their education after their 21 compulsory schooling period has ended. EMA is demand led and published data for the 2020 -21 academic year (the latest full year) show that 18,690 applications were approved for EMA (around half of appli cations are continuing students) . Details of budget provision for the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) and the PDG Access fund . 2.3.7 Funding for the PDG has increased year on year, in particular this financial year due to the pandemic and rising numbers of learners eligible for Free School Meals. In line with our Programme for Government commitment, w e are continuing to invest record levels of funding in the PDG , increasing the budget by \u00a320m from 2022 -23, taki ng our total investment for PDG to more than \u00a3130m per annum to support our most economically vulnerable learners. This includes funding to continue PDG -Access. 2.3.8 As outlined in section 2.1, w e will continue to work closely with PDG regional representatives to identify those areas where funding can hav e most impact. We are committed to reviewing the use and impact of PDG and broader considerations in relation to COVID -19 recovery. What discussions has the Minister for Education and Welsh Language had with the Minister for Finance and Local Government about reviewing the Free School Meals (FSM) eligibility criteria with a view to extending entitlement \"as far as resources allow\" (as set out in the 2021 Programme for Government) 2.3.9 We are proud of our record on delivering free school meal provision for pupils in Wales and are committed to building on that provision. Earlier this year, our Programme for Government set out our intention to continue to meet the rise in demand for Free S chool Meals resulting from the pandemic, and to review the eligibility criteria for free school meals, extending entitlement as far as resources allow. Building on this, the Co-operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru which commits us to extend free school mea ls to all primary school pupils over the lifetime of the agreement. This represents an important further step to reaching our shared ambition that no child should go hungry and, in taking this action, an additional 196,000 children will become eligible to take up the offer of a free school meal in Wales. 2.3.10 Our ambitions are informed by our understanding that younger children are more likely to be living in relative income poverty and our commitment therefore represents a transformational intervention in ter ms of tackling poverty and child hunger. However, evidence also points toward the wider benefits of free school meals, including raising the profile of healthy eating, increasing the range of food pupils eat and improve their social skills at meal times as well as improvements to behaviour and attainment. 2.3.11 This significant investment will also enable us to use our levers to drive public procurement to increase local food production and distribution, which will in turn benefit local economies, ecologies and communities. 22 Estimated costs of different free school meal (FSM) eli gibility models, which the Welsh Government may be considering as part of its review of FSM eligibility, and how these are reflected in either the Education and Welsh Language MEG or the Finance and Local Government MEG 2.3.12 In this Budget, t o support the rollout of this commitment over the lifetime , we are making an investment of \u00a3200m over the next three years from the Education and Welsh Language MEG . Reflecting the importance of partnership working and preparatory work ahead of full rollout of this enhanced offer, this commitment will be de livered in stages, with \u00a340m being made available for FSM delivery in 2022 -23, \u00a370m being made available in 2023 - 24, and \u00a390m being made availa ble in 2024 -25. Any other funding within the Education and Welsh Language MEG for initiatives to tackle the deprivation/attainment negative correlation, for example holiday hunger and school holiday enrichment projects. 2.3.13 From 2022 -23 we are maintaining our investment in the School Holiday Enrichment Programme (SHEP) of \u00a34.85m per annum , following the additional funding of \u00a32.15m invested in last year's Budget , to support the potential to run schemes which are Covid secure. SHEP provides opportunities fo r children aged 7 -11 years to be more active, eat healthily and develop friendships whilst also making the most of local school facilities in disadvantaged areas during the summer holidays. It supports action to tackle health and educational inequalities a nd supports action to tackle food poverty during the summer holidays. During 2021 -22 the investment of \u00a34.85m enabled 7,780 children to benefit from the programme. 2.4 Education workforce Details of budget allocations to finance Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and professional learning for current teachers 2.4.1 There is dedicated funding within the Teacher Development and Support BEL to support and embed the reforms of ITE as follows: Approximately \u00a32.6m to deliver the alternative ITE routes; the Part -time PGCE and Salaried PGCE which form our coherent suite of high quality routes into teaching under our ITE Reforms. The Part -time PGCE and Salaried PGC E continue to be available in 20 22-23. The budget provides a training grant and sa lary contribution grant for ITE Students on the employment -based scheme, the Salaried PGCE, delivering priority Secondary subject teachers (Science, Maths, English and Welsh) into the workforce . In addition the Salaried PGCE (and Part -time PGCE) provides for those where a full -time ITE programme is not suitable including career changes, Welsh speakers in rural communities, career pathways for teaching assistants already employed in schools and supporting our efforts to diversify the teaching workforce by at tracting more Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic students . 23 Approximately \u00a32.6m to continue to deliver the priority subject incentive scheme to support recruitment into the profession. From 2023 -24 this budget will also support the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic incentive. This budget is demand -led and therefore final allocation and spend varies; the line is highly dependent on recruitment levels into ITE Programmes. \u00a30.160m has been made available in 2021 -22 to support costs relating to developing eviden ce informed policy to continue to support the Welsh Government 's ITE reforms. It is proposed that th is funding will continue in 2022 -23 to support the ongoing research exploring how best to support BAME recruitment into the profession as well as supporting events to mature and support our fledgling ITE Partnerships. Approximately \u00a30.8m for the Iaith Athrawon Yfory Welsh -medium incentive scheme targeted at Welsh speaking student teachers to encourage them to undertake an eligible postgraduate secondary ITE programme enabling them to teach through the medium of Welsh. The line is demand -led and is highly dependent on recruitment levels into ITE programmes (QTS). In addition the incentive scheme is paid at two points in a teacher's early career (on award of QT S and completion of Induction) and applicants have a number of years in which to claim each instalment. Therefore each year's budget allocation covers a number of cohorts up until their respective deadline dates and the final allocation and spend varies de pending on demand in the previous year. Up to \u00a30.25m has been allocated in 202 1-22 to continue the communications and marketing campaign for Teaching in Wales. It is proposed that this funding will continue in 2022 -23. Approximately \u00a30.3m is allocated annually to the FE Incentives programme to support the recruitment of students to PGCE for teaching in FE settings. It offers a grant to students studying a full -time PGCE FE course on a pre - employment basis at a Welsh Higher Education Institution (HEI). T he scheme has been in operation since the 2001/02 Academic Year. 2.4.2 The National Centre for Learning Welsh , funded via the Welsh Language BEL, is leading on a pilot project to incentivise young Welsh speakers to return from universities to help teach Welsh in schools. They will be working with partners in the education sector to offer a training course for students at the end of the academic year. In future years the project will also include a placement period in a secondary school. It is hoped that this pr oject will attract young people to teaching, and the Learn Welsh sector whilst also helping to increase the use of Welsh in schools. Professional learning for the workforce 2.4.3 The delivery of high quality professional learning is fundamental to meeting the overarching objective of implement ing a transformational curriculum from 2022. In 202 2-23 we will be allocating nearly \u00a337 .5m from the Teacher Development and Support BEL to support the development and delivery of 24 professional learning in accordance with o ur National Approach for Professional Learning. Funding will be allocated via various routes, including the regional consortia , National Academy for Educational Leadership and universities to support a number of priorities. The key elements of this funding are likely to include the following allocations. However, they may be subject to change as we finalise our planning : \u00a312m to be allocated to schools to enable them to prepare for the new curriculum and a further \u00a33m to be allocated to regional consortia and local authorities to enable schools to share practice as part of the professional learning offer. This is in addition to the \u00a343 million investment in professional learning, which has been awarded to schools since 2018 (\u00a39m in 2018 -19, \u00a315m in 2019 -20, \u00a37m in 2020 -21 and \u00a312m in 2021 -22). This funding is consistent with the costs outlined in the RIA of the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act. Approximately \u00a3 4.2m to be allocated to regions and other stakeholders to continue the Curriculum for Wales Dev elopment Programme to equip all schools to realise the new curriculum. Approximately \u00a31m to continue the National Professional Enquiry Programme to fund universities and a national network of lead enquiry schools to support wider system development. Appro ximately \u00a31m to continue to populate the Professional Learning Journey (PLJ) website with a wide range of high quality resources produced in partnership with regi ons and schools to support the additional professional learning INSET days. Nearly \u00a33m to support the development of the components of the Early Career Support Package, which includes the development and introduction of a national dedicated coaching and mentoring programme and the new Masters programme. \u00a36.4m to support Welsh -language and Welsh -medium professional learning. \u00a31m to continue to deliver professional learning to those assisting teaching. \u00a30.65m to enable our national pedagogy and practice network to continue to facilitate the co -construction of new approaches to teaching and learning that will be required by curriculum reform. \u00a31m to continue to support the teaching of A levels. \u00a30.25m to continue our commitment to develop all schools as le arning organisations, to enable them to identify their own strengths and priorities for improvement - including professional learning. Approximately \u00a3 1m to develop and implement the National Strategy for Educational Research and Enquiry to support evidence -informed policy, develop a research literate profession, and to develop research capacity within higher education in Wales. Approximately \u00a3 3m to fund the National Academy for Educational Leadership and the leadership programmes that have been accredited. 25 Information on any funding provided by the Welsh Government to the Education Workforce Council. 2.4.4 Grant funding of \u00a37.678m has been awarded to the Education Workforce Council (EWC) for 2021 -22 to support the following activities: Administration and notification of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS); Induction appeals and certification; Administration of the Induction programme for Newly Qualified Teachers in Wales; The maintenance and development of the Professional Learning Passport (PLP); Promotion of careers in the registered professions; Secretariat to Welsh Pay and Conditions Review Body; Data provision and analysis; Registration contribution; Initiatives / events to further embed the new ITE programmes and culture within Wales; FE and QTS mapping s tudy; and Further development of professional standards for FE and WBL. 2.4.5 Welsh Government officials will meet with EWC early in 2022 to discuss their grant award for 2022 -23. Details of funding for local authorities towards meeting the costs of the teachers' pay award for academic year of 202 1/22, including a breakdown between the 202 1-22 and 202 2-23 financial years and the respective mechanisms used (whether direct grant or incorporated into the local government settlement). 2.4.6 The increase of 1.75% across all teacher scale points and allowances from September 2021 equates to an estimated increase to the overall pay bill of \u00a314.87 million for financial year 2021 -22 (September 2021 to March 2022) and \u00a325.49 million for full year impact for financial ye ar 2022 -23. 2.4.7 Whilst the funding provided through the RSG is un -hypothecated and for each local authority to determine its own priorities, a significant factor in the Welsh Government's decision to increase funding for the RSG for 2021 -22, was to recognise the impact of teachers' pay. It was therefore anticipated that the costs of any 2021 -22 pay award would be met through funding allocated to local authorities via the RSG and their ability to raise funding through council tax. 2.4.8 However, f ollowing discussions with local authority representatives on ongoing and exceptional budget pressures as a result of the pandemic this financial year, in addition to the funding already provided within RSG, we have provided by direct grant through the EWL MEG a one-off further \u00a36.4m towards supporting the cost of the pay award in schools and sixth forms in 2021 -22 financial year. This equates to providing the 0.75% contribution to the overall 1.75% increase of the costs falling to 2021 -22. 26 2.4.9 In determining t he distribution of funding across authorities for the local government Settlement for 2022 -23, we have recognised the decisions made on the 2021 -22 teachers' pay deal, and the commitment made by local government to fund this deal, by directing the necessar y funding into the schools part of the formula. 2.5 Curriculum Reform Information on funding to support preparations for, and implementation of, the Curriculum for Wales including professional learning for the workforce 2.5.1 The funding to support the implementation of the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 and associated qualifications reform has been covered under section 1.5 (legislation). Further details on professional learning for the workforce has been detailed in section 2.4 ( education w orkforce ), and information on Qualifications Wales costs associated with curriculum reform is at section 2.12. 2.5.2 More generally, the Curriculum for Wales: implementation plan (January 2021) set out a common, strategic vision for what curriculum realisation means in practice, including information on the impact we want our reforms to make in support of all children and young people in Wales. The p lan included information on the long -term Evaluation and Monitoring Programme which is being used to gather and publically report evaluation, research and evidence vital to identifying required support, improving implementation and maintaining momentum. 2.5.3 The programme's initial readiness and scoping phase has focussed on engaging with a wide range of schools, settings and practitioners to understand the different levels of readiness in the sector. This has involved conversations with practitioners, surveys , interviews and evidence gathering through our delivery partners, though we have remained mindful of the need to limit the call on schools' at this time. Interim findings from primary and secondary school senior leaders was published in September and highlight that there remains considerable support for curriculum reform, and the challenges are finding the time and space within the context of the pandemic. These findings will be updated shortly - see: Practitioner survey on preparations for Curriculum and Assessment Reforms 2022 . In addition, this initial phase of the Evaluation and Monitoring Programme is developing a detailed pla n on how we will monitor and evaluate progress over the medium term, for publication early in 2022. 2.5.4 We have also undertaken work with the non -maintained sector and settings which deliver early education to 3 and 4 year olds to understand the additional support needs of the sector, including professional learning. 2.5.5 As schools and settings move from preparation into implementatio n from the next academic year, we expect our Evaluation and Monitoring Programme, 27 alongside our annual report, to form the basis of our progress reporting on curriculum implementation. 2.6 Emotional and mental health of children and young people Information on the financial implications for the Education and Welsh Language MEG in 202 2-23 of the work to embed a whole -school approach to emotional and mental health, including any funding to support the statutory guidance. 2.6.1 Following publication of the statutory whole school approach to wellbeing framework guidance in March 2021, we made \u00a39m available during 2021 -22 (\u00a37m from Health and Social Services MEG and \u00a32m from EWL MEG) to support implementation and evaluation of our work in this area. This recognis ed the cross cutting nat ure of this work and emphasised our commitment to progressing t his agenda. 2.6.2 In this Budget, we are increasing funding in the EWL MEG to support the whole school approach by \u00a33.2m in 2022 -23, with further increases in 2023 - 24 and 2024 -25. By 2024 -25, total funding to support the whole school approach in the EWL MEG rises to \u00a39.6m . Increasing funding in this area from 2022 -23 will enable us to further strengthen activity and embed wellbeing across education (not just in maintained schools) but in other areas and targeting some of the most vulnerable learners. Funding will continue to be targeted at those areas where we believe they will have the greatest impact including : Improving and extend the school counselling service , which sees around 11,500 children and young people each year, and to deliver the recommendation s contained in the Cardiff University review into the efficacy of the existing service and the need to extend age appropriate support below the current Yr6 thr eshold. School counselling is also an integral element of the continuum of support available to l earners as part of our response to the impact of Covid19. To initiate universal and targeted wellbeing interventions in schools and to support teacher and other school staff training on wellbeing. Detail of how any funding from the Health and Social Servi ces MEG is being used to complemen t work in schools on this area. 2.6.3 From 2022 -23, \u00a37m is being maintained for the whole school approach within the Health and Social Services MEG, recognising the cross cutting nature of this work and emphasising our commitment to progressing this agenda. Taken together with the additional funding in the EWL MEG, funding will ensure we are able to support wellbeing needs, from building resilience to more targeted interventions for learners to ensure their needs can be met outside of specialist services, bringing savings and efficiencies for those services. For instance in 2021 -22 we have provided \u00a34m (\u00a35.5m provisional allocation in 2022 -23) to LHBs to roll out nationally the CAMHS school in - reach service, which sees dedicated mental health practitioners in schools 28 providing consultation, li aison, advice and training to teachers and other school staff. Details of funding for any additional or tailored initiatives to support children and young people's mental health in education settings during the COVID -19 pandemic. 2.6.4 Numerous studies have highlighted that the pandemic has inevitably caus ed additional anxiety for people of all ages, not least children and young people. We recognise that the emotional and wellbeing implications of COVID -19 are likely to outlast the physical impact of the pan demic, with children and young people affected by bereavement, the economic impact on their families, worries over the impact on their education and worries over their own health and that of families and friends. As such we view our whole school approach to emotional and mental wellbeing work as integral to tackling the impact of COVID -19 in its totality. 2.6.5 In this Budget, we have maintained funding of \u00a32m allocated since 2020 -21 to continue and extend initiatives that suppo rt mental health and wellbeing of both learners and staff i n the FE sector. FE institutions use their funding allocations for a wide range of activities, including the costs of employing staff for \"front line\" learner support; professional learning for staff to support learners; and the purchase or development of resources such as tutorial materials to help build learner resilience and coping skills. 2.6.6 Officials have commissioned an evaluation of the FE mental health funding which will report in March 2022. This will help to identify ways in which our guidance could be strengthened, and will look specifically at how colleges are evaluating the impact of their funded activities. 2.6.7 As part of this Budget, we are providing additional ring -fenced funding of \u00a32.3m in 2022 -23, with further allocations in 2023 -24 and 2024 -25, to further support mental health and wellbeing in post -16 education . This funding wil l form part of our Renew and Reform Post -16 Project to develop a whole system approach to mental health and wellbeing for post -16 learners. 2.6.8 In previous years, the Welsh Government has allocated significant additional resource to support the mental healt h and wellbeing of learners and practitioners across the post -16 sectors throughout the pandemic. 2.6.9 In 2020 -21, \u00a34.5m was allocated to the FE sector for this purpose, with a further \u00a32m allocated in 2021 -22 to build on and embed the initiatives developed by providers which include additional one -to-one support. 2.6.10 For universities in 2020 -21, a total of \u00a350m was allocated to help provide additional support for students and staff members impacted by the pandemic. This included an initial \u00a310m to provide incre ased support to students facing financial, emotional or mental health difficulties and a further \u00a340m in January 2021 to support student financial hardship, making Wales the most generous of the four nations in this regard. 29 2.6.11 In addition to specific mental health support, school sixth forms and FE colleges have also benefitted from \u00a333m Learner recovery and progression funding. In discussions with colleges it is clear that mental health and wellbeing is a continued concern and up to 40% of this funding is b eing used on 1-1 interventions to support these learners. We are still in the process of collecting data to identify any trends in learner characteristics, backgrounds or subject areas that are needing the most support. 2.7 Support for Minority Ethnic and Gy psy, Roma and Traveller learners Details of funding to support the education of M inority Ethnic and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (MEGRT) learners in 202 2-23 and how this is being distributed. 2.7.1 A total of \u00a311m per annum is being maintained and will be provided to local authorities over the next three years to provide continued support for ethnic minority and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller learners. This funding reflects the additional funding \u00a31m allocated in last year's Budget to recognise the increase in numbers of minority ethic learners with English as an additional language needing support. 2.7.2 We have developed a positive working relationship with local authorities and through a working group have co -constructed a revised funding formula and set of principles for the MEGRT grant. The revised formula and principles more accurately reflect the pur pose of the grant and offer a fairer distribution of funding. Funding is distributed using a formula based on numbers of children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) (excluding Gypsy Roma and Traveller (GRT)), plus numbers of GRT from the Pupil Le vel Annual School Census (PLASC). The decision to adopt EAL as a basis for the formula was based on research that language acquisition is a key factor in a child's ability to access education and in their attainment. 2.8 Additional Learning Needs An updat ed assessment of the pressures facing local authorities, schools, and colleges in delivering current SEN/ALN provision, the impact of the additional funding in previous years and whether further additional funding will be provided in 202 2-23. 2.8.1 The regulat ory impact assessment undertaken at the time the ALN Bill was developed concluded that the ALN system would be cost neutral, and as such, there should not be any additional ongoing costs once implemented. However, we have listened to local authorities, uni ons and head teachers about the potential costs of the phased implementation . 2.8.2 This Budget includes a continuation of the \u00a38m allocated since 2020 -21 for local authorities and FE colleges to support children and young people with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) , to meet additional costs associated with learners with complex needs and disabilities to ensure they succeed . 30 2.8.3 In this Budget, we are going further by allocating an additional \u00a37m per annum from 2022 -23 which will be directly allocated to local au thorities, maintained nurseries, schools and colleges. This funding will provide resources to transfer children and young people from the SEN system to the ALN system. This funding will also ensure that the needs of children and young people are listened t o and appropriate ALN provision is secured, if required. Funding will also meet the additional costs associated with learners with complex needs and disabilities to ensure they succeed. 2.8.4 Specialist FE provision is also essential to ensuring those young people with learning difficulties or disabilities whose needs cannot be met in their local college are able to access further education and training suitable to their needs. Last year we invested an extra \u00a31.4m to support students with learning difficultie s, bringing total funding to \u00a313.9m per annum. For 2022 -23 we are maintaining that investment to ensure we are able to meet existing demand for those learners up to the age of 25 who require specialist FE provision in order to access further education. 2.8.5 For Further Education, t he budget includes \u00a315.525m f or learners with ALN . This funding helps colleges provide the additional support which is necessary for learners with ALN to succeed on their chosen programmes of study . Information on funding provision for the ALN Transformation Programme and the implementation of the 2018 Act. 2.8.6 A \u00a320m package of funding was allocated by the Welsh Government in 2017 to support preparation for the implementation of the new ALN system duri ng the current Assembly term. As outlined in section 1.5 , the costs associated with the ALNET (Wales) Act 2018 and the wider ALN Implementation Programme are \u00a36.936m in 2021 -22 (ALN BEL). 2.8.7 Over the next two years this will fund a national implementation p rogramme to provide strategic direction and to work in collaboration with delivery partners across Wales to give advice, collect information and understand the impact of the ALN Act. The latest position on funding for the training of educational psychologists in Wales and the grant funding arrangement with Cardiff University. 2.8.8 The Welsh Government currently awards a grant to Cardiff University which pays fees and bursaries for 10 stud ents per year on their three year Doctorate in Educational Psychology professional training programme. At least one of these bursaries must be for students who can already, or ha ve the potential to work through the medium of Welsh . The current funding arra ngement is in place until August 2022 and discussions with the university regarding arrangements for the next three years are nearing completion. Funding of \u00a30.9m has been allocated from the ALN BEL in 2022 -23 to continue this commitment . 31 2.9 Infant class si zes Confirmation of whether the Reducing Infant Class Sizes Grant is continuing in 2022 -23 and an evaluation of the impact of funding for this in the previous Senedd 2.9.1 An additional \u00a336m (\u00a320m capital and \u00a316m revenue) was made available over the previous Senedd term to reduce infant class sizes along with a further \u00a36m this financial year targeted at schools with high levels of deprivation. The Reducing Infant Class Siz es grant will cease at the end of this academic year. 2.9.2 The \u00a320m capital element of the grant has funded 59 additional classrooms along with improved facilities in 33 schools across Wales. The majority of capital projects have been completed, although som e have been delayed due to the impact of COVID -19. Builds are able to continue to completion into the next financial year and will be managed as part of the 21 st Century Schools and Colleges programme. The capital funding has also provided additional spac e in schools where there is demand for Welsh -language places and supported the childcare offer. 2.9.3 The revenue element of the grant has funded 126 additional teachers and 48 additional teaching assistants to reduce infant class sizes in schools that meet the criteria. The proportion of infant classes in receipt of the grant with 29 pupils and over reduced from 84% in 2017 to 17.5% in 2021 and the average infant class size is now 23. Schools in receipt of the grant reported a number of benefits including incre ased teacher -pupil conta ct time, improving teaching and learning in the classroom. 2.9.4 Since the introduction of the grant in 2017, the national average infant class size has reduced from 25.6 in 2017 to 25.3 in 2021. 2.10 Small and Rural Schools Grant Confirma tion of whether the Small and Rural Schools Grant is continuing in 2022 -23 and an evaluation of the impact of funding for this in the previous Senedd 2.10.1 An additional \u00a310m was made available over the previous Senedd term to support Small and rural schools al ong with a further \u00a32.5m in 2021 -22. The small and rural schools grant will come to an end on 31 March 2022. 2.10.2 The aim of the grant is to encourage innovation and increase greater school to school working. Over 460 schools have benefitted from the grant to date. Schools have worked together on matters of mutual interest, including the digital inclusion strategy. The funding has also been used to develop joint procedures and policies across a number of schools in a l ocal authority area. Some schools have taken school to school working further by forming formal federat ions under one governing body. From 2022 -23, funding has been earmarked from the Teacher Development and Support BEL to take forward 32 our Programme for Go vernment commitment to examining how a greater degree of federation can support education leadership across Wales. 2.10.3 The funding has also been used to fund joint posts . For example , Conwy used its allocation to appoint three Higher Level Business Support Of ficers across 21 of its primary schools in three clusters focussing on higher level administrative functions. One local authority used its funding to employ a community link worker one day a week to increase the community use of school buildings. This has led to the establishment of community Welsh classes, running a community library open to the public and a community playgroup. A number of schools have used the funding to improve technology for use both by pupils and the wider community. 2.11 Estyn Details of Estyn's budget allocation for 202 2-23 from the Finance and Local Government MEG, including what recent discussions have been held with the inspectorate on its required levels of funding and how thi s compares with previous years. 2.11.1 The total budget allocation for Estyn within the Estyn BEL of the Finance and Local Government MEG stands at \u00a311.473m per annum from 2022 -23, consisting of fiscal resource (\u00a311.023m), non fiscal resource (\u00a30.2m) and capital (\u00a30.25 m). 2.11.2 In this Budget we are providing additional funding to Estyn, via the EWL MEG, to reflect their core funding requirements in order to forward the key priority areas of work to support the education system and reforms. This includes an extra \u00a31.6m in 2022 -23, with further indicative increases of \u00a31.3m in 2023 -24 and \u00a31.1m in 2024 -25. This additional funding will enable Estyn to ensure that they can meet their statutory requirements for inspection , by undertaking all inspections within the current cycle that hav e been suspended due to the pandemic; to trial more frequent inspection activity; and to engage with schools to support curriculum reform as set out in 'A Learning Inspectorate' (their strategy to support wider education reforms). 2.11.3 The revenue funding will also support additional activities relating to: Initial Teacher Training; Youth Work; Careers; and Employability and work requested by Welsh Government to meet policy changes relating to induction of newly qualified teachers; and joint inspection of chil d protection arrangements. 2.12 Qualifications Details of the budget allocation to Qualifications Wales in 202 2-23, including what recent discussions have been held with the regulator on its required levels of funding and how this compares with previous years. 2.12.1 Qualifications Wales' resource budget is being maintained at \u00a39.867m per annum from 2022 -23 (\u00a39.617m revenue and \u00a30.25m non -cash) . In addition, a 33 capital budget of \u00a3 0.25m per annum is being provided for the first time. Qualifications Wales will also have access to a further \u00a3 0.15m if required , from the Curriculum Reform budget, to support their role in reforming the underpinning qualifications during 2022 -23. An update on any additional funding Qualifications Wales is receiving to support its work on qualifications reform in the context of the new Curriculum for Wales and its programme of sector reviews of vocational qualifications. 2.12.2 The additional funding Qualifications Wales anticipated it needed to deliver its Qualified for the Future programme of work was detailed within the RIA of the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales ) Act. However, the pandemic has meant that both plans for developing the future suite of qualifications and wider Qualifications Wales activity have had to be revisited and re -prioritised. Informed by discussions with Qualifications Wales and supported by their refined operational delivery plan for the remaining work -streams of the Qualified for the Future programme , it is now expected that delivery of this work during 2022 -23 will be achieved without additional funding requirement (above and beyond their core \u00a39.867m allocation and the accessible \u00a3 0.15m available from the Curriculum for Wales overall budget allocation in support of that programme for 2022 -23). The programme of sector reviews, as set out in their strategic plan and operational plan is fact ored into core funding requirement. Information on any financial implications for Qualifications Wales, or any Welsh Government budgets, from the impact of the pandemic on the awarding of qualifications . 2.12.3 Whilst Qualifications Wales has worked alongside stakeholders to deliver alternative assessment arrangements for qualifications in 2020 and 2021, in response to the pandemic, this has been instead of the delivery of the normal exam series, meaning associated activity was delivered within existing budgets . In 2021 additional funding was provided to WJEC to enable a 50% reduction in entry fees (\u00a31.6m) for schools and colleges, to support the delivery or arrangements for private candidates and to schools and colleges to help in their planning and delivery of centre determined grades including professional learning and the appeals process (\u00a38.5m). In 2022, an exam series with adaptations to reflect disruption to teaching and learning is planned and therefore no additional funding is expected for either Qualifi cations Wales or WJEC. However, reflecting continued disruption to learning and learner anxiety about the prospect of potentially taking exams for the first time additional funding is being provided to WJEC to support provision of teaching/ learning and re vision resources and to regions and schools/ colleges to support the provision for additional learning for learners in qualifications years (\u00a37.5m). At this point in time exam series are planned for 2022 -23 and could be funded as part of Qualifications Wal es core budget. 34 2.13 Welsh -medium education Details of budget provision to support the Welsh Government's Welsh -medium education strategy and local authorities' Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs) , as well as the education sector's contribution to meeting the Cymraeg 2050 target of one million Welsh Speakers 2.13.1 The new Cymraeg 2050 Work Programme for 2021 -26, published in July 20 21, sets out our plan for the next five years of this Senedd term, to help achieve the two overarching targets set out in Cymraeg 2050 , to reach a million Welsh speakers by 2050 and double the daily use of Welsh by 2050. There are a number of budgets within the Welsh in Education BEL, and other BELs across the MEG, which contribute to our work of reaching those targets within the education sector. 2.13.2 Late immersion provision is essential as we work towards creating a million Welsh speakers . Our Programme for Government commitment reflects our ambitions in this area, and in this Budget we are allocating an additional \u00a32.2m to further expand provision from 2022 -23 onwards. We will work with local authorities to ensure that children across Wale s benefit from this unique and essential service. This builds on the \u00a32.2m allocated this financial year (from the Covid -19 Reserve) to respond to the increased demand for provision due to the pandemic. 2.13.3 We will maintain our funding of \u00a33.031m per annum for Mudiad Meithrin to continue to expand and strengthen early years capacity to provide a path into Welsh -medium education. Through their work, 43 new groups were established over the first 3 years of the programme up to 2021 with a target of establishing a further 60 groups set for the subsequent 5 years. With 90% of children who attend a Cylch Meithrin progressing to a Welsh -medium primary school, this work will contribute greatly to the aims of Cymraeg 2050 . 2.13.4 The e -sgol blended learning programme is cont inuing to develop and has been going from strength to strength since the pilot was introduced in 2018. To date, 40 GSCE, AS and 'A' level e -sgol courses have been offered across 40 schools to nearly 450 pupils. In this Budget, through the reallocation of f unding within the MEG, w e will also provide an additional \u00a30.35m from 2022 -23 to support e- sgol. Taken together with existing funding, it provides total funding of \u00a30.6m per annum from 2022 -23 to further develop the programme and provide opportunities for schools and pupils to access this flexible and valuable teaching model . 2.13.5 In this Budget, and as part of the Co -operation Agreement we are providing additional funding to support the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol . Further d etail is provided at section 2.2 . 2.13.6 We will continue to allocate \u00a30.190m funding to Cwlwm during 2022 -23. Cwlwm works to raise awareness / understanding of the importance of the role of childcare and play in realising Cymraeg 2050 's vision across all 'Cwlwm' 35 outputs. It works to mainstream Welsh -medium provision and bilingual provision across the whole sector. 2.13.7 We will continue to allocate funding of \u00a30.1m to support work on the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs). New WESP regulations came into force on 1 December 2020 setting out ne w arrangements for the preparation and implementation of WESPs . Our efforts in 2022 -23 will concentrate on supporting local authorities in their preparation and implementation of new 10 year Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (WESPs). This will include: Advice and guidance around communication and promotion of Welsh - medium education (including a package of digital resources for LAs to use). Procurement of Welsh language and education consultants to advise LAs on aspects of WESP implementation, such as prog ression from Welsh -medium primary and work around school categorisation . Support to implement the new WESPs. 2.13.8 Local authorities will continue to use funding from a number of other sources to implement their WESPs including activities supported and delivere d through the Welsh -medium Capital programme and the RCSIG . 2.13.9 This draft Budget outlines an investment of \u00a345m over the next three years (\u00a315m per annum) to provide continued support for our Welsh -medium capital programme. This funding builds on the first round of funding announced in 2018 which has supported 46 projects across 20 local authorities, leading to 2,818 additional Welsh -medium childcare and education places. A further \u00a330m was announced in March 2021 to support capital projects dedicated to growing the use of the Welsh language in education according to local WESP needs. The Expressions of Interest window closed on 22 October , and bids are currently being assessed . The funding required to support outstanding comm itments against the first round of investment will continue to be managed as part of the wider 21st Century Schools and Colleges programme. Information on any funding allocated to support the realisation of the single continuum for the teaching and learni ng of Welsh, for example increasing the capacity of the Welsh -speaking education workforce in both English and Welsh - medium schools . 2.13.10 In the Curriculum for Wales, Welsh forms part of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of learning and Experience. The statutory guidance for this area reflects the needs of different contexts but provides a common path for all learners starting with little or no language an d working towards proficiency. This is designed to help schools ensure that all learners are supported to make continuous progress in Welsh from age 3 -16, whatever their starting point and learning context. Funding for curriculum reform is supporting schoo ls to work collaboratively with others on curriculum and assessment design and development, freeing up time and space to design and plan approaches to curriculum, and supporting engagement with the national network for curriculum implementation. 36 2.13.11 Welsh Gov ernment is currently working with practitioners and other experts to develop a Framework for Welsh to support teachers in English medium schools and will consult on the draft framework, as well as professional learning and supporting materials needed along side it, in Spring 2022. 2.13.12 Funding for increasing the capacity of the Welsh -speaking education workforce is supported through funding within the Teacher Development and Support BEL. In this Budget, a dditional funding has been allocated and will be invested over the next three years to implement the forthcoming 10 -year plan for the Welsh in education workforce. A total of \u00a31.845m will be allocated in 2022 -23 (an increase of \u00a31m) with further increases of \u00a30.5m in 2023 -24 and \u00a32m in 2024 -25. This funding will be prioritised to support the aims of the plan, and is likely to include funding for the following amongst other developments that are still under consideration: expansion of the primary -secondary Welsh -medium conversion programme to provide support for t eachers to transfer from teaching in the primary sector to teach in secondary. work with Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol and other stakeholders to increase the number of learner choosing to study Welsh at A Level in order to increase the future number of Welsh teachers. 2.13.13 We continue to provide incentives for student teachers from Wales undertaking Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and have maintained the Iaith Athrawon Yfory incentive of \u00a35,000 for each student who is preparing to teach secondary subjects through the medium of Welsh . 2.13.14 Professional learning is a key feature of our approach to strengthening Welsh - medium teaching capacity and improving the skills of teachers to teach Welsh as part of the new curriculum. We continue to support practitioners to develop their Welsh language skills in accordance with the Professional Standards for Teaching and Leadership through the sabbatical scheme and support delivered by the regional consortia and in conjunction with other stakeholders. We hope to maintain the same le vel of funding in 2022 -23 to support Welsh - language and Welsh -medium professional learning, which totals approximately \u00a36.4m. 2.14 Early Years / Foundation Phase An update on the work being undertaken to review the relationship between funding rates for chil dcare for three and four year olds (under the Childcare offer) and early years education (the Foundation Phase) for three and four year olds. 2.14.1 In 2019 the Welsh Government undertook a pilot project, in partnership with Flintshire County Council, to test the impact of a consistent funding rate for early education and childcare within t he Childcare Offer for Wales. Arad Research was commissioned to undertake an evaluation of the pilot to assess the impact of a consistent funding rate, which was presented to the Welsh Government in December 2019. There was a pause in this work due to the pandemic. Welsh 37 Government subsequently accepted the recommendations of the independent evaluation. 2.14.2 From January 2021 it was agreed that additional funds should be made available to local authorities to enable them to increase funding to non - maintained settings which deliver early education to help align with the current Welsh Government funding rate for childcare (\u00a34.50) within the Childcare Offer. To ensure an equitable approach across Wales we applied a standard formula to the funding. In 2021 -22 funding of \u00a33.8m ( split equally from the Health and So cial Services MEG and EWL MEG) was provided in grants to local authorities to contribute to the harmonisation of funding r ates in non - maintained settings . Our intention is that this support will continue to be provided from 2022 -23. An updated assessment of the financial position of the funded non -maintained nursery sector as it relates to the Education and Welsh Language MEG and the Minister for Education and Welsh Language's portfolio, including in the context of delivering the new curriculum. 2.14.3 We are committed to ensuring that the many young children who have their first experience of education in a childcare setting s hould continue to receive high quality educational provision and that provision continues to be strengthened. The Welsh Government undertook to develop a curriculum for non -maintained settings under the Curriculum and Assessment Act (Wales) 2021. Working w ith the sector, including local authorities, national umbrella organisations and settings, we started co -constructing that curriculum last year and consulted on it in summer 2021. 2.14.4 The results of the consultation were positive and further refinement of the draft curriculum was undertaken in the early autumn 2021 . We will be publishing the final curriculum for funded non -maintained settings in January 2022. Following the same co -construction model, we will be developing assessment arrangements for non -maintained settings in 2022. 2.14.5 We have been working with the sector to understand their support needs in the run up to the implementation of the new curriculum in September 2022. We have developed a range of resources with the early years sector to support practice and are considering what additional training will be requ ired - early in 2022, but also later in the year. 2.14.6 We provided a range of additional support for early learning, recognising the potential impact of the pandemic on the development of our youngest learners. This included \u00a33m funding for non -maintained se ttings via the RRRS grant in 2020-21 and a further \u00a31.9m in 2021-22 to support emotional, physical and learning development needs. The non -maintained sector also benefitted from the additional \u00a313m provided in 2021-22 through the EIG which supports ratios in schools and support for the non -maintained sector. 2.14.7 While the structure and terminology of the new arrangements for nursery settings will be consistent with Curriculum for Wales to ensure a continuum of 38 learning, the key pedagogical principles of the Foundation Phase will remain. We do not anticipate a significant impact on the non -maintained sector in implementing the new curriculum. 2.14.8 We will continue to work with the sector - including local authorities and the national childcare umbrella organisati ons which will receive around \u00a3 0.24m in funding in 2022 -23 to support early education in non -maintained settings - to ensure we clearly understand any likely impact and ensure appropriate support can be put in place for the sector. 2.15 Youth work Details of the budget provision to support youth service provision including in the context of the Interim Youth Work Board. 2.15.1 In this Budget, we are increasing funding within the Youth Engagement and Employment BEL by \u00a32m in 2022 -23, rising to \u00a34.9m by 2024 -25, supporting our Programme for Government commitment to drive forward and implement the recommendations of the Interim Youth Work Board (IYWB) . The recommendations are included in the Board's final report 'Time to Deliver for Young People in Wales' , which was published on 16 September 2021. This will have a positive impact on youth work in Wales and on the lives of the young people accessing youth work services. In January we will start the recruitment of a new Youth Work Strateg y Implementation Board, which will inform the development of a work plan and future funding allocations. 2.15.2 Taken together with transfers within the MEG to support the Hay Festival, t his will increase funding for the Youth Engagement and Employment BEL to \u00a39.5m in 2022 -23, rising to \u00a312.4 m by 2024 -25. In line with previous years, a further transfer of \u00a33.7m to support Youth Homelessness is expect ed from the Climate Change MEG as part of a future Budget. 2.15.3 The Youth and Engagement budget will continue to fund a number of youth support grants to support statutory and voluntary youth services in Wales . This will includ e funding to local authorities through the Youth Support Grant, the voluntary sector through the Strategic Voluntary Youth Work Organisation Grant, CWVYS an umbrella body supporting voluntary sector organisations and Education Training Standards (ETS) Cymru , who support the education and qualification of the sector. The funding will play a pivotal role in securing the implementation of the Yout h Work Strategy for Wales. The vital preventative services, which are delivered by both local authorities and the voluntary sector, are increasingly reliant on the development of innovative partnership approaches. 2.15.4 This budget contributes heavily towards s upport for some of our most vulnerable young people, including those with emerging emotional, mental health or wellbeing issues, and those at risk of youth homelessness. This targeted work builds on the successful Youth Engagement and Progression Framework , improving the ability of local authorities and their partners to identify and broker interventions for those most in need at the earliest 39 opportunity. Our investment is intended to encourage greater collaboration and new ways of working. This budget incl udes the continuation of \u00a32.5m targeted funding to support young people with emotional wellbeing or mental health needs through non -clinical approaches and community based youth work support. 2.15.5 The budget will also support continued engagement with young p eople through the Young People's Committee and the youth work sector through its Strategy Participation Groups (SPG). The SPGs have developed workplans to deliver the aims of the Youth Work Strategy for Wales (2019) and these are reviewed as the work prog resses. 2.16 Offender Learning Details of provision in 202 2-23 and how this compares to previous years . 2.16.1 The table below summarises 2022-23 provision for offender learning and a comparison to previous years. Prisons 2022 -23 \u00a3000 2021 Total 7,328 6,628 6,628 2.16.2 The Welsh Government funds the education and learning provision and prison libraries in Welsh public sector prisons through a joint Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS). HMPPS are responsible for commissioning all education and learning delivery in Welsh public sector prisons to achieve sustainable employment prospects. The public sector prisons in Wales are HMP Cardiff, Swansea, Usk, Prescoed and HMP Berwyn. With the e xception of HMP Berwyn, learning and skills is delivered by in -house staff employed by the Ministry of Justice. For HMP Berwyn, HMPPS has contracted out the learning and skills provision to Novus Cambria. HMP Parc is a private prison and all services are operated through G4S. 2.16.3 The current arrangements enable the Welsh Government to improve further the quality and relevance of offender learning in the context of Welsh Government priorities. They support a number of commitments within the Programme for Government with a key focus on providing some of the most disadvantaged people in Wales the support they need in order to access jobs. Through better education and providing skills for life, this will serve to break the cycle of disadvantage and inequality that many experience with in this cohort over the longer term. 2.16.4 The \u00a33.328 m to cover the costs of learning and skills provision in the South Wales Prisons, is allocated as follows: 40 South Wales Public Sector Prisons (HMP Usk / Prescoed, Cardiff and Swansea) - \u00a33,074,288 ; and South Wales Privately run Prisons (HMP YOI Parc) - \u00a3253,712. 2.16.5 The allocation to the North Wales Public Sector Prison (HMP Berwyn) covers the Welsh Ministers contribution towards Novus Cambria's contract costs for delivering the learning and skills provision at HMP Berwyn , with HMPPS making up any shortfall. For previous years , this has been actioned through an in year transfer as part of the supplementary budget process . This arrangement is in place to accommodate the increasing numbers of learners in the pri son as a result of other prisons in England closing. From 2022 -23 however , the \u00a34m has been reflected as a baseline adjustment to the Offender Learning BEL in this draft budget , following the recurrent transfer of funding to the Welsh Government by the Ministry of Justice . 2.17 Further education, Sixth Forms and Adult Community Learning Details of the complete 2021 /22 allocations to further education colleges, to include the amounts of all components of the allocation (i.e. full -time, part -time, part-time allowance, deprivation, sparsity and welsh medium allowances, maintenance allowance and the Adult Learning Wales adjustment). 2.17.1 This information has been provided at Annex F. Details of changes to the further education funding model (if any) from the model provided to the Committee in the previous Government's paper dated 08 Jan 2020 (and updated by the paper from the then Minister for Education for the CYPE Committee meeting o f 21 Jan 2020), and the reason for any changes. 2.17.2 When calculating FE funding the same model employed in 2021/22 will be used . 2.17.3 There will be one small, planned, change to the method of deriving predicted learners by including a 3 year average (last year a 2 year average was applied). This is due to Welsh Government holding the relevant data for the last 3 years and the change brings the FE funding methodology fully in line with the school sixth form funding methodology, which has used a 3 year average f or several years now. Details of any hypothecated funding to further education institutions or Sixth Forms beyond their usual core grants. 2.17.4 At the time of writing, details of any further hypothecated grants for 2022 -23 are not available. Details of any funding provided in the 202 2-23 budget for achieving pay parity and/or to meet any pay award to further education institutions and Sixth Forms, including an explanation as to the sufficiency of the funding to meet in full any agreed pay award / pay equival ency over the period of this budget. 41 2.17.5 At this stage negotiation of the 2021/22 pay award is still ongoing between the FE sector and unions. Whilst an additional 3.8% was included in the unit rate of funding for the 2021/22 allocations to allow for possib le pay increases, it is not possible to identify whether this unit rate increase sufficiently covers the cost of the pay award as it has yet to be agreed. 2.17.6 The same percentage increase to the unit rate was applied to school sixth forms. Despite the final teacher's pay offer of 1.75% being well within that increase, additional funding was found in 2021 -22 to cover the costs of 0.75% of that increase for the period September 2021 to March 2022. Details of the complete 202 2-23 Sixth Form allocation broke n down by each local authority. 2.17.7 At the time of writing, details of the 2022 -23 Sixth form allocations are not available. A copy of the most recent Further Education Financial Forecast Planning Assumptions guidance issued to FEIs. 2.17.8 The latest financial forecast assumptions guidance is attached at Annex G . The allocation for Adult Community Learning broken down by the relevant bodies that directly receive the funding. 2.17.9 At the time of writing, details of the 2022 -23 Adult Community Learning allocations are not available. The complete 2021 -22 and 2022 -23 programme values used in the calculation of FE and Sixth Form funding 2.17.10 Programme Values for 2021 -22 are at Annex H . At the time of writing 2022/23 programme values are not available . 2.18 Higher education , and post -16 student financial support Details of the HEFCW allocation, including details of any hypothecated funding, or funding which is intended for specific activities including mental health and student well -being. 2.18.1 Draft Budget includes a re source allocation for HEFCW of \u00a3203.513m in 2022 - 23, which represents a small increase of \u00a30.1m over the initial 2021 -22 figure, due to the consolidation of the non -cash depreciation budget into the main resource BEL. Within this amount Degree Apprenticeship funding of \u00a35m; \u00a32m mental health funding; and \u00a34m for postgraduate bursaries have been earmarked. 2.18.2 Whilst a reduction of \u00a33.5m in the resource allocation for HEFCW is included in 2023 -24 and 2023 -24, given the significant additional investments we have 42 made in higher education in the last two ye ars, in particular to help the sector deal with the impacts of the pandemic, we do not anticipate this reduction will have a major impact. Regarding the Diamond reforms: set out the expected level of student financial support saving for 202 2-23 compared to 202 1-22 and the proportion of this sum that will be reinvested back into the higher education sector as part of the \"Diamond Dividend\". 2.18.3 In FY 2021 -22, \u00a325m was identified and wholly reinvested into the higher education sector, implementing the recommendations of the Review of Student Support and Higher Education Funding in Wales ('the Diamond Review'), as agreed by Cabinet. This included a dditional funding for expensive subjects (part time and full time), expansion and maintenance of part time, increases in QR and increase in provision of knowledge transfer, (an integral part of the Welsh Government response to the Reid review) and increase d collaboration between HE, FE and Schools. 2.18.4 Following the implementation of the final phase of 'the Diamond Review', the latest student support models suggest the cost of Welsh student support will increase in 2022 -23, 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 from 2021 -22, to ensure improved maintenance support arrangements for all full -time and part -time undergraduate students, with the highest level of grant support covering the full cost of maintenance for those who are most in need. This package, including on postgradua te support, is unique in the UK and will encourage students from all backgrounds to enter higher education. 2.18.5 Student Support Grants are demand led, which by definition mean that they are difficult to predict, manage or forecast. Our current 2022 -23 budget was produced using the Higher Education Division's student support models (incorporating the most up to date information on a number of variables, including student numbers, inflation rates and other economic data), however as with this financial year (20 21-22), actual results can vary from predicted, and costs will continue to be managed during the year within the EWL MEG. 2.18.6 The increase in student supp ort forecasts experienced in 2021 -22 and likely in future years, could be attributed to the economic unc ertainty caused by the Covid -19 pandemic and the potential increase in the number of students expected to attend university in 2021/ 22. 2.18.7 It must also be highlighted that due to the demand led nature of student support, it is possible there may be further fluctuations in these forecasts, when more up to date actual student drawdown figures become available. 2.18.8 In addition, following the implementation of the recommendations of the final phase of the Review of Student Support and Higher Education Funding in Wales ('the Diamond Review'), a commitment was made to ensure improved maintenance support arrangements for all full -time and part -time undergraduate students, with the highest level of grant support covering the full cost of maintenance for those who are most in need. As a result of this, 43 forecasts for both Full Time and Part Time Maintenance Grants are expec ted to continue to rise in 2022 -23, 2023 -24 and 2024 -25. Details of any 202 2-23 allocation intended for the delivery of degree apprenticeships and if it is intended to be used to recruit new apprentices or to just teach out existing apprentices. 2.18.9 \u00a35m is included in the HEFCW baseline to support Degree level Apprenticeships. It is an ticipated that further funding will be transf erred in year from the Economy MEG (as part of the supplementary budget process) to support the cost of new and continuing Degree Apprenticeships in 202 2-23, although the cost s are not confirmed at this stage. Details of any capital funding to be made available to HEFCW, including any restrictions to be placed on it by Welsh Government. 2.18.10 Please see the table at 1.1.6. Details of any contingencies/reserves/non -allocated funds within any of the 2022 -23 tertiary education related BELs, including the BELs within the post -16 Learner Support Action; details of how the funds are/can be deployed; and details of any deployment of them during 2021 -22 2.18.11 There are no such contingencies. Grants : A table showing the 2020 -21 outturn, and forecast expenditure over the following four years (broken down by students studying in Wales and elsewhere in the UK) for: Full-time undergraduate (FTUG) Tuition Fee Finance grant element; Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA); Welsh Government Learning Grant (Further Education) (WGLG(FE)); and Targeted grants and allowances. 2.18.12 This information has been provided for in Annex I. Loans provision: A table showing the 20 20-21 outturn, and forecast loan outlay over the following for years (broken down by students studying in Wales and elsewhere in the UK) for: FTUG tuition fee and maintenance loan outlay and Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) charge; PTUG tuition fee and maintenance loan outlay and RAB charge; Masters Finance loan element outlay and RAB charge; and Doctoral loan outlay and RAB charge. 2.18.13 This information has been provided at Annex I. 44 2.19 Apprenticeships What discussions has the Minister for Education and Welsh Language had with the Minister for Economy to liaise and work together on funding skills provision and coordinate apprenticeship delivery? 2.19.1 Whilst we have not recently met, we are both committed to a co -ordinated apprenticeship and skills offer. We will continue to focus on strengthening delivery on growth sectors, as such those in the green economy, and encouraging more employers to recruit young people through our apprenticeship programme. 2.20 Other post -16 education provision Details of Personal Learning Account funding 2.20.1 We are also providing an additional \u00a31m up to 2024 -25 in Personal Learning Accounts which provide support across Wales for employed people on below average salaries to gain higher level skills to help them to access a wider range of job opportunities and/or gain employment at a higher level. As our first gender budgeting pilot Personal Learning Accounts meet e volving regional skills needs and continue to address skills gaps with funding specifically targeting labour shortages and skills gaps in priority sectors such as health and social care, logistics, green construction and renewable energy. 2.20.2 The Personal Lea rning Accounts, a \u00a318m programme for 2022 -23, provides support across Wales for employed people to gain higher level skills which will enable these individuals to access a wider range of job opportunities and/or gain employment at a higher level. It specif ically enables people on below average salaries to achieve higher earnings on a sustainable basis. It uniquely offers flexibility around how and when people learn by helping colleges deliver courses around individuals work and family commitments. 2.20.3 The programme is also responsive to employers' upskilling requirements, in recognition of the ongoing challenges posed by Covid -19 and the challenges and opportunities arising from the UK's decision to leave the European Union. 2.20.4 The courses and qualific ations are fully funded by the Welsh Government. All courses and qualifications delivered through the PLA programme are endorsed by Regional Skills Partnerships to ensure the provision meets evolving regional skills needs and addresses skills gaps. 2.20.5 This flexible approach to learning enables colleges to work differently to offer courses and qualifications to address the economic skills requirements for employed people regardless of their previous level of qualification achievement. 45 2.20.6 In partnership with R SPs PLAs will meet the evolving regional skills needs and continue to address skills gaps. In 2021 -22, additional funding is being specifically targeted at addressing labour shortages and skills gaps in priority sectors such as reengaging and retraining st aff to return to work in health and social care, training more HGV lorry drivers and reskilling individuals to respond to exciting new job opportunities in green construction and renewable energy. 2.20.7 An external evaluation has commenced, which will inform f urther policy or eligibility changes for the 2022/23 academic year to help the Programme reach more diverse groups of learners while maintaining its core aims and objectives. 2.20.8 Individual Eligibility: Live in Wales Want to gain skills/qualifications in pri ority sectors 19 years old or over 2.20.9 In addition, individuals must meet at least one of the following criteria: Employed people (including self -employed) earning under the median income (\u00a329,534), or Workers on zero hours contracts, or Agency staff, or At risk of being made redundant, or Have been negatively financially impacted by COVID -19 (e.g. projected income is likely to fall below median wage) Details of the Welsh in Education budget including any allocation for the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol. 2.20.10 In 2021 -22 the the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol stands at \u00a36.953m. This includes funding of \u00a35.4m for the Coleg's higher education programme and \u00a30.330m for its Welsh -medium scholarship scheme. In higher education, \u00a33.558m directly supports W elsh-medium provision across universities and subject areas. Essential support is provided through Coleg branches to lecturers, staff development and publications. In post -16, a total of \u00a31.223m is allocated to support the Further Education and Apprentices hip Welsh -medium Action Plan with a strategic development fund of \u00a30.95 supporting FE colleges and training providers to build teaching capacity that includes the additional \u00a30.81 allocated to the expansion in 2021 -22. 2.20.11 Within the core funding, the Coleg provides training and mentoring through Sgiliaith, to enable tutors and assessors to gain confidence in teaching bilingually and support for the apprenticeship sector. Additional grant funding from other areas is provided for resource development, apprenti ceship support, the ambassador project and support for developing Welsh and Welsh -medium teachers. 46 2.20.12 The Programme for Government and our Co -operation Agreement with Plaid Cymru includes a commitment to invest in Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol to increase the p roportion of Welsh -medium apprenticeships and further education and the National Centre for Learning Welsh to provide free Welsh language learning for 16 to 25 -year-olds. 2.20.13 As a result, in this Budget, we are increasing funding by an extra \u00a38m by 2024 - 25 (\u00a31.5m for the Coleg in 2022 -23, with further increases to support the Coleg and National Centre of \u00a33m in 2023 -24 and \u00a34m in 2024 -25). The Coleg already has a close working relationship with the National Centre for Learning Wels h and further collaboration will strengthen the support to the Welsh language post -16 sector. Details of any EU funding expected to be utilised by Welsh Government during 2022 -23 to secure tertiary education provision (i.e. within HE, FE, ACL, 6th Forms , and excluding apprenticeships) 2.20.14 There is no expectation of any EU funding being utilised by Welsh Government during 2022 -23 to secure any tertiary education provision other than for apprenticeships. 2.21 Capital funding for school and college infrastructure Information on budget provision for 21st Century Schools and Colleges programme and progress of the programme to date, including expenditure and numbers of projects completed/approved to date, broken down by: a summary of expenditure and number of proje cts undertaken / completed within Band A; and the latest position regarding Band B of the programme. 2.21.1 The table at paragraph 1.1.6 confirms that the draft budget 2022 -23 invests a further \u00a3900m of capital funding over the next three years (\u00a3300m per annum) to support our 21st Century Schools Programme ( Sustainable Communities for Learning Programme from 1 January 2022) . Taken together with other capital funding, this represents an annual capital increase to the EWL MEG of 31.7% for 2022 -23 and 33.6% for -24 and 2024 -25, when compared to our 2021 -22 baseline . This three -year allocation underpins the Programme's strategic approach towards investment in schools and colleges, providing a sound footing for delivery against our Programme for Government and Co - operati on Agreement commitments. 2.21.2 In addition, our revenue funded investment stream Mu tual Investment Model (MIM), MIM will target \u00a3500m of i nvestment through the Programme. The first projects are due for completion in September 2023. 2.21.3 Band A is drawing to a close having invested \u00a31.61bn in the infrastructure of schools and colleges within Wales, with the Welsh Government investing \u00a3801m. This investment has delivered 172 projects against a target of 150. Of 47 these projects 166 have been completed, with the remainder currently under construction. More than 100,000 learners have benefitted under Band A . 2.21.4 Band B is well under way having officially commenced in April 2019. To date, investment of \u00a3607m has been approved across 71 projects, wi th the Welsh Government contributing \u00a3417m. Of the 71 approved projects 25 are under construction and 12 are in the preconstruction stage. I am pleased to report 15 projects have also been completed. Any implications from the pandemic for the 21st Century Schools programme, including any impact on the progress and costs of projects. 2.21.5 The impact from the COVID -19 pandemic has presented a number of unique challenges for Local Authorities and Further Education Institutions as well as the construction sector and its supply chains. However the Programme Team worked with Local Authority and Further Education Institution teams in seeking opportunities, whilst schools and colleges operated on -line, to fast -track delivery of projects whilst buil dings were vacant. This resulted in the completion of a number of projects earlier than originally programmed. For example, the new \u00a330m Whitmore High School in the Vale of Glamorgan was delivered 12 weeks early. This allowed staff and learners to move into the new school in May instead of September, minimising the disruption associated with both construction and the pandemic. 2.21.6 Whilst excellent delivery progress has been maintained under the 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme the pandemic and Brexit are having an impact on construction costs. The availability of construction materials and labour has seen costs increase by around 15%. Under the Programme's co -construct approach, we have been working closely with Local Authorities and Further E ducation Institutions in managing cost increases jointly. In supporting these costs, an additional \u00a330m was secured from the COVID -19 resilience fund during the last financial year to support additional costs . The cost implications from the Welsh Government's commitment to reduce the carbon footprint o f school construction projects 2.21.7 From January 2022 all projects delivered under the 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme that had not already been approved at Outline Business Case stage w ill be required to be delivered as net zero carbon in operation, and also to have targets for reducing the embodied carbon associated with construction; about 20% improvement against current good design standards. 2.21.8 As witnessed when the BREEAM environmental st andards were mandated, an initial increase in costs is being seen. As the sector adapts to the change in standards, and advancements in material manufacture and construction processes adapt, it is reasonable to expect the current 12.5% net zero carbon premium to reduce over time. In the interim, and in order to demonstrate commitment towards addressing climate change, this additional cost will be 48 met through the Welsh Government's contribution to project costs for all remaining projects under the current wave of investment. 2.21.9 It is important for the Welsh Government to demonstrate our commitment towards the international challenge that climate change presents for our future generations. Delivering this commitment through the school and college buildings ou r learners are learning in will help contextualise the challenge and highlight some of the measures our young learners can take back to their own homes and communities. 2.21.10 The increased funding reflected in this t hree-year capital budget will help support the additional costs in delivering the Programme's net zero carbon schools and colleges commitment . 2.22 Capital funding for childcare An update on capital funding from the Education and Welsh Language MEG for the Childcare Offer and any information as to how this has been / will be impacted as a result of the review of entitlement to the offer. 2.22.1 The Draft budget for 2022 -23 commits \u00a370m of capital funding over the next three years to support the continuat ion of the Flying Start and Childcare Offer programmes. The budget allocations across the three year term are reflected in the table at paragraph 1.1.6. 2.22.2 For 2022 -23 we will use the \u00a320m to fund existing commitments and, wherever possible, to fund COVID -19 related financial pressures within the construction sector. Our records show that more than a 100 childcare capital projects will be under construction during this financial year, with the majority profiled for completion the same year. Alongside this pro posal for childcare, we will maintain our Flying Start estate by funding essential maintenance work. Review of entitlement to the offer 2.22.3 Capital investment is essential to support our Programme for Government's commitments related to our Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) vision as follows: Deliver a phased expansion of early years provision to include all two -year- olds with a par ticular emphasis on strengthening Welsh -medium provision Continue to support our flagship Flying Start programmes Fund childcare for more families where parents are in education and training 2.22.4 We will work closely with our key partners to consider the impact on capital as proposals against the priorities above are developed over the next 3 years, aiming to address the gaps in childcare provision and, in particular, Welsh - medium childcare as child care for two -year olds is expanded. Additionally , the findings of the Childcare Sufficiency Assessments, due next year, will provide valuable information regarding the need for additional childcare spaces, areas 49 of greatest demand, including Welsh medium c hildcare provision. We propose to adapt our capital application process by taking the above into consideration and learning from previous years, to ensure that there is sufficient childcare in the right areas, with a specific focus on developing new provis ion in areas that currently lack childcare services, in particular in rural and disadvantaged areas. 2.22.5 The Childcare Offer, 21st Century Schools, Flying Start and Welsh -medium capital grants are delivered collaboratively to ensure a joined up approach to the management of our capital programmes. This additional funding will assist us to continue co -locatin g early education provision with the Childcare Offer and Flying Start childcare provision on a single site, wherever possible, supporting a joined up appro ach to working with children and their families. 2.23 Capital funding for the Community Focused Schools initiative Information on budget provision for the Community Hubs and Community Learning Centres grant and an update on progress in increasing the community focused nature of education estates. 2.23.1 Launched in 2019, t he \u00a315m Community Hubs Pilot Programme is progressin g well. To date, 11 of the 21 one approved proj ects have been completed with 4 under construction and 6 at preconstruction stage. Schools and their communities are already realising the benefits from the Pilot, some examples include: Brynteg Comprehens ive School - East Hub project has seen the re -location of the East Bridgend multi -service hub directly into Brynteg School, allowing hub staff in areas like safeguarding and counselling to work more closely with the school along with other local schools; e ncouraging a culture of co - production; and Currently under construction, the Queensferry Community Learning Campus in Flintshire which will see a new community learning and multi - agency hub built alongside a school and PRU / adult day care centre to meet the need for learning and sports opportunities. The hub will provide number of facilities for adult and vulnerable young people learning opportunities and intervention services, early years and childcare provision, community use and community sports cl ub facilities all at a single location. 2.23.2 In moving this commitment forward, Education officials are working with officials within Health and Social Services in the joint delivery of P rogramme for Government commitments for the co -location of services. 2.23.3 The benefits of joined -up policy delivery through the 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme are already clear, having been evidenced through the successful delivery of the Welsh Language, Flying Start and Childcare capital investment programmes. We wan t to build on this by exploring all opportunities and resources available to maximise the wellbeing outcomes for our learners and their communities. 50 2.23.4 The learning, good practice and benefits to learners, their families and wider communiti es through the work will be translated into revised Design and Costs Standards under the 21st Century Schools and Colleges Programme business case process. The outcome of this will ensure delivery of Community Schools becomes the ' standard' and we expect to see efficien cies emerg ing as we mainstream Community Schools through the established 21st Century Schools and Colleges investment Programme. In the interim, we will continue to work closely with stakeholders in the delivery of this commitment within the three - year ca pital budget settlement.

They are on an advisory basis and if any college feels that they are not appropriate to their own circumstances alternative assumptions can be used provided they are disclosed within the forecast . 3. These assumptions should be read in conjunction with any publications from Welsh Government giving specific advice on oth er funding streams. Welsh Government grant funding Institutions should use the final allocations for the 2021/22 academic years that have been notified. Assume allocations reflect changes to demographic for FT and no change for PT (please see note 1 and 2 above) Pay Assume a 1% pay award for each year (please note: Note 1 and 2 above) . Pensions Pensions forecasts should be based upon the latest available information for the relevant schemes. European funding European funding should be based on an individual institution assessment of the projects they have ongoing applying due consideration to the impact of Brexit. Capital All planned and approved capital projects should be included. Maintenance funding Assume \u00a310m for capital and equipment for 20 21/22 with no assumption for 2022/23.

Pension liabilities Institutions should assume no movement in the pension liability unless specific further information is known from actuarial reports, which should be disclosed. Targets Institutions should take account of learning targets that have been set and associated clawback if targets a re not met. Sensitivity analysis Due to the lack of information at the current time over the Welsh future budgets we are recommending sensitivity analysis of 2.5% and 5% in recurrent funding, including any Work Based Learning income.

Economy Main Expenditure Group (MEG) 1. Introduction This paper prov ides information on the Economy budget proposals as outlined in the 2022 -23 Draft Budg et published on 20 December 2021 . It also provides an update on specific areas of interest to the Committee. The Arts and Sport activity is being scrutinised by the Culture, Communications, Welsh Language, Sport and I nternational Relations Committee on 19 January 2022. This paper considers the Economic Development and Employability and Skills draft budget plans. 2. Strategic Context / Covid Impacts The Economic Resilience and Reconstruction Mission (Mission) , published in February 2021, established the fundamental recovery principle s and direction for the economic policy of the previous administration. It was developed in consultation with Welsh stakeholders and, at that time, the Ministerial Advisory Group for Economy. It was built on the foundations of Prosperity for All: Economic Action Plan , whic h set the course for inclusive growth and remains the framework for how public investment is directed. The Programme for Government 2021 - 2026 includes a commitment to p rogress that Mission. As part of that progression process, in October I held an Economic summit and subsequently gave an Oral Statement on Moving the Welsh Economy Forward . We know there is a long -term demographic challenge facing the Welsh economy. The proportion of the population aged 16 to 64 years old in Wales has been decreas ing year-on-year since mid -2008 - mid 2019 - and could be just 58% of the population by 2043. We want to create the conditions where more people, particularly the disadvantaged and young people, feel confident about planning their futures in Wales. In parti cular, it is my hope that by taking bold action, we will create a future where more young people feel that they do not need to get out to get on. At the same time, if more people also positively choose to come to work in Wales, we can address the risks t hat come with the decline in our working age population. Overall, this means implementing a progressive economic policy that focusses on better jobs, narrowing the skills divide and tackling poverty so that we create genuine fairness in how the economy gro ws. However, whilst economic prospects have improved, supply chain and staffing issues and rising inflati on are hampering the recovery along with new uncertainty around the Omicron variant. In paraphrasing the words of the Office of Budget Responsibility - Brexit will double (reduce UK GDP by 4%) the long running scarring effect that the pandemic (reduce UK GDP by 2%) will have on the economy. 2 The UK level of GDP for the first quarterly estimate of Q3 2021 was 2.1% below where it was before the coronav irus pandemic in October to December 2019. We will get a better picture for Wales when the OBR publishes its Welsh Taxes Outlook alongside the Welsh Government Draft Budget on 20 December. Whilst the unemployment rate in Wales at 3.7% continues to fall an d it remains lower than the UK rate of 4.2%, a key part of moving the economy forward will be our upcoming Employability Strategy which will be published in spring 2022 . It will set out actions to accelerate progress on achieving the new labour market Mile stones; tackle structural inequalities; focus on progression pathways for young peop le in the labour market; increase levels of qualification and progress our Fair work ambitions. The new context demands a fresh approach to how we work and who we support going forward, to maximise the impact of the resources we deploy, and mobilise national interventions to better meet the needs of those groups less represented in the labour market. 3.

In addition the capital pl ans are supported with an additional funding of \u00a360m to protect arts and culture and deliver the cultural strategy: a priority in the Co -operation Agreement. This will also support wider priorities for economic development.

To not e, there is a decrease in budget of \u00a33m when compared to the Final Budget for a reduced requirement for Careers Wales. The budget is regularly reviewed and future adjustments made in supplementary budgets. 4. EU funding - implications We are fully aware of the issues being faced by businesses as a result of the UK leaving the EU which, among other things, ha s resulted in additional costs, delays, staff shortages, access to certain goods, as well as grappling with increased paperwork and border checks associated with moving goods in and out of the EU. We have been working closely with our business representat ive organisations to understand these issues as well as providing support through our B usiness Development Managers . This budget includes investment in Business Wales and the Export Action Plan, demonstrating the practical steps we are taking to support W elsh exporters, our network of dedicated International Trade Advisers will continue to provide one -to-one advice to companies. Our Regi onal Economic Frameworks (REFs) will be published shortly. They have been co-developed and co -designed with stakeholde rs in the regions. The Corporate Joint Committees which will be established in 2022 will ensure decision -making and 5 prioritisation happens in the local areas and regions and will enable them to develop their own distinctive strengths and opportunities and play a much greater role in allocating funding and managing portfolios of distinct regional projects. We will continue to work with our partners to seek opportunities for further investment in the regions of Wales. 5. Wellbeing of Future Gener ations Act 2 015 and Preventative spending In this unprecedented context we continue to be guided by the five ways of working in the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 to improve how we make decisions. We recognise the need to collaborate with our partn ers and to use our collective resources effectively to plan for the tough choices ahead. The Act forms the blueprint for a Wales that is economically, socially and environmentally sound. This government's ambition is for new national milestones to drive c ollaborative, shared action and act as a key measure of the pace and scale of change needed in a number of key areas. Budget proposals reflect my continuing commitment to protect and prioritise investment that supports preventative measures as far as poss ible. The spending decisions have not only considered how best to meet the current demand for services but have also focused on supporting interventions. This preventative approach is an important part of our planning , both now and in the future. We are doing all we can to support our path to recovery, ensuring the stronger Wales which emerges from the pandemic continues to value equality at its heart. Over the next three years we will continue to protect, rebuild and develop our public services, deliver for vulnerable people and communities across our country, invest in our rich heritage and culture and invest in a stronger, greener economy. That is why this year, we have prepared the b udget around priority areas where our resources can have the most imp act. 6. Equality, Sustainability, Welsh Language and Demographic Considerations We have over recent years taken an integrated approach to impact assessments , as well as taking into account the impact of decisions and policies on social, economic, cultural and environmental well -being, as set out within the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act , which continues to be an important driver guiding our Budget considerations. The Draft Budget, published on 20 December 2021, sets out the impacts of our spending d ecisions , including highlighting spending decisions that directly imp act on our stakeholders . This is complemented by the Strategic Integrated Impact Assessment (SIIA), outlining the contextual evidence that has sup ported our spending decisions . The SIIA also includes more -detailed case studies on the impacts of specific spending decisions, including our key PfG commitment on the new Young Persons Guarantee programme . The three -nation NOS Governance Group ensures that activity relating to the deve lopment and review of NOS with employers and stakeholders aims to be inclusive, representative and reflect the diversity of the four UK -nations. An audit of the end -to-6 end NOS system has been commissioned to identify current good practice and areas for imp rovement within the NOS system relating to equality and diversity. The policy relating to National Occupational Standards (NOS) requires that consultation on the development and review of NOS should take place with a representative sample of employers fro m across the whole of the UK and all sectors in Wales and include an assessment of demand for Welsh translation. Where need is identified, Welsh Government NOS funding supports the translation of NOS into Welsh and their quality assurance, to ensure accur acy and consistency in terminology. Accurate translation is important as Welsh NOS frequently inform the content of Welsh -medium vocational qualifications and training programmes. In formulating our plans, the following key demographics trends from the m ost recent report, produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), on national population projections (2018 -based) have been considered which suggest that: The po pulation of Wales is projected to increase by 2.7% from 2018 to 3.22 million by 2028, and by 3.7% to 3.26 million by 2043. The number of children aged under 16 is projected to decrease by 4.7% to 536,300 between 2018 and 2028. The number of people aged 16 -64 is projected to increase by 0.2% to 1,927,700 between 2018 and 2028. The number of people aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 16.3% to 758,600 between 2018 and 2028. The number of people aged 75 and over is projected to increase by 29.3% to 378,100 between 2018 and 2028 *The ONS will be publishing updated national population projections for Wales (2020 - based) on 12 January 2022. Population projections are trend -based projections that provide estimates of the size of the future population, and a re based on assumptions about births, deaths and migration. The assumptions are generally based on past trends. These projections , therefore, do not make allowances for the effects of central or local government policies or changing economic circumstances on future population levels, distribution, and change. According to the latest Relative Income Poverty statistics for th e 3 year period up to March 2020 . Between 2017 -18 and 20 19-20, 23% of all people in Wales were living in relative income poverty. The percentage of people living in relative income poverty has been relatively stable in Wales for over 15 years. In Wales, 31% of children were living in relative income poverty in 2017 to 2020. This figure has increased from 28% reported last year and is a 2 percentage point increase based on the unrounded data. Between 2017 and 2020, 22% of working -age adults in Wales were living in relative income poverty. The percentage of pensio ners in relative income poverty fell by 1 percentage point for the second consecutive period following a gradual rise since around 2013. 18% of pensioners in Wales were living in relative income poverty between 2017 and 2020. People in social rented housi ng were more likely to be in relative income poverty (at 48%) than those in private rented (41%) or owner occupied housing (13%). 73% of children living in a workless household were in relative income poverty compared to 25% living in a working household i n 2017 to 2020. 7 Lone parent households were the family type most likely to be in relative income poverty (at 46%). 30% of people in single female households with no children lived in relative income poverty. In the past, most people living in relative inco me poverty were living in households with children. However, the pattern is now less clear with a similar proportion of those living in relative income poverty living in households with children and without children. For the period 2015 -16 to 2019 -20 (an a verage of 5 financial years) there was a 29% likelihood of people whose head of household comes from a non -white ethnic group living in relative income poverty. This compares to a 24% likelihood for those whose head of household comes from a white ethnic g roup In the latest period (201 7-18 to 2019 -20): 38% of children who lived in a family where there was someone with a disability were in relative income poverty compared with 26% of those in famil ies where no -one was disabled. F or working -age adults, 31% who lived in a family where there was someone with a disability , were in relative income poverty compared with 18% of those in families where no -one was disabled . 7. Impact on Deprivation and Poverty At the Economic S ummit in October 2021 I outline d our amb itions for moving our economy forward as we strive for a stronger, fairer and greener Wales. The Summit was joined by the Confederation of British Industry, the Wales Trades Union Congress, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Welsh Local Government Association and started a conversation about how we can work together for a team Wales recovery that is built by us all. Supporting stronger local economies will be essential to the job of tackling poverty. We are looking to attract more people to live and work in Wales, which can address the risks that come with the decline in the proportion of the population of working age.

The revenue budget of \u00a320.064m over three years ensures that Welsh Ministers meet their legal and statutory obligations as landlords and land owners in managing the Economic development property portfolio, including the management of St Athan and the unitary payments under the Lloyd George Avenue PFI scheme. The budget is supplemented by other income, primarily rental receipts and profits from disposing of land and buildings. The capital budget of \u00a330m ov er the next three years is supplemented by c\u00a310m p.a. receipts from land and property sales. This enables delivery of modern sites and buildings that are capable of meeting companies' timescales for occupation to provide Wales with a real competitive advan tage over other locations. All direct build commercial projects undertaken will aim to achieve a Net Zero carbon in use standard and the Welsh Government's Sustainable Buildings Policy will apply to projects delivered in partnership with others. City Deal s The city and growth deals in Wales are long -term (15 -20 year s), three -way investment agreements between the Welsh Government, the UK Government and (jointly) the local authorities in each of the four regions to deliver lasting regional economic growth. Three deals are underway in Wales - in the Cardiff Capital Region, Swansea Bay City Region and North Wales. The Final Deal Agreement for Mid Wales is due to be signed in the New Year. The Draft Budget includes provision for the Cardiff Capital Region o nly - for \u00a322m in 2022 - 23. The Welsh Government is considering options for reprofiling its contribution to the funding for the Swansea Bay and North Wales deals following the UK Government's announcement that it would accelerate its contribution to these deals to provide the funding over ten years rather than 15. Budget plans for the Swansea Bay and North Wales deals, and in due course for the Mid Wales deal, will be clarified once the options have been considered. Each government contributes funding t o the Welsh deals on an annual basis. It is for the relevant local authorities, working together as a region, to decide how to use the funding over the lifetime of their deal - together with investment from their own budgets, from other public bodies and from the private sector - to deliver the outcomes set out in the deal agreements and the approved business cases. Corporate Budgets The Healthy Working Wales budget of \u00a3 1.957m over three years delivers workplace initiatives supporting the healthy and acti ve ambitions set out in the programme for Government.

This budget also contributes to Welsh Government's Office for Science promotion and engagement activitie s including stakeholder engagement seminars, public attitude Science surveys, British Science Week, Science in the Senedd, WJEC Innovation and CREST Awards, LSW Medals, commissioned science performance reviews and promotion of diversity & gender equality in R & I and STEM. The c apital budget of \u00a315m continues the internationally recognised S\u00ear Cymru programme that helps maximise the beneficial impacts of research expertise, specialist innovation facilities and supply of talented researchers. This progr amme (highlighted in Nov 2021 by Welsh Government as one of the five 5 R,D& I priorities) has already helped build a depth of researchers and science infrastructure in Wales which did not exist previously and contributed to improving Wales science and rese arch performance over the past decade. Further information is available in sections 10.17. Tourism Tourism development and marketing investment of \u00a333.486m is aligned to the recovery plan Let's Shape the Future to support the sector emerge from the pandemic.

Programme Support The annual budget of \u00a31.7m delivers the Wales European Funding Office Technical Assistance EU funded operations. 9. SKILLS BUDGETS The three year resource investment of \u00a3 664.531m is summari sed in the following table: TABLE 7 - SKILLS & EMPLOYABILITY RESOURCE BUDGETS Business Area 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3'000 Change \u00a3'000 2022 -23 Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change Young Person's Guarantee) - consolidates Marketing 14,400 100,336 277,208 Employability (including Young Person's Guarantee) 1,400 - 1,400 - 1,400 - 1,400 4,200 Communities for Work 9,972 (6,000) 3,972 5,000 8,972 (5,000) 3,972 16,916 Communities for Work - Non cash 36 - 36 - 36 - 36 108 Total Resource 195,877 17,500 213,377 5,000 218,377 14,400 232,777 664,531 Budget Changes There is an increase in 2022 -23 when compared to the 2021 -22 Final budget due to the streamline of BEL's within the skills activity: Merger of the Careers Wales BEL, Marketing BEL and Skills Poli cy BEL into the new Employability (including YPG) BEL - This is offset by the additional allocation of \u00a320m for Young Persons Guarantee and \u00a320m for Apprenticeships and a baseline adjustment of \u00a316.5m out of the Apprenticeship BEL due to a one off allocati on from the Welsh Covid reserve last financial year. In 2023 -24 there is a further allocation of \u00a35m for Young Persons Guarantee and \u00a35m for Apprenticeships. This is offset by \u00a310m reprioritisation of budget to support the loss of EU income for Business Wales and Communities for Work. In 2024 -25 there is a further allocation of \u00a35m for Young Person Guarantee and \u00a35m for Apprenticeships. Apprenticeship s The revenue budget of \u00a3366.099m over three years s upports the delivery of the apprenticeship programme to employers and their employees, with a particular priority for new recruits, throughout Wales. Further de tail is provided in section 10.19 . 13 Employability (including Young Person 's Guarantee) The Employability (including YPG) revenue budget of \u00a3277m over three years funds the development and delivery of strategies, policies and programmes which assist people to access, return to, remain in, and progress at work through skills and training support ; underpinning a number of key PfG commitments . It als o facilitates a direct response to assist the growth of individual businesses through workforce development and provides sector -based, employer -led and wider solutions to respond to identified skills needs in Welsh Government priority areas which are impor tant for the economy of Wales. Skills and employability support can further these aims by focussing investment and interventions on those who are under -represented in the labour market and who face disadvantage and inequity in accessing skills, qualific ations and employment. This will help eradicate the gap between the employment rate in Wales and the UK by 2050, with a focus on Fair work and raising labour market participation of under -represented groups . The BEL also funds Careers Wales which delivers a national, all age, impartial and bilingual careers information, advice and guidance (CIAG) serv ice in Wales . In addition to the revenue budget, there is a non cash depreciation budget of \u00a31.4m . Communities for Work Programme The revenue budget of \u00a316m over th ree years supports the Parents, Ch ildcare and Employment (PaCE) and Communities for Work programme. PACE is a \u00a321.5m project jointly funded by the European Social Fund and Welsh Government, working in partnership with Department for Work and Pensio ns (DWP). PaCE targets economically inactive parents aged 25 and over, and parents aged 16 -24 who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). This is also the cohort covered by the Youth Guarantee. All parents enrolled onto PaCE have childcare a s their main barrier preventing them accessing education, employment or training opportunities. Almost 95% of parents that join the PaCE programme are women. To the end of November 2021, PaCE has supported 6,643 people (including 398 disabled people and 20 2 people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Communities) and helped 2,939 people into work, of which 124 were disabled people and 81 people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Communities). Communities for Work is a \u00a3102m programme jointly funded by the European Social Fund and Welsh Government working in partnership with the Department for Work and Pensions, Local Authorities and Voluntary Organisations. It supports economically inactive and long -term unemployed people, focusing on two separate group s - those aged 25 and over; and those 16 -24 year olds who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET ). This is funded from Communities for Work BEL and there is a \u00a33.972m budget for 2022 -23. CfW provides a community based person -centred approach , offering holistic support to tackle a range of complex barriers that participants face. Up to the end of October 2021, the programme has supported 33,373 people (including 3,735 disabled people and 2,144 people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Comm unities), and helped 13,872 people into work, (1,053 disabled people and 1,010 people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Communities). This BEL has a baseline reduction of \u00a36m compared to final budget due to funding received last financial year from th e Covid reserve. The budget has seen an increase of \u00a35m in 2023-24 to support against the loss of EU income, but the baseline is restored to 14 funding levels in 2022-23 for the last financial year, but will be a priority for any additional funding that becom es available , but will be a priority for any additional funding that becomes available.

Strategic environmental de velopment and sustainability will be built into the new spatial strategy with a focus on the national and regional growth areas through adopting the 'Town centre first' approach. 10. ECONOMY - KEY POLIC Y UPDATES Additional information has been provided in response to the specific areas highlighted by the Committee as follows: 10.1 Business Support - Recovery from the pandemic Since April 2020, the Welsh Government has provided more than \u00a32.6bn to support Welsh businesses, mostly via the Economic Resilience Fund, in a package that has been designed to complement and build on the support provided by the UK Government. The budget plan does not include any additional recovery funding. In the 2021 -22 the Welsh Government made available a \u00a335m package to help SME s in Wales relaunch, develop, decarbonise and grow to help drive Wales' economic recovery. The funding will support more than 1,000 business, help to create 2,000 new jobs and safeguard a further 4,000 jobs with grants of up to \u00a350k available. This funding will continue to support businesses into 2022 -23. The funding provides an opportunity to kick -start and grow the economy as we focus on creating a fairer, greener and prosperous future for Wales and will be specifically targeted at businesses with projec t proposals to: Focus on decarbonisation and the climate emergency that will help Wales meet its legally binding net zero carbon emission target by 2050 Progress the ambitions in the Mission (including fair work, skills, industry / services of the future, apprenticeships and collaboration with universities and business to maintain graduate talent in Wales) Help businesses to work co -operatively to support local supply chains, including local delivery and logistics services In addition the fund seeks to pro vide support to the Covid response in terms of well - ventilated work spaces and the ability to work smartly 15 Business Wales also support businesses through and recover from the pandemic by the delivery of information, guidance and direct support to entrepre neurs and businesses in Wales to help them start, grow and prosper and respond to key challenges such as the pandemic. In addition, t he Welsh Government Business Innovation Team are positioned to support businesses and entrepreneurs on a one -to-one and a o ne-to-many basis for all aspects of developing new products, processes & services. The Development Bank of Wales is well placed to help Welsh businesses through, and to recover from, the pandemic and access finance they need to start up, strengthen and gro w. It can provide loans from \u00a31k right up to \u00a310m, as well as mezzanine, and equity funding; and helps businesses find the right finance partner to leverage in private finance with its own gap finance when necessary. Economy Futures Fund Launched in May 2018 the Economy Futures Fund is the simplification and rationalisation of a number of existing financial support schemes. As a pre -requisite for funding, applicants must have demonstrated contribution to the prin ciples of the Economic Contract . Busines s seeking funding from the Economy Futures Fund will be expected to contribute to at least one of the five Calls to Action , this is based on the principle of \"something for something\" and supports those businesses that wish to adapt to grow. The schemes t hat currently make up the Fund are: Capital Investment and aid for Job Creation Research Development and Innovation ( Including SMART Cymru) Environmental Protection scheme Tourism Investment Support Scheme/Wales Tourism Investment Fund Creative Productio n Funding Repayable Fund for SMEs Since its launch in May 2018, 452 offers with a value of over \u00a3107m have been accepted. 10.2 Regional Economic Development The Economic Action Plan (EAP) outlines the basis for a regional approach to economic development a cross Wales, recognising the distinctive opportunities of particular regions and seeking to build upon them to deliver enhanced prosperity for all, whilst addressing the barriers that prevent this. Since the appointment of the Chief Regional Officers and their teams we have sought to foster closer and more effective collaboration with our regional partners and stakeholders. This is bearing real dividend and through collaborative effort with our key partners across the regions we are delivering tangible di fferences to businesses and communities across all regions of Wales. As the voice of government in the region and the voice of the region in Government, the Chief Regional Officers and their teams are influencing and informing national policy and programm es, as well as delivering targeted support in the various regions through the regional capital stimulus funds and support for key business across the regions. The development of REFs is an essential part of our commitment to a more regionally focussed mod el of economic development - developing the distinctive strengths of our regions, supporting inclusive and sustainable economic growth and maximising 16 opportunities to address regional and local inequalities, contr ibuting to the well -being g oals for Wales. REFs are intended as a vehicle to help promote collaborative regional planning and delivery amongst public, private and third sector partners, working to a shared vision and a set of common economic development objectives. In taking forward the developmen t of the REFs we have been acutely aware of the immediate reset and recovery required in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, but also the need to set out the longer term aspirations for the regions, aligned to the Mission. The REFs will be published shor tly. Since the publication of the OECD's report, The Future of Regional Development and Public Investment in Wales , in September 2020, Welsh Government officials have been working with the OECD to develop a project to support the implementation of some recommendations from the report. The new two -year project began in September 2021 and its scope includes: vision -setting, planning, cross -sector coordination and integration for regional development policy and public investment practices and mechanisms for realising regional development policy and public investment objectives In 2020 -21 \u00a30.1m will be paid to the OECD and a final payment will be due in 2023 -24. Overall the economic development initiatives are budgeted with in the Business and Regional Ec onomic Development revenue budget. 10.3 Regional Development - Impact of UK Government Schemes In terms of the Levelling Up Fund and Shared Prosperity t here is concern that the funding allocated to ind ustrial decarbonisation schemes, such as the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund (IETF), Cluster Sequencing and the Hydrogen Fund , is not adequate in scope or scale to enable decarbonisation projects across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the short to medium term. Whilst Welsh based businesses have su ccessfully applied for support via IETF there has been limited opportunity for success within other funding streams. Welsh Government is in active discussion regarding appropriate business models to enable the decarbonisation of Welsh industry. The South Wales Industrial Cluster members are investing over \u00a324 m which has in turn leveraged over \u00a326m of UK Government funding to Wales since 2019 , including \u00a321 million of Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge funding to deliver a Phase 2 Route Map plus a variet y of deployment projects across S outh Wales. Additionally, over \u00a32m of Industrial Decarbonisation Research & Innovation funding has been allocated to Welsh universities dedicated to activity within industrial clusters. The HyNet p roject, which covers bot h north -west England and north east Wales has been shortlisted to receive Track 1 funding via the Cluster Sequencing programme. It remains to be seen at this stage whether any Welsh based activity will be funded via this process. 10.4 Foundational Economy Pla ns The additional funding allocated to the Foundational Economy in 2021 -22 supported specific project activity which built on the Foundational Economy Delivery Plan, published in March 2021. In addition, the funding supported the initial launch of the Ba cking Local Firms Fund 17 (BLFF), focused on food, social care and future skills associated with the Optimised Retrofit Programme. There is a furthe r allocation of \u00a33m in the 2022 -23 draft budget. A strategic review of current activity has been undertaken an d key stakeholders engaged to identify long term priorities . The allocation will support scaling up the BLFF to enable Welsh businesses to access support which will help them grow. Within the B LFF, we will provide grant based assistance to assist businesse s to develop capability to engage in delivering the Optimised Retrofit Programme to help optimise the value of this investment for communities and economies across Wales. The B LFF will continue to enable indigenous food producers and suppliers to attain th e necessary food safety accreditations required for involvement in public sector food supply chains and we will identify how the funding can support producers with growth potential for accelerating into the larger retail and hospitality markets. The care s ector is a significant part of the Foundational Economy and funding will help businesses in the sector to respond to the ongoing recruitment crisis and help introduce new care provider capacity. The way the public sector undertakes procurement has a profo und impact on the Foundational Economy. Experience from work to date illustrates that there is huge ambition across the public sector to better engage with businesses but lack of capacity hinders progress. Funding will enable add itional capacity to help pu blic bodies to collaborate and utilise procurement to deliver place -based priorities linked to local wellbeing plans. As part of our cross -government working, Foundat ional Economy is supporting the business decarbonisation programme and potential funding requirements for this work is in the process of being established. In order to support spreading and scaling of best practice and to provide places where people and organisations can collaborate, we will support Communities of Practice for the Foundational Economy and consider how these will best operate taking account of national, regional and thematic considerations. 10.5 The Development Bank of Wales (DBW) The 2022 -23 budget does not currently include any further capital provision for the D BW as allocation s in previous years have positioned the development bank to continue making investments in 2022 -23 and beyond in line with the Remit Letter issued to the DBW by the Minister for Economy in November 2021. It should be noted that the reclassification of DB W by the Office of National Statistics , for the purpose of national accounts , is resulting in some changes to how expenditure and, therefore the budgets for DBW are presented and reported. The reclassification outcome determined by the Office of National S tatistics was confirmed on 31st August 2021 and applies retrospectively to 2017 when the DBW was established. For those parts of the DBW group reclassified to the central government sector, work is now underway to restate budgets in line with standard HM Treasury procedure. This is expected to have a neutral effect on WG budgets with no impact on the investment plans already in place for DBW. This exercise is due to complete by end of 2021 -22 and, to the extent it will impact on 2022 -23 budgets, will be reflected in the first supplementary budget of 2022 -23. In addition to the equity mechanism that the Wales Management Succession Fund provides for management buy -outs, DBW also has other funds (the Wales Flexible Investment Fund and Wales Business Fund) w hich can provide loans to employees more widely in order to facilitate wor ker buy outs (employee owned bu sinesses). 18 These debt based funds enable DBW to more directly contribute to the PfG objective of providing greater support for worker buy -outs. More information is available at the DBW website: Performance and impact | Development Bank of Wales 10.6 Business Wales The draft budget plans include \u00a366.138m over three years f or Business Wales activity. In 2021 -22 the budget levers in \u00a315.7 m ERDF funding with a further \u00a311.4 m in 2022 -23. In 2023 -24 budget of \u00a39.443m has been reprioritised to replenish the EU funding with a managed reduction in 2024 -25. This will enable the serv ice to engage with over 60k businesses, deal with over 30 ,000 direct enquires, provide information to over 12,000 entrepreneurs and businesses, direct support to 3,000 businesses and entrepreneurs to create start -ups and jobs. The funding will also enable the Business Wales digital platform to handle 10 million calls entrepreneurs and businesses across Wales. Business Wales provides businesses and entrepreneurs with a single point of contact for business information, advice and support from the public, pr ivate and voluntary sectors, and can be accessed digitally via http://businesswales.gov.wales and social media channels; the helpline; and offers a combination of online, telephone, 1 -2-many and 1 -2-1 business support which is tailored according to client need and the different regions of Wales, dependant on local requirements. The Business Wales service is positioned to: - Raise entrepreneurial aspiration and activity in Wales leading to an increase in self - employment and the business birth rate. - Improve the competitiveness, survivability and productivity of micro businesses and SMEs in Wales resulting in sustainable growth and good quality jobs. - Ensure that support is easily visible, si mple to use and well connected with the private sector and other policy instruments. It is a fully bi -lingual, flexible service that can be adjusted to accommodate regional considerations as well as the specific needs of individuals and businesses. Comp lementing the helpline and digital offer, the main Business Wales advisory service provides direct business support to pre -start, start and growth businesses through one -to- one relationship management and workshop activities. The service currently operates virtually but also works with a range of partners to deliver services to SMEs in locations across Wales. Examples of Business Wales cross cutting delivery Direct engagement activity through entrepreneur role models - Big Ideas Wales who deliver talks t o inspire young people 25 . This is complemented by financial support to colleges and universities to develop their entrepreneurial capacity . A universally ava ilable digital support platform, including Business Online Support service, the Sell2Wales procur ement and Brexit portal s. The platform also hosts 19 organisations such as t he Development Bank of Wales, Careers Wales, the Ambition Board to deliver a one stop shop approach. An Accelerated Growth offer which is targeted specifically at businesses that demonstrate the potential for rapid growth in terms of exports and high quality job s. Social Business Wales which supports growth orientated social enterprises. The five regional Enterprise Hubs provide enhanced regional visibility and facilitate a more con nected approach to providing entrepreneurship and business support. The Disabled People's Employment Advisory service is delivered alongside the Welsh Government's Disabled People's Employment Champions and has specialist advisors to encourage employment and retention of disabled workers to ensure a more equal, representative workforce in Wales. The Business Wales service deliver on the following impacts: TABLE 9 - BUSINESS WALES IMPACTS Measures Outcomes Net GVA up -lift \u00a317 per \u00a31 spent on Accelerate d Growth Programme \u00a310 per \u00a31 spent on BW core delivery Start -up survivability 85% over 4 years for those who have accessed BW support 41% for non -supported start -ups Social impact 20% of jobs created are filled by previously unemployed individuals 10.7 Employee Owned Businesses The Employee Ownership Association estimates that the employee owned sector accounts for around 3% of UK GDP and the number of employee owned businesses grows by 10% year -on-year. There are currently 2 -3 employee buy -out deals comp leted in Wales each year but the potential exists for many more. Business Wales and Social Business Wales offer specialist advice to support employee buy outs. In addition to the support available through Business Wales, t he Welsh Government provides fun ding to t he Social Business Wales service to promote and offer direct support and develop Employee Ownership in Wales, which will be further p romoted via social media channels. In 2022 -23 funding of \u00a30.9m is earmarked in the Business Wales budget. The Wal es Flexible Investment Fund operated by DBW offers a potential debt -based funding route for employee buyouts. Management buy -outs can be supported through the Wales Management Succession Fund \u00a325m provides ambitious managers and management teams with the f unding they need to buy established Welsh SMEs when their current owners retire or sell up. 10.8 The Community Bank/support for Banc Cambria The PfG commitment to support for the creation of a Community Bank for Wales, seeks to address the market failure in r elation to the gap in provision, effectiveness and access to quality banking services in Wales. 20 Our vision for the Community Bank for Wales, is one that is based on the mutual model, owned by, and run for, the benefit of its members, rather than the maxi misation of profit for shareholders. It will be a modern full service community bank, headquartered in Wales. It will provide access to bilingual products and services, through a range of channels including digital, online and in -branch. The Bank will faci litate local investment and enhance community wealth building, recirculating savings into loans and preventing capital drain. It will provide a positive impact on communities and high streets, improving access to everyday banking services for all citizens regardless of income or wealth, as well as, small businesses across the whole of Wales. Start -up co -operative and mutual banks face challenges particularly in respect of securing development and regulatory capital which make entry and organic growth diffi cult. In addition, banking sector legislative and regulatory competencies are reserved matters. We are therefore reliant on the alignment and ambition of private sector firms who share our vision and ethos in order to establish and operate a Community Bank for Wales. The Minister for the Economy made an Oral Statement on 14 December 2021 providing an update on the progress of Banc Cambria, welcoming the announcement by the Monmouthshire Building Society stating its intent to develop its approach to deliver ing a community bank in Wales. The Minister for Economy is responsible for the Community Bank during its development phase, supported by revenue funding of \u00a30.150m in 2022 -23 for ongoing policy development and research via procurement of external expertis e / reports in areas such as economic impact assessment, financial due diligence and legal advice. The Minister for Social Justice is leading on the capital investment to establish the Community Bank. 10.9 Support for key manufacturing sectors such as aerospac e, automotive and steel Automotive The o ngoing uncertainty throughout the Brexit negotiation process, leaving the Single Market, wider disruption from C OVID -19 and more latterly, the global semi -conductor shortage have all created significant short -term pressures for the industry. The automotive industry in Wales comprises of around 150 companies employing around 11,000 people in highly productive, highly skilled and highly paid jobs. With 2 niche vehicle manufacturers, 35 tier one systems and component manufacturers, the majority of these supply chain companies are SMEs. The Welsh Automotive Forum has indicated that together with the closure of Honda's Swindon plant, have significantly contributed to the loss of some 4,400 jobs in the sector in Wales s ince 2019. The latest available figures from the SMMT for UK pr oduction in 2021 show that 721, 505 cars were manufactured up to October 2021, 2.9% down on the same period in 2020. Despite confidence earlier in the year, as a result of the semi -conductor sh ortage, analysts now expect car production in the UK in 2021, to be lower than last year. In addition, the industry is at the forefront of a significant technological change through the move away from the internal combustion engine. Transition to low car bon automotive sector could however bring with it significant potential benefits not only to the environment but also to the economy. Up to November 2021, battery electric, plug in and mild hybrid vehicles accounted for over a quarter of new car registrati ons in the UK . Welsh Government will continue to support WAF in its work to migrate the sector to new electrified supply chain opportunities and to promote the sector during this transition. 21 Welsh Government also continues to engage strongly with the UK G overnment to ensure Wales has access to its relevant funds , including those handled by the Advanced Propulsion Centre and the driving the electric revolution fund to ensure opportunities are not missed. To date , Wales has received over 18% of the driving e lectric revolution UK wide funding. One such beneficiary has been Meritor, Cwmbran , awarded \u00a331.9m by the Advanced Propulsion Centre for a collaborative project to design and develop a game changing electric powertrain system for heavy -duty electric trucks and buses. In this context Welsh G overnment will continue to provide a platform to the Welsh automotive industry. The recent response to companies' physical presence at the low carbon vehicle show this year's indicates strong demand for Welsh expertise. Aerospace The UK Aerospace & Defence (A&D) industry employs some 250,000 people with an annual turnover of \u00a360bn . Wales, with 5% of the overall UK population employed more than 20,000 people in the sector prior to COVID , with a turnover in the order of \u00a36bn, according to the Aerospace Wales Forum (AWF ). The outbreak of COVID has had a huge detrimental impact on the Aviation / Aerospace sector, and together with tourism and hospitality, has been the hardest hit of all sectors. Much of the world's aviati on system ground to a halt in 2020 as countries closed their borders and imposed lockdowns. The 5 largest civil Aerospace sector employers in Wales reduced their workforce by over 3,000 staff due to COVID, although they are now beginning to reemploy and t ake on apprentices. This is during a period of transition, as the sector addresses climate change and looks at ways of meeting the net zero target for 2050, through technology, alternative forms of propulsion, operations and infrastructure. The Aviation and Aerospace sector growth projections are significant (4.5% p.a. ) and we must ensure that Wales remains a key part of the UK's capability and rebounds from this current crisis to provide many well paid, highly skilled jobs in an attractive, climate consc ious and growth sector. There are some encouraging signs including additional orders for Airbus A321 aircraft at the Dubai air show, additional recruitment by Airbus in Broughton and additional contracts from the MoD to Raytheon. Welsh G overnment will continue to support AWF in its work to promote the sector . We will also continue to promote the Welsh aerospace sector to potential funding bodies in UK G overnment and lobby hard for continued support for the sector , in particular for R&DI activity to assist in the transition. The recent investment by the UK 's Department for Transport in LanzaTech to develop a sustainable aerospace fuel in P ort Talbot is one such example of this. We have also supported AWF develop a maintenance repair and overhaul cluster to work collaboratively to win further overseas contracts. Space is a small but growing sector in the UK and in Wales. We have a number of world - class players including Airbus, Raytheon and Space Forge, who we will continue to support and promote. Key indu strial figures in Wales chair the Welsh Space Leadership Council which is in place to help coordinate activity and benefit from the UK wide space strategy whilst developing our own space strategy focusing on particular strengths. Ventilator Production at Airbus / AMRC Cymru , Broughton 22 Many companies in Wales provide d an overwhelming response to the pandemic, COVID outbreak, making significant contributions to supporting the production of vital equipment for the NHS, demonstrating their ingenuity, adaptabi lity and capability to react at pace. The highest profile example was at Airbus, Broughton. Over 550 employees were transferred to the Welsh Government -owned AMRC Cymru, manufacturing key components for t he Penlon ES02 -type ventilator. Almost 12,000 units were delivered to the NHS by late June 2020. The supply chain for the Penlon ESO2 included the Renishaw operation near Cardiff, demonstrating that much of the UK Ventilator Challenge was 'Made in Wales'. Steel As a result of the pandemic as well as t he ongoing semi -conductor shortage, the steel sector has experienced a drop in activity in relation to automotive sector orders. The UK construction market has remained strong in the UK. We continue to embed the UK Steel Charter principles to maximise bene fits. The Welsh Government was the first signatory to the UK Steel Charter, which complements our earlier Procurement Advice Note by encouraging projects in Wales to source and benefit from high quality British steel wherever possible. In addition to compl iance with Public Contract Regulations, we have implemented an additional mandatory legal position in our tender pre -qualification questionnaire that 'No Dumped Steel' is used on any contract awarded by public sector bodies in Wales. Decarbonisation is a key challenge. Welsh Government will be publishing a procurement policy note in respect of practical strategies to drive decarbonisation actions across the wider public sector which will sit alongside the Welsh Procurement Policy Note (WPPN) which mandate s the use of carbon reduction plans at the selection stage of the procurement of public contracts valued at \u00a35 m or more for Welsh Government. We are also working with the UK Government through the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund, the South Wales In dustrial Cluster (SWIC) and the North Wales Economic Ambition Board to consider regional industrial decarbonisation approaches. We wil l continue to work collectively with the industry, the workforce and the UK Government to support the transition to low -carbon steelmaking to help ensure a competitive and sustainable future for the steel sector in Wales and the UK. 10.10 Support for automation and AI The Digital Strategy Wales published in March 2021 includes the 6 pillars reflecting the 2019 Brown Review: o Developing Industrial Clusters - Develop our Welsh Industrial clusters to be equipped for a 21st Century digital society. Adopting, exploiting and creating digitally driven innovation for the benefi t of the broader economy . o Developing a Digital Ecosystem - Establish a thriving ecosystem of commercial and academic expertise that drives digital innovation in emerging technologies . o Digital Adoption for Businesses - Increase digital adoption and resilien ce of businesses, including the principles of green, sustainable and prosperous economy and accelerated adaption to the future of work and skills in Wales . o Cyber Security - Increase digital adoption and resilience of businesses, including the principles o f green, sustainable and prosperous economy and accelerated adaption to the future of work and skills in Wales . 23 o e-Procurement - Improve procurement practices and processes delivering better outcomes for all . o Shared Workspaces - Seek out and explore collabo rative opportunities for shared working spaces across public and private sector, to encourage collaboration and reduce travel . The Economic Action Plan also highlights Digitalisation as one of the Calls to Action, demonstrating progress in the digitalisati on of their products and processes enable businesses to access the Welsh Government financial support. Welsh Government is committed to creating the environment to allow tech and tech enabled businesses to thrive, providing the goods and services to suppo rt the digitalisation of businesses across the economy and in the supply chain to the digitalisation of public services in Wales. Creative Industries (including Digital Creative) Cyber Security, Fintech and Compound Semiconductor are amongst the priority sectors in Welsh Government's International Strategy. The strengths of these areas in Wales forming the basis for efforts to pursue new Foreign Direct and Inward Investment into Wales. Tech has also been identified as a priority cluster for Export and Trad e support, with focussed efforts to support Welsh Tech businesses explore and deliver to new international markets. The Manufacturing Action Plan (MAP) , launched in March 2021, contains a Digital work stream that seeks to support the adoption of digital te chnologies and practices amongst manufacturing companies in Wales. Welsh Government has created, partnered, fully or partially funded the following: The National Digital Exploitation Centre : a cyber -security centre of excellence, focusing on digital tra nsformation in Operational Technology. NDEC provides bespoke solutions to combat the threat of cyber -attacks on critical systems. The centre also includes the Digital Education Centre which focuses on schools, citizens and SMEs, delivering training and ed ucation to help promote digital awareness, skills and understanding . The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre : AMRC Cymru is part of the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and a member of the High Value Manufacturing (HVM) Cat apult . It helps the manufacturing community access advanced technologies to drive improvement in productivity, performance and quality. Airbus Endeavr Wales : a joint initiative between Airbus and the Welsh Government to support innovation in Wales. The programme supports research and development of technologies in the fields of the Digital Economy, the Low Carbon Economy and Advanced Engineering & Manufacturing. Work is ongoing to develop the following: Proposed Cyber Innovation Hub : A hub for industry, government and academic partners to grow the Welsh cybersecurity sector and plug the gaps in the current eco system around skills, innovation and enterprise creation. 24 Proposed Wales Data Nation Accelerator : a pan -Wales initiative that is being developed t o accelerate new insight, foresight and intelligence from diverse data assets for societal, health and economic impact. Data Science Graduate Programme : the programme is managed by the Welsh Contact Centre Forum and seeks to develop talent creation initiat ives in financial services and data science these skills they are designed and delivered in collaboration with a strong consortium Welsh based employers. 10.11 The allocations to deliver the Let's Shape the Future and the forthcoming Action Plan Visit Wales is responsible for delivering activity that supports the sustainable development of the visitor economy across Wales with business m arketing, activity to build Wales' reputation and performance as a place to visit, invest, work and study. It specifically add resses activity that assists in implementing : Push forward towards a million Welsh speakers, and enable our tourism, sports and arts industries to thrive by. putting the work, places the promotion of Welsh language and culture at its heart and our activit y acts as an important flag -carrier for the Cymru Wales brand and continues to play a key role in the recovery of the visitor economy by helping to address seasonality (encouraging visitors during off peak season), spend (encouraging people to spend more a nd stay longer), and spread (encouraging people to discover more of Wales). Visit Wales is recognised by public, private and third sector stakeholders in a leadership capacity, helping to set direction and engender commercial confidence. We want our sector to grow purposefully throughout the year, helping to stimulate prosperity in urban and rural areas. This is a sector severely impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic. Businesses have faced unprecedented and extreme challenges from the outset and despite ex tensive Welsh Government and UK financial interventions the downturn of the sector stands to have a serious impact - symbolic, social, cultural and economic - on many towns and villages that are also facing other post Covid -19 related challenges that will continue into 2022/23. However, this is also a sector with positive prospects in the medium to longer -term due to the nature and quality of the Welsh product offer and strength in the domestic UK market and any funding is not solely a means of supporting a challenged industry; but can also an investment in the long term prosperity of many parts of Wales. The activity proposals have been developed to complete delivery of the Recovery Plan and take us back to our Strategic Plan Welcome to Wales: Priorities for the Visitor Economy 2020 -2025 . The proposed activi ty also takes account of our commitment to leveraging th e successful Cymru Wales brand to promote Wales in the world, as highlighted in the International Strategy for Wales and the more single -minded wellbeing proposition that has now been devel oped and which brings the brand closer to the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. Our Cymru Wales brand and campaigns also position our language as central to our culture, and to project Wales as an outward facing, bilingual nation. In build ing an economy based on the principles of fair work, sustainability and the industries and services of the future the strategy will deliver skills/recruitment campaign s, business marketing and business support conditions. Tourism is vital in making our cit ies, towns and villages even better places in which to live and work by funding schemes and place mak ing activity that put community benefits alongside visitor benefits to \"grow tourism for the good of Wales\" . Visit Wales will continue to support innovato rs in the industry who come forward with high quality, reputation -changing products. Our primary product gap is high -quality 25 accommodation in many parts of Wales, so in line with our move to value over volume, we will work with current businesses to increa se their occupancy levels and yield. Our \u00a350 million Wales Tourism Investment Fund , delivered in partnership with the D BW, will continue to help finance capital investment in tourism projects that grow the sector and have a positive impact on the Welsh eco nomy. We will also take a more strategic and internationalist approach where we aim to provide additional funds and investment to support our sector, positioning Wales as a quality location to grow a brand or business through the appropriate channels. Not all iconic projects will be large in scale, and our support is not limited to serviced accommodation and attractions; we are looking for quality across all price -points and sectors. This includes the caravan and camping sector - an area of wide popular ap peal that is rapidly diversifying in response to market changes, and is core to the market position of Wales, especially in the UK. We need to continue to invest in the basic tourism infrastructure around Wales, as well as in high quality visitor experien ces. Brilliant Basics is a Wales wide fund that will deliver basic small -scale tourism infrastructure improvements, and ensure that all visitors to Wales have a positive and memorable experience throughout their stay. It will focus on the infrastructure ne eded to ensure that everyone feels welcome - from fully accessible 'Changing Places' to wider access improvements. We will also consider further ideas, working with local partners to build on the distinctive identity and character of market towns and coast al villages and place emphasis of projects that contribute towards meeting the decarbonisation agenda creating sustainable destinations. 10.12 The forthcoming Retail Strategy The retail sector is the largest employer in Wales, with 114,000 employees and with retail trade accounting for 5.9% of Welsh GVA (Note the retail sector refers to SIC 47: Retail trade, except of motor vehicles and motorcycles ). Alongside its value in economic terms, the retail sector is the lynchpin of many of our local communities and p rovides the essential and non -essential goods and services upon which our collective well -being depends. However, the dual impacts of EU Exit and Covid have changed matters considerably. Previously, the sector was experiencing challenges with developmen ts in technology and changes in consumer spending patterns but many of these changes have been accelerated by the pandemic and we have seen a catastrophic impact on both small and large retailers. Whilst the retail sector provides rewarding work to many, w e also recognise this is not universal and that challenges remain around the quality of work. There is a shared desire from responsible employers, trade unions and others to address this and make fair, safe, secure and rewarding work more prevalent across the retail sector. We benefit from a high level of engagement with the sector and greatly value contributions from our stakeholders, including businesses and their representatives and unions: The retail forum, launched jointly by the Minister of the Econ omy and the Deputy Minister for Social Partnership, is a social partnership made up of sector representatives, unions and officials that works collaboratively to inform development of a retail strategy that will produce immediate, medium and long -term reco mmendations to provide stability and security to the sector. The strategy, which is due for Ministerial launch in March 2022, will support the retail sector to achieve a vibrant future that will offer an attractive 26 opportunity for employment and career pro gression and continue to be a cornerstone of the Welsh economy, from the local high street through to our city centre settings. 10.13 Transition to Net Zero Net Zero Wales is the next phase of our journey and the first with net zero as our target, working towards a greener, stronger, fairer Wales. Our approach will sustain existing jobs, create employment opportunities and help ensure our industries remain internationally competitive. However, the challenges faced in coming decades cannot be under -estimated , and we must all work together to realise the opportunities available. Our vision is a well -being economy which drives prosperity, is environmentally sound, and helps everyone realise their potential. Delivering a just transition to a low carbon future is critical for Wales. I am working closely with the Minister for Climate Change on how we can refresh Business Wales to reflect our priorities for Net Zero, how we can prioritise support for businesses who contribute the most for Wales with our Economic Contract, and how Development Bank Wales (DBW) can ensure that businesses seeking to decarbonise receive the support that they need. Business Wales supports new entrepreneurs, micro -businesses and SMEs to embed sustainable development practices in the fabr ic of their venture. This helps Welsh businesses exploit new opportunities and take proactive steps to realise the business benefits of resource and energy efficiency, as well as joining a growing community of forward -thinking organisations working towards a zero carbon future. We are taking further steps to strengthen the approach of Business Wales in tackling the climate emergency, for example by providing enhanced information, guidance and support not only to help businesses reduce their carbon emissions but also to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We are refreshing the Business Wales website to reflect the priorities for Net Zero Wales, signposting SMEs to business support programmes, key websites, online tools, regulatory guidance and case studie s to share the experiences of businesses in Wales. Welsh businesses are currently supported to develop , implement and commercialise new products, processes and services through the Smart Cymru Programme . The Development Bank Wales already works with many businesses to support their ambitions to decarbonise, reduce energy consumption and develop new products with a green focus. This breadth of activity and current experience puts DBW in a key role to support the decarbonisation agenda. At the end of Novemb er I launched a new \u00a335m Package to help small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) in Wales relaunch, develop, decarbonise and grow to help drive Wales' economic recove ry. Our Economic Contract prioritises support to businesses contributing the most to Wales. We are committed to talking to all businesses we support about how they address the climate emergency. Regional Skills Partnerships continue to be a pivotal compon ent of the Welsh skills landscape, providing labour market intelligence to Welsh Government, whilst acting as strategic partners on all matters relating to employability and skills, directly supportin g our regional approach and the City Deal and Growth Dea ls across Wales. This will mean accelerating the adoption of the new skills required for the quality, secure jobs that a low carbon economy relies on. 27 Jobs need to be made more directly relevant to th e needs of a low carbon economy . The skills system must play its part managing the transition so it can quickly enable more individuals and businesses to prosper in a shifting economy. The Net Zero Wales Plan makes commits Welsh Government to the development of a Net Zero Skills Action plan in order to aid tra nsition to Net Zero and one that is equal and fair. Officials will be work ing closely with stakeholders from across Wales in the development of the Action Plan. Universities and colleges, along with skills providers, local authorities, and the third sec tor will play a central role in providing the training, skills and innovation needed by employers across Wales. Transferability of skills is crucial to the economy in times of crisis and when new training interventions are needed; N ational Occupational Standards (NOS) and the transferability they offer are crucial to these programmes. NOS are responsive to occupational and societal changes, and as such can accommodate the skills that Wales will require in the future. The new NOS Strategy will respond to t he green recovery agenda as one of its key priorities, and commission LMI research to identify the most robust sources of data to respond to occupations which are emerging or facing significant change across the UK. We also a need a long term and consisten t policy on decarbonisation and increased support for innovation from the UK Government. From clarity for business on regulation and funding to action on fuel switching and carbon pricing, our calls demand a coherent framework that all of us can use to pl an against. With the right framework, business and industry in Wales would finally have the certainty they need to accelerate their ambitions. As with other areas that were previously in receipt of EU funding, the levels of research capability and capacity in Wales is likely to decline over future years without the UK Government at least maintaining current levels of investment. 10.14 Welsh Government's policy on remote working Budget for the remote working policy is not separately identified in the Economy budget. However because we have brought together a test network of hubs detailed in the Press release - Remote working locations at very low or no cost, we expect future expenditure to be focused on providing enabling tools, such as a digital platform for information and booking. These will be similarly low cost and focused on future commercial sustainability, therefore we expect costs to be managed as a pressure in year. 10.15 Trade The Export Action Plan published in December 2020 and the delivery is a PfG commitment . The budget is maintained in the draft budget at \u00a34.692m and aim s to drive the growth in Welsh exports in the longer term. The Plan ensures we have a comprehensive range of export programmes to support businesses on their export journey, from - inspiring businesses to export; building export capability; finding overseas customers; and accessing overseas markets. International trade, however, has been significantly impacted by COVID -19 and the more complex trading relationsh ip with the EU, our largest trading partner . This is reflected in the most recent provisional export statistics, which show the value of goods exports for Wales was \u00a313.5 billion in the year ending June 2021, down \u00a32bn (13.1%) compar ed to the 28 year ending J une 2020, down \u00a34.3 bn (24.1%) compar ed to the year ending June 2019 . The Plan has put in place support for businesses at all stages of their export journey, including through dedicated 'on -the ground' support and advice via our team of International Trad e Advisers, based across Wales. To inspire a culture of exporting and internationalisation amongst Welsh businesses, our Export Exemplar campaign is showcasing the successes of a number of experienced Welsh exporters to encourage others to consider exporti ng; and, we also launched a new pilot New Exporter programme to work intensively with targeted businesses who have the ambition and potential to become sustainable and successful exporters. To develop export capability, we are delivering a series of webina rs and online training and advice on exports through the dedicated Export Hub. The new Export Cluster initiative was launched in the a utumn, which brings companies together in key sectors to develop strong networks of support, working on a \"one -to-many\" ba sis to support export development, helping to ensure companies learn from each other and share knowledge and experience. To support businesses find overseas customers and accessing overseas markets, we continue to deliver overseas trade missions/exhibitio ns to promote Welsh exports , many of whic h have been delivered virtually, to key markets, supported by our overseas t eams, as well as other key partners in -market such as D epartment for International Trade. The budget supports our efforts to promote Wale s as a destination for inward investment, a key commitment in the International Strategy. The activity focusses on opportunity -led investment and on those segments of the economy where Wales can demonstrate international class capabilities including compou nd semiconductors, fintech, cyber security, marine energy and specific aspects of life science such as regenerative medicine, neuroscience and medtech. As part of this, an extensive engagement programme is being delivered with our own overseas offices, wid er networks, critical industry clusters and stakeholders to raise the profile of investment opportunities in Wales. 10.16 Border Control Posts In accordance with the UK Statement of Funding Policy, the BCP facilities should be funded in full by the UK Governme nt as the costs have arisen as a result of the UK Government's EU Exit policy. However no funding was allocated in the Spending Review. Since then, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has committed to funding the costs of building BCPs in north and sout hwest Wales through reserve claims. This is welcome. The funding has not yet been included in the draft budget. However the UK Government has not committed to funding the running costs, including the costs to set up the arrangements. Welsh Government b elieves these should also be met and discussions continue with UK Government. 10.17 Research, Development and Innovation The 2022 -23 budget does not currently outline specific allocation of funds for RD&I for the five priorities announced by the First Minist er. The a llocation in previous years has supported collaborative R,D &I by the private, public and third sectors . Our priorities continue to be: 29 Deployment of research, development and innovation capacity to support our PfG, focusing on climate change, en vironmental recovery and decarbonisation; Building further on Welsh research, development and innovation capacity in the Health and Life Sciences; Developing a cross -Welsh Government innovation strategy for growth and skill development in the established r esearch and innovation base. We will continue to deliver our innovation agenda: As a co -investor and risk -sharer in business RD&I . Our current programmes help businesses develop new low -carbon products and processes. All applications are assessed agai nst the Wellbeing of Future Generations goals. As a stimulant to new public procurement practice . We partner with the UK Government's Innovate UK, in developing Small Business Research Initiative competitions which enable public sector bodies to seek innovative solutions to their intractable issues, many of which relate to the decarbonisation agenda; e.g., helping Cardiff Council run a competition for portable renewable energy generation so it can reduce the need for diesel power at major events in the city. As a deliverer for UK innovation facilities. For example, securing the UK Challenge Fund's \u00a336m Active Building Centre for Swansea. The centre is developing next -generation products and techniques that generate, store and release energy. This bui lt on work of the SPECIFIC Institute, also in Swansea, which recently developed one of the first positive energy classrooms. As a horizon scanner of national, European and global best -practice. Through our work within international innovation partnershi ps, many of which are with other EU regions. In previous years innovation has levered significant EU funding to provide an annual budget of c \u00a321m which also addressed the ambitions in the Reid review and expectations for distributing and replacing EU fun ding for the former Government delivering significant outcomes : TABLE 10 - INNOVATION OUTCOMES Outcomes Impact Businesses encouraged to grow through adoption of Innovative practices 881 Business investment in RD&I projects \u00a332m Businesses partnering i n collaborative RD&I projects 80 Innovative products, processes and services developed for societal improvement 382 Intellectual property rights registered (to retain the knowledge in Wales) 74 Investment secured for business growth through RD&I \u00a366m Net GVA uplift generated by adoption of RD&I practices \u00a3112m Carbon Reduction: Businesses adopting or improving environmental sustainability strategies 961 This Government recognises the importance of RD&I to Wales but, given UK Government's changes on t he Internal Market Act and control of UK Shared Prosperity Fund, has had to respond to the anticipated reduction in expected funding and related pr evious commitments reflected in the capital budget allocations of \u00a331.4m over the next three years , including EU funding of \u00a311.4m in 2022 -23. 30 Universities in Wales have established the Wales Innovation Network (WIN) to support the development of collaborative bids in research and innovation, raising the prominence of Wales' capabilities in a number of importan t areas for business and community development. HEFCW have invested \u00a31m in WIN over three years, and an interim director has just been appointed. It is unclear what the UK Government \u00a322b n investment in innovation by 2027 means for Wales and it is essent ial we secure funding levels at least equivalent to those we received historically via the EU and address historic underfunding from both competitive and non -competitive UK investment sources. Work is underway to develop with Welsh partners a new cross G overnment Innovation Strategy. In devising the strategy there is a need to focus innovation effort towards recovery and growth. Professor Reid's review is one source of evidence which will inform this work, but during this term of Government our priorities and focus have, out of necessity, also evolved, taking into account current funding constraints. Details of any funding during 2022 -23 intended to resource the mission -based national innovation strategy that is part of the Co -Operation Agreement if this is not included in the above. Our new cross -government fully integrated innovation strategy will address opportunities and challenges to build on the momentum in public and private sector innovation caused by the Covid -19 pandemic. It will also address carbon measurement so that we can fully understand the impact we have on carbon reduction. A case will be made for funding to assist cross -government delivery and an assessment made on what is needed. Committee Scrutiny 2020 -21 - Research and Innovation EU Funding During the period 2014 -2020, Wales benefitted from over \u00a32 bn Structural Funds. Between 2014 -2018, 20 % of ERDF and ESF proportion was allocated to research and innovation. The total investment was c\u00a3334m between 2014 and 2020, approximately \u00a360m each year. This includes a portfolio of strategic, complementary and specialist investments, covering Life Sciences, Energy, Advanced Engineering and ICT. In a UK context, during this period, Wales allocated c.\u20ac388 m of the UK's total \u20ac1.5 bn ERDF for Research and Innovation, the highest of any of the UK Devolved Administrations The Horizon 2020 programme facilitated researcher collaboration, with its emphasis on excellent science, industrial leadership and tackling societal challenges. It also provided grant su pport across the full spectrum of R&D, from ground breaking research to close -to-market activity. By September 2018, Welsh organisations had secured some \u20ac102 m of Horizon 2020 funding since the beginning of the programme, based on competitive excellence. T his involved over 255 participations (awards) and 2,820 international collaborations representing a total investment of some \u20ac1 billion in projects involving collaboration from Welsh participants. The Welsh Government's ERDF funded SMART schemes (SMART In novation, SMART Cymru and SMART Expertise) provides an integrated suite of interventions that drive innovative behaviour in Welsh businesses. SMART Innovation has engaged with over 1,800 companies and encouraged 240 of these to seek 31 competitive funding fro m Innovate UK and Horizon 2020. SMART Cymru and Expertise and have supported over 340 companies with R&D projects worth over \u00a3100 m with match funding. Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW). The Welsh Government invests more that \u00a342 m in health and social services research annually. This provides support for an extensive infrastructure of centres, trials units and support groups, which deliver clinical research studies, lead multicentre international research and participate in research that has an impact o n the health of Wales, the UK and globally. The Welsh Government has made significant investment in research infrastructure to support and increase capacity in research and development, designed to ensure that Wales builds on research strengths where it ex cels and includes vital collaborations with the life sciences industry, for the universal benefit of patients. The S\u00ear Cymru II \u00a360m programme was match funded. Designed to grow Wales' research capacity, it attract ed a wider range of research -excellent st ars in the early or middle stages of their career and fellowships to attract scientists on career break s, back into research posts in Wales. Taken collectively the in vestment approximates some \u00a3100m from: Welsh Government, HEFCW, Welsh HEIs, European Regio nal Development Fund and Horizon 2020 funding. In response to Covid -19, the WG held a research call to universities , via the programme, for novel research proposals contributing to the advancement of research , exploring expertise and talent within our un iversity sector. The \u00a35.4m initiative delivered 40 projects , levering \u00a32.5m match funding. The following table summarises the HEFCW position: TABLE 11 - DIRECT 2020 /21 \u00a3'000 2021 /22 \u00a3'000 By Academic Year Research Wales Innovation Fund 7,500 10,500 15,000 Wales Innovation Network - 150 420 QR (Quality Research) 75,800 75,800 81,700 PGR (PostGraduate Research) 6,500 6,500 6,200 Global Challenges Research Fund 2,500 2,800 - S\u00ear Cymru programme 200 500 1,300 92,500 96,250 104,620 Funds managed by HEFCW (Financial Year) Higher Education Research Capital* 6,980 9,430 29,620 The Young Pe rsons Guarantee (YPG) is the umbrella structure, which sits above all programmes for young people, aiming to create a simple journey for young people regardless of their circumstances and background. 32 The YPG is forecast to cost over \u00a3500m in 2022-23 financ ial year across the Welsh Government; this includes costs within the Education and Welsh Language MEG in addition to the Economy MEG. Within the Economy MEG, \u00a368m is forecast in 2022-23 financial year. This includes circa \u00a312m of European Social Funds in 2022-23 financial year from the JGW+ programme through the Traineeships ESF operations, subject to eligibility of activity. Circa \u00a348m of this relates to existing budgets and activities which support the guarantee and \u00a320m is additional budget which has b een allocated in draft budget 2022-23 to support the expected additional NEET cohort. Personal Learning Accounts Personal Learning Accounts (PLAs), will benefit from an additional \u00a31m up to 2024 -25 taking it to an for 2022 -23 and \u00a318.5m by 2024 -25. The programme provides support across Wales for employed people on below average salaries to gain higher level skills to help them to access a wider range of job opportunities and/or gain employment at a higher level. As our first gender budgeti ng pilot Personal Learning Accounts meet evolving regional skills needs and continue to address skills gaps with funding specifically targeting labour shortages and skills gaps in priority sectors such as health and social care, logistics, green constructi on and renewable energy The programme is also responsive to employers' upskilling requirements, in recognition of the ongoing challenges posed by Covid -19 and the challenges and opportunities arising from the UK's decision to leave the European Union. The courses and qualifications are fully funded by the Welsh Government. All courses and qualifications delivered through the PLA programme are endorsed by Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs) to ensure the provision meets evolving regional skills needs and addresses skills gaps. This flexible approach to learning enables colleges to work differently to offer courses and qualifications to address the economic skills requirements for employed people regardless of their previous level of qualification achieve ment. In partnership with RSPs PLAs will meet the evolving regional skills needs and continue to address skills gaps. In 2021 -22, additional funding is being specifically targeted at addressing labour shortages and skills gaps in priority sectors such a s reengaging and retraining staff to return to work in health and social care, training more HGV lorry drivers and reskilling individuals to respond to exciting new job opportunities in green construction and renewable energy. An external evaluation has commenced, which will inform further policy or e ligibility changes for the 2022 -23 academic year to help the Programme reach more diverse groups of learners while maintaining its core aims and objectives. Individual Eligibility: Live in Wales Want to gai n skills/qualifications in priority sectors 19 years old or over 33 In addition, individuals must meet at least one of the following criteria: Employed people (including self -employed) earning under the median income (\u00a329,534), or Workers on zero hours co ntracts, or Agency staff, or At risk of being made redundant, or Have been negatively financially impacted by COVID -19 (e.g. projected income is likely to fall below median wage) To note: Funding for PLA activity sits within the Education and Welsh Langua ge MEG Working Wales Working Wales is the Welsh Government's approach to delivering free, impartial, employability and careers advice tailored to an individual's needs and circumstances. The service, provides professional careers information, advice and guidance, for individuals over 16, by undertaking a needs -based assessment , including barriers to employment, and referring the individual to appropriate support. The service provides a national entry point to employability support, which supports and comp lements existing channels. Working Wales will refer individuals onto appropriate existing employability programmes supported by the WG including, JGW, ReAct and Traineeships. Working Wales is the gateway into our Young Person's Guarantee, building on th eir already strong and successful model of delivering careers guidance and signposting support. From 30 September Working Wales, began to track and monitor the YPG. ReAct+ ReAct+ is a new, exciting and refined adult employability programme offering ind ividualised support to unemployed adults 18+ trying to enter the labour market by working closely with the individual to remove barriers to employment. ReAct+ will form a key part of the response to the Young Person's Guarantee commitment by expanding th e offer to the 18 -24 year old NEET cohort. An incentive will also be offered to employers who recruit a NEET individual, this offer will also be available to employers that recruit an individual with a disability. The programme will offer an individualised approach and enable people to access relevant training and support and help prevent people entering long term unemployment by assisting them to move into sustainable work quickly. ReAct+ is demand led adult employability grant programme where the indivi dual along with support from a Working Wales adviser has the buying power, therefore providers vary across the regions, depending on the tailored needs of the citizen and sector based opportunities. This approach provides the project with the flexibility and the ability to respond quickly to the changing economic environment and changing priorities around the social well -being of Wales by responding to the needs of individuals and the barriers they face. The new programme will retain the tried and tested a pproach to providing vocational training skills to individuals, while providing support with care and travel costs for example. ReAct+ will see the expansion of eligibility to include the NEET cohort, supporting the Young 34 Person's Guarantee commitment with in the Programme for Government. An incentive will be offered to employers who recruit an individual from this cohort. Individuals who have a disability are also prioritised by the incentive to employers. ReAct+ will also support Ex - offenders and offenders serving their sentence in the community. An exciting new addition to ReAct+ is a Personal Development Support grant which will address individuals' barriers to employment including but not limited to DBS checks, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) as well as well -being issues of self -esteem, confidence, motivation, resilience and attitude. This provision will only be available to individuals identified as having labour market disadvantages and who require further support to overcome these bar riers to employment. ReAct+ will offer work experience where this is an identified barrier to employment and Working Wales will ensure an effective 'job match' for ReAct+ participants. A new mentoring service will be introduced to the ReAct+ programme and will be available to eligible individuals, providing personalised support for those presenting with barriers into employment, taking the service the 'extra mile' to support individuals. Officials are working across Government with Communities for Work + a nd Working Wales colleagues on the development of this innovative element which builds on the outcomes of previous evaluations. By targeting disadvantaged groups and enabling people to access relevant training and support quickly, the ReAct+ programme wi ll help prevent people experiencing long term unemployment by assisting them to move into sustainable work quickly. A cost analysis exercise has been undertaken to ensure that the support offered is current and realistic for individuals to engage in the programme and pursue their journey to employment. The table below highlights the key advancements of ReAct+: TABLE 12 - KEY ADVANCEMENTS FOR REACT Programme Element Current ReAct ReAct+ Vocational Training Up to \u00a31,500 Up to \u00a31,500 Extra Support Up to \u00a3200 Up to \u00a3300 Care/Childcare Up to \u00a32,600 (childcare only) Up to \u00a34,550 Employer Recruitment Support Up to \u00a33,000 Up to \u00a33,000 Additional \u00a31,000 for employers who recruit a disabled person or an 18 -24 year old who is NEET Employer Training Support 50% contribution up to \u00a31,000 50% contribution up to \u00a31,000 Personal Development Support This element is not available on the current ReAct programme Up to \u00a3500 (available to those identified as having a barrier to the labour market) Mentoring This ele ment is not available on the current ReAct programme This is at no cost to the programme and will be built into the role of the Working Wales and Communities for Work + service.

Journey to employment (JobMatch @ Working Wales) This element is not available on the current ReAct programme This is at no cost to the programme and will be built into the role of the Working Wales programme. 35 JGW+ Jobs Growth Wales+ is a new and exciting opportunity which is a fundamental part of the new Young Persons Guarantee. JGW+ takes the best elements of Train eeships and Jobs Growth Wales and will provide an holistic, tailored package of support for young people who are, or who are at risk of becoming, NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) The legacy Jobs Growth Wales programme was solely focused on employment offering young people a six month wage subsidised employment opportunity. Jobs Growth Wales+ retains this element but expands it so that it also focuses on those young people who are not yet job ready and helps them to reach that stage. There is also a much stronger focus on providing help for young people to reach their full potential by providing tailored assistance to help them overcome any barriers they may face when accessing employment or training opportunities. The differences between Trai neeships and Jobs Growth Wales+ are set out in this table: TABLE 13 - DIFFERENCES TRAINEESHIPS:JGW+ Activity Traineeships JGW+ Three strands Engagement Level 1 Bridges to Employment (this strand was never operational) Engagement Advancement Employment First strand Engagement Strand identifies and addresses barriers which prevent young people participating in learning or progressing to employment. This is done through work placements, voluntary opportunities and work placements as well as centre based l earning to help young people gain a work focus which will allow them to progress to further learning or employment. The JGW+ Engagement Strand is intended for young people who are assessed by Working Wales as: Needing to confirm or contextualise an occupa tional focus prior to entering further learning or employment including an Apprenticeship, and/or who are experiencing barriers preventing them from engaging in a programme of study at Level 1. Second strand The Traineeships Level 1 strand uses work place ments (including voluntary work) and centre based learning to address learner's barriers and deliver a Credit Framework (QCF) qualification before the learner progresses to employment or another level of training. The JGW+ Advancement Strand is for young people who are assessed by Working Wales as being occupationally focussed, and able to follow a level 1 qualification programme of study. The JGW+ Advancement Strand sets out the support and learning activities young people need to address any barriers th ey may face allow them to progress. This is achieved via work placements and centre based learning to deliver the appropriate qualifications. This element of the Traineeships programme was never operational The Traineeships Bridge -to- Employment strand was never utilised but was originally aimed at young people who were assessed as being occupationally focussed, above level 1 learning had completed the Traineeships Engagement strand; and had a minimum standard of qualifications. The JGW+ Employment Str and provides a wage subsidy for a paid and sustainable job opportunity and is for young people who are assessed by Working Wales as being occupationally focussed, and job ready (meaning they are motivated, seeking work and have realistic expectations of th e work they can do) The JGW+ Employment Strand sets out the support needed to address barrier/s identified in the ARR as which may be stopping young people from progressing. Wage subsidised employment opportunities (paid at 50% of the 36 minimum wage) help yo ung people progress in the world of work. JGW+ is contracted by tender; the contracts have been issued to the following Contractors under a Framework agr eement within each Regional Lot: TABLE 14 - JGW+ CONTRACT LOTS Region Contractor North Wales Grp Llandrillo Menai (GLLM) Consortium Coleg Cambria ACT Ltd South West & Mid Wales Pembrokeshire College ITEC Training Solutions ACT Ltd South Central Wales ACT Ltd ITEC Training Solutions South East Wales ACT Ltd ITEC Training Solutions The total procured Framework value sets a range of \u00a3100m -\u00a3200m for the full term of the agreement. It is anticipated that for 2022-23 financial year \u00a331m will be required. Flexible Skills Programme The Flexible Skills Programme provides targeted skills inter ventions where skills needs cannot be met through existing provision or where there is a clear case for direct involvement by the Welsh Government. Officials, in parallel with regional skills delivery partners, work to ensure that skills support is firmly focused on the regional economic needs and opportunities presented, for example through Regional Skills Partnerships, Enterprise Zones and City Regions. The programme is open to employers, employer -focused bodies and other consortia, with the aim of enabli ng and encouraging the development of flexible, industry -led skills solutions. The Programme can support, via a 50% contribution, eligible internal and external training delivery costs and training materials. It should be noted that the salaries of the employees that are undertaking training activities will not be considered as eligible training costs for the purpose of this funding award. The programme can also be utilised as a mechanism to channel funds secured from other budget lines as appropriate, e.g. the EU Transition Fund and Covid Commitment. Utilising these budget lines the likes of Airbus have been in receipt of funding to support digitisation, automation and advanced manufacturing techniques within the Airbus business development plan. Wales Un ion Learning Fund (WULF) The WULF programme has been in operation for over twenty years, supported by Welsh Government funding. The overarching aims of WULF are to: raise the skills of the workforce and facilitate progression by supporting Trade Union - led learning activity, in partnership with employers and others, with a focus on increasing the essential and digital skills levels and employability skills of the Welsh workforce, and also supporting workers to progress onto further learning and to gain 37 relevant qualifications support the recruitment and networking of Union Learning Representatives (ULRs) in raising demand for learning from non -traditional learners, especially workers with low skill levels and disadvantaged groups in the workplace, helpin g them to overcome barriers to learning; be responsive to the emerging skills and employability needs of workers, helping to deliver the skills needs of both the current and future workforce; work with employers to assist with workforce development inclu ding establishment of collectively bargained learning agreements and provision of advice on workplace policies and practices that encourage participation thus increasing the likelihood of progression, resulting in more workers benefiting from fair work. encourage employers to recognise the value of developing individuals through workplace learning in support of employability and progression. Increase diversity and inclusion within adult learning by removing barriers to learning and working with employers to widen access to workplace learning and skills. The intended participants of the programme are workers within the unionised organisations that are supported by those unions that bid into the fund. The current bidding round for delivery in 2022 -25 is un derway. Inspiring Skills Excellence in Wales The Inspiring Skills Excellence in Wales (ISEiW) project delivers a programme of activities that inspires and promotes vocational excellence in order to develop young people who will impact positively on the prosperity of the Welsh economy. The project, a Welsh Government funded initiative led by Coleg Sir G\u00e2r, will continue to raise the profile of vocational skills in Wales and drive forward a skills agenda that will fulfil the requirements of education and industry in Wales. National Occupational Standards (NOS) We remain committed to maintaining a three -nation policy approach to UK -wide National Occupational Standards (NOS) to underpin Adult Vocational Qualifications and apprenticeship frameworks in Wales. NOS support social mobility and permit the transferability and movement of skills across companies, sectors and borders. NOS support cross -cutting PfG Commitments to: Build an economy based on the principles of fair work, sustainability and the industri es and services of the future (Cabinet) Legislate to strengthen and increase our Welsh language education provision (Cabinet) Lesson Learnt Jobs Support Wales In September 2020 the Director General for Economy, Skills and Natural Resources announced at Pu blic Accounts Committee that a review into the procurement for the Job Support Wales programme would be undertaken and a report produced. The report contains the findings from a review carried out by internal audit. The review focussed on: Ensuring action s agreed in response to recommendations made in the ESNR review have been implemented; Reviewing a sample of procurements undertaken to confirm the new processes have been adopted and improvements have been made. 38 Conclusions from the report focused on ens uring secure governance, risk management and internal control within those areas under review were suitably designed and applied effectively. All recommendations had been implemented and actions were in place to closely monitor future procurements The ini tial review and the subsequent follow up work by Welsh Government's Internal Audit Services has provided the assurance that all necessary steps have been identified to protect the position of the Welsh Government and its responsibility to use public funds in a safe and controlled manner. The lessons learnt from both procurement exercises for Job Support Wales were at the core of all decisions made relating to the new programmes, and were supported by knowledge matured during the development of Job Support Wales to maximise value for money and time already invested in relation to adult and youth employability. 10.19 Work Based Learning The actual 2020 -21 outturn for the Traineeship programme is \u00a330.4m (inclusive of ESF income). The expected outturn for this pr ogramme for 2021 -22 is \u00a332m (including ESF income). The actual 2020 -21 outturn for the Apprenticeship programme is \u00a3124.22m (including ESF income). The expected outturn for this programme in 2021 -22 is \u00a3150m. This increase in the 2021 -22 outturn reflects the increased cost of the Employer Incentive Scheme. The proposed 2022 -23 Work -Based Learning BEL is net of \u00a35m to be transferred to HEFCW to support Degree Apprenticeships. It is anticipated that further funding will be transferred in year in the supple mentary budget to support the cost of new and continuing Degree Apprenticeships in 2022 -23. The cost is not confirmed at this stage. The Welsh Government commissions new and revised apprenticeship frameworks via contracting arrangements with Skills Develop ment Scotland (SDS). SDS manages the tendering and contract management process on behalf of the devolved nations. In order to ensure the apprenticeship offer remains current and relevant to the needs of employers in Wales, \u00a3145,000 has been allocated in 2021 -22 for the development of apprenticeship frameworks. This amount is based on expenditure in previous years and includes: \u00a3135,000 to be made available for apprenticeship framework developers via the SDS Commissioning process to develop new apprenti ceship frameworks and revise existing ones. This will include commissioning a review of the Automotive, Transport & Logistics, Digital Technology, Hospitality & Catering Energy and Business and Management frameworks; and \u00a310,000 for reviewing the Engin eering and Advanced Manufacturing Degree Apprenticeship Frameworks. This will involve quality assuring additional degree qualifications for these frameworks. In addition, recognised Development Partners are also able to develop and review frameworks. Thes e are non -commissioned reviews but have to be agreed by Welsh Government prior to commencement. In 2021 -22, Welsh Government has agreed to the 39 non-commissioned development and review of frameworks in the Healthcare and Construction sectors. It is our int ention to continue to develop and review the frameworks outlined above in 2022 - 23 and to also commission the development and review of frameworks in the following sectors: Property Services, Engineering & Advanced Manufacturing and Materials, Hair & Beau ty and Tourism, Travel & Leisure. It is expected that \u00a3140,000 will be committed for this purpose in 2022 -23. Demand -management restrictions and actions to manage apprenticeship demand Our Apprenticeship Action Plan (2017) signalled our intention t o move the Apprenticeship programme towards supporting new entrants and employees who are relatively new in their job role. It also identified the need to move away from generic apprenticeships towards those that are sector specific. Our current eligibil ity rules reflect this direction of travel but also allow some flexibility to support those sectors and learners who are disproportionately affected by the impact of Covid -19. Our general approach is that employees (excluding disabled individuals) are ine ligible for a level 2 Apprenticeship if they have been employed for more than 6 months in the same job role and those employed for more than 12 months are also ineligible for a level 3 Apprenticeship. There is no employment length restriction in place for learners seeking to undertake a level 4/5 apprenticeship. We have also restricted the availability of generic apprenticeships to those learners who are disabled or new to employment. However, in recognition that young people are disproportionately impa cted by the economic downturn, employees aged 16 -24 are not deemed to be ineligible for an apprenticeship on the grounds of length of employment in their current job role. The only exception to this will be for those Level 2/3 apprenticeships that have be en identified as generic (e.g. Business Administration, Retail and Customer Service, Team Leading and IT Users) as these will only be available for new recruits. This relaxation will be subject to further review but will apply until at least the end of Jul y 2022. In addition, in recognition that the Tourism and Hospitality sector in Wales has been significantly and disproportionately impacted by Covid -19 restrictions, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that significant numbers of employees are de -motivated , lacking confidence in the future of the sector and seeking alternative employment, we relaxed the apprenticeship eligibility rules to enable its employees to undertake an apprenticeship irrespective of their length of employment. It was widely regarded that providing opportunities for up -skilling would go a long way towards improving staff motivation and confidence; thereby helping to retain staff. This relaxation is expected to be in place until at least the end of July 2022. We intend to retain thes e demand management approaches into the 2022 -23 year and will review the requirement to retain the Covid related relaxations post July 2022. The Employer Incentive Scheme (EIS) has been successful in attracting circa 5,500 learners into apprenticeships si nce August 2020. Whilst this scheme is planned to end in February 2022, the budget from 2022 -23 onwards will allow the scheme to continue for disabled apprentices. The number of disabled people starting an apprenticeship in Wales already falls behind both Scotland and England. Currently over 8% (2020/21 Q2) are disabled whilst the figures in Scotland and England is over 11%. The continuation of the EIS 40 for this cohort will help to increase the participation of this disadvantaged group and will help us achi eve our target of eradicating the gap between the employment rate in Wales and the UK by 2050 with a focus on Fair Work and raising labour market participation of under - represented groups. 10.20 Regional Skills Partnerships/Employer Engagement In responding to the PfG commitment to 'Strengthen Regional Skills Partnerships' and the recommendations of the EIS Committee (October 2019) and its recognition of the 'clear resource challenges' the Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs) have faced, officials have proposed an increase of funding to the RSPs. This increase will enable RSPs to make required improvements and ensure they are able to effectively carry out their work of aligning Further Education and Apprenticeship provision with employer need, aid in recovery fr om Covid -19, and ensure we have the skills required as part of our drive to Net Zero. A fourth RSP, covering Mid Wales, was established in April 2021 with this RSP receiving the same level of funding as the existing RSPs (\u00a3165,000 per annum). Officials pr opose an increase of the funding for RSPs from \u00a3660,000 in 202 1-22 to \u00a31,160,000 in 2022 -23. This amount would be split equally between the four RSPs at \u00a3290,000 per RSP, although officials are currently investigating how to best provide the RSPs with a ce ntral research capacity and funding for this may have to be drawn from this total budget. This is in response to the EIS Committee recommendations. In addition, RSPs have been provided with an additional \u00a3100,000 in 2021 -22 (\u00a325,000 per RSP) to conduct en gagement with their delivery partners to help Welsh Government's understanding of the current marketplace in terms of projects and programmes to support young people and how projects can contribute to the Young Person's Guarantee. This work is expected to be repeated next year with further funding provided. Welsh Government does not provide any other funding to support the operation of Regional Skills Partnerships. 10.21 Brexit The impact on the labour market is unprecedented with significant disruption. That has led to sharp falls in the number of people employed, the number of hours they work and the number of job vacancies on offer. The impact of the pandemic threatens to reverse progress made in reducing unemployment and economic inactivity in Wales over the last decade. However, we seek to move forward with a renewed focus on our goals to tackle the forecast rise in unemployment (in collaboration with the D epartment of Work and Pensions WP), to address the Not in Employment Education or Training (NEET) rate of young people, to improve qualification levels in Wales, and to reshape the skills of the existing workforce and promote fair work in Wales. For the economy to emerge stronger and more productive than before, both individuals and businesses will nee d support to navigate the crisis. The Welsh Government employability offer will be central to our economic recovery and ambitions to Build Back Better, and crucial in supporting those most likely to be negatively impacted in the Welsh labour market. We are expanding front lines services via Employment Bureaus (Further Education), Working Wales, and the Communities for Work Plus (CfW+) advisor and mentor 41 infrastructure. To help people back into work, we are directing people to access Working Wales as the portal to our wider employability offer. Our goal is to support the 'Return' and 'Retention' of the current workforce, 'Restart' an individual's employment journey following a period of unemployment or furlough, and prepare and 'Reskill' people across Wales for the future world of work. Working across Government, we remain firmly committed to supporting people into employment or self -employment, securing learner continuity and progression in the labour market throughout this pandemic. The Welsh Governm ent has been clear and consistent in its priority that Wales will not to lose a penny of funding due to Brexit; as promised during the referendum. We have assurance that the UK will continue to participate in EU programmes funded through the 2014 -2020 Mul tiannual Financial Framework under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, meaning we will be able to continue to deliver our programmes through to December 2023. Since the Referendum in 2016, we have been working with stakeholders across Wales on a new re gional investment policy which puts us in a strong position to hit the ground running when the EU Structural and Investment funds begin to tail off towards the end of this year. The Framework for Regional Investment in Wales, published 18 November 2020, s ets out our high -level strategy for achieving prosperity and an inclusive economy to which local, regional and national (i.e. Wales -wide) interventions will contribute. 10.22 EVIDENCE BASE / EVALUATION & REVIEWS Evidence from a wide range of sources underpins our financial decisions such as published research, engagement with stakeholders, previous policy evaluations and statistics. This is embedded in decision making with some examples as follows. Economic Resilience Fund Welsh Government appointed Economic Intelligence Wales to undertake an impact and evaluation . The first stage report Covid -19 Welsh Government Financial Interventions : An Analysis of Welsh Beneficiaries assessed Welsh Government Phase 1 and 2 business grants and the Covid -19 Wales Business Loan Scheme managed by the Development Bank of Wales. It also considers the Non -Domestic Rates grants administered by local authorities. Other schemes have more recently opened to firms in Wales for applications and these are not analysed in this initial report. The initial findings in the report are: The first 2 Phases of the ERF have provided over \u00a3200m of grants to support businesses in Wale s. This figure excludes support paid through the Non Domestic Rates grant of \u00a3770m which was paid to 64,000 businesses. 42 In total these ERF business grants have dire ctly supported almost 12,000 organisations in Wales and 125,000 jobs (full -time plus part -time), representing around 10.5% of total employment in Wales. Average funding awarded was \u00a31 5,620. On average, the amount approved for SMEs was just over 77% of the value of funds applied for by firms in Wales. Almost 80% of recipient firms were micro businesses, receiv ing an average grant of almost \u00a310,000. Small firms comprised 18% of supported firms with average funding of almost \u00a331,000 per firm. Medium -sized firms accounted for almost 3% of recipient firms, with an average grant of almost \u00a374,000. Large firms received an average grant of around \u00a3302,000. The wider impacts of the support could be significant, with many thousands of further jobs supported indirectly in related businesses through supply -chain effects and wage spending effects. There are a further two stages to the work of the EIW which include a survey element and a follow on impact and conclusion evaluation. The survey element has now concluded and an analysis been undertaken which is due early in 2022. Working Wales plays a vital role in evaluating and understanding an individual's needs and the complex barriers they present. In doing so, they are able to determine the most appropriate provision to meet the needs of that individual. The service provides a national entry point to em ployability support, which supports and complements existing channels; thereby avoiding duplication and ensuring value for money. We are developing a new adult employability programme, to start delivery in late 2021 - 2022. The new Adult Employability Progr amme will build on the proven successes, concept and brand to combine ReAct (redundant workers All -Wales) and Access (unemployed people) to provide this full employability offer to unemployed adults in Wales. The programme will provide individualised suppo rt to those trying to enter the labour market by removing barriers and providing grant support such as vocational training, childcare, travel costs and wage subsidies. The main aim of the programme is to enable progression into sustained employment. The new programme will utilise a format that is tried and tested and will offer a programme of support to fulfil the aims of Taking Wales Forward and the Employability Plan. ReAct development, evaluations and audits over the past 20 years have helped the progr amme become efficient and effective at assisting people enter employment. We have funded the Wales Social Partners Unit, through a competitive tender process, to deliver engagement services between Social Partners and the Welsh Government in Wales. This helped to ensure that the views of some of our key stakeholders are embedded into policy development and delivery. This area of spending underwent an independent evaluation. The organisation's resource is now located within the Social Partnership and Fair Work directorate within Welsh Government. In 2018, Welsh Government commissioned a research report:\" Commercial Property: Market Analysis and Potential Interventions\" to evaluate the supply of and demand for modern sites and premises in Wales. The SQW report has been used to support the implementation of the Welsh Government's Economic Action Plan: Property Delivery Plan. 43 An additional note has been produced alongside the final report to consider the potential implications of the Covid 19 pandemic, give n the report was delivered at the start of the outbreak. This area is reviewed to ensure evidence is reflective of the current and future circumstances. Business Wales Impact Assessment During 2021, Cardiff Business School was commissioned to provide an independent assessment of the economic outcomes associated with Business Wales. Findings of this Economic Impact report as follows: Core and Growth (Level 1 -4) The four year survivability rate is 67% compared to 33% for a matched sample of non - assisted businesses The service has generated \u00a392m of business investment connected to projected turnover of \u00a37.76bn For Each \u00a31 invested, this can be linked to around \u00a310 of net GVA uplift per annum. An estimated 5,108 of the 10,408 safeguarded jobs under these p rogrammes would not have been protected in the absence of the support. The net (additional) jobs are estimated to be connected with around \u00a3266m of GVA. Accelerated Growth Programme The four year survivability rate for AGP assisted businesses is 77.4% compared to 32.7% for a matched sample of non -assisted businesses \u00a3377m of business investment connected to projected turnover of \u00a35.99bn. For each \u00a31 invested in AGP, this can be linked to around \u00a318 of net GVA uplift per annum Since 2015 -16, AGP supported around \u00a3377m of investment in enterprise, 9,755 jobs, and \u00a3266m of exports. Total gross 9,755 jobs created translates to around 5,332 net jobs i.e. around 45% of the employment outcomes might have occurred in the absence of the Business Wales AGP intervent ion. These net jobs are estimated to be connected with around \u00a3410m of GVA. Additional employment created/activity estimated \u00a3410m GVA per annum. Business Wales Customer Satisfaction 2703 businesses / individuals interviewed that have previously accesse d the Business Wales service. Cumulative results as follows: 91% of those interviewed were satisfied with the advisors expertise and knowledge. 87% of those interviewed were satisfied with the quality of advice. 86% of those interviewed would recommend t he service to others. 85% of those interviewed were satisfied with the overall service they received. Business Wales Brand Awareness Independent Brand awareness survey conducted in November 2021 by Beaufort Research as part of their omnibus surveys (inte rviewing 500 businesses). Independent Brand awareness survey conducted in November 2021 by Beaufort Research as part of their omnibus surveys (interviewing 500 businesses). 44 Before today, were you aware that the Welsh Government provides a dedicated busin ess support service to people running or starting a business? 2021 results - Yes 55% / No 42% / DK 2% This is a positive increase of 10% from 2020 results 10.23 MONITORING BUDGETS There are well -established processes in place for detailed and effective management of voted budgets in -year to the Economy MEG. A significant element of planned activity in the MEG is demand led such as the Economy Futures Fund and invariably large infras tructure projects which are undertaken by third party contractors . Consequently expenditure can be affected by facto rs outside Welsh Government control such as adverse weather conditions. Plans are monitored closely by the senior management team to agree options and proposals for corrective action to seek to manage net expenditure at budget levels. Robust challenge reviews are undertaken at mid -year to identify any significant issues and inform options for the consideration of the Directors, Minister, and Deputy Minister and available resources reprior itised to remain responsive to economic developments . 10.24 LEGISLATION There is no current legislation requiring provision in the draft budget p lans. Summary The Economy MEG Draft Budget for 2022 -23 is pres ented to the Committee for consideration. Vaughan Gething Minister for Economy 1 Local Government and Housing Committee Date: 21 January 2022 Title: Welsh Government draft budget scrutiny 2022 -23 Introduction The Draft B udget inc ludes spending plans for 2022 -23 to 2024 -25. This paper provides evidence to the Committee on the future programme budget proposals in relation to Housing , Regeneration and Land budgets as outlined in the Draft Budget which was laid on 20 December 2021 . Annex A provides a breakdown of the relevant Draft Budget figures for the Climate Change Main Expenditure Group (MEG) by Spending Programme Area, Action and Budget Expenditure Line (BEL). These figures are reflected in the table below. Financial Tables 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3'000 2022 -23 Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change 20,000 245,008 7,500 251,508 6,500 Non Cash 0 0 0 0 0 Total Resource 213,508 237,508 20,000 financial transactions capital have been allocated as part of the Draft Budget. Allocations will be considered and made as part of the Final Budget. Allocations made to support Programme for Government Commitments The Housing Directorate support s the delivery of a number of Programme for Government commit ments . In accordance with Welsh Government budget management principles, allocatio ns to support the delivery of these commitments have been targeted towards interventions that are affordable and offer value for money. Details of the allocations and the PfG commitments they support are provided throughout this paper. A Strategic Integra ted Impact Assessment was published alongside our Draft Budget on 20 December; this sets out how our interventions have been targeted to address economic , climate a nd other impacts. Allocations have been made throughout this portfolio to address impacts th at have been identified and with the principles of the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in mind ; these details are provided throughout this paper . 2 Homelessness - Revenue allocation of \u00a313 .240m in 2022 -3, a further \u00a35m in 23 -24, and a further \u00a35 m in 24 -25 Fundamental reform of homelessness services to focus on prevention and rapid rehousing is a key priority in the Programme for Government which commits to \" Reform housing law and implement the Homelessness Actions Group's recommendation to fundamentally reform homelessness services to focus on prevention and rapid rehousing \". Reform of the Housing system offers the opportunity to contribute significantly to a f airer and more equal Wales. Additional revenue funding of \u00a313m will boost investm ent in Homelessness Prevention and Housing Support across Wales as well as support d evelop ment of a national scheme restricting rent to local housing allowance levels for families and young people who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness . We hav e already begun work to meet our objective to fundamentally reform homelessness services to focus on prevention and rapid rehousing which is a key priority in the Programme for Government. Additional investment in housing support and homelessness preventio n delivers on key policy objectives, reduces pressures on other public services and improves outcomes for individuals and families. The continued and increased focus on preventative measures through the Housing Support Grant and Homelessness Prevention Gra nt is therefore vital. Our support will ensur e we have a system which places the right people in the right homes in the right communities with the right support, in order for people to succeed and thrive. The legislative, policy and funding framework needs to be reformed and aligned to achieve this. T he pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated aspects of the wider transformation to homelessness services, mostly in respect of the policy considerations regarding priority need. Whilst the temporary measures have been hugely successful in reducing rough sleepi ng to record lows, it has resulted in unprecedented numbers of people in temporary accommodation - currently estimated at 6,900 people across Wales, which places considerable resourcing pressures on local authorities. The additional funding will support l ocal authorities with the costs of temporary accommodation in order to continue the 'everyone in' approach during the transitional period, prior to wider legislative reform and the transition to a rapid rehousing approach. Given the diverse range of peopl e potentially affected by homelessness, significant consideration has been given to protected groups. We have looked at the data and can see that specific services are required across Wales to serve specific client groups that have unique needs. The Housin g Support Grant (baselined at \u00a3166.8m across the three financial years) helps to create more specialised services that can support different groups, e.g. women affected by homelessness, as well as domestic abuse and sexual violence. By having that support in place, women will be more likely to present to services, rather than remaining 'hidden' and in danger. Similarly, services that are sensitive to age or sexuality will be vital for young LGBTQ+ clients who require specialised support in order to feel saf e enough to present and move on to more permanent accommodation. Ensuring that we meet the needs of diverse ethnic minority people is also important given disproportionate impact of homelessness on some ethnic minority people. Wrap around services that were developed during the pandemic, including support for those experiencing mental health and/or substance misuse issues have been mainstreamed with the additional funding provided to the HSG in 2021 -22. 3 Investment in housing support and homelessness pre vention delivers on a key policy objective , reduces pressures on other public services, and improves outcomes for individuals and families. For example, we estimate that currently as a result of the pandemic, there ar e at least 6,9 00 people in temporary ac commodation across Wales. Evidence from Crisis UK shows that people who experience homelessness for three months or longer cost public services (health and criminal justice) an average of \u00a318,388 over the twelve month period . This would equate to over \u00a3126 .9m in estimated costs to publ ic services in Wales (over \u00a344.4m in health services alone) if those people currently in emergency accommodation experienced homelessness for three months or more . The continued focus on preventative measures through the Housi ng Support Grant to keep people in their homes are therefore vital. Research by Cymorth Cymru and Cardiff Metropolitan University into the social and financial impact of the Housing Support Grant estimated that the grant generates a gross annual saving to public services of \u00a3300.4m, or a net annual saving of \u00a3176.7m (when taking in to account the annual HSG spend as at July 2019). This represents an estimated net saving to public services in Wales of \u00a31.40 for every \u00a31 of funding for HSG. Every \u00a31 of HSG funding generates an estimated net saving of \u00a35.20 for mental health services. Achieving transformational change is ultimately therefore about the need to shift resources to alleviate pressure and demand from elsewhere in the system. There is anecdotal e vidence during the pandemic that providing accommodation to long -term rough sleepers has enabled wider public services to engage with people, helping them to stabilise and manage substance misuse habits and engage with physical and mental health services, reducing demands on emergency services. The additional funding allocated in the budget will enable the continuation of this approach whilst we shift more towards prevention and transition homelessness services towards a rapid rehousing approach. Of the \u00a313m allocation to the Homelessness BEL in 2022 -23, \u00a31m will support the PfG commitment to \"Implement the renting homes Act to give renters greater security and develop a national scheme restricting rent to local housing allowance levels for families and young people who are homeless or who or are at risk of homelessness\" . We have already announced the roll out of a national leasing scheme across Wales to improve access to longer term affordable housing in the private rental sector. Local auth orities will be able to use the scheme to discharge their homelessness and prevention of homelessness duties. Property owners will be encouraged to lease their properties in return for a rent guarantee and additional funding to improve the condition of the property; and tenants will benefit from longer term security of tenure (between 5 -20 years) at rents restricted to Local Housing Allowance rates. Revenue funding supports local authorities to staff and administer the scheme and forms the basis of the prop erty owner incentive and tenant support . Private Rented Sector Supply - Capital allocation of \u00a30.5m in 2022 -23, \u00a31.5m in 2023 -24, and \u00a31.5m in 2024 -25. Having access to a greater stock of good quality, affordable housing will be a key driver in helping meet the needs of the people of Wales. The private rental sector PRS leasing scheme is intended to address some of the difficulties both landlords and tena nts experience in the PRS. The scheme will be rolled out across Wales to improve access 4 to longer term affordable housing in the private rental sector. The scheme directly supports the delivery of the Programme for Government commitment to develop a natio nal scheme restricting rent to local housing allowance levels for families and young people who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness . Property owners will be encouraged to lease their properties to the local authority in return for a rent guarantee and additional funding to improve the condition of the property and the l ocal authorities will be able to use the scheme to discharge their homelessness and prevention of homelessness duties. The a mbition is by the end of year 5 each local author ity will have leased 1% of their PRS through the scheme, approximately 2,000 properties across Wales. The aim of the scheme is to improve access to longer term affordable and good quality housing in the PRS and address concerns around housing cost induced poverty, including supporting communities where people are priced out of the private rental market. This will benefit tenants by supporting them into PRS accommodation where they would otherwise face significant barriers , and by helping them access and mai ntain their tenancies will reduc e the risk of future homelessness by addressing their challenges quickly and responsibly. The scheme is intended to help some of th ose who ar e disadvantaged and potentially more vulnerable in society and has been designed to reflect the needs of children and their representatives, people with protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010, and other people who may face particular barriers . As the scheme also provides a secure home for individuals, there are wide rangi ng benefits that come from that, including health (including mental health) as it provides longer term accommodation at local housing allowance rates to households on low incomes making the PRS accessible to those who are currently financially excluded or live in the poorest quality PRS accommodation with little security of tenure. Providing good quality housing, with assurances of tenure length, helps prevent and alleviate physical and mental conditions resulting in fewer calls upon the NHS and a healthier society. Providing g reater security of accommodation for tenants will contribute towards a Healthy and more Equal Wales , a Wales of Cohesive Communities, and a Wales of vibrant culture and thriving Welsh language . This is demonstrated by the clear health benefits of having a good quality home which is affordable and located in a safe environment. Investing in the PRS contributes to the local economies, creating and supporting jobs and training opportunities as wel l as improving people's health, well -being and quality of life. This work involves improving the housing stock for future generations and the quality of that housing stock in the PRS. Supporting the provision of affordable homes also promotes the creation of local jobs, training opportunities and housing development supply chains. This scheme involves collaboration with local authorities to help prevent and reduce homelessness. To assess the efficacy of the model a pathfinder has been running across seven local authorities and lessons learned from the pathfinder will support the development of the national roll out. A key benefit from the scheme is the opportunity to strengthen links between local authorities and private sector landlords, providing pathway s for households experiencing or threatened with homelessness into housing and offering financial stability and support for landlords. 5 The majority of WG funding is aimed at supporting those at most priority need for housing and initiatives to provide new and/or affordable housing. Instead, this scheme approaches need differently as it seeks to relieve pressure on the demand for social housing through its use of the PRS. Such an initiative will not suit everyone and considerations of eligibility will need to be undertaken in matching people who will benefit from the scheme an d the independence it supports. Housing Policy - Revenue allocation of \u00a31.76 m in 2022 -3, baselined for the next two years \u00a31.76 m has been allocated to the Housing Policy BEL as a package of funding to undertake a range of activity to meet our Programme for Government commitments. Implementing the Renting Homes legislation will significantly increase security of tenure by ensuring that tenants who have not breached their cont ract will have a minimum of six months' notice to find a new home. The legislation will also make other important changes, such as providing protection against retaliatory eviction and ensuring homes are fit for human habitation, which will include the fit ting of smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and regular electrical safety testing. The Minister for Climate Change has committed to implementing Renting Homes by the 2022 summer recess. We will also support \"Rent Smart Wales landlords to respond quickly to complaints of racism and hate crime and offer appropriate support \" via training for all landlords and managing agents who rent out properties in Wales. We will work with third sector organisations and Rent Smart Wales to develop training focused on quic kly responding to complaints of racism and hate crime for all landlords and managing agents who rent out properties in Wales. The training will be delivered alongside a n awareness raising communication programme , targeted at tenants , focussed on how t o rep ort racism and hate crime and where to get help and support. Additional revenue funding of \u00a30.6m will support the various strands of activity within the Second Homes and Affordability Pilot which is comp lementary to the PfG Commitment to \"Create a Welsh Language Communities Housing Plan \". This includes a pilot manager, dedicated staff resource on the ground in the pilot area, evaluation and exchange of good practice, a range of programme -funded interventions, and provisi on for legal advice and suppo rt The Programme for Government sets out clearly our commitment to address the issue of affordability in areas where there are high instances of second homes and to develop a Welsh Language Communities Housing Plan . A consultation on the plan was launched by the Minister for Education and Welsh Language on 23 November. The plan includes proposals on numerous interventions that aim to support Welsh speaking communities. These include support for community -led co -operatives and social enterprises, establishin g an estate agents steering group and setting up a commission on the Welsh language. The consultation will close on 22 February 2022. The interventions in the draft plan, if taken forward after consultation, will be complementary to the work being taken fo rward in the second homes pilot in Dwyfor. Additional revenue of \u00a30.5m will enable Care & Repair agencies to extend their services to support rapid hospital discharge of complex cases. The funding increase to \u00a34.8m is specifically to enable agencies to support people who have more complex hospital discharge issues where adaptations cannot be provided until essential works 6 have been undertaken in the home e.g. to remove health , falls and fire hazards. This will particularly benefit disabled people, includ ing those who have conditions such as hoarding, as well as owner occupiers in older housing stock in a poor state of repair and in the private rented sector who are not able to access the benefit of social landlord maintenance services. The Programme for Government has also committed to \" Legislate to enact the recommendations of the Law Commission in relation to leasehold reform\". The leasehold housing sector is an important part of the national housing market. It houses an estimated 4.5 million households in England and Wales. Approximately two thirds of these properties are flats and one third houses. In Wales, leasehold accounts for around 16% of all dwellings. This equates to, very approximately, 235,000 properties. The Law Commission has proposed wide -ranging reforms to make it easier for leaseholders to extend or buy the freehold of their home and to promote the adoption of commonhold as a form of ownership that gives more rights in comparison with leasehold. The Minister has committed to implementing leasehold reform through working collaboratively with the UK Government, not least as some aspects of the legislation to implement the Law Commission's recommendations are likely to relate to reserved matters. This approach will enable a more comprehensive and beneficial set of reforms to be enacted for leaseholders in Wales as soon as possible. The additional funding will support a greater emphasis being given to these important reforms. By implementing the Law Commission's recommendations on leasehold re form and ensuring open spaces and facilities on estates are funded fairly, which is another Programme for Government commitment, we will contribute to our well -being objective of making our cities, towns and villages even better places in which to live and work. The additional fu nding will also support work to \"Publish a White Paper to include proposals for a right to adequate housing including fair rents and new approaches to making homes affordable for those on local incomes \". Funding will support work to establish an evidence base and develop policy in relation to this commitment to develop a white paper on Property and Fair Rents. The balance of funding will support delivery of a range of activities focussed on ensuring that everyone has a decent pla ce to call home and delivery of equity and high standards in housing across Wales. This includes delivery of the following Programme for Government commitments: Take forward actions to cap the number of second homes, bring more homes into common ownership and licence holiday lets. We are taking a three -pronged approach to address the challenges facing communities with high levels of second homes in Wales Revenue funding of \u00a30.6m will support the various strands of activity within the Second Homes and Affordability Pilot which is complementary to the Programme for Government commitment: Create a Welsh Language Communities Housing Plan. This includes a pilot manager, dedicated staff resource on the ground in the pilot area, evaluation and exchange of good practice, a range of programme -funded interventions, and provision for legal advice and support. Additionally, Homebuy will form part of the package to address issues of affordability through targeting and tailoring existing housing programmes. 7 Develop further effective tax, planning and housing measures to ensure the interests of local people are protected. These commitments relate to our work in the area of second homes and affordable housing solutions. At this point, we have consulted on local taxes for second homes and self -catering accommodation, and have launched consultations on possible changes to the planning system and to Land Transaction Tax . Decisions relating to those areas, and financial impacts of options, will be fully assessed in l ine with the consultation responses. We have also established a pilot to test interventions in Dwyfor. The budget will support the roll -out and evaluation of the pilot as well as the central coordination of our policy development and implementation. Explore the feasibility of introducing local authority mortgages . Section 435 of the Housing Act 1985 gives local authorities the power to directly provide mortgages. A small number of mainly English councils provided mortgages in the wake of the 2007 -08 financial crisis targeting mortgages at first time buyers via the Local Authority Mortgage Scheme (LAMS). In this scheme participating local authorities set aside a sum of money to act as an indemnity for the partner mortgage lender(s). This indemnity enabl es the applicant to apply for a mortgage with only a 5% deposit as opposed to the deposits of around 20% to 25% required by most mortgage lenders. This indemnity also enables the applicant to obtain similar interest rates to those offered to people with a higher personal deposit. Rhondda Cynon Taf CBC previously participated in LAMS. We will explore the use of this scheme further with Welsh local authorities and provide written guidance on their powers to provide mortgages. Building Safety - Revenue allocation of \u00a35 m in 2022 -3, a further \u00a31m in 2023 -24, and a further \u00a3500k in 2024 Capital allocation of \u00a3 2023 -24, and \u00a3165 m in 2024 -25. Building Safety is a priority for the Welsh Government. Building defects are having a significant impact on leaseholders and residents and we have committed to \" Reform the current system of building safety, including a second phase of the Welsh Building Safety Fund, so that people feel safe and secure in their homes\". We are dedicated to find ing a solution and are working a t pace on this most complex of issues. We want to ensure funding to support remediation addresses all issues that affect fire safety in multi -residential buildings and ensures no one else has to go through these difficulties again in the future; and the identified solutions are the right ones. This government wants to ensure multi -occupied residential buildings are a safe place to live and are well equipped to protect life and limb in the unfortunate event of a fire. Future funding will further progress the Welsh Building Safety Fund bringing forward support options for those in affected buildings. Revenue funding will support the Building Safety. We have engaged through information events with Responsible Owners to in form and encourage them to use the EOI process as an opportunity to explore further into the safety of their buildings. The Expressions of Interest for phase one of the Welsh Building Safety Fund opened on 30 September. As of 20th December 2021, Welsh Gove rnment have received circa 105 Expressions of Interest. Our 8 proposal to establish a nd fund a Joint Inspection Team in Wales received strong support in the \"Safer Buildings in Wales\" consultation. A Joint Inspection Team working in partnership with current enforcement agencies will provide another route to improve building safety for residents , recruitment to the JIT will commence in the New Year . We are committed to ensuring resident engagement is at the heart of these legislative reforms and our white paper set out bold and important reforms to strengthen resident voice to ensure they have more say in matters that affect their homes and can be confident their buildings are safe. All residents, regardless of their tenure, should expect to have their voices heard . Having good communication and engagement with residents is vital, not only for building safety but also for community cohesion and social well-being. T his funding will support the development of these commitments. The Building (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2019 were made by the then Minister for Housing and Regeneration as an immediate response to the Hackitt Report, following the independent inquiry into the Grenfell tr agedy. Revenue funding will directly support fire safety surveys and the creation of Building Remediation Passports for all mid and high rise buildings across Wales. Additionally, the revenue funds will provide resource to progress a significant amount of evidence based policy development at a pace that residents feel supported in Wales. Capital funding will support the remediation of buildings and support to leaseholders. We have made significant progress on this highly complex issue . The critically important first phase continues to help us understand the true scale of the problem and inform development of the right solutions to properly address it. Funding to support remediation will seek to holistically address fire safety in multi -residential buildings and ensure no one else has to go through these difficulties again in the future. Land - Revenue allocation of \u00a3 0.844m in 2022 -23, \u00a330k in 2023 -24 and further \u00a30.1m -25. Capital allocation of \u00a310m in 2023 -24, and \u00a310m in 2024 -25. The revenue funding will support additional resource to enable the Land Division to meet the ministerial ambitions where Land Division is tasked to increase the provision of affordable/social housing across Wales and to deliver \"Exemplar Sites\" within its land portfolio. It will also enable the full potential of the land portfolio to be realised over the next 5 years in terms of delivering good quality affordable hous ing. The pipeline of sites has the potential to deliver circa 2,600 housing units over the next 5 years The resource will allow Land Division to pursue the agenda of achieving maximum public benefit for the public purse from its land portfolio. It will set a performance specification aligned to the PfG setting out its standards for policy objectives, in particular affordable homes, place making, carbon reduction, biodiversity, supply chain, community benefits and the like. This process will allow best scheme selection and to achieve best value for the public purse. The Land and Buildings Development Fund (L BDF) complements the ambitions of other interventions delivered across Welsh Government and wider public sector with the aim of unlocking the potential for developing public land for public good, particularly to meet the demands for social and affordable h ousing. The scheme, is primarily intended to support the ambition for small scale, energy efficient, low carbon developments. The 9 fund is particularly interested in applications seeking to unlock schemes that will utilise modern methods of construction, in novative technologies and deliver solutions at pace. LBDF is a targeted capital driven programme that concentrates on freeing up public land where development has stalled. It is intended to enable public bodies and public sector partners to overcome barriers to development i.e. bridge the \"viability gap\" and advance change. This c apital funding is supporting delivery of the 20,000 new homes target by secur ing sustainable, well -designed affordable homes on p ublic sector land, including our own land portfolio, where it will see k to establish a new benchmark for residential development . All schemes are delivered in a place -making context, with the intention of 50% affordable homes and m andating space standards and driving innovation in low carbon energy solutions and Modern Methods of Construction . Regene ration - Revenue allocation of \u00a31.556m in 2022 -23, a further \u00a370k in 2022 and a further \u00a3 0.4m Capital allocation of The Welsh Government's regeneration investment is focused on town centres to strengthen their social, cultural and public service usage therefore creating sustainable places. It is delivered through an integrated place -making approach under the Transforming Towns programme, which provides flexible support in response to the issues and challenges faced by individual towns across Wales, taking into account the potential future impacts of climate change and embedding sustainable development principles. Its overall objective is to support the sustainable growth of towns and cities and their transformation into places of living, working, learning and leisure . Sustainable regeneration of town centres will be achieved through three objectives: Focus Town Centre First Build the strongest case for 'Town Centre First' princip les across government and the wider public sector, and provide challenge to 'out of town' development Work across government departments to support delivery of strategic projects that will regenerate town centres, multiplying impact through strategic coord ination at the Welsh government and local levels across Transport, Health and Education, in particular Deliver positive change for places Invest in infrastructure that will re -energise town centres post -COVID to ensure their sustainability Reimagine the high street to deliver wider benefits and placemaking to support town centres Build local capacity to deliver regeneration Engage stakeholders across development and regeneration to test and implement fit -for-purpose town centre regeneration Ensure local authorities and other local delivery partners have the capability and capacity needed to deliver regeneration through strengthened support from 10 government, including more collaborative ways of working and the delivery of digital resources. Our investments focus on town centres to mitigate the impact of the rapid rate of decline experienced by many towns over a number of years and prevent it from worsening. Once decline sets in there is often an associated rise in anti -social behaviour, crime and poverty. T he cost to communities as well as the public purse increases. Failure of town centres to meet the economic, social and environmental needs of the communities they serve often disproportionally affects older people and those on lower incomes, who have less opportunity to access services elsewhere. Our aim with regeneration is to address inequalities experienced in town centres by investing in places that are currently under -performing, both economically and in terms of wellbeing, in order to raise their pe rformance. In doing so, we aim to improve overall levels of prosperity and wellbeing in Wales as a whole . Regeneration investment, through Transforming Towns, aligns with the following Welsh Government well-being objectives to: Make our cities, towns a nd villages even better places in which to live and work ; by provid ing funding for businesses including, public, private and third sectors , to improve the vibrancy of our town s and improve the availability of services and community facilities; contributing to civic pride. A ccessibility of services in easy to reach town centre locations reduces inequality ; Build an economy based on the principles of fair work, sustainability and the industries and services of the future ; Transforming Towns is focused on cap ital schemes and these are often linked to skills and job creation. By having vibrant and sustainable town centres we can create an environment that supports businesses and creates jobs. The Town Centre First policy seeks to ensure that, as well as public services, new business development and high -skill jobs are increasingly concentrated in town and city centres. The focus on a wider offer of activities and uses in town centres, including flexible business space, leisure and local services, which will brin g entrepreneurs and create jobs opportunities into town centre; Embed our response to the climate and nature emergency in everything we do : Regeneration will respond through the creation or improvement of green public spaces to enhance beauty and biodive rsity, address drainage and improve air quality. Projects will have a positive impact on the physical environment in which they are located and will be very designed, planned and constructed to the highest environmental credentials (e.g. BREEAM, EPC A rat ings etc.) with design standards being reviewed by the Design Commission for Wales in appropriate cases. Funding will be prioritised for projects that redevelop and build low carbon properties. Our investment in Regeneration will help support the deliver y of the following Programme for Government commitments: Enable our town centres to become more agile economically by helping businesses to work co -operatively, increase their digital offer and support local supply chains, including local delivery service s. Through our Programme for Government, we are committed to making our cities, towns and villages even better places in which to live and work . Businesses 11 within our towns, particularly within the retail and hospitality sectors, are facing the critical challenges of the impact of Brexit, the Coronavirus pandemic and supply chain shortage. As a result, towns have been, and indeed still are, fac ing significant and often unforeseen challenges resulting in decreased footfall. It is uncertain how many of the changes to habits will be permanent or if some of them are temporary and, post pandemic, increased confidence may lead to an increase in footf all. However, for people to be able to return to them, the businesses and services in towns need to survive. Safeguarding these businesses and services and supporting them to adapt is necessary to ensure the long -term sustainability of our towns. We will encourage and support the use of digital technology by town centre businesses through an extension of our Transforming Towns - SMART Towns programme . This includes utilising data to help businesses better understand their customer base and trends whi ch will support businesses in their future planning and marketing activities. In addition, we will support businesses to cooperate, for example, through the development of more Business Improvement Districts in Wales. This will provide businesses with a p hysical presence in town centres, a competitive edge over online only operators and a stronger voice in local developments. Develop masterplans for towns and high streets. Our strategic regeneration investments are targeted at improving the fabric of town centres, creating the environment for them to diversify as places of livin g, learning, leisure and work. This diversification is fundamental to th e sustainability of our towns. The Town Centre First policy of Future Wales will directly influence the location of public services, retail and commercial development, and require them to be in town centres. Local authorities, directed by this policy, are preparing long -term land use plans to deli ver these uses into town centres. Good quality mixed -tenure housing in town centres will support the vitality and viability of existing and new services and allows residents to access them by using sustainable transport infrastructure. Planning the c o-location of this housing with leisure, learning and work facilities will support strong eco -systems of residents, services and businesses and contribute to the sustainability of town centres for future generations. Through this commitment, we will suppo rt town masterplans to help develop sustainable places. The plans will be considered through the wider spatial context of the Local Development Plan and the emerging regional Strategic Development Plan. The plans will be flexible and involve the community and other stakeholders from the outset. Empower communities to have a greater stake in local regeneration. Funding through our Transforming Towns programme was previously allocated regionally and delivered by our local authority partners. Despite the s uccess of this approach, we are also committed to working closely with more localised groups. Collaboration, engagement and support between the Welsh Government, local authorities and the people that rely on and use towns across Wales is more likely to de velop town plans which have a legitimate base and a better chance of coming to fruition. It will enable individual towns to benefit from better outcomes through our Transforming Towns programme by identifying the mix of support that best suits their speci fic characteristics, local strengths, culture and heritage. Through this commitment, we will assist local groups to become involved in deciding what happens in their towns as well as developing learning and engagement between places. 12 Create more community green space in town centres. To help address the climate and nature emergency our Programme for Government includes our commitment to expand arrangements to create or enhance green and blue spaces. Our published Building Better Places document focuses on key areas of Planning Policy Wales, including the importance of green spaces, encouraging the creation of new spaces, and improving people's access to green space . The introduction of green infrastructure and improved public realm in town centres is centr al to successful place making and is therefore a fundamental part of our Transforming Towns programme. Green space and public realm is valued by the public and is therefore not only an essential part of the environmental regeneration of towns, but also the ir social regeneration. Garden squares, small parks, tree lined pedestrian routes and landscaped areas will not only respond to the climate and nature emergency but all contribute to civic pride. Repurpose public space for outdoor events, markets, street vendors, pop up parks and 'parklets'. Given the challenges faced by our town centres as a result of Covid restrictions, delivery partners have sought to support business activity and vibrancy. The continuation of this support is a priority in making our towns and cities more attractive places to live, work and spend leisure time. Through this commitment we will support a range of smaller cost, more flexible interventions empowers local authorities, community organisations and other partners to come t ogether in regional partnerships to decide upon the most appropriate mix of schemes and how they are deployed effectively in town centres. Outdoor events, such as festivals and markets are key in attracting footfall and visitors to town centres and provid ing a more diverse and social offer to the local community. Markets and pop up vendors often sell local produce, reducing the impact of the supply chain on the environment and providing good quality produce locally which reduces the need to travel. It als o allows small local businesses to thrive and offers low risk opportunities to vendors, putting money back into the local economy where many vendors grow, raise and produce their products. Green infrastructure into town centres is considered to be central to successful place making and a fundamental part of projects supported under our Transforming Towns programme, following the successful delivery of the \u00a39 million Green Infrastructure Pilot Fund in 2020 -21. A range of Green Infrastructure interventions h ave already been supported and been well received, including pocket parks in Penarth and Newport town centres and a pop up parklet at Cardiff Castle. Support the development of a register of empty buildings and help small businesses move into vacant shops . Empty properties are a scar on town centres, surrounding neighbourhoods, and a constant source of concern to the people who live in these communities. They soak up resources both in local and central Government, and are often expensive to remedy. We un derstand that empty properties attract antisocial behaviour, are often dangerous, and if untreated, can directly contribute to the decline of an area. They also create a perception of decline in the minds of local 13 people and businesses which undermines con fidence in the area. However, empty properties are obviously an underused community asset. There are many reasons why properties are empty, one challenge is to acquire the data to ensure we are tackling those properties that are persistently empty and no t those only temporarily (for example, in a good state of repair and on the market). The establishment of a register of empty buildings and supporting businesses into them is one of a number of measures and interventions we are taking to tackle the issue of empty properties. Support cooperative housing, community -led initiatives, and community land trusts. Revenue funding provides a programme of support for co -operative or community -led housing groups. Work is ongoing to develop a support programme building on the success of the current programme, but ensuring a key focus on supporting community land trusts and supporting other government commitments including the 20,000 target and the second homes pilot. Through this, the programme will directly con tribute to the 20,000 target and provide knowledge and expertise to a Community Housing Enabler role as part of the second homes pilot. National Construction Company - Revenue allocation of \u00a31m in 2022 -23, baselined into future been allocated in 2022 -23 recurrently as part of the Plaid Cymru Co -Operation Agreement to \"establish Unnos, a national construction company, to support councils and social landlords to improve the supply of social and affordable housing \". We will explore opportunities to establish Unnos within this envelope, with further details to be scoped as we undertake feasibility studies and the required due diligence. Social Housing Grant and Land for Housing - Capital allocation for Social Housing Grant of \u00a3310m in 2022 -23, \u00a3330m in 2023 -24, and \u00a3325m in 2024 -25. Capital allocation for Land for Housing of \u00a310m in 2022 -23, \u00a310m in 2023 -24, and \u00a315m in 2024 -25. Welsh Government has made a Programme for Government commitment to \"build 20,000 new low carbon social homes for rent \" to tackle both a housing shortage and the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, and a commitment to fundamentally reform homelessness services to focus on prevention and rapid rehousing. This will allow individuals and househol ds to access high quality affordable to rent and run homes in Wales. Social homes set the benchmark for quality; we expect high standards of space, quality, energy efficiency and place making from the Welsh social housing sector . Within the target of 20 ,000 low carbon social homes for rent it is anticipated that 17,500 will be provided by Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and Local Authorities (LAs) using S ocial Housing Grant (SHG) funding. We are implementing the Standard Viability Model (SVM) to enabl e a focus on value for money. 14 Social Housing Grant : Delivers high -quality, warm secure and energy -efficient homes for people who need them most, helping reduce fuel poverty. Supports the foundational economy, construction industry and supply chain in Wales, delivering training and employment opportunities, including jobs and apprenticeships Supports the transformational shift of homelessness services to a rapid rehousing approach, where those who experience homelessness are quickly supported back into a suitable permanent homes. Supports older people and those with additional care requirements to avoid dependence on residential or long term care, reducing the call on the NHS. Delivers good quality social housing which has a significant impact on people and communities, helping to achieve our long -term goal of ending homelessness, improving physical and mental health, ensuring those with complex needs receive the support they need. Revenue funding provided will also directly support the Rural Housing Enabler programme, which plays an important role in supporting rural housing , working with communities to identify local housing need and we remain committed to supporting them . This programme directly contributes to the 20,000 target and as well is suppor ting a Community Housing Enabler role as part of the second homes pilot. Much of the work of Land Division and the associated funding aligns to the impacts of Social Housing Grant and the 20,000 low carbon social homes for rent target. All of the schemes being delivered from the Land Division portfolio are intended to deliver homes of which 50% will be affordable. A number of the schemes will also include for example a new primary school, public open space and community facilities. The schemes are intende d to set a new benchmark for energy efficiency and design and will be based around achieving Zero Carbon and improved space standards. It is also intended to promote modern methods of construction, in particular off -site manufacture. The developments will also aim to facilitate self -build and where appropriate to support community led developments. As an example the development at Cosmeston will contribute circa 250 homes to this specific target but also deliver a new primary school, which again aligns wit h the Well - being objectives contained in the Programme for Government which seeks to invest more than \u00a31.5bn in the next phase of 21st Century Schools and develop net -zero carbon schools and open up school facilities for local communities. The proposals fo r Cosmeston include facilities that will be available to the local community and provide a hub for local activities and has been designed to have place making at its core, reducing inequality and supporting well -being objectives. The additional capital wi ll enable the Land Division to meet the ministerial ambitions where Land Division is tasked to increase the provision of affordable/social housing across Wales and to deliver \"Exemplar Sites\" within its land portfolio. It will also enable the full potentia l of the land portfolio to be realised over the next 5 years in terms of delivering good quality affordable housing. The pipeline of sites has the potential to deliver circa 2,600 housing units over the next 5 years 15 Rapid Response Adaption Programme -Capital allocation of \u00a3 17.660 m in \u00a317.660 and \u00a3 17.660 m in 2024 -25. The Rapid Response Adaptation Programme supports a range of activity: We will continue to provide capital funding for local authorities under the Enable programme to enable them to undertake medium adaptations, such as stair lifts and downstairs level entry wet rooms, without applying a means test (as would be required for a Disabled Facilities Grant), using powers under the Regulatory Reform Order 2002. The additional funding will support local authorities to begin to address low levels of adaptations provision in the private rented sector and consolidate 'no mean test' policies . We will continue to support Care & Repair (C&R) agencies with capital funding to enable them to deliver small adaptations rapidly to facilitate timely NHS hospital discharges and prevent unnecessary admissions. This relieves costs on social care by reducing pressures on domiciliary and residential care. The additional funding will enable Car e & Repair agencies to provide support for those with the more complex hospital discharge requirements, where work in the home is required prior to making adaptations e.g. tackling health and fire hazards due to poor maintenance or issues such as hoarding. Our Physical Adaptations Grant enables traditional housing associations to provide adaptations for tenants in social housing and reduces pressures on local authority capital budgets for Disabled Facilities Grants. This investment in housing delivers si gnificant benefits to NHS and care services, and contributes to the equalities and tackling poverty agendas. In particular, in facilitating independent living, it has a particularly positive impact on older and/or disabled people. Additionally, and in the context of the Well -being of Future Generations Act, providing adaptations to enable people to continue to live independently is a long term preventative intervention; it serves to integrate health, housing and care services; it requires collaboration betw een housing associations, local authorities, Care & Repair, Occupational Therapists and health and social care services; and it involves disabled people in choices about their lives. Need is rising in real terms, both as a consequence of Covid -19 and as the proportion of the older population rises more quickly than healthy life expectancy: \"Census data highlights that a higher proportion of the Welsh population consider themselves to b e in poor health than is the case in England. Welsh Government projections anticipate that the number of people in Wales who will experience mobility problems and difficulties undertaking daily domestic tasks will increase significantly in the next 20 year s\" (Audit Wales, 2018, with references to Census and Daffodil Wales sources). Increasing the capacity to provide adaptations will benefit disabled people, older people and people in socio -economic disadvantage. It will help to sustain rural and Welsh spea king communities by supporting people to live in their community for longer. It directly supports improved health and well -being. The capital is also an investment in local jobs as the contractors and supply chains are predominantly local ones. There are also indirect decarbonisation outcomes where an intervention results in the improvement of energy efficiency, especially in older homes. 16 There is a full monitoring system in place for these grants and the adaptations and we publish annual data on o ver 30,0 00 adaptations. We intend to conduct a full evaluation of Care & Repair Cymru in 2022. The system as a whole was scrutinised by Audit Wales in 2018. Their conclusion was that adaptations represent a value for money preventative policy, but that there are s ystems issues which need to be addressed. The majority of the recommendations have been addressed but we continue to progress with systems improvements, including a strategic framework for integrated working between providers at the regional and local leve ls. We are also seeking a stronger role for Regional Partnership Boards (RPBs) in overseeing adaptations delivery in their regions, as part of the strategic framework referred to above. Consideration of adaptations forms an essential part of planning for the care and support needs of the population and as such as should be considered by RPBs as part of their remit. It is our intention to change the Physical Adaptations Grant scheme from a demand -led scheme to an allocation -based grant from April 2022 so it can operate within a fixed budget. We are working with CHC and housing associa tions on the design of a fair formula. The PAG budget of \u00a310m represents about 17% of the total spend on adaptations (including local authority Disabled Facilities Grants) on just 5.5% of the housing stock. Through the increase in Enable funding we can be gin to address low levels of adaptations provision in the private rented sector. Funding alone is not sufficient. We will also need to improve private sector landlords' understanding of the importance of adaptations. Integrated Care Fund - Allocation o f \u00a362.340 m in 2022 -23, \u00a36 2.340 m and \u00a36 2.340 m in 2024 -25. This funding programme provide s housing and accommodation to meet care needs i.e. extra care and other accommodation for older people and people with dementia; supported living for adults with physical and learning disabilities and/or A utistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and mental health p roblems; close to home accommodation for children with complex needs; intermediate care settings, such as short term assessment settings for children with complex needs/on the edge of care, step up/step down and reablement settings, moving on accommodation ; associated small scale investments e.g. in digital care technology. Increasing the scale and pace of investment in specialist housing and accommodation will help to meet th e needs of an ageing population and increasing opportun ities for independent livi ng will make a significant reduction in the need for out of county/country placements. Our main aim will be to increase the existing stock of housing with care by building approximately 930 units over a three year period. The majority of these units will be Extra Care housing for older people and people with dementia. The remainder will be in small scale developments to provide supported living accommodation for adults with a learning disability and/or ASD and others. These are tenanted social housing unit s which will count towards the 20,000 low carbon social housing for rent target. We will also invest in small scale residential accommodation for children with higher needs in order to bring children back from, or avoid, out of county/out of country 17 place ments, as well as intermediate care settings in the community e.g. step up/step down. This objective also supports the Programme for Government commitment to fund regional residential services for children with complex needs ensuring their needs are met as close to home as possible and in Wales wherever practicable. In addition to providing new accommodation, we will increase our investment in adaptations so that people can remain independent in their existing home. Adaptations are an effective way to impr ove the health and wellbeing of older people, and disabled adults and children. They can prevent falls, reduce hospital admissions and facilitate discharges, reduce reliance on care, avoid the need to move into residential care and significantly improve qu ality of life and wellbeing for individuals, their families and carers. Our investments in the Integrated Care Fund and our Adaptations programmes will support delivery of the Programme for Government commitment to \"Support innovative housing development to meet care needs \". Programme outcomes impact on health and social well -being, with economic benefits during construction stage and ongoing support for jobs in the Foundational Economy in line with the Well-being of Future Generations Act. The programme meets all 5 ways of working sustainably - the impacts are long term and cumulative; it is a preventative intervention that maintains well -being, reduces hospital admissions and reduces reliance on residential care; it integrates a number of key Government policy areas relating to housing, health, social care and economic recovery; requires collaboration between partners through the RPBs and involves all stakeholders and beneficiaries in key decisions. The programme is also designed to have significant posit ive impacts on equalities and Welsh language agendas and is strongly aligned with WFG Act and A Healthier Wales objectives. All accommodation supported by the programme must meet Welsh Government housing quality and sustainability standards, including n ew low carbon requirements. A Town Centres first approach will ensure beneficiaries are close to services, reducing the need for travel. Additionally, n ew cross directorate governance arrangements to be put in place, alongside strengthened programme and project management arrangements and benefits realisation. An independent evaluation will be scheduled for Year 3, 2024 - 25. Housing and accommodation projects will be subject to social housing funding application and assessment processes, including technica l scrutiny and the Standard Variability Model (to determine grant intervention rates). This will provide consistency across the Housing and Regeneration directorate. Funding will be allocated in year to projects which are investment ready, regardless of where they are located, with a view to equalising investment across the regions over the course of the programme. Alignment with the social housing programme will bring forward a greater number of projects with blended SHG and ICF funding, increasing the n umber of pipeline projects and contributing to achieving the 20,000 low carbon social rented homes commitment. 18 Home buy - Capital allocation of \u00a32m in 2022 -23, \u00a3 2.5m in 2023 -24, and \u00a34 m in 2024 -25. Our Home buy scheme is designed to support shared equity home ownership and is available on existing homes. Home buy primarily supports people who would like to purchase an existing home, within their community, but do not have the full financial resources to be able to do so, thus supporting people from lower socio economic backgrounds. The scheme is a tried and tested scheme which has been offered by Welsh Government, on a small scale, for many years and is popular in rural areas, where new build ho mes are not readil y available. Building on previous inve stments of \u00a39.7m into 178 Homeb uys during the last term of Government, this draft budget commits to investing \u00a37.5m in a further 85 Homeb uys over the next 3 years, subject to market conditions. The investment will in itially facilitate availability of the scheme in the proposed second homes pilot area, with the scheme becoming more widely available in other areas of Wales. Work is already underway with Gwynedd Council, and its delivery agent, Grwp Cynefin, to tailor th e scheme to better meet local needs within the pilot area. The Programme for Government sets out clearly our commitment to address the issue of affordability in areas where there are high instances of second homes and develop a Welsh Language Communitie s Housing Plan of which Home buy forms a part, and is the only offer around homes for purchase. We are taking a three -pronged approach to address the challenges facing communities with high l evels of second homes in Wales, Home buy will form part of the package to address issues of affordability through targeting and tailoring existing housing programme s. We will invest \u00a37.5 m in circa 85 Home Buys over the next 3 years, depending on housing market conditions. The scheme offers support of 30 - 50% of the purchase price of a home, which is repaid on the sale of the home. It is open to all, and managed by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) who can place additional requirements on applicants such as the need for a local connection. Thus the scheme is seen as key to supporting the work on mitigating the issues of affordability in some communities often exacerbated by high volumes of second homes. Major Repairs Allowance and Dowry Gap Funding - Capital allocation of \u00a3108m in 2022 -23, \u00a3108m in 2023 -24, and \u00a3108m 2024 -25. An independent evaluation of WHQS (June 2021) states that WHQS has significantly enhanced the quality of Welsh Social Homes since 2002. Ceasing support would mean standards of housing for some of Wales most vulnerable homes would decline and Ministers would be exposed to reputational risk such as that recently featured in England , where the spotlight is focused on homes unfit for habitation. \u00a3108m per annum is spent via We lsh Housing Quality Standard (WHQS) to support social landlords to provide good quality warm social homes, to some of Wales' mo st vulnerable households. This is 35% of WHQS works to achieve and maintain the standard, the sector put in 65%. Any reduction in funding means landlords would spend 19 more to maintain existing homes to the WHQS standard, compromising their ability to deliver new homes and building safety measures. The new WHQS standard which is due to go live in 2022, following formal consultation, is a statutory requirement for all social landlords in Wales and it is anticipated that this will incorporate an increased energy efficiency standard and decarbonisation standard. WHQS2 will focus on decarbonisation of social housing whilst WGs Optimised Retrofit programme will facilitate test and learn to inform long term wider retrofit of all homes, across all tenures in Wales. On-going WHQS 2 investment from 2022 together with Optimised Retrofit P rogramme funding will continue to boost local prosperity through SME growth, and supply chain development. Dowry contractual arrangements to L arge Scale Voluntary Transfer s are extant for 30 years in total, with most stock transfer RSLs having 15 -20 years remaining on their agreement with WG. Breaching the ag reement would risk immediate Judicial Review. Residential Decarbonisation Revenue allocation of \u00a3 0.6m in 2022 -23, a further \u00a31.4m in and a further \u00a3 0.5m in -25. Capital allocation of -24, and \u00a392m in 2024 -25. The 1.4m homes in Wales are responsible for 27% of all energy consumed in Wales and 15% of all our demand -side Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The retrofitting of these homes is a primary preventative measure as it seeks to improve the energy efficiency o f homes to reduce their carbon emissions to help Welsh Ministers to meet legally binding carbon targets, as well as PFG commitment to decarbonise residential homes through retrofitting. Total cost of decarbonising the housing stock based on WSA estimates i s circa \u00a315bn, of which more than \u00a310bn is for the social housing stock and for homes in fuel poverty. Revenue funding will be utilised help support the establishment of a Housing Net Zero Performance hub to provide independent support for the Welsh housing sector. The hub will be run as a 'For Good' business model and : bring together expertise in research and development in t he fast moving field of decarb; provide technical know -how; retrofit advice and expertise specific to h ousing; allow access t o suitable qualified individuals and SMEs certified to carry o ut surveys and decarb activity; and, act as a learning vehicle to generate data on the schemes supported, in order to share with other organisations. This will help the housing sector across al l tenures know what works, and just as importantly - what doesn't. Revenue funding will be used to help support the development of the decarbonisation agenda for housing and the delivery of the ORP programme. Revenue funding will also be utilised to cover the additional staff costs required to deliver the capital investment arising from the retrofitting homes. Without this funding the PfG deliverables will be not be achieved. Spending significant capital investment needs appropriate skills and oversight to ensure funding activity is in line with highest standards of corporate governance and risk management. It is key that significant capital investment delivers value from the public purse. 20 In line with the PfG commitment to \" Decarbonise more homes through retrofit, delivering quality jobs, training and innovation using local supply chains \", revenue funding will accelerate landlords' access to independent support in time for the launch of the new W elsh Housing Quality Standards decarb standard in 2022, thus rapidly increasing the pace of d ecarbonising the housing sector and retrofitting more homes . Capital funding will predominantly be used to support the social housing sector, through the Optimised Retrofit P rogramme, which will facilitate test and learn to inform long term wider retrofit of all hom es, across all tenures in Wales including the development of a Building Renovation Passport and the n undertaking the measures required to enable the decarbonisation of homes across Wales. Our ambition is to ensu re that all social housing landlords participate in this scheme over the next three years so that they can integrate the decarbonisation agenda within their planned maintenance programmes. The ORP programme will offer gap funding to landlords to help fac ilitate the decarbonisation of the hosing stock. Any reduction funding contribution is likely to mean delays in steps being taken to tackle the decarbonisation agenda - thereby impacting the timeline for legally binding climate change targets and the PfG commitment to decarbonise more home through retrofitting The continued grant funding will mean the tools, strategies and foundational economy benefits started in the current ORP programme will continue to be developed and sustained at a level needed to b uild the opportunities to deliver against the Cabinet's green economic recovery commitments. Furthermore, without this continuity and growth the business sector, landlords and private owners will face significant difficulty in meeting decarb targets. Investment in WHQS and optimised retrofit across Wales' housing must be seen against the backdrop of significant benefits to well -being, cost savings in services and local economic growth. Investment in over a million homes this decade has the potential to gen erate large economic returns as well as reducing our emissions and levels of fuel poverty. The retrofitting of these homes is a primary preventative measure as it seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes to reduce their carbon emissions to help W elsh Minister s to meet legally binding carbon targets. Our strategy and investment will prioritise social housing, demonstrating best practice, developing supply chains and skills that will stimulate the market and inform strategy for owner occupied home re trofit programmes. It requires social landlords, their tenants, SMEs, funding bodies and other key stakeholders to work together to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Our investment in Major Repairs and Residential Decarbonisation will support delivery of the Programme for Government commitment to \"Continue to improve existing homes, helping us tackle fuel poverty, create much needed jobs, training opportunities, and supply chains \". Investment in W elsh Housing Quality Standards and optimised ret rofit across Wales' housing must be seen against the backdrop of significant benefits to well -being, cost savings in services and local economic growth. Investment in over a million homes this decade has the potential to generate large economic returns as well as reducing our emissions and levels of fuel poverty. 21 Market Housing Capital allocation of \u00a310m in 2022 -23, \u00a325m in 2023 -24, The draft budget 2022 -23 makes available \u00a360m of capital funding over three years to our Empty Homes Fund, to provide loan or grant funding to bring 2,400 difficult empty homes back into occupation. Through this grant, we want to tackle the difficult empty properties that are persistently empty and not those only temporarily (for example, in a good state of repair and on the market). We w ill make funding available to cover the cost of remedial works to make a property habitable . We will also consider if the funding should be conditional upon the applicant living in the pr operty for a minimum of 5 y ears. Whilst this government is committed to social housing, the Minister for Climate Change has been clear that there is a continued n eed in Wales for market housing, it is crucial to the creation of mixed tenure housing sites in order to achieve truly sustainable communities. 22 Annex A 1 Budget in FLG MEG at Final Budget 2021 -22 EXTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE MAIN EXPENDITURE GROUP (MEG) RESOURCE BUDGET MEG BEL 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3000's Changes \u00a3000's New Plans Draft 2022 -23 \u00a3000's Climate Change 1,587 6,471 Total Independent 1,587 173,234 SPA 193,554 10,827 204,381 Safety 3,545 5,000 8,545 Total 3,545 5,000 8,545 Residential Decarbonisation 0 773 773 Total Achieve Quality Housing Action 0 773 773 Total Housing Safety, Regulations & Standards SPA 3,545 5,773 9,318 Housing Finance Grant 13,100 13,100 Total Increase the Supply & Choice of Affordable Housing Action 13,100 0 13,100 Housing Programme Revenue Funding 1,073 1,073 Total Housing Revenue Funding Action 1,073 0 1,073 Regeneration 560 1,556 2,116 Cardiff Harbour Authority 5,400 5,400 Total Regeneration Action 5,960 1,556 7,516 Total Homes and Places SPA 20,133 1,556 21,689 Land Release fund1 276 1,844 2,120 Total Land Division Action 276 1,844 2,120 Total Land Division SPA 276 1,844 2,120 EXTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE MEG TOTAL RESOURCE BUDGET 217,508 20,000 237,508 23 *Budget figures in 21 -22 exclude Financial Transaction Capital budgets for comparative purposes EXTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE MAIN EXPENDITURE GROUP (MEG) CAPITAL BUDGET MEG BEL 2021 -22 Final Budget \u00a3000's Changes \u00a3000's New Plans Draft Budget 2022 -23 \u00a3000's Climate Change Rapid Response Adaptation Programme 17,660 0 17,660 Private Rented Sector (PRS) 0 500 500 Total Independent Living Action 17,660 500 18,160 Total Housing Policy SPA 17,660 500 18,160 Building Safety 20,000 55,000 75,000 Total Building Safety Action 20,000 55,000 75,000 Major Repairs Allowance & Dowry Gap Funding 108,000 0 108,000 Residential Decarbonisation & Quality 0 72,000 72,000 Total Achieve Quality Housing Action 108,000 72,000 180,000 Total Housing Safety, Regulations & Standards SPA 128,000 127,000 255,000 Social Housing Grant 299,999 10,001 310,000 Land for Housing 0 10,000 10,000 Total Increase the Supply & Choice of Affordable Housing Action 299,999 20,001 320,000 Market Housing 0 10,000 10,000 Home Buy 0 2,000 2,000 Total Increase the Supply & Choice of Market Housing Action 0 12,000 12,000 Integrated Care Fund 40,000 22,340 62,340 Total Integrated Care Fund Action -21,808 20,000 Total SPA 381,807 32,533 414,340 Land Release fund 10,560 -560 10,000 Total Land Division Action 10,560 -560 10,000 Total Land Division SPA 10,560 -560 10,000 EXTRACT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE MEG TOTAL CAPITAL BUDGET 538,027 159,473 697,500 1 Equality and Social Justice Committee Date: 24 January 2022 Title: Scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget 2022 -23 Introduction The Draft B ludes spending plans for 2022 -23 to 2024 -25. This paper provides evidence to the Committee on the future programme budget proposals in relation to the Social Justice MEG as outlined in the Draft Budget which was laid on 20 December 2021 . Annex A provides a breakdown of the 2022 -23 Social Justice Main Expenditure Group (MEG) allocations by Spending Programme Area, Action and Budget Expenditure Line (BEL). Annex B provides c ommentary on each of the Actions within the MEG, including an analysis and explanation of changes between the Draft Budget 2022 -23 and the First Supplementary Budget 2021 -22 (June 2021). Financial Tables Detailed information in relation to individual BELs are provided in Annexes A and B. The table below provides an overview of the changes to MEG budgets between Final Budget 2021 -22 and Draft Budget 2022 -23. 2021 -22 \u00a3'000 2022 -23 Draft Budget \u00a3'000 Change \u00a3'000 % Change -24 Draft Budget \u00a3'000 125,177 Non Cash 101,846 110,355 Total Capital 16,887 17,000 113 0.7% 17,000 17,000 Budget processes We have undertaken the first multi -year spending review since 2015, this budget has a future that is stronger, fairer and greener at its heart. To inform the allocation of multi - year revenue budgets we undertook a new review process to align spending to t he new Programme for Government. We have sought to take an integrated approach to better understand the intersectional and unintended impacts of spending to maximise the impact of available funding. This budget outlines how we will continue to respond to the devastating impacts of the pandemic in widening inequalities and continue to target our financial levers where they can have the greatest impact to tackle socio -economic disadvantage. The current context has also highlighted a range of structural ineq ualities that existed prior to the pandemic which the funding we have outlined has been targeted to address. Tackling 2 poverty was one of the cross -Government themes which informed the preparation of the budget, with shared priorities discussed with Minist ers. The integrated approach has also been maintained in assessing the impact of our spending decisions that underpins the Strategic Integrated Impact Assessment of our Budget. This approach allows us to understand how we can target funding to deliver better outcomes through understanding how different needs and areas of impact intersect, particularly for those with protected characteristics, wh ile at the same time seeking to understand and mitigate against unintended impacts. For this 2022 -23 D raft Bu dget, we have included details of the impacts of spending decisions as part of the main narrative in chapters four and six with the economic and financial contexts outlined in both the Chief Economist's report and chapter two of the budget narrative. Within my own portfolio, I have made a number of allocation s that aim to tackle poverty and inequalit ies. These include allocations to the Discretionary Assistance Fund, the Basic Income Pilot and the Income Maximisation Scheme as well as allocations to the Equality and Community Cohesion budget to support a number of activities which aim to reduce inequalities. Details of these allocations are provided in later sections of this paper. COVID -19 allocations During 2020 -21 and 2021 -22 the Welsh Government has made allocations from reserves specifically to tackle the impacts of Covid -19. The UK Government ha s not provided an y Covid -19 related allocations as part of our 2022 -23 settlement and as such no further Covid -19 allocations have been made as part of this Draft Budget . It is clear that inequalities have been exacerbated by this pandemic and these inequalities will persist i nto the next financial year and beyond. As a Government, we have made allocations to alleviate these inequalities with additional supp ort provided for free school meals, the Childcare Offer, Flying Start and for homelessness services among others. Within my portfolio, I have made allocations to tackle socio economic inequalities to tackle poverty through the Discretionary Assistance Fun d by piloting a Basic Income Pilot and to provide support for Income Maximisations Services. I have made broader allocations to tackle other equalities through the Equality and Community Cohesion BEL. This will provide support for the implementation of the Race Equality Action Plan; Race Disparity Unit ; Disability Rights Taskforce; the implementation of the LGBTQ I+ Action plan for Wales and a review and implementation of the Advancing Gender Equality Action Plan . To tackle Violence A gainst Women Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence , I have also made a further allocation to support our new Strategy and Blueprint approach alongside our capital investment programme. Further details are provided below in respect of these allocations. We have al so built on the actions we took within our 2021 -22 Budget and continued to reflect the need to prevent harm to the most disadvantaged and prevent wider negative impacts on the people of Wales and the wider economy as a result of the pandemic by 3 protecting health and jobs, building a greener future and to create a Fairer Wales through tackling inequality in all of its forms. No specific Covid -19 allocations were made as part of this Draft Budget, although all allocations will be based on need and that will have taken into consideration continuing impacts of the pandemic. For example, f unding has been allocated to support the Disability Rights Taskforce and work to deliver our response to the 'Locked Out: Liberating disabled people's lives and rights in Wales beyond Covid -19' Report . Also in understanding that the pandemic will continue to have financial impacts on our most vulnerable citizens, we anticipate that demand for the Discretionary Assistance Fund is unlikely to return to pre -Covid levels and as a result have allocated an additional \u00a37m to this budget's pre -Covid baseline. The Third Sector Resilience Fund (TSRF) third round which operated in 2021 -22 was designed to not only help organisations to survive through the ongoing pandemi c, but also to help them to adapt to become more resilient in the future. The ongoing legacy of the TSRF is that third sector organisations benefiting from the funding will be more sustainable. Welsh Government is now encouraging departments to offer mult i-year grant awards. These enable organisations to better plan staffing and resources to help respond to the needs of their beneficiaries Advancing Human Rights The allocations within the Equality and Community Cohesion BEL will enable us to progress our human rights commitments in the extended Programme for Government. Further scoping work is underway to confirm the scope, scale and timing of next steps. This work is being undertaken in partnership with the Strengthening and Advancing Equality and Human Rights Steering Group . It is anticipated that any legislation will be for the latter part of this Senedd term. Any legislation will be consulted on and suppo rted by a thorough assessment of any associated costs. Equality and Inclusion Programme funding The current Equality and Inclusion Funding Programme will come to an end on 31 March 2022 . The programme was developed to support Welsh Government's Equality Objectives 2016 -20 and has seven main strands relating to race; disability; LGBTQ I+; gender; Gypsies, Roma & Travellers; Hate Crime; and Refugees and Asylum Seekers. Work to develop a new programme has been progressing. My officials consulted on the future of this programme at the start of 2021 . On 28 September I issued a Written Statement about the outcome of the consultation, which highlighted broad support for our aims and principles, but also the need for more engagement with stakeholders to enable us to achieve them . We have held two independently facilitated meetings with partners in November and December to co -construct the new programme. Thro ugh this process, we have identified core support which will be established from April 2021 and further areas which will be developed in partnership during the first part of 2022/23. 4 Well-Being of Future Generations Wales is unique in having made a promise that we will protect the interests of future generations as well as meeting the challenges of the present day. The initial Programme for Government published in June 2021 set out the 10 well-being objectives we are working towards this term, as w ell as outlining the steps we are taking to deliver these goals. Delivering these objectives will maximise our contribution to the well -being goals. This revised and extended Programme for Government maintains our commitment to these 10 well -being objectiv es. These objectives will allow us to deliver a more prosperous, more equal and greener Wales in line with the sustainable development principle, addressing the extraordinary challenges Wales's faces and creating a sustainable foundation for future generations to build on. Our commitment to these objectives is unchanged. This Budget is the first of this Senedd term and has been developed to underpin the commitments made within the Programme for Government to build a Stronger, Fairer and a Greener Wales. As outlined in Chapter 4 the allocations contained within this Draft Budget are aligned with Welsh Government's well -being objectives which lie at the heart of the Programme for Government to max imise the impacts of available funding aligned to the Well -being of Future Generations Act. As part of the 2020 -21 Budget, we published a Budget Improvement Plan for the first time. The Plan outlined our vision, including short and medium -term ambitions over the next five years, to improve the budget process using the Well -being of Future Generations Act (WFG Act) and the five ways of working to drive continuous improvement. We have committed to publishing the Plan annually to recognise the ongoing natur e of driving and sustaining longer term change. Our overall aim is that these planned improvements to the budget process will result in greater transparency in the annual Budget documentation to demonstrate how the Act has influenced budget decisions. This updated Plan continues to show how we have built, or plan to build, on this work in future years, including the measures we have undertaken during the current budget cycle. Our budget allocations will enable us to deliver our well -being objectives and help us maximise our contribution to the well -being goals. Community Support Officers The Programme for Government 2021 -2026 made a commitment to maintain the funding of 50 0 Police Community Support officers and increase this number by a 100. Based on the 2021 -22 costs of employing an additional 100 officers, we have allocated \u00a33.7m in 2022 -23 to fund this commitment. The Welsh Government is committed to help keep communit ies safe. Integral to Neighbourhood Policing Teams, PCSOs are the eyes and ears of their communities. They take a problem solving preventative approach to addressing issues within their local areas. The additional PCSO s will work within communities providi ng support to the most vulnerable and working with them , finding solutions on the ground for issues such as anti -social behaviour. 5 Basic Income Pilot The budget contains an allocation to enable the delivery of a pilot for a basic income scheme in Wales for a cohort of young people leaving care . This commitment is an extension of the social wage and the model of progressive universalism that the Welsh Government has followed for over 20 years. I have allocated \u00a35m in 2022 -23 and a further \u00a35m in 2023 -24 to meet the costs of this pilot. In 2024 -25, the costs of the pilot are expected to reduce to \u00a35m and therefore \u00a35m from the previous year's baseline has been reallocated to other priorities withi n the MEG. The purpose of the pilot is to ensure young people in the pilot get all the support they need to give them the best possible chance to make their way in life and the transition out of care bet ter, easier and more positive. A Basic Income pilot supports the aims of the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 to promote 'A Wales of cohesive communities' and 'A More Equal Wales'. Subject to the resolution of remaining practical matters, including the interface of our Basic Income Payments with the benefit system, I plan to introduce the pilot in the financial year beginning 1 April 2022. The pilot will be accompanied by a dynamic evaluation which will allow us to learn what is working for the participants, and what isn't, as we progress. I hope that by the end of this pilot we will be able to produce a set of recommendations which will be relevant to both care leavers and other gr oups who could potentially benefit. I also hope that the pilot will offer real -world deliverable ideas for financial wellbeing, emotional wellbeing, and pathways to education and employment. Discretionary Assistance Fund With individuals continuing to be affected by the pressures of Covid -19, individuals and families across Wales are turning to the Fund for additional support to help them with some of the financial pressures and challenges they are facing. As a result I have allocated an additional \u00a37m revenue in 2022 -23 which will be baselined throughout the budget period and will enable me to continue to support this ongoing demand to the fund. Continuing to provide funding for the DAF contribute s to the national w ell-being goals, including: A resilient Wales - the DAF is now referring its most vulnerable applicants to the Single Advice Fund (SAF), which provides advice on income maximisation, ensuring individuals are receiving the benefit support they are entitled to, and also debt advice. This promotes longer term financial stability for these individuals. A more equal Wales - the DAF provides support for vulnerable individuals to provide food, gas and electric in situations where they would otherwise be unable to. 6 Advice Services Investing in advice and income maximisation services tackle s inequality and promote s social justice for all. As a result I have allocated \u00a31.7m from 2023 -24 to expand the Single Advice Fund and complementary income maximisation activities . The funding will increase welfare benefit and debt advi sor capacity within the Single Advice Fund and enable the delivery of a range of national and local awareness raising initiatives. Advice service outcomes support several of the national well-being goals, including a prosperous Wales by helping people to maximise their income and build their financial resilience and a healthier Wales through reducing the stress generated by unsolved social welfare problems. Welsh Government's spending decisions on advice services is founded upon the five ways of working (sustainable development principle) . Through the Single Advice Fund , grant funding has been awarded to advice consortia who embraced Welsh Government's ambition for collaborative deliver y models that resolve a person's social welfare problem and offers them access to services that build their capability, developing their resilience to future social welfare problems occurring. Anti-Poverty Strategy I have allocated \u00a33m in 2024 -25 toward s the Anti -Poverty Strategy. The Supporting Communities budget line will also continue to provide \u00a31m revenue funding to support food banks. Under the Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010, Welsh Ministers have a statutory duty to develop and publish a child poverty strategy and set objectiv es for tackling child poverty. The current strategy was published in 2015. I am committed to refreshing the Child Poverty Strategy so that it better reflects the issues Wales is currently facing and the options ava ilable to us . In doing so, I will build on the findings from the Child Poverty Review and more recently the WCPP work, helping develop a more coherent framework for tackling poverty in Wales and help to maximise the impact of cross -Government interventio ns and ensure accountability. It will also include undertaking meaningful community engagement with children, young people and their families (as well as frontline workers with experience of working with families) with lived experience of poverty. Equali ties and Community Cohesion Revenue allocations to the Equalities and Community Cohesion BEL of \u00a34.6m revenue in 2022 -23, \u00a39.5m in 2023 -24 and \u00a312.7m in 2024 -25 towards the Race Equality Action Plan and o ther activities will contribute to the Welsh Govern ment's commitment to advance and strengthen equality and human rights, improving outcomes for people and contributing to a more equal Wales. This will be achieved through funding actions arising from the Race Equality Action Plan, the Disability Rights T askforce, the LGBTQI+ Action plan and commitments to further embed Period Dignity. There is a commitment to introduce legislation to incorporate specific UN Conventions into Welsh Law as well as taking specific actions in relation to legislation around Ban ning Conversion Therapy and devolution of the Gender Recognition Act. 7 The terrible fact that six out of ten deaths related to Covid 19 across the UK were disabled people led to the commissioning of research by the Welsh Government's Disability Equality Forum. The allocation, as noted above, will also enable support for the Disability Rights Taskforce and subsequent implementation of actions arising from its work, as well as the implementation LGBTQI+ Action Plan and further work to promote gender equality. Race Equality Action Plan The Covid Pandemic has brought into sharp relief where the deepest inequalities in society lie. Sign ificant work has been undertaken, in collaboration with stakeholders and delivery partners , to identify what actions are needed to address these. At the outset of the pandemic a concerning picture emerged around the impacts of Covid on Black, Asian and Min ority Ethnic people. The Welsh Government quickly established Advisory groups and subsequently brought forward the development of a Race Equality Action Plan for Wales. The plan sets out how Welsh government will achieve the First Minister's pledge to ach ieve an Anti -Racist Wales by 2030. Whilst many of the actions that are contained with the Race Equality Action Plan will sit within the portfolios of other Ministers, I have made allocations within my MEG to ensure we can establish accountability mechanisms (including the Accountability Group), deliver key actions around Gypsy and Traveller accommodation and homes, support individuals and groups working with communities and supporting across Government to ensure policymakers can access lived experi ence on an equitable basis. I will also establish a Race Disparity Unit as part of the Equality and Data Evidence Unit to guide our work and ensure we are developing interventions with the most significant positive impact. Equality Evidence and Data Un its To inform policy development, strategic and budgetary planning and the development of targeted interventions to address areas of deepening inequality I will establish an Equality and Data Evidence Unit. This will comprise of units focused specifically on race, disability and equality impacts. The Units will also ensure more effective evaluation of the impact of policies and decisions. Recruitment to the units will begin in Year 1 (2021 -22) with an allocation of \u00a31.695m with capacity and capability in creasing over the subsequent years. Support for the Voluntary Sector and Volunteering The pandemic has shown the importance of the third sector and the role it will play in ensuring that our recovery is fair and just. The WCVA and the 19 county voluntary councils across Wales provide the support infrastructure that ensures the third sector is well governed , resilient and sustainable . The voluntary sector in Wales works with many of our most vulnerable people and communities. It is trusted in a way that the public sector is not. It can reach people the public sector cannot and so ensure that they get access to the services they need. 8 The sector has played a vital part is supporting communities through the pandemic, into recovery and beyond. The programme for government commits us to continuing our strong partnership with voluntary organisations across the range of our responsibilities . As a result, t he Third Sector budget will increase to \u00a39.2 94m in 2024 -25 following an allocation of \u00a31.8m. This three year budget allocation allows Welsh Government to offer multi -year grant awards , enabling organisations to better use resources, develop partnerships and partnership working over the longer term. This collaboration will lead to better integrated service provision which in turn will allow earlier interventions and preventative activity. Third sector organisations work across Wales using the ir infrastructure to support the volunteers they recruit and mobilise to deliver against many of our polici es and priorities such as those contained in the Race Equality Action Plan. These organisations also make their contribution to the national well -being goals . Voluntary organisations w orking in the health and social care sector - alongside the NHS and local government contribute to better physical and mental health outcomes. (a healthier Wales) Access to help and advice from voluntary sector organisations from food -banks to educational charities contribute to better outcomes for children and families. (a more equal Wales) Voluntary sector organisations supporting minority ethnic groups, disabled people , and the LGBT QI+ community help to empower people. ( A Wales of cohesive communities). Employment programmes operated by the third sector can sometimes reach those furthest away from the jobs market. ( A more prosperous Wales). Violence Against Women Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence I have allocated a further \u00a31.050m revenue in 2022 -23 baselined into future years and \u00a32.1m capital in each of the three years to address issues of Violence Against Women Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence. Both the VAWDASV capital and revenue funding sup ports our statutory duty under the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (VAWDASV) (Wales) Act 2015 to eliminate all forms of VAWDASV in Wales. Under Section 3 of the VAWDASV Act 2015 Welsh Ministers must prepare and publish a National Strategy which sets out objectives and actions to achieve the purposes of the Act: prevention, protection and support of VAWDASV in Wales. The intended effects of the VAWDASV Strategy 2022 -2026 are to permanently change the culture and response to VAWDASV , improve support for victims and their children and to prevent offending and reoffending. In developing the draft Strategy, we have considered the national well-being goals and continued to apply the sustainable development principle (five ways of worki ng). The draft Strategy contributes to: A prosperous Wales through reducing the negative economic impact often associated with being a VAWDASV survivor; A healthier Wales through improving the physical and mental well -being of VAWDASV survivors and their families; A more equal Wales through ensuring VAWDASV survivors have support to encourage them to fulfil their potential; 9 A Wales of cohesive communities through awareness raising around VAWDASV and encouraging everyone to acknowledge that VAWDASV is not a cceptable; and A globally responsible Wales through the development of a central repository to collate VAWDASV -related data and research, with the aim of learning from good practice. Social Partnerships The Social Partnership and Fair Work allocation of \u00a30.238m in 2022 -23, \u00a30.435 m in 2023 -24 and 2024 -25 will support the introduction and effective implementation of the Social Partnership and Public P rocurement (Wales) B ill and further progress in delivering the Fair Work Commission recommendations for increasing the prevalence of fair work. The Bill will establish a statutory Social Partnership Council and introduce new duties in relation to social partnership, socially responsible procurement a nd the promotion of fair work. The additional funding allocation will support a range of activity to ensure effective implementation, including the development of statutory and non -statutory guidance; the roll-out of training sessions and webinars; communications activity and the develo pment of case studies, tools and resources. In particular, the allocation will support our ability to engage effectively with social partners; scale up interventions to encourage real living wage adoption and accreditation; improve the diffusion of info rmation, advice and guidance to individuals on their rights at work; communicate the social and economic benefits of social partnership and fair work; and enhance our contribution to tackling modern slavery and extreme forms of labour exploitation. Prog ressing the Fair Work Commission recommendations requires the development and delivery of wide ranging actions to increase the availability of and access to fair work. This funding will support our ability to scale up interventions to encourage real living wage adoption and accreditation; the diffusion of information, advice and guidance to individuals on their rights at work; the communication of the social and economic benefits of fair work; the promotion of access to trade unions as well as enhance our contribution to tackling modern slavery and extreme forms of labour exploitation. Formal reporting requirements in relation to social partnership, socially responsible procurement and fair work will be introduced and will provide transparency in relatio n to the progress made and the outcomes achieved. Intended outcomes include strengthened social partnership working that informs better policy -making and wider impact; an improve ment in the experience of work in Wales which will help make Wales a more app ealing place to live and work ; and improving the ability of public procurement to deliver genuine social value for people and communities in Wales. Public Bodies / Public Appointments All regulated public appointments in Wales include reference in th e application pack sent to all candidates to the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and the responsibilities those bodies subject to the Act have in relation to that Act. 10 The Future Generations Commissioner is a member of the Public Leaders Forum in Wales and is a regular contributor to the discussions held at that Forum, as well as a regular presenter on aspects of public bodies' responsibilities under the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. Community Bank Allocation The Welsh Governments policy development and private sector delivery of a Community Bank for Wales are developed in accordance with the sustainable development principle . I have allocated capital of \u00a31.5m capital for years 2022 -23 and 2023 -24, with \u00a31.75m all ocated for 2024 -25 to support the delivery of the Bank. The proposed delivery of the Community Bank of Wales by the existing private sector financial institu tion has been 'impact assessed' . A Community Bank for Wales will support the application of the sustainable development principle (five ways of working ) as follows: Long term - The Community Bank would address an immediate and on -going withdrawal of the retail banks from Welsh high streets. By establishing fixed financial relations with individuals and micro -businesses, it would engender longer -term thinking and planning, based on local priorities. Prevention - The Community Bank would help prevent the decline of local communities in Wales by mitigating the impacts of other banks branch closure s. Integration - The Community Bank has committed to work alongside the Welsh Government on many of its economic initiatives including 'Town Centre First' and 'Economic Hubs' and are to sign up to the economic contract. Collaboration - The Community Bank plans to work across the Welsh financial ecosystem, collaborating and partnering with local authorities, town/community councils, credit unions and other mutually -owned entities. Involvement - The provisions of mutuality (1 member - 1 vote) are at the he art of the Community Bank. The use of Member Forums are central to the bank's mission to be member -led. It will provide focus on financial well -being of members as part of delivery to enable members to thrive. Community Facilities Programme The Community Facilities Programme (CFP) has a budget of \u00a36.5m in 2022 -23, 2023 - 24 and 2024 -25. The CFP is a capital grant programme which provides grants for the improvement of well used and much needed community facilities - land and buildings. The CFP c an also be used to help communities take ownership of these facilities. The CFP helps communities to be greener. It provides grants to help with energy efficient heating, lighting, windows and doors or new technology such as solar panels. Fit for purpose community facilities mean that local people can access services within their communities, meaning they do not have to travel outside as often. 11 Community facilities contribute towards the national well-being goals as follows: Community facilities provid e an inclusive environment for the community to get together and socialise. They are a focus for community activity. (a Wales of cohesive communities) Community facilities help to prevent loneliness and isolation and can provide access to support losing weight, stop ping smoking or exercise. (a healthier Wales) Community Facilities provide volunteering opportunities, local jobs and training opportunities (a more equal Wales) . Fire & Rescue Services \u00a30.9m capital has been allocated in each of the three years for equipment to support the three Fire and Rescue Services' Safe and Well visits to the homes of our most 'at risk' citizens. It will fund complex fire safety equipment to prevent fires and other hazards from occurring, allowing these vulnerable citizens to live safely and independently in their own homes. This programmes contributes to the objectives of promoting good health and wellbeing and building healthier communities and more resilient environments in which to live. Gypsy Traveller Sites The Race Equality Action Plan is a key element in both the extended Programme for Government . The Gypsy and Traveller Sites Allocation of \u00a33.7m for 2022 -23, \u00a33.2m for 23-24 and \u00a33.4m for 2 024-25 provides the capital investment to deliver more and improved culturally -appropriate accommodation. Since we created the duty to identify and meet the need for appropriate accommodation within the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 we have seen well over two hundred new pitches either created, or refurbished, many on small, privately -owned family sites. There is a shortfall of some 100 Gypsy and Traveller permanent residential pitches across Wales as well as an established need for transit provision . This investment area supports our Local Authorities to deliver their statutory obligations to provide appropriate accommodation, as well as supporting the development of sustainable access to appropriate utilities and services for Gypsies and Travellers living on resident ial sites in Wales. During consultation on the Race Equality Action Plan we heard powerful evidence from Gypsies and Travellers about the barriers to new public and private pitches and about the need to use the knowledge and expertise of residents more e ffectively. The revised Race Equality Action Plan will commit to using capital allocations in more innovative ways, supported with revenue activity to revise guidance on the design and management of public sites, with support for those seeking to develop t heir own family sites. Supporting Communities Following the end of European Transition Funding, we will maintain the \u00a31m revenue funding in our revenue baseline which will build on funding provided in the previous three years to support an increased number of people facing food poverty. It will 12 support the strengthening community food initiatives across all local authorities in Wales, including a focus on activity that helps to address the root causes of food poverty. The capital funding of \u00a31m annu ally, will support organisations to boost their capacity to provide good quality, nutritious food to their customers. The revenue funding will be used in a variety of ways to suit the requirements of each authority area including, but not limited to, the d evelopment of projects such as social supermarkets, community cafes, lunch clubs and community cookery classes. There will be a focus on initiatives which help build community resilience and tackle the root causes of food poverty, such as the development o f community hubs which co -locate a range of support services such as debt and housing advice, holiday hunger schemes, community cafes, social enterprises and advice services, built around community food provision. Funding can also be used to address foo d insecurity, for example, through the development and strengthening of food partnerships with a view to creating healthy, sustainable local food systems. Review of the bodies subject to the well -being duty The financial implications of extending the list of public bodies under Section 6 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 will be assessed as part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment. Given the need to engage with all affected parties, and understand the implications on the additional publi c bodies, we intend to conclude the review by summer 2022. Future Generations Commissioner The Welsh Government received the Future Generations Commissioner's Budget Estimate for 2022 -23 on 29 October 2021 . It was a needs -based budget application, and i s currently being considered by officials who will advise the Minister for Social Justice on it by mid -January 2022. Poverty and gender inequality In 2022 we will publish the fin dings of r esearch undertaken by the Covid -19 Evidence Centre which will assist in work to refresh and re -prioritise actions within the Gender Equality Action Plan in order to address and mitigate the impacts of Covid -19 on gender equality. A number of allocations have been made through this Draft Budget specifically to tackle issues of women's poverty. Within my own portfolio, the period dignity grant fund will continue to be offered to local authorities in order to support our P rogramme for Government commitments to embed period dignity in schools and expand our period provis ion in communities and the private sector. Moreover, we have commissioned a process evaluation to ensure that future funding is directed most effectively in order to reach under -served communities. Our Period Dignity Strategic Action Plan, published for consultation in October 2021, outlines how we will expand our work on period dignity across communities. 13 The delivery of Chwarae Teg's core funding will , where possible , be aligned to the refresh of the Employability and Entrepreneurship plan. Chwarae Teg have undertaken research relating to the impact of COVID 19 on women , and those women specifically with caring responsibilities , as they have been adversely affected. Chwarae Teg work with a range of officials across Welsh Government in a variety of areas to provide advice, support and guidance on how the recommendations from the Gender Equality Review can be implemented. In total we will be investing an additional \u00a350m in suppor t for children, families and childcare over the first year of this budget, with further allocations in future years. This underlines our commitment to ensuring we give every child the best start in life. In the coming year we will be investing an initial \u00a33.5m in expanding the Childcare Offer as part of our commitment to support more parents in training and e ducation with childcare costs. We will also be working with key partners across the childcare and play sector, and within local government, on plans t o increase early year's provision for 2 year olds to be funded via the Children and Communities Grant. This investment, and these commitments, recognise both the importance of high quality early education and care provision for children's development, and the critical role access to affordable childcare plays in supporting parents, particularly mothers, into work. Evidence shows the majority of social care workers are women aged over 40, who are not financially independent despite being in full time work. Delivering improved pay through the introduction of the Real Living Wage will help to address low pay associated with the sector and increase the attractiveness of social care work. This delivers not only improvements for social care workforce, but improv ed workforce retention and outcomes for people receiving care and support. These actions will help reduce the inequalities associated with socio -economic disadvantage through having positive impacts on those on lower incomes, and this will form part of mor e detailed impact assessment considerations and evaluation. The Social Care Fair Work Forum is considering how to improve working conditions for social care workers across Wales. Equality and inclusion is core to the definition of Fair Work in Wales and t hese considerations will underpin the Forum's work. The Written Statement by the Mini ster for Health and Social Care confirmed the steps being taken to deliver the Real Living Wage for social care workers during 2022 -2023. Funding for this and in recognition of the wider pressures on social care services is being provided through the increased local government un -hypot hecated settlement. A major component of the delivery of care and support in Wales is provided by unpaid carers, often family and friends. Evidence from the Family Resource Survey (FRS) of gender inequality in the provision of unpaid care shows that women aged 55 -64 years are most likely to be carers and more likely than men to provide informal care across all age groups, except for age group 85 and older. Previous research has shown that women in their fifties are more likely to leave the labour mark et to provide unpaid care for family members than men. The fact that women are more likely to provide care means that they are more likely to face adverse employment effects associated with caring i.e. lower earnings and leaving the labour market. Similarl y, the 2011 census showed that women make up the majority of unpaid carers - 57% of carers in Wales are women and women of working age (25 to 64) are significantly more likely than men to be providing unpaid care to someone with a disability or illness or who is older. As such, the Welsh Government is investing funding in support for unpaid carers in relation to a number of areas such as the provision of short breaks and respite and development of a young carer's ID card. This work sits alongside ongoing in vestment of circa \u00a31m in 14 support for carers through local health boards, relevant projects under the Sustainable Social Services Third Sector Grant, and support via Regional Partnership Boards. Working Wales is the Welsh Government's approach to deliverin g free, impartial, employability and careers advice tailored to an individual's needs and circumstances. The service, delivered by Careers Wales, provides professional careers information, advice and guidance for individuals aged 16 and over, by undertakin g a needs -based assessment, including barriers to employment, and referring the individual to appropriate support. The service provides a national entry point to employability support, which supports and complements existing channels. This is available to women. The Wales Union Learning Fund is delivered through 18 Union projects and support for learning is available to the workforce in Unionised workplaces. The projects have responded positively to the Covid 19 pandemic by shifting learning from a face to face environment to on -line learning which over time has resulted in an increased uptake in learning. In some workplaces, face to face learning is beginning to return. We are currently in the process of assessing bids in order to award funding to Union s to run the new programme of delivery which will commence in April 2022. It has a strong focus on equality issues including gender equality. A skills competition provides an opportunity for individuals or teams to compete against one another to demons trate their talent in a particular vocational skill, using tasks derived from real life, industry -based scenarios. Each individual's work is scored by experts to an agreed criteria, and the highest score(s) go through to the next stage of the competition. Competitions operate across Wales, up to UK and international level. The Inspiring Skills Excellence in Wales project uses skills competition as a way of evolving to inspire and elevate young people's aspirations to achieve excellence. This includes br eaking down gender segregation issues. As part of the work to grow apprenticeships we will be giving consideration as to how to target under -represented groups to work in the sector, for example this could be through ring-fencing degree apprenticeships fo r only under -represented groups or through targeted awareness raising as part of communications. Research specifications will also include data gathering relating to equality and inclusion. There is also an interface between learning on apprenticeships pro grammes and the R ace Equality Action Plan social care goals relating to access for workers and better outcomes for people. An integrated impact assessment will be undertaken on the work and this will consider in further detail impacts on the basis of intersectionality as well as opportunities to promote equality and inclusion. Women's experience in the criminal justice system In 2021 -22, an additional allocation of \u00a30.5m was made to take forward the work of the Female Offending and Youth Justice Blueprints , increasing the budget to \u00a31.075m which has been baselined into 2022 -23. The additional funding has enabled the continued support of the Women's Pathfinder Whole System Approach and 18 -25 Early Intervention Service, which aims to improve outco mes for women coming into contact with the criminal justice system in Wales, by delivering a women specific, multi -agency, integrated package of support . 15 Welsh Government are also co-funding the 'Visiting Mum's' project with the HM Prisons & Probation Service, which will help strengthen and maintain links between Welsh women in the secure estate and their chil dren. The equalities implications of the use of data and data justice Welsh Government recognises that investing in robust evidence can support the targeted and appropriate use of resources to tackle inequality and promote social justice for all. The Welsh Government have committed to c reate a Race Disparity Unit and a Disability Disparity Unit alongside an Equality Data Unit to ensure an inclusive evidence base to inform decision making in government and across the Public Sector . The Units will work to improve the coherence, consistency, use and availability of equalities evidence on Wales . The work will also enable Welsh Government to address the National Statistician's Inclusive Data Task Force recommendations at a Wales -level. Both Units will be funded from the allocation made to the Eq uality and Community Cohesion BEL. Domestic violence and the safety of women in public places The Draft Budget allocation for VAWDASV 22 -23 is \u00a37.87 5m revenue, an increase of \u00a31.050m from 2021 -22 baseline, and \u00a32 .2m capital funding. Grant funding contributes to all of the VAWDASV National Strategy objectives and meets Welsh Government commitment on carrying out the purposes of the VAWDASV Act 2015. We have made a commitment through the Programme for Government to Strengthen the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Strategy to include a focus on violence against women in the street and workplace as well as the home . Intended outcomes are f or Wales to be the safest place for a woman or girl, and t hat no - one should suffer or die from domestic abuse and sexual violence. The strategy will be to: change public attitudes to VAWDASV through awareness raising ; Increase awareness in children and young people of the importance of safe, equal and healthy r elationships ; Increased focus on holding those who commit abuse to account and supporting those who may carry out abusive or violent behaviour to change their behaviour and avoid offending; Make early intervention and prevention a priority ; Relevant prof essionals are trained to provide effective, timely and appropriate responses to victims and survivors; and, Provide victims with equal access to appropriately resourced, high quality, needs led, strength based, inter -sectional and responsive services acros s Wales . Our Programme for Government also commits us to \"Expand the 'Ask and Act' and 'Don't be a Bystander' training and awareness campaigns \". As per the VAWDASV Act 2015, there is a statutory requirement to train relevant authorities and professionals fulfilled through Welsh Government's Ask and Act training framework. Prevention lies at the heart of the National Strategy of which the expansio n of 'Don't be a Bystander' awareness raising campaign is a key deliverable , more specifically outcomes will be to ensure: 16 Relevant professionals are trained to provide effective, timely and appropriate responses to victims and survivors ; and, Change public attitudes to VAWDASV through awareness raising . Immigration and European Citizens' Rights under the terms of UK withdrawal from the EU In recent years, we have provided funding to a range of organisations to ensure EU Citizens could receive the advice and support they need to apply for Settled Status and address any inequalities they may be experiencing in Wales. In 2021 -22 this included \u00a3600k for the EU Citizens Rights project (which provided funding to Citizens Advice Cymru, Settled and included training and communications costs) and \u00a3174k for Newfield's Law to provide complex legal advice for appeals . The UK Government 's Settled Status scheme ended on 30 June 2021 but we have continued to provide funding to these organisations until the end of March 2022 to resolve issues arising and support late applications to the scheme. We are currently considering what the most app ropriate level of required funding will be beyond March 2022 but we anticipate reductions in the level of support provided. The EU Citizens Rights Project will end on 31 March 2022 but we think some continued support for EU Citizens will remain. We antici pate this will cost approximately \u00a3200 - 250k in 2022 -23. The support for EU Citizens in 2022 -23 is set against other emerging migration support needs which have been identified. Since 2019, we have been able to draw in funding from the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for our ReStart: Refugee Integration project but this w ill end on 31 March 2022 . The ReStart project has been crucial in ensuring the operation of 'ESOL Hubs' in Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham . These Hubs perform a vital role in ensuring everyone who comes to Wales can acquire language skills as quickly as possible to support integration. Due to the loss of AMIF (as a result of EU Withdrawal) we will need to explore whether ESOL Hubs can continue to be funded through Wels h Government budgets. Additionally, Wales is now home for a number of Afghan and Hong Kong families due to recent UK Government visa and resettlement pathways which have been established. We are anti cipating that an additional \u00a32.3 m will be made availabl e as part of a future Supplementary Estimate though this has yet to be confirmed. We will then be seeking to utilise this as part of our work in this area. Health inequalities, healthy life expectancy and lifestyle Current measures to address health inequalities are embedded across all activity both as part of the strategic planning required by the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ('the 2015 Act') and through our 'health in all policies ' approach (supported by the Health Impact Asses sment ('HIA') process). Consequently it is not possible to disaggregate the specific budget which is allocated to tackling health inequalities from the totality of government spending. However, specific examples of government spending which contribute grea tly to tackling health inequalities include interventions such as the Welsh Government's Flying Start Programme which has 17 received an uplift through the Children and Communities Grant in the Finance and Local Government MEG. The 2015 Act continues to be a n important driver guiding our Budget considerations and we have continued to embed the 2015 Act's five ways of working in our approach and the processes that support it. We have over recent years taken an integrated approach to impact assessments, which i ncludes consideration of children's rights, reflecting their protected characteristics under the Equality Act, as well as taking into account the impact of decisions and policies on social, economic, cultural and environmental well - being, as set out within 2015 Act, as well as sustainability and the Welsh Language. Further details on our approach to assessing impacts will be available alongside the Draft Budget to be published on 20 December. Our experience in dealing with the COVID -19 pandemic has laid b are the costs of tolerating health inequalities in our communities in the disproportionate impact we have seen of the pandemic on the less well off in Wales. This experience has highlighted the importance of tackling the causes of these inequalities with r enewed urgency and heightened ambition. As such, we are continuing our focus on prevention and early intervention. We have maintained the \u00a37.2 m allocated for Prevention and Early Years funding and will be shifting its focus to ensure it is targeted towards the two leading causes of avoidable death in Wales: obesity and smoking. Using this funding, we will support projects across Local Health Boards which: in conjunction with Public Health Wales, support the rollout of inpatient smoking cessation support in all Local Health Boards; support a reduction in the number of people smoking in pregnancy and support cessation; support prevention work in the obesity and overweight space, in line with the Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy and meeting existing popul ation health measures. Alongside this work, as referenced above, continued investment in interventions such as Flying Start contribute greatly to the prevention and early intervention agenda through making a decisive difference to the life chances of chi ldren in the crucial early years phase in the areas which it runs. Good quality and affordable housing Good quality and affordable housing positively impacts on physical and mental health, education, employment and indeed every aspect of a person's life. This is why Wales has never moved away from its support for social housing. The Minister for Climate Change has made significant allocations through the Climate Change MEG to meet housing needs. Living well in a quality home brings a wide range of benefits to health, learning and prosperity supporting the government's wider agenda for improving outcomes in health and wellbeing and educational attainment as well as on poverty and decarbonisation. Good quality housing impacts positively on health and wellbeing, helping reduce pressures on health and other public services. For example, investing in improving energy efficiency in new and existing housing can help to reduce fuel po verty and reliance on benefits, with every \u00a31.00 spent on energy efficiency estimated to save around 0.42p in health costs. 18 Poor quality or overcrowded housing can have a detrimental impact on children and young people in terms of physical and mental wel lbeing and educational outcomes. Children living in acutely bad housing are also 20% more likely to attend hospital A&E departments than other children. Investment in housing delivers good social, economic, environmental and wellbeing outcomes for people and communities in Wales, creating homes and places to support vibrant communities where people can live well. Delivering high -quality, warm, secure and energy -efficient homes for people who need them most, helps reduce the negative impacts of poor quality or unaffordable housing and fuel poverty. Whilst we know the causes of homelessness are complex, we know that at their root are issues of poverty and inequality. We know that social housing in Wales plays a key role in addressing homelessness, supporting some of our most vulnerable individuals, and that good quality accessible and affordable housing ensures people can sustain their tenancies and thrive. It can positively impact on health, mental health and education. Additionally, investment s in housing with care and adaptations puts in place primary prevention measures to mitigate the health, social and economic inequalities of some of the most vulnerable groups in society e.g. people in frail old age, people with dementia, children and adults with physi cal and learning disabilities, and children with complex and higher needs (physical, neurological and behavioural). The Welsh Government also recognises the important role of the private rented sect or in meeting housing need. The Minister for Climate Chan ge has inve sted in programmes to increase access to and affordability of the private rented sector through a national leasing scheme which invests in property standards, links rents to benefit rates and offers longer term security and social landlord suppo rt and management. Additional investment has been made in discretionary housing payment budgets to ensure local authorities can support individuals and families to meet the costs of private rental. Currently, \u00a3108m per annum is spent via Welsh Housing Qua lity Standard (WHQS) to support social landlords to provide good quality warm social homes, to some of Wales' most vulnerable households. 1.4m homes are responsible for 27% of all energy consumed in Wales and 15% of all our demand -side Green House Gas (GHG ) emissions. The retrofitting of these homes is a primary preventative measure as it seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes to reduce their carbon emissions to enable Welsh Ministers to meet legally binding carbon targets. WHQS and the Optimised Retrofit Programme (ORP) aim to maximise Welsh Government levers by focusing on social housing where there are significant financial levers that can be deployed to accelerate decarbonisation activity. We have begun to deliver these p rogramme in social housing and the Private Rented Sector and Owner Occupier Sectors will follow. Investment in social housing decarbonisation retrofit will generate capacity and skills and develop approaches that other tenures can benefit from. We are a lready working closely across Government departments to create appropriate programmes and policies for private tenures which compliment, rather than duplicate activity in social housing. This involves close working to remodel the warm homes programme, and develop a successor to ARBED which finishes this financial year. Investment in WHQS and optimised retrofit across Wales' housing must be seen against the backdrop of significant benefits to well -being, cost savings in services and local economic growth. I nvestment in over a million homes this decade has the potential to generate large economic returns as well as reducing our emissions and levels of fuel 19 poverty. The inclusion of low carbon within the 20,000 new social homes in the social sector enables us to ensure the homes built will be kinder to the climate, warm and affordable and help tackle fuel poverty. Since 2010 to the end of March 2021, more than \u00a3394m has been invested to improve home energy efficiency through the Warm Homes Programme, benefitti ng more than 67,100 lower income households. These improvements are reducing the energy bills of lower income households by an average of more than \u00a3300 annually. The Arbed 3 contract ended on 3 November 2021. Since April 2018, the Arbed 3 Scheme will ha ve delivered domestic energy efficiency improvements to more than 4000 lower income households. Lower income households will continue to benefit from home energy efficiency improvements delivered through our Nest scheme. Th is will run until spring 2023. We are launching a consultation on the next iteration of the Warm Homes programme. The consultation will start not later than December 2021. During 2020 -21, Welsh Government invested \u00a320.1m in the Nest scheme, with 90% of installations completed by Wales -based installers, including 23 apprentices working on the scheme. Nest provided 15,557 households with free, impartial advice and signposting to a range o f support services. 4,559 of the 15,557 households received a package of free home energy efficiency measures such as a central heating system, a boiler or insulation. These improvements are estimated to have saved households an average \u00a3305 on their annua l energy bills. Benefit entitlement checks resulted in a household average \u00a32,091 potential increase in benefit take -up. Additionally, combined Welsh Government and European investment of \u00a315.7m in the Arbed scheme in 2020/21 resulted in 1,032 homes bein g improved through 22 schemes in 12 Local Authority areas installing 5,050 measures. These improvements are saving bill payers an average \u00a3327 on their annual energy bills. The f uel poverty policy (and the plan to tackle fuel poverty) sits with the Minister for Social Justice , while domestic energy efficiency funding (which funds the Warm Homes Programme) sits with M inister for Climate Change . 20 Annex A Resource Budget -
