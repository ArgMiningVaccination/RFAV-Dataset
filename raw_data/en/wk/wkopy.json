The stubborn lower back pain I have suffered from for years, causing me to constantly be aware of my resulting poor posture, is PRETTY MUCH GONE. The changed outlook on life itself is a remarkable byproduct of the \"cure.\" [youtube.com/channel/UCPC...](/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCPCyxGrQzKworv-1ahf1lVA%2Fvideos&s=124b14c83c6a3cab78430beb52bc1b056757a428ad9132a8aa8a4448819bb793) - 4/7/2023 I was a client having regular appointments at mind body with Dr Chev. However as time went on I got increasingly frustrated with the billing at the clinic. For example it's April of 2023 and I received a text reminder this week that I had a remaining balance from my last appointment in August of 2022. Keep in mind I pay my co-pay at every visit before my appointment begins. On top of that in August of 2022 I paid an additional $80 to cover \"co insurance\" costs. After speaking with Liz at the reception desk she told me they have been auditing their records and realizing that patients were being undercharged and the billing team has been replaced. I believe that people in the world are honest and good by and large. Im not accusing anyone of being dishonest but it's very frustrating. I have seen multiple chiropractors over the years and never had this experience. I will not be returning under any circumstances. - 9/20/2022 They will undoubtedly call you many months after your visit to claim insurance didn't cover the charges, or that your copay was not properly charged and then tell you that you have a bill that is due from a visit 6-8 months ago. The written bill that I got many months after the visit was even a different amount than what they said was owed when I called it pay it out of pocket just to not deal with them anymore... clearly they do not know what they are doing when billing insurance. Know this prior to your visit and expect to deal with it months after the fact. - 1/20/2020 I have been trying to find a good chiropractor in the Seattle area for a few years, and I'm so grateful to have finally found Dr. John Chevigny. I hurt my lower back so severe it was difficult to walk, and with just a couple visits I felt back to myself. He took the time to listen and evaluate me, before adjusting, as well as doing soft tissue work. He didn't rush through, which was so refreshing. I have already recommended him to several friends! - 9/11/2018 Dr. John is the nicest guy you'll ever meet. He has a gentle nature and a strong arm that can pop anything back into place. I've been to multiple chiro's in Seattle and he is by far my favorite. Intuitive, caring and obviously doing what he was meant to do, I highly recommend him! - 8/30/2019Updated review Dr. John and his staff do amazing work on healing the body from injury. I highly recommend anyone who needs chiropractic or massage therapy to visit, even if you don't have any physical pain. I've learned so much about my cervical spine, deep tissue injuries, and overall well being. It's a very pleasant place for treatment.3/29/2019Previous review Nicole, John and Michelle are helping me with great care to recover from whiplash in a traffic accident (I was T-boned while driving with the right of way at an unmarked intersection). Their care and commitment has made such a difference in getting back to what I used to feel like. I'd highly recommend taking the time to see or talk with them for any soreness or pain issues. It's so great to have this care in my neighborhood! - 3/9/2017 I am late in my pregnancy and have experienced severe lower back pain, to the point where I could barely walk and was in constant pain. I have been seeing Julie for massage and she has been so wonderful - working with me to treat my pain with massage and making sure she is addressing my massage needs! It has helped SO much! I have also seen Maria when Julie wasn't available and she was awesome too! They are all so sweet and have been super accommodating with scheduling and meeting my needs. The massages are so great and they really know what they are doing! I highly recommend going here!! - 3/7/2017 Went to see Jennifer for some back pain that was referring to my shoulder and jaw. I had never been to a chiropractor before. She was gentle and it really helped. I felt so much better overall after seeing her. She also took my regency insurance which was great. - 1/12/2019 Maria is an incredible massage therapist. She has helped me resolve injuries and pain I've lived with for years. I thought things would never improve, but she has made a huge difference in my wellbeing. She's amazing at troubleshooting the problem and super sweet and kind as well. Love her! - 9/9/2009 I've been to a few chiropractors in the past, and this has been my favorite so far. I've been to both Natasha Whittaker and Jennifer Londergan and love them both. Natasha is my usual chiropractor, and I love that she's friendly and easy-going enough that we can talk about things aside from my back pains. (Jennifer too...they're both great!) I'm so pleased and thankful for this place as my back & neck have felt the best it's ever felt since I started coming here. I also love the fact that they have no qualms against giving you a mini massage if you completely need it before they start adjusting you. It makes the whole adjustment easier and it feels SO good.
