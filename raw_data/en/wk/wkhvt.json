Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a form of undernutrition that increases the risk of disease and mortality from severe infections, including diarrhoeal disease and measles. VAD is also the leading cause of child blindness and can lead to night blindness in pregnant women. VAD is a concern in many countries, notably in Africa and South-East Asia.
