Recline back and rejuvenate as you listen to the soothing sounds of the crystal bowls, tingsha bells, chimes...and more. You will be led through a Yoga Nidra body scan during the sound bath which will help balance your chakras. All practitioners are welcome to attend for this mindful practice. About the Salt Cave When entering the salt cave you will be surrounded by 10 tons of pink Himalayan salt. Once you step foot into the cave you will feel the crushed salt that lies beneath your feet as you walk. The salt generates negative ions which help purify and balance your body's ratio of negative to positive ions that are also beneficial for the respiratory system. Price: $40/person. Registration is required. What to bring: please bring a pair of clean white sox to help keep the salt cave pure. *Due to limited space, no refunds may be granted but you may gift your pass to a friend. Register now as space is limited to twelve students. REGISTRATION REQUIRED "}
