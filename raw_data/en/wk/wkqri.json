This research hastwo goals: 1)making machines more useful and 2)understanding intelligence. This concerned with the firstgoal. Thecomputer programs withwhich AIisconcerned areprimarily symbolic processes continually face indealing with theworld. Thisform ofproblem solving differs markedly from scientific areprimarily numeric innature ofpossible Intelligence Primarily symbolic processes Heuristic search (solution steps implicit) Control structure usually separate from domain knowledge Usually easy tomodify, update andenlarge Some incorrect answers often tolerable Satisfactory answers usually acceptableConventional Computer Programming Often primarily numeric Algorithmic (solution steps explicit) Information andcontrol integrated together Difficult tomodify Correct answers required Best possible solution usually sought *Also sometimes referred toasmachine intelligence orheuristic programming. Therelationship dependent arealways branch points. Thus, oneofthe usual ways ofrepresenting problem thenumber of branches atthebottom can gettobeenormous forproblems Therefore, toefficiently search thetrees. Initially, there were\"blind\" methods forsearching approaches solution pathwould notbetriedmore thanonce.However forproblems more complex thangames and puzzles, these approaches were inadequate. Therefore, rules of thumb (empirical rules), referred toas\"heuristics,\" enor- mously. Representation Early of reasoning, build when hastobe brought tobearonaproblem, methods areneeded toefficiently model Common Sense problem solving method. However, solution convergence proved tobedifficult withcomplex problems, resulting ina formulating expert systems, andbasicprogram- ming aids. Principal AIApplication Areas Based onthese basic elements, Nilsson identified four principal AIapplication areas (shown theouter ringofFigure 1-1.) Natural Language Processing (NLP) NLP isconcerned with front ends tocomputer programs, computer-based speech understanding, textunderstanding andgeneration, and related applications. Adetailed overview ofComputer Vision computer programs for their solutions areneeded.

Figure II- 1listssome ofthekeyAIactivities the first initial activity involved attempts atmachine translation. Itwasthought thatnatural language translation could be readily accomplished using abilingual dictionary andsome knowledge ofgrammar.

Resolution, ifthehypothesized conclusion indeed followed from agiven setofpremises, wasoneofthe early golden hopes ofAIforuniversal problem solving bycomputer. resolution, Green (1969) devised ageneral-purpose, question-answering system, QA3, thatsolved simple problems in anumber andchemistry.

Then, appropriate operators could bechosen toreduce these differences, resulting innewproblem states closer tothegoal states. The usedwould thenform thesolution become excessive forthemore difficult problems. AIproved muchmore difficult than originally expected. By1970,AIhadhadonly limited suc- cess.

Thus knowledge representation isespecially central toexpert systems, computational vision, andnatural language understanding. Representation schemes are classically classified into declarative and procedural ones.
