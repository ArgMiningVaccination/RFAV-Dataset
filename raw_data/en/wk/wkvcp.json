Be Safe and Courteous to Others While masks are no longer required in California, it is important to check the levels in your community to determine your risk before heading out. [See risk level in your community \u00bb](https://covid19.ca.gov/safely-reopening/) For your protection, wearing a well-fitting mask is strongly recommended when indoors. For the safety of others, especially those who are pregnant or immuno-compromised, stay home if you have any of the following symptoms: - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fatigue - Muscle or body aches - Headache - Loss of taste or smell - Sore throat - Congestion or runny nose - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea Mega Events: Indoors and Outdoors Mega events are defined as events that attract crowds of greater than 1,000 indoors and greater than 10,000 outdoors. These large crowds pose a risk of substantial and severe COVID-19 outbreak. We strongly recommend wearing a mask when you attend such occasions, including concerts and sporting events. Read guidance from the [California Department of Public Health \u00bb](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Beyond-Blueprint-Framework.aspx) Travel and Destination Guidelines Before You Travel It's smart to consider your destination and activities in terms of possible exposure to COVID-19, even when traveling domestically. We recommend wearing masks on public transportation and inside transportation hubs. Visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html) for more recommendations on domestic travel. [Check the CDC U.S. COVID Data Tracker \u00bb](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days) If you are traveling internationally, you can see which countries have the highest risk for COVID-19 on the [CDC COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html) map. While You're There When you travel to a foreign country, you must follow the rules of that country. If you test positive for COVID-19 while abroad, the rules of that country might require isolation in a hotel or hospital. If you are traveling with family members or a group, plan for what will happen if one person tests positive and others do not. Many travel insurance companies offer policies that cover the costs of isolation periods and COVID-19 treatments in other countries. Flying into the United States Requirements for travelers returning to the United States are subject to change. Before you enter the country, be sure to review the CDC Travel Requirements.
