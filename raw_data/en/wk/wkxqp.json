It's as if we have all forgotten about things that come from nature and how important they can be to our healing. Living in a world where simple swipes on a smart phone connect us to someone thousands of miles a way, brings food to our door steps, reads our heart rate. It can be easy to get lost in technology. But, we inherently miss nature and our natural selves leading many people into a huge rediscovery of herbal medicine, astrology, holistic health, intuitive readings, energy work, etc. It is apparent that we are all looking for something more. I teach folks in my monthly workshops that gua sha is a way to upgrade your skincare routine not just because of its beauty benefits but because it gives you the opportunity to be present with how you feel and to connect with your body. Something that as an acupuncturist, I am always trying to teach. The fact that facial gua sha brightens the complexion, increases circulation, sculpts, de-puffs and smoothens is really an added benefit. So many people ask about the properties of the stones that my facial tools are made of. Much like herbal medicine, stones and crystals are substances with energetic properties too. Some are even listed in our Chinese herbal materia medica like amethyst and selenite. To get more info, I consulted my friend and crystal expert, Trisha Solsaa to come up with this quick guide in hopes that it will assist you in choosing your [facial tools](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site/). Trish has been interested in the healing properties of the natural world around us since childhood. Over the last several decades, she has collected knowledge of differing modalities, including reiki, crystal healing, sound therapy, meditation and accessing the Akashic Records for healing and general inquiries. Her belief is really that the crystal or process picks you and that there is a co-creating of what your self ultimately needs. The work is shared and these tools help one formulate the needed response to emotional, spiritual, mental and physical gaps by aligning the vibrational frequencies to promote repair and growth. Rose Quartz is a favorite among all! Trish describes it as \"a stone of gentleness, unconditional self-love and love for others, compassion, acceptance and healing around all matters of the heart.\" A heart shaped gua sha tool, mushroom set or facial roller made of this stone might be just what you need to love on your skin with. It is the softest self care EVER. Adding some rose quartz to your skincare regimen will make you FEEL the beauty you already possess. Amethyst has always felt much more substantial on the body. It is \"a stone that purifies, stabilizes and recognizes what patterns need to be shifted in one's life, granting inner peace with grace\", says Trish. Rolling your skin with amethyst might be what you need during life transitions. Use it at the end of the day for spiritual protection and good sleep. Fluorite gua sha tools are a cute butterfly shape and help with \"clarity, discernment and decision making,\" Trish explains. \"It assists in revealing one's soul purpose and clears the path of obstacles for you.\" Use it when you're studying new material, preparing for a new job or for those graduating school or another program. Lapis Lazuli \"is the stone of royalty, the personal attributes of power, self confidence, fortune and wisdom all while being in connection with others, the greater collective,\" says Trish. Super charge your skincare routine with a lapis roller or gua sha tool before a big event. It'll give your complexion that extra glow. Sodalite, Trish advises is \"a stone that aids honest awakened communication with others and one's own truths, abilities and beliefs.\" A sodalite facial roller or mushroom set might be a great gift for the teachers, managers, facilitators, and counselors in your life. I love a sodalite mushroom set for those who hold tension around the third eye. Agate is the stone I think of when I need grounding. Trish says, \"In any form, agates offer comfort, protection, confidence and tenderness. It revitalizes the physical body and centers one's spirit.\" Try an agate facial roller in the evening, after a hectic day or in the morning before a packed schedule. Using this roller helps those who are prone to rushing, slow down and be present. Nephrite Jade, Trish calls it \"the abundance manifesting stone that encourages strength, renewal, endurance, wisdom, financial and spiritual growth.\" This gua sha tool is my new favorite! Not just because it makes me feel lucky but because it keeps me inspired and this particular tool has different edges that are made for sculpting jawlines and cheek bones. Tiger's Eye [facial rollers ](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site/product/tiger-s-eye-facial-roller/250?cs=true)feel soft yet strong. Trish advises that it is \"a leadership stone that helps one balance and harmonize extremes, bringing wisdom and seeking truth.\" This stone will help you find that middle ground. Red Jasper [rollers ](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site/product/red-jasper-facial-roller/248?cs=true)are for the skincare routines of the fierce. Trish says it is \"the stone of gradually building strength, courage and insights. It balances while grounding, all while connecting one to the Earth.\" Picasso Jasper according to Trish's expertise is \"a stone of inspiration, creativity. It encourages bigger dreams and positivity.\" Using [this roller](https://emily-grace-acupuncture.square.site/product/picasso-jasper-roller/249?cs=true) in your skincare routine might just be the thing for your creativity blocks. Cleansing and Charging Your Stones For those of us that are sensitive to shifts in energy, cleansing and charging stones is something you might have already be doing. For energy workers, starting with a clean field is important. Trish explains that, \"crystals attune to the energies that they are working with and need to be cleared/cleaned of whatever debris it took on. It's like a dirty window, the light can still get through, but the light is stronger when the glass is cleaned of the accumulated films of dirt. Crystals, like all of us, work better when they are in their optimal, clean state. Charging a crystal is giving it a bit of a jump start, like revving up an engine, pushing it past it's natural vibration.\" Personally, I have always been confused about the difference between clearing and charging so I asked Trish about it in more detail. She clarifies that, \"clearing and charging stones are done the same way, the difference is the energetic intention setting that one does to the stone, whether it is to clear it or to supercharge it with specific intention. You can clear/charge stones with reiki, with sunlight, full moon light, sound therapy, burying the stone in dirt, in salt, herbs, in organic brown rice, rinsing or soaking in water, saltwater, sacred smoke, setting a stone on top of another stone, like selenite, black kyanite, blowing on it with your breathe, shaking the stone. Not every way is equal in the amount of time it takes and not every stone can be cleared with certain processes, for example, selenite dissolves in water, citrine and amethyst fade in sunlight, and others have chemical reactions with salt.\" Contact [trishsolsaa@gmail.com](mailto:trishsolsaa@gmail.com) for services and rates How Do I Choose My Facial Tools? Gua sha tools are what I recommend the most because they allow you to do the most, and in the most detail. The different shapes, and sizes are really dependent on your preferences. I advise choosing a tool that is comfortable for you to hold and it should feel good in your hand. The tools I offer are a variety of what I like to use. They typically have a long edge and a grooved edge for sculpting. Tools that have pointed edges are good for light acupressure. Tools with a cerated edge or \"teeth\" are good for light massage on tight areas. These techniques require sound instruction and can be learned in my [monthly workshops](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/workshops). Facial rollers are easy and fool-proof. You don't need much instruction to use them but you won't be able to do all the things that a gua sha tool offers. What I do really like them for, is using them to roll sheet masks while watching Netflix. They can also aid in the absorption of serum products. Mushrooms are popular among those with forehead tension and tight jaws. Refrigerate and use them in a circular motions. I enjoy using them to apply serums and lotions in this way. It feels like a relaxing dreamy ice cream massage for a tense face. Learn more in my monthly [Facial Gua Sha Workshop](https://www.emilygraceacupuncture.com/workshops)!
