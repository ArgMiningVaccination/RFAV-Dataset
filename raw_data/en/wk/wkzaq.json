Worms (intestinal)ABORTION 1 Etiology : Spontaneous abortion is defined generally as happening before the 20th week of pregnancy (early abortion: before 12 weeks and late abortion 12 -20 week), or of a fetus with a weight of less than 500 gm. 10- 15% of pregnant women will spontaneously abort their fetus. Many time the fetus is grossly deformed, or has genet ic abnormalities that make it incompatible with life. Therefore, it is theorized that a spontaneous abortion may be a natural selection process for rejecting those fetuses that are biologically unfit for life. Most spontaneous abortions occur w ithin the first trimester (often due to fetal maldevelopment). Spontaneous abortions in the second trimester seem to be due more to maternal factors (i.e. incompetent cervix; congenital or acquired abnormalities of the uterine cavity hypothyroid ism; DM; chronic nephritis; acute infection; trauma to the pelvic region; or severe emotional shock. Habitual aborter is a woman who has had 3 or more consecutive spontaneous abortions. Spontaneous abortions may be: 1. threatened (bleeding and/or cram ping in the uterus within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy), inevitable 2. inevitable (intolerable pain or bleeding that is threatening the mother's well -being) 3. incomplete (only part of the conception is passed) 4. complete (all products of conception have passed, the uterus is normal sized and the cervix is closed) Signs and Symptoms : The woman is pregnant (may not know) and is experiencing: 1. pain, cramping and bleeding from the uterus 2. passage of some or al l of the products of conception Lab Findings : 1. serum HCG Course and Prognosis : 1. should be checked by a physician or midwife to make sure all products of conception have passed 2. watch for signs of infection 3. all abortions must be completed 4. offer whatever psychological counseling/processing she needs to help through the miscarriage 5. in the case of a threatened abortion a. woman should have bed rest b. avoid intercourse c. undertake appropriate treatment Differential Diagnosis : 1. determine the cause 2.

ABSCESS 1 Definition : An encapsulated collection of pus in a localized infec tion with tissue destruction and swelling or a cavity formed by liquefaction necrosis within solid tissue; abscess of organs such as the brain include their own set of symptoms. Etiology : 1. direct implantation (i.e. penetrating wound) of and organism. 2. spread from other infection via blood or lymphatic transport. 3. breakdown of natural barriers allowing organisms to travel from non -sterile body areas to sterile cavities. 4.

The thickening leads to the impacting of sebum and keratin and eventually causes follicle rupture, producing an inflammatory reaction responsible for the formation of papules, pu stules and cysts. b. Other factors include: oil -based cosmetics, improper diet and food sensitivities, assorted compounds (i.e. corticosteroids, halogens), industrial pollutants (i.e. coal tar derivatives, chlorinated hydrocarbons), oral contraceptive age nts, fatigue and stress, poor skin hygiene, chronic irritation (i.e. football helmet straps, backpack straps). 4. generally begins at puberty due to androgen production causing changes in the size and activity of the pilosebaceous glands. a. acne in females can be related to low pituitary function at mid -cycle.

The withdrawal syndrome is defined as \"unpleasant physiologic changes that occur when the drug is discontinued abruptly or when its effect is counteracted by a specific antagonist.\" (Mer ck) It may be metabolic or psychological. Signs and Symptoms : 1. most all patients undergoing withdrawal of their substance of abuse will crave that substance in the initial phases.

Tuberculinum or Bacillinum : 200c once a week for 8 weeks ALCOHOLISM (also see Addiction [withdrawal]) 1 Definition : 1. alcoholism is the physical and emotional dependency on the use of alcohol 2. removal of alcohol will cause physical and emotional symptoms of withdrawal 3. needs the alcohol in the bloodstream in order to feel \"all right\" otherwise pain will develop phys ically and emotionally (internal belief or feeling that such dependence is somehow right and natural) Etiology : 1. largely unknown 2. genetic, familial tendencies, biochemical factors, sociocultural pressures are all associated 3. the development of al coholism has two distinct elements: a. physical : based on a combination of physiological damage incurred and compensatory adjustments developed as a result of the continued use of alcohol 1. develops at different rates in different individuals and effects vary widely (any human who drinks enough alcohol over time will become an alcoholic) 2. it is difficult to predict where any given individual may be on the scale b. mental/emotional : based on the desire of the patient to reduce awareness of their own internal discomfort through the anesthetic effect of alcohol 4. alcoholism is known in all parts of the world and is a fundamental disease of western civilization 5. some sources suggest that most alcoholics have a decreased ACTH production so they have no stamina or endurance 6. hypoglycemia with a strong epinephrine compensation is found in almost all cases (only thing which will calm down the adrenaline and go with the sugar is alco hol) Signs and Symptoms : There are 31 symptoms of chronic alcoholism, the following are the main ones: 1. tremors 2. blackouts 3. mood swings upon ingestion of alcohol 4. protecting supply (many alcoholics can hold a job long after they have lost eve rything else including their family) 5. a loved one or associate telling the patient they drink too much 6. gulping drinks 7. hiding supply 8. denial According to research, if alcoholism is: 1. chronic: a person may never drink again 2. primary : othe r emotional problems will not be responsive until the alcoholism is arrested 3. progressive : even after the person stops drinking, the disease progresses; it the person drinks again, much later, the disease is manifested as if they had been drinking all a long 4. fatal: in the absence of treatment, the disease leads to insanity or death CAGE : 1. Cut down 2. Aggravated 3. Guilty (about drinking) 4. Eye opener (to start day) *if alcoholism is suspected and a person has had a drink in the last 24 hours odds are in favor of them being an alcoholic Lab Findings : 1. increased : GGT, anion gap, MCV 2. decreased : serum magnesium and glucose, cholesterol 3. stomatocytes (transien t) 4. AST/ALT ratio > 1 (with AST > 300mU/mL, identifies 90% of cases with alcoholic liver disease) 5. AST to 300 with normal ALT favors alcoholic liver disease Course/Prognosis : 1. aspect of dependency is, initially, it takes more and more alcohol to attain the desired effects but later takes less a. may be due to liver damage or to impaired psychological function 2. coarse of the disease: a. neutral is represented by a mid -line b. drinking alcohol allows a person to move above the mid -line toward euphoria with a small price to pay (perhaps),on the next day, falling below the line into mild discomfort or pain c. as the condition progresses, the person may travel higher into euphoria but falls below the neutral (mid-line) and it takes more alcohol to attain the same level of euphoria as previously d. finally, the person is so far below the line that they need to drink to keep from feeling pain; to feel normal ALCOHOLISM (also see Addiction [withdrawal]) 2 3. denial : is a hallmark symptom or condition of the disease a. denial of having a problem with alcohol prevents the person from taking successful action against it b. denial may come in the form of \"generalizing\" the condition to avoid specifically stating how bad things are or \"minimizing\" the extent of the problem 4. \"hitting bottom\" : the person feels enough pain that their walls of denial are cracked a. at this point the person is often ready to receive the kind of help that is available, in whatever form it takes 5. recovery rate is poor even among people who s eek help a. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is as successful as any treatment program and there is no fee Differential Diagnosis : 1. differentiate the signs and symptoms which may mimic other diseases 2. quite frequently severe emotional problems underlie al coholism Treatment [see Addiction (withdrawal)] ALOPECIA 1 Definition : 1. hair loss 2. types: a. alopecia areata : idiopathic, non -inflammatory loss of circumscribed areas of hair on scalp, beard or eyebrows b. alopecia congenitalis : absence of all hair at birth c. alopecia marginalis : loss of hair at the hair line; more commonly seen in blacks; may be secondary to seborrheic dermatitis d. postpartum alopecia : temporary diffuse loss of hair at the termination of pregnancy e. trichotillomania : loss of hair from being pulled out by the patient, usually a nervous or neurotic condition Etiology : 1. idiopathic 2. endocrine disorder 3. autoimmune disorder (i.e. SLE) 4. systemic disease 5. pharmacotherapy toxicity 6. menopause 7. dermatological disorder 8. tissue damage 9. adverse effects of hair preparations Signs and Symptoms : 1. may follow the patterns mentioned above therefore note the extent, borders, condition of exposed skin, follicles, etc. 2. signs and symptoms of associated disease may be present Lab Findings : 1. check endocrine function (esp. thyroid) 2. check for auto immune disease Course/Prognosis : 1. depends on etiology a. temporary alopecia following febrile illness or postpartum will usually recover fully b. autoimmune conditions or normal aging may be irrecoverable c. trichotillomania is often difficult to cu re until the neurotic cause is established and treated Differential Diagnosis : 1. alopecia areata 2. 5. trichotillomania Nutrition : 1. increase silicon rich foods (alfalfa, comfrey, young horse tail, nettles, onions, kelp), seeds, nuts, oats, buckwheat, barley, sesame seeds, rye, millet, rice, goat milk as yogurt or kefir, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, brewer's yeast, wheat ger m Preparations: 1. peel fresh ginger, dip into brandy and rub all over the scalp (bid) 2. mix onion juice and castor oil and apply to scalp, cover and leave it on overnight (every night for 2 weeks) 3. mix 3 oz cayenne pepper with 1/5 Romanoff Vodka or pure alcohol, tincture for 2 weeks shaking bottle every day, then strain through cheese cloth, rub small amount into scalp twice a day.

ARRHYTHMIA 1 Definition : Abnormal heart rhythm. Normal sinus rhythm originates within the pacemaker cells of the sinostrial (SA) node at the junction of the superior vena cava and high right atrium. These cells represent the primary electrical generator (pacemaker) for the norma l human heart. The impulse generated here travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, then to the rest of the myocardium. Conduction of impulses is a complicated series of events; all of the conductive tissues and nodes of the heart contain cells capable of spontaneous depolarization. Cardiac arrhythmia generally represent other tissues assuming the role of pacemaker. There are often complications. Etiology : 1. can result from damaged conductive tissue in the heart being placed under stress 2. cause s are diverse (coronary artery disease, hypertension, drug reactions, endocrine abnormalities, myocardial disease, rheumatic fever, metabolic derangements, etc.) Signs and Symptoms : 1. may include: a. sensation of heart irregularity, skipping, extra beats b. associated dyspnea; or other symptoms associated with cordiac insufficiency c. changes in pulse rhythm, rate, heart sounds d. symptoms and signs associated with underlying condition See: Tachycardia/bradycardia Lab Findings : 1. EKG: abnormal (generally definitive and provides the initial differential) Course/Prognosis : 1. depends upon the type of arrhythmia' some are normal, some are benign, some are medical emergencies Differential Diagnosis : 1. sinus bradycardia (bpm < 60) 2. sinus tachycardia (bpm > 100 in adult, often due to decreased vagal tone) 3. sinus arrhythmia (heart rate changes cyclically and regularly, usually increasing on inspiration and decreasing on expiration; normal finding , most common in the young) 4. sick sinus syndrome (inadequate sinus node function most commonly associated with cerebral manifestations of lightheadedness, dizziness and syncope) 5. premature depolarization a. of the atria: se nsation of a \"skipped beat\" or flutter b. of the ventricles: similar sensation; often seen in cardiac failure 6. paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (heart rate races to 100 -200 bpm with 1:1 A -V conduction maintained) 7. atrial flutter (continuous electrical activity produces an atrial rate between 240 -400 or about 300 bpm) 8. atrial fibrillation (continuous and chaotic re -entry of electrical impulses within the atrial myocardium) 9. multifocal atrial tachycardia (multip le areas of enhanced automaticity within ordinary atrial myocardium) 10. His bundle rhythms (enhanced bundle rhythms) 11. ventricular tachycardia (100 -200 bpm; succession of premature ventricular contractions; usually associated with arteriosclerotic hea rt disease but can occur in many conditions) 12. ventricular fibrillation (irregular and chaotic ventricular arrhythmia with a rapid rate and disorganized spread of impulses throughout the ventricular myocardium; ventricular systole becomes an uncoordinat ed event; mechanical activity cannot occur and cardiac output falls to zero; fatal if not terminated immediately; associated with acute myocardial infarction) 13. heart block (spread of cardiac electrical excitation is slowed or interrupted in a portion o of the normal conduction pathway) 14. ventricular pre- excitation (a form of accelerated A -V conduction, resulting from two A- V conduction pathways) See: Tachycardia/bradycardia Nutrition : 1. magnesium rich foods 2. potassium rich foods 3.

Yerba Santa : when relieved by expectoration ATHEROSCLEROSIS (also see Angina) 1 Definition : Intimal thic kening of one or many arteries due to localized accumulation of fatty material (atheromas) Etiology : 1. most important kind of arteriosclerosis 2. atherosclerosis sequelae are the major cause of mortality from illness in the US (at least 33%) 3. diseas e seems to favor blood vessels of high importance (cardiac, kidney, cerebral) and the peripheral arteries (causing much morbidity) 4. mechanism theory: a. lining of blood vessel is injured from turbulence, hypertension, hypoxia, hyperglycemia or free ra dicals b. this causes smooth muscle cells to proliferate at the lesion site to initiate regrowth of tissue c. LDL attaches to the smooth muscle cells to stimulate them to multiply d. but the uptake of cholesterol (a major component of LDL) into the inti ma leads to the formation of an atheroma that is later hardened by calcium deposits 5. other implicated factors include: a. hydrogenated oils (including partially hydrogenated oils) are significantly atherosclerotic. They are unsaturated oils which have been heated, pressurized and then chemically altered with nickel (or a similar metal) resulting in a changed biochemical formation from the nat ural \"cis\" formation (liquid at room temperature) into synthetic \"trans\" formation (solid at room temperature). It is suggested that the synthetic quality of the trans oil creates damage to body tissues causing atherosclerotic formation or cancer. Further more, polyunsaturates allow significant formation of free radical compounds, thought to cause endothelial damage and predispose to formation of atheromas. Epidemiological research shows that people were eating high cholesterol diets for hundreds or thousa nds of years (meat, cream, butter, eggs, lard) and yet the epidemic of heart disease began only earlier this century, after the introduction of hydrogenated oils. Of course, this is one among many other contemporary factors related to heart disease, inclu ding pollution, sedentary lifestyle, refined sugar and flour products and poor meat quality due to chemicals, hormones, antibiotics and other additives. Almost all the long-lived, healthy communities where degenerative disease and heart disease were unknow n included significant meat or dairy in their diets. It seems that the argument that cholesterol alone is the villain in heart disease falters at the evidence of those communities. It now seems that use of monounsaturated oils such as olive and canola, and moderate use of short -chain FAs (butter) may be the best way of maintaining \"healthy\" fat intake. 6. risk factors : a. high blood pressure b. DM (hyperglycemia) c. cigarette smoking d. obesity e.

(+) cardiac angiography for occluded coronary arteries (definitiv e) Course/Prognosis : ATHEROSCLEROSIS (also see Angina) 2 1. best treatment is prevention 2. control/prevention of atheroma development: a. weight loss b. dietary counseling and nutritional supplementation c. exercise programs d. cessation of smoking e. control of blood pressure and blood sugar 3. epidemiological evidence strongly supports the claim that it is a \"disease of affluence\" which is relatively absent in culture with different dietary and lifestyle patterns 4. recent research demonstrates that appropriate dietary and lifes tyle treatment many substantially reduce intimal plaques, confirming the empirical evidence gathered by naturopathic physicians and others that symptoms resulting from the presence of atheromas may be ameliorated or reversed entirely in patients undergoing treatment. However, while there is now considerable evidence supporting those treatments, there is controversy over the extent to which sufferer will comply with such actively participant regimes.

(+) Candida culture of stool Course/Prognosis : 1. most conditions of untreated intestinal toxemia will cause various degrees of low-grade morbidity in the patient 2. however, it will often act as the predisposing factor for the development of chronic disease 3. treatment, through bowel cleansing, diet adjustments and supplementation can correct the intestinal condition and lead to disease reversal 4. it is important to emphasize that many traditional and alternative schools of medical thought and training have long recognized the connection between bowel toxemia and the development and reversal of chronic disease 5. recognizing the key role of digestion and toxemia in the pathogenesis of the \"chronic diseases of affluence\" may be one of the major elements in addressing many of the health care issues presently facing society Differential Diagnosis : BOWEL TOXEMIA (Intestinal Dysbiosis/Intestinal Flora Imbalance) 2 1. since bowel toxemia may un derlie a wide variety of clinical and sub -clinical conditions, it needs to be considered and ruled out in many of these, specifically GI complaints should be ruled out where GI symptoms are a significant part of the clinical picture Nutrition : 1. eating principles: a. increase all green vegetables b. high fiber diet c. enhance stomach acid 2. therapeutic foods: a. asparagus, cherry, cucumber, dandelion greens, watercress, foods high in chlorophyll, green vegetables, foods high in vitamin A, foods hi gh in acidophilus and lactobacillus b. garlic and onions Remedies: a. 1 Tbsp.

Candida albicans is a yeast that is present in the intestines normally in very low concentrations 2. it is a n opportunistic microorganism, able to proliferate only if improper intestinal (and possibly, systemic conditions) allow its growth 3. contributing factors include: a. Hx of antibiotic use : particularly with a history of repeated administration but can f ollow a single broad -spectrum course; antibiotics kill not only the disease -causing bacteria but also the beneficial bacteria in the intestines; Candida is no longer limited by high concentrations of normal bacteria flora and is able to proliferate b. Hx of high sugar intake : sugar directly feeds the Candida organisms and promotes their growth c. Hx of high ingestion of certain foods from : yeast (breads), fermented foods and food upon which yeast/molds can grow (ie. mushrooms); it is suggested that these foods may help the growth of yeast cells d. lowered immune system or poorly nourished patient : these patients will not be as effective in blocking the growth of Candida if the conditions develop for its increase; the same factors that can cause Candida t o proliferate (ie. high simple sugar intake) are the same factors that will decrease the patient's immune system 4. the incidence of Candida overgrowth seems to be rising in our society in parallel with the widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of e ven minor conditions, their hidden ingestion through food source (esp. beef and chicken) and the excessive intake of high -sugar foods. If appears that C. albicans elaborates antigens which stimulate IgA activity and other immune mechanisms. Cross- reaction s create immune responses to other yeasts and molds which are subsequently ingested Signs and Symptoms : 1. Hx of gas and bloating, irregular stools 2. fatigue, lack of concentration, drowsiness, esp. after eating; the patient often complains of chronica lly feeling tired and of having low energy 3.

Also, characterized by the repetitive, compulsive habit of eating a normal or excessive amount of food on ly to self -induce vomiting and or use laxatives in an effort to purge what has been ingested. The patients generally know that their behavior is abnormal, yet have a great fear that they cannot control the bingeing; when they are finally done eating, they feel markedly depressed and guilty. Low self - esteem may follow; with a negative view of themselves and their bodies - setting into play the next cycle of bingeing/purging. Etiology : 1. cause unknown; factors that may be responsible include: a. hypothalamic p roblem b. psychiatric disorders (ie. depression) c. peer pressure d. nutritional deficiencies e. cultural and/or family attitudes about the body [bingeing patients have a higher incidence of dysfunctional families than in the general population, notably families with affective disorders, alcoholism and recreational drug use] 2. may be related to hypoglycemia where sympathetic compensation is interfering with gall bladder function 3. eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa (to which bulimia is closely related) a re on the increase in western society; it is estimated that 18 -25% of college women have on or both of these problems 4. the typical patient is White and female (males account for only 5% of patients) and come from a middle or upper class family; rare in lowe r socioeconomic person and in Blacks and Asians 5. binge eating generally occurs daily, with one study showing that in 40 bulimic patient the mean times of bingeing per week was 12 (with a range from 1 to 46); eating period usually lasted 1.2 hours, though could go on for as long as 8 hours; caloric consumption could be extremely high: up to 50,000, though the average amount of calories ingested was 3,500 6. five most favorite food items eaten: a. ice cream b. bread c. candy d. donuts e. soft drinks 7. patients are often ashamed a nd embarrassed about their eating and purging habits and live a life of secrecy, to the extent that friends and family are unaware of the patient's problems Signs and Symptoms : 1. depression: with possible suicidal tendency 2. near normal weight with a history of fluctuations 3. amenorrhea in about 50% of women 4. wound or scars on dorsal aspect of hand due to scraping hand against teeth when putting it down throat to initiate vomiting 5. dental caries from stomach acid in vomit and from high intake of sweet foods 6. consti pation based on chronic laxative use (dependency on laxatives for defecation) 7. insomnia Lab Findings : 1. hypokalemia with metabolic acidosis due to vomiting and laxative use 2. may see low zinc status 3.

DM e. polycythemia Signs and Symptoms : CVA 1. symptoms also depend on the arteries injured: a. middle cerebral artery : contralateral hemiplegia; aphasia b. internal carotid artery : same as middle cerebral artery c. anterior cerebral artery : uncommon; contralateral hemiplegia; poor grasp reflex and urinary changes in consciousness; dysarthria; dysphagia; this type of stroke is often fatal TIA 1. sudden onset 2. symptoms last from 2 -10 minutes gener ally 3. symptoms expression is related to which arterial system sustained the injury: a. carotid artery : unilateral paresthesias; or blindness; bilateral weakness and paresthesias of the limbs; may cause the person to fall to the ground (\"drop attacks\"); slurred speech Lab Findings : CVA 1. lab not usually necessary; clinical diagnosis is typically adequate 2. rule out polycythemia, anemia, infections 3. x-ray (chest): to rule out lung tumor and CV problems 4. CSF: usually normal, may be bloody 5. angiography: to identify the site of the injury 6. CT scan: to differentiate ischemic stroke from intercerebral hemorrhage, hematoma TIA Doppler sonography 2. (+) angiography Course/Prognosis : CVA 1. course or prognosis is unknown du ring the early days, unless death occurs 2. about 35% of patients of neurologic damage depends on the patient's age, state of health and size and location of the stroke 3. it is unusual for total recovery to occur but the sooner improvement is seen, the better the prognosis for minimal deficits CEREBROVASCULAR ACCICENT/TIA 2 4. any deficits present after 6 months is likely to be permanent but neurological retraining programs appear to be having some success 5. further CVAs are common TIA 1. treatment should be directed to correcting any present risk factors, such as lowering cholesterol or hypertension 2. anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors or resection of the artery are other conventional treatments Differential Diagnosis : 1. migraine 2. convulsive seizures 3. neoplasms 4.

Leptandra : enlargement of liver, painful on palpation, vertigo with sleepiness; profuse diarrhea with dark blood 6. Myrica cerifera : headache in temporal and frontal area; bitter taste with terrible nausea which is < after eating and > walking 7. Podophyllum : pain in epigastrium with distension and sense of vacuum there in; great thirst for water; diarrhea painful, green watery, too profuse, fetid, expelled like water jet (explosive); alternately constipated CHOLELITHIASIS/BILIARY COLIC Jason Schnieder 1998 1 Definition : Gallstones are precipitated bile in the gallbladder (GB). They may be soft or may be hard and even jagged. If they block the duct, the pain is generally exquisite. The pain of a GB attack is termed biliary colic. Etiology : 1. very common (10 -20% of p opulation in over -developed countries) 2. 1 million new cases diagnosed/year 3. 20% of people over 65 years have stones 4. affects women more than men Risk factors : 1. female : (2:1 female to male in Caucasians); esp. certain Native Americans, 75% incidence in Pima, Hopi and Navajo; North, Central and South Americans 2. fat: obesity, hyperlipidemia, rapid weight loss 3. forty: advancing age 4. fertile : sex hormones; OBC and pregnancy increases HMG CoA reductase activity which increases cholesterol uptake and synthesis 5. stasis: pregnancy, prolonged fasting, parenteral nutrition, spinal cord injury all increase the concentration of bile 6. acids: decreased bile caloric intake b. refined carbs: reduce bile acid production c. high saturated:unsaturated FA intake d. decreased frequency of meals: increase cholesterol sat uration e. low fiber, esp. water- soluble types: decreases bile acid production and increases deoxycholic acid production which makes cholesterol less soluble in gall bladder bile; soluble fiber carries deoxycholic acid out in stool as well f. vegetarian diet protects g. food allergies: food elimination prevents gall bladder attacks Bile salts : 1. formed in the liver from cholesterol (some cholesterol is secreted with bile salts) 2. when considering stone formation, one must review solubility of fats and water, saturation points and so on 3. cholesterol, lecithin and bile salts form micelles (tiny globules) which are soluble in water 4. under certain conditions, stones precipitate out and can become problematic Gallstones are thought to be caused by : 1. high concentration of bile 2. increased cholesterol in bile 3. inflamed epithelium in the bladder and ducts which allow inappropriate absorption of water and nutrients causing precipitation of stones on the walls 4. obesity 5. family history 6. Western diet (low fiber and high in refined carbohydrates and fat) Dumping syndrome : 1. seen in some patients with: a. partial gastrectomy b. cholecystectomy c. ileal bypass d. other malabsorption syndromes (lactose, gluten or sorbitol intolerance, radiation induced, other foods allergies, etc.) 2. diagnosis by: a. history usually Signs and Symptoms : 1. most cases are asymptomatic 2. RUQ abdominal pain or epigastric, colicy pain due to transient cystic duct obstruction) 3. pain referred to lower tip of the right scapula 4. pain is steady 5. (+) Murphy's sign 6. onset: after eating fat or oil and usually in evening 7. palpatory pain under the liver where the GB lies 8. N/V common 9. reflex points: a. T6, T7 of spine, just lateral to the TVPs (tenderness) CHOLELITHIASIS/BILIARY COLIC Jason Schnieder 1998 2 b. LI4 on R hand c.

[300% of normal]) and steatorrhea 5. gastric acid test [G+W] 6. US: usually cannot readily determine the size of stones [Marz] Cour se/Prognosis : 1. this is often a chronic condition but may be ameliorated in some patients by addressing the inciting factors for stone formation 2. the characteristic pattern is long asymptomatic periods with occasional acute attacks of colic 3. Clofib rate: drug which decreases cholesterol conversion to bile acids (reduces 7 -alpha hydroxylase activity) and also increases HMG CoA reductase which increases biliary cholesterol levels 4. most common complication is cholecystitis (see cholecystitis) Differ ential Diagnosis : 1. renal colic 2. cardiac complaints 3. low grade GB infection 4. costochondral (anterior rib) injury or strain 5. GI ulcer and/or other GI complaints Nutrition : 1. eat as little as possible or short fast 2. increase vitamin C foods 3. increase fluids 4. low fat diet 5. high fiber intake (foods high in water soluble fiber: flax seed, pectin, guar gum, oat bran, mucilage) 6. vegan diet 7. hypoallergenic/rotation diet 8. lever cleansing foods greens, black radish, water chestnuts, beet tops, pearl barley, watermelon, grapefruit, radish, apple, tomato, olive oil, celery Remedies: a. liver flush [Marz]: A. pre-flush: drink a lot of apple juice for 5 days and cutting fat consumption way down, eat as much fresh fruit as possible; 2 days before the flush, the patient should take 500 -800mg of magnesium and 30 drops of Dioscorea tincture TID -QID B. flush day : the patient takes 2 tsp. disodium phosphate in warm/hot water after lunch, repeat the disodium phosphate 2 hours later, the patient should drink a big glass of grapefruit or other citrus juice for dinner (that's all); at bedtime the patient should drink 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil along with 1/2 cup lemon or grapefruit juice, then go to bed and lie on their R side with the R knee pulled up to the chest [if any cramping occurs for an extended period of time, another dose of Dioscorea can be taken C. next morning : the patient should take 2 tsp. of disodium phosphate in 2 oz. of hot water 1 hour before breakfast; flush can be repeated in 2 weeks if necessary b. take 120g of walnut kernels and deep fry in oil until crisp, add sugar and grind into a paste; SIG: use over a period of 1 -2 days, a little at a time c. grind together into a powder, equal quantities of black pepper and sodium sulfate crystals; SIG: infus e 3g in water and drink qd Avoid : 1. food intolerances, allergies 2. nuts, hot sauces, spicy foods, fried foods, fatty foods, rich foods, salty foods, heavy protein foods, cow's milk and other dairy products, vinegar's, white bread, refined foods, processed foods, sugar, sweets, shellfish 3. catarrh forming foods: tofu, meat, ice cream 4. alcohol, coffee 5. caffeine 6. animal products CHOLELITHIASIS/BILIARY COLIC Jason Schnieder 1998 3 Supplements : -if gall bladder is removed, decreased ability to absorb fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) therefore supplement -trypsin can be irritating to an inflamed gastric mucosa -cholescystectomy: there may not be an adequate supply of readily available bile, therefore, may need to supplement it with meals 1. vitamin C ( with cholesterol gallstones) (1g TID)[G+W] 2. vitamin E 6g qd): may normalize the abnormally low phospholipid : cholesterol ratio associated with cholesterol ga llstones [Marz] 5. essential FAs (3 -5g QD for months) [G+W] 6. 6 monitor thy roid function [G+W] 10.

EBV is in a family of viruses which may create lifelong latent infection in the host after recovery from the acute infection c. Signs and symptoms of CFS are similar to that of mononucleosis 2. however, it proved difficult to achieve consistent results among pati ents and until recently, determine the presence of a reactivated infection by blood titers. Now other viruses have been implicated in the disease: a. cytomegalovirus (CMV): produces a disease similar to mononucleosis that usually strikes older people b. toxoplasmosis 3. as a result, the disease is now known as chronic viral fatigue syndrome (CVFS) or chronic fatigue immune disorder (CFID) 4. reports of a prolonged and recurrent mononucleosis -like disease surfaced in the 1940's and 50's, yet it is still far from being a clearly studied or accepted syndrome 5. it is suggested that CFS patients may have poor glycogen storage, Candida with dysbiosis, hypersensitivities and a hx of hepatitis or mononucleosis Signs and Symptoms : 1. fatigue: a. the degree may be mild (being able to perform at work or home but easily fatigued from it) or it may be intense (causing patient to give up their jobs and greatly curtailing other activities) b. sometimes they may be bedridden and slight activities such as housecleaning or going for a walk may necessitate a recovery period of 2 -3 days c. usually more strenuous exertion and exercising are impossible d. frequently, though, patients have alternating periods of fatigue and normalcy e. disease usually begins gradually with the fatigue slowly growing until it becomes overwhelming 2. recurrent pharyngitis 3. HEENT lymphadenopathy 4. Recurrent h/a 5. Chronic low -grade fever 6. Myalgia and/or arthralgia 7. Inability to concentrate 8. GI upset 9. emotional upset and/or depression 10. may have a hx of allergies, difficulty sleeping, weight loss or gain Lab Findings : 1. panel testing different titers of causative agents agents ws accurate diagnosis of present, chronic active or inactive infections but severity of symptoms do not always correlate with the lab findings 3. some patients with extremely high titers for a particular agent may be symptom -free while other with low tite rs may be extremely symptomatic 4. may see decreased WBC count, increased lymphs or atypical lymphs on peripheral smear Course/Prognosis : 1. this disorder is not well recognized by most conventional physicians despite empirical evidence and clinical research 2. conventional treatment involves suppression and/or palliation of symptoms (ie. salicylates for fever, h/a and myalgia) 3. with no fur ther diagnosis or treatment the patient is likely to have bouts of remissions and exacerbations that may develop into a constant, persistent disease 4. appropriate diagnosis and treatment lead to excellent recovery rates in most sufferers who comply 5. very few cases are refractory to treatment Differential Diagnosis : 1. conditions that cause abnormal EBV: specific serologic tests (possibly produced by suspected cases of chronic mononucleosis) 2. primary or secondary immunodeficiency conditions 3. Hodgkin's or non -Hodgkin's lymphoma 4. SLE 5. AIDS 6.

Depending on the patient an d situation, constipation can be used to describe difficult stool passage requiring straining, small and/or hard stools, infrequent defecation or a feeling of incomplete defecation. The degree of infrequency which defines constipation is subject to varied medical opinions; naturopathic physicians define healthy elimination as daily at minimum. (see Bowel toxemia) Etiology : Acute : 1. represents a distinct change for the patient and usually indicates an alteration in diet and/or lifestyle, strong stress or an organic cause 2. in patients with no obvious cause and where the constipation is quite recent, a mechanical bowel obstruction should be investigated 3. causes of acute constipation: a. adynamic ileus : which is often seen with intra -abdominal disea se, after a traumatic injury and as a result of general anesthesia b. as a side -effect of drug use hydroxide, tumors (when the constipation is persistent for weeks or is gradually getting worse) d. anorectal pathology : herpes simplex outbreak, fissure, etc. Chronic : 1. normal frequency should be an easy, full movement at least once daily 2. factors influencing regul arity and ease of stool passage include: a. diet b. cultural attitudes c. individual colonic health and activity d. insufficient dietary fiber and roughage e. sedentary lifestyle f. ignoring deification urges g. frequent travelling 3. the voluntary suppression of the urge to defecate may arise in the child from stresses around toilet training (see Encopresis, course/prognosis) or in the adult from unaccustomed surroundings, unpleasant toilet facilities, a \"too busy to spot\" lifestyle, m edications or conditions requiring confinement to bed 4. as the bowel becomes chronically full, the patient becomes less aware of rectal distention, although associated symptoms such as excessive flatulence, bed breath and h/a may be problematic. Negativ e feedback then occurs as the constipated patient finally has a bowel movement that proves to be painful, unsatisfactory and necessitates straining. The patient may become even more adverse to defecation because of the discomfort and the situation worsens (constipation to painful stool passage to more constipation) 5. often chronically constipated patients become frequent, dependent laxative abusers, until their bowels can no longer have a movement without laxatives 6. more common in women 7. children w ith chronic constipation below age 16 and adults with atonic constipation may develop an unpleasant complication known as encopresis (or soiling) 8. causes of chronic constipation: a. depression b. decreased colonic motility (ie. scleroderma, spinal cor d injury, Hirshsprung's disease) c. painful anorectal pathology (ie. hemorrhoids, fissures, abscesses, strictures, carcinoma, hernias, diverticulitis) metabolic abnormalities (ie. hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, dehydration, hypercalcemia) e. neurologic disorders (ie. spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's senility) f. psychological disorders Special types : a. psychogenic constipation : is described as an obsessive -compulsive fixation on frequency and quality of bowel movements. Unhappy with their defecation and anxious if a day is missed, these patients often become dependent on laxatives, developing a \"cathartic colon\" (a colon that resembles the colon of UC from its lack of haustra on barium enema testing) and demonstrate mela nosis in the colon b. atonic constipation : is associated with elderly or invalid (esp. bedridden) patients. There is a lack of normal stimuli eliciting the colon to evacuate and/or the accessory stimuli garnered by eating and physical activity; as a resu lt, feces accumulate in the colon. Signs and Symptoms : 1. infrequent and/or painful defecation 2. small, hard stools 3. feeling of incomplete stool passage 4. straining at stool 5. bloating, flatulence CONSTIPATION (also see Bowel toxemia) 2 6. halitosis 7. full tongue, broad, dry and th ick 8. h/a 9. abdominal cramping 10. skin problems (ie. acne vulgaris) 11. decreased appetite 12. anxiety over poor bowel function 13. frequent use of laxatives 14. distended abdomen 15. abdomen tender to palpation 16. feces palpable in colon 17. decreased (or increased) bowel sounds 18. melanosis coli (psychogenic constipation) 19. ampulla full or soft feces 20. non-tender abdomen (atonic constipation) 21. anorectal pathology (ie. fissures) Lab Findings : 1. increased bowel transit time 2. check occult blood 3. barium enema 4. anoscope/sigmoidoscopy 5. other appropriate tests to rule out suspected underlying disease 6. complete stool analysis to check for bacteria, enzyme, etc. Course/Prognosis : 1. unless the patient changes the lifes tyle factors which usually underlie constipation, the prognosis is for chronic, persistent constipation and associated symptoms or a patient who will become dependent on laxatives 2. chronic constipation may lead to: a. fecal impaction : this may be spont aneous or follow a barium enema. The patient presents with rectal pain and spasm and cannot defecate even with the most urgent straining. The patient may experience cramping and the passage of watery mucus or liquid feces around the impacted mass (encopr esis). Rectal examination reveals a mass of feces that is often rubbery/putty -like or rock hard. Removal of the mass by the clinician affords great relief. b. encopresis : incontinence of feces in a toilet -age child that is not due to an organic illness or defect. Rule out possible pathologies before making the diagnosis. The most common age of patient is 7- 8 and it affects boys 3X more that girls. 50% of the children have had control of their defecation before starting encopresis and 50% have never ha d control. One theory for the development of encopresis is mismanaged toilet training. The suggestion is that parents may try to force toilet training on a child before: 1. the child's neuromuscular system is physiologically developed 2. bowel movement s have been coming at regular times 3. the child comprehends what is expected in the training chair (potty) 4. the child is willing to sit on the chair and attempt to defecate NOTE: with anxious, tense, strict, compulsive, bowel- fixated parents, t oilet training becomes an aggravation and struggle; the child begins to hold back to avoid having to defecate. The child might develop some anorectal pathology (ie. fissure that makes stool passage painful, which creates the same cycle as in the adult). The child, ignoring the urge to defecate eventually either loses the stool or has a watery passage of material around the fecal mass (as in the adult atonic constipation). Physical exam reveals normal sphi ncter tone and a rectal ampulla full of feces. The child may be withdrawn or have poor neurodevelopment (poor coordination, writing/speaking deficiencies). Invasive testing should be minimal; barium enema and x -rays are not usually helpful and sigmoid oscopy should be reserved to those cases where a bowel defect is suspected. Unless a severe psychosis or neurologic condition exists, the prognosis is excellent with caring, patient treatment. The majority of children are no longer encopretic by age 1 6.

Arnica montana : inflammation due to contused skin 3. Calendula : ulcers of the skin 4. Cantharis : burning with urinary difficulties 5. Rhus toxicodendron : redness, swelling, itching and burning; < heat CONTRACEPTION 1 Methods : 1. Sterilization : tubal ligation in a women and a vasectomy in a man a. man's procedure is much less complicated and less expensive and has a lower rate of complications b. tubal ligation has an effectiveness of 98 -99%; with a very small number of deaths from the procedure (.02-.03%); reversibility rates vary from 25-50%, althoug h this is not guaranteed 2. Rhythm method : abstaining from sex during fertile period a. women must be extremely regular to use this type of contraception and even so it is quite risky b. ovulation can occur any time during the month and may change month ly, esp. if the woman is under stress, sick, travelling, using alcohol or drugs, etc. c. also for some more sexually active couples, the abstinence may not be enjoyed 3. Withdrawal method : removing the penis from the vagina just before ejaculation a. effective 98 -99% of the time, although pregnancies have been known to occur from the pre -ejaculatory d/c from the penis which can contain some sperm b. this type of contraception can only be used by men with excellent ejaculatory control and premature ejaculation is a contraindication for its use c. can also create a very anxious atmosphere during love -making and may interfere with wither the man's or woman's orgasm 4. Temperature method : uses the natural rise in body temperature that occurs with ovulation a. the woman must have very regular periods to use this method and unless this is practiced extremely carefully pregnancy will result b. this method can also be affected by anovulatory cycles, fevers, travel, alcohol and drugs 5. Birth Control Pill (BCP): are hormonal drugs that suppress ovulation in women a. in a small number of women, ovulation is never again established (or may take years) once they stop taking the BCP b. advantages are that intercourse may be spontaneous without having to stop to deal with a contraceptive device or control c. menstrual problems and endometriosis will all be controlled while on the pill d. 95-98% effectiveness rate e. women must remember to take it daily 6. Cervical Mucus check : depends on the woman checking her cervical mucus daily for its consistency a. has a questionable effectiveness rate when used alone (perhaps around 77%) b. contraindicated in women with irregular cycles, GC or cystic fibrosis c. must be practiced very carefully and sex must be abstaine d from during the time of ovulation or another form of contraception must be employed 7. Foam (spermacide): has a very low effectiveness rate (est. 58- 62%) a. easy to use, less messy than creams or jelly, however it interrupts foreplay and is not very ef fective if used solely b. must be reapplied with each act of intercourse c. allergic reactions can occur 8. Jelly or Cream (spermacide): effectiveness rate is less than 70% a. as with the foam, allergic reactions can occur b. disadvantages: leaks fro m vagina after intercourse as woman sits or stands, some think it has a bad taste or smell and it interrupts foreplay 9. Sponge (spermacide and barrier): basically same as above two a. poor protection (est. 73%) b. allergic reactions or irritation frequently occur 10. Condom (barrier): a. condom alone is only 60 -80% effective; with spermacide it is increased to 95% b. condoms are easy to use, buy and offer protection against STDs and AIDS (with ones that contain nonoxynol -9) c. can help the male afflicted with premature ejaculation, decreases vaginal leakage after intercourse and is not associated with side- effects unless sensitive to latex d. they can break, cause irritation if not enough lubricant present, decrease sensitivity for the male 11. Diaphragm (barrier): a. always used with spermacide to gains the effectiveness rate of 85 -95% b. can only be in for about 1 -2 hours before sex c. must be reinserted with each act of love -making d. must stay in the woman from 6 -12 hours after intercourse 12. Cervical Cap (barrier): a. effectiveness rate is 85 -98% b. can be inserted up to 12 hours before sex, though , which can help make lovemakin g spontaneous without any interruptions c. doesn't need to be reinserted for each act of love -making d. have been some reports of changes in the cervix resulting form the suction of the cap e. it is quite difficult to insert correctly and remove f. may be painfully felt by the man or woman during intercourse CONTRACEPTION 2 Signs and Symptoms : Review of complications 1. Sterilization : In the woman, complications include problems with the general anesthesia; bowel or uterine perforations; increased menstrual complaints; risks involved with major surgery; chronic pelvic pain and psychological problems from becoming infertile (the proced ure in women is usually not reversible). In men, 1- 10% will experience chronic scrotal pain (reversible with surgery) because a vasectomy is an in -office procedure with just local anesthesia there are very low associations with complications (aside from t he male feeling inadequate or having other issues arise from the operation). The effectiveness rate is almost 100% 2. Rhythm method : Ovulation can occur anytime during the month and may change monthly, esp. if the woman is under stress, sick, travelling, using alcohol or drugs, etc. 3. Withdrawal method : anxiety during love -making and may interfere with either the man's or woman's orgasm 4. Temperature method : can also be affected by anovulatory cycles, fever, travel, alcohol and drugs 5. Birth Control Pill: is a common and dangerous form of contraception and is associated with increased risks of: a. blood clots (causing strokes and embolisms) b. heart attacks c. developing high blood pressure d. abnormal blood sugars and become a diabetic (reversib le by stopping the BCP) e. gallbladder disease f. liver disease g. endometrial and breast cancer h. incidence of vaginitis i. incidence of cervical dysplasia and eversion j. development of asthma k. depression and mood swings l. vitamin deficiencie s of B6 and folic acid m. decrease immune system against viruses n. eye pathology o. other symptoms (ie. nausea, fluid retention, chloasma, weight gain, etc.) contraindications : 1. poor circulation 2. uterine fibroids 3. tendency to depression 4. >35 years old 5. any liver diseases 6. abnormal genital bleeding 7. previous or present cancer 8. lactation 9. cystic fibrosis 10. sickle cell anemia 11. pregnancy use with grave caution in : 1. migraines 2. abnormal blood sugars 3. epilepsy 4. asthma 5. mental retardation 6. heart disease 7. kidney disease NOTE: BCP plays havoc on the body's own normal hormonal system and balance 6.

Etiology : 1. pituitary adenoma may secrete excess ACTH; so may a non -pituitary tumor such as an oat cell carcinoma of the lung 2. it is often impossible to discern histologic abno rmalities in the pituitary from which the over -stimulation of the adrenal cortex arises (suggests over -stimulation of the pituitary by the hypothalmus) Signs and Symptoms : Overproduction of cortisol causes the body to make sugar from its own tissues; thi s causes wasting of structural poroteins and increased blood sugar levels force the insulin response of fat production. From this arise a series of sumptoms and signs: 1. round \"moon\" faces 2. truncal obesity with supraclavicular and dorsal cervical fat pads referred to as \"buffalo hump\" 3. distal extremities and fingers usually quite slender 4. muscle wasting and weakness 5. thin, atrophic skin with poor wound healing and easy bruising 6. purple striae (s tripes) may appear on the abdomen due to rapid growth of fat and weakened capillaries 7. hypertension, renal calculi, osteoporosis, glucose intolerance are seen 8. females often have menstrual irregularities 9. increased production of androgens in addi tion to cortisol may lead to signs of virilism in females Diagnosis is generally made via plasma cortisol measurements which should fall as the day goes on; a dexamethasone test is a good screening test.

Uranium nitricum : due to defective assimilation; weak digestion, langour, debility; enormous appetite and thirst; dyspepsia; violent appetite even when stomach is full DIARRHEA Jason Schnieder 1998 1 Definition : Increased volume, fluidity or frequency of bowel movements Etiology : There are several types of diarrhea: 1. osmotic : this occurs in response to water -soluble, non -absorbable solutes present in the colon a. stops upon fasting or when discontinuation of ingestion of cause b. causes: lactase deficiency, sorbitol and mannitol intolerance, vitamin C overdose and poorly absorbs salts (ie. magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate), citrate containing laxatives [BII] c. ceases when the provoking substance is removed/avoided 2. secretory : occurs as a result of the intestines secreting salts, electrolytes and water instead of absorbing them a. persists during fast and the stools are larger via volume and more watery[BII][NII] b. stimuli that initiate this process include: bacterial toxins, unabsorbed dietary fat, bile acids, castor oil, some cathartics, some hormones and some drugs 3. malabsorption : may result in either of the two above; sometimes in generalized malabsorption bot h types of diarrhea exist simultaneously (fat malabsorption resulting in secretory diarrhea and carbohydrate malabsorption resulting in osmotic diarrhea) 4. exudative: results from inflammatory processes as they lead to increased leakage of plasma, seru m proteins, mucus, pus and blood; fecal bulk and liquid levels then rise significantly, leading to diarrhea 5. altered intestinal transit : diarrhea may occur from either too long or too short a transit time a. shorter transit time: causes malabsorption by not allowing the chyme enough time to bind to the surface of the intestinal tract; it is often seen after GI surgery (ie, gastric reaction, vagotomy) b. longer transit time: can cause malabsorption and diarrh ea as the food is esposed and processed by the intestinal bacteria; longer transit times are seen in: iatrogenic stagnant loops, scleroderma GI disease and with intestinal strictures Generally, if the cause is in the small intestine, the diarrhea is charac terized by large quantities of water and/or fatty stools; if the diarrhea is due to disease in or of the colon, the stool are frequent and often accompanied by blood, mucus or pus; it the disease is rectal in origin, there are often frequent movements of a small amount of stool.

Veratrum album : copious N/V, < least motion or drinking; abdomen swollen with terrible colic FOOD SENSITIVITIES 1 Definition : Having either an immediate or delayed reaction to an ingested food Etiology : 1. food sensitivities can be defines as inappropriate and uncomfortable clinical signs and symptoms following the ingestion of food; the reaction may or may not be dependent on an immune reaction and may involve either a protein, large carbohydrate, other food component, or an unnatural food additive (ie. coloring, preservative, etc.) 2. terms to describe the various food reactions: a. adverse reaction (sensitivity) to a food : a general term that can be applied to a clinical abnormal response attributed to a n ingested food or food additive (FOFA) b. food hypersensitivity (allergy) : an immune -mediated response to a FOFA c. food anaphylaxis : a classic allergic hypersensitivity reaction involving the release of IgE and chemical mediators d. food intolerance : a general term used to describe adverse reactions and measurable signs not necessarily attributable to an immune response e. food toxicity (poisoning) : a term used to imply an adverse effect as a result of a direct action of a FOFA upon the patient without involving the immune system. Toxins may come from within the food or may be created by microorganisms or parasites inhabiting the food f. food idiosyncracy : a quantitatively abnormal response to a FOFA that differs from its physiologic or pharmacologic al effect, although the reaction is similar to hypersensitivity, it does not involve the immune system. These types of reactions occur in specific groups of people and ther is probably a genetic component g. anaphylactoid food reaction : an anaphylaxis -type FOFA reaction as a result of the release of chemical mediators independent of the immune system, which mimic the signs and symptoms of food allergy h. pharmacological food reaction : an adverse reaction to a FOFA as a result of a naturally derived or added chemical which produces a drug -like or pharmaceutical effect in the host i. metabolic food reaction : an adverse reaction to a FOFA as a result of the effect of the food substance upon the metabolism of the patient 3. clinical ecologists classify allergies in 2 ways: 1. cyclic: accounts for 80 -90% of all allergies and occurs after repetitive eating of the same food a. after a time of abstinence (may take up to 4 months), the food may be reintroduced and often no reactions will occur unless the patient again begins repetitive eating 2. fixed allergies : this type of allergy occurs no matter when a food is eaten, the time span between eating the food again is not of importance 4. theories of the causation of food sensitivities include: 1. genetic predisposition : food allergies are clearly seen as inherited genetic tendencies, allergies commonly run in families 2. immune system mediated : including IgE (immediate reaction) and IgG and IgM (delayed reaction); IgA can often be faulty for letting the antigen cross the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract 3. immune system disorder : studies have shown that atopic patients ha ve: a. 50% more T -helper cells b. a lower immunological set point (thus they react to lower levels of antigen than the non -atopics) c. lower levels of IgA, allowing entry of antigens across the intestinal mucosa 4. non-immunological mechanisms : includ ing release of inflammatory mediators without the formation of antibodies 5. digestion : factors involved include: a. exposure to a FOFA b. improper digestion or low levels of digestive enzymes present (leaving large, undigested molecules that can be absorbed) c. poor integrity of the intestinal barrier, letting antigens pass through (partially digested proteins for example) [leaky gut syndrome] 5. simpler version of the etiology might be: a. a food allergy is one that elicits a Type I IgE -mediated rea ction that can lead to urticaria, angioedema, hypotension and anaphylaxis b. in these cases the food particle (usually a protein or long carbohydrate) acts as a true antigen to the body's immune system; this is the rarer type of food reaction 6. the most common type of food reaction is food intolerance a. the reaction may be immediate or, most commonly, delayed up to 2 days, the patient develops symptoms after eating specific foods b. both IgE and IgG reac tions are implicated, though need not be involved c. anaphylaxis is not part of this clinical picture 7. also consider a pituitary/low estrogen imbalance where the pituitary stops producing a part of ACTH which stimulates the anti -inflammatory reactions [Easley] Signs and Symptoms : 1.

(+) sensitivity testing: RAST, RASP , cytotoxic, Vega, kinesiologic, intradermal, (think parasites) 3. decreased ACTH [Easley] Course/Prognosis : 1. untreated chronic food sensitivities may progress through 3 stages: a. hypersensitivity : when the patient e licits an acute response to the FOFA each time it is ingested b. adaptive: when the acute post -prandial symptoms become less recognizable and the patient begins experiencing more chronic ailments c. maladaptive : when the person is in a persistent, constant state of biochemical dysfunction and does not even correlate their ailments to a food sensitivity 2. in all cases, significant improvements may be achieved by appropriate diagnosis and treatment, either by desensitization or dietary changes Differential Diagnosis : 1. intestinal flora imbalance 2. hypoglycemia 3. environmental poisoning/sensitivity 4. chronic viral fatigue syndrome 5. pituitary/low estrogen imbalance where the pituitary stops producing a part of ACTH which stimulates the anti-inflammatory reactions [Easley] Nutrition : 1. short alkaline fast, then followed by an elimination diet 2. hypoallergenic/rotation diet 3. increase fiber to decrease bowel transit time 4. increase omega -3 and -6 FAs: vegetable, nut, seed oils, salmon, herring, mackerel, sardines, walnuts, flaxseed oil, EPO, black currant oil (if these are tolerated well) Avoid : 1. common allergens : wheat, eggs, soy, chocolate, dairy, corn, citrus, shellfish a. use an elimination diet then introduce each of these 5 days apart to see reaction 2. rancid oils, fried foods, sugar and sweet products, saccharin, processed foods, high levels of salt, spicy foods, stimulating foods 3. coffee, soft drinks, alcohol, caffeine 4.

Risk and extend of injury are increased by impaired circulation, drunkenness, exhaustion, hunger and/or impaired consciousness. The very young or very old. Often occurs while skiing or enjoying other winter sports; wind -chill factor can dramatically lower otherwise benign temperature. There are 3 levels of frostbite: 1. incipient or frostnip 2. superficial 3. deep There are 3 degrees of frostbite. Signs and Symptoms : 1. incipient or f rostnip : usually involves the tips of the fingers or toes or ears, nose, cheeks and chin; relatively painless 2. superficial : skin is firm with a waxy appearance, the subcutaneous tissues are soft and there is substantial numbness 3. deep: there is absen ce of sensation and the skin and underlying tissue are hard and waxy white with a purple tinge 4. degrees : a. 1st degree: temporary hyperemia following numbness b. 2nd degree: vesicle formation c. 3rd degree: onset of gangrene Course/Prognosis 1. recovery from frostbite depents on the factore involved: a. length of time of exposure b. temperature c. wind speed d. tissue protection, patient's overall condition 2. appropriate medical care is critically important 3. treatment of hypothermia, where present, must take precedence over frostbite 4. frostbitten tissue should never be rubbed and should never be rewarmed if there is a risk of refreezing 5. transport takes precedence over rewarming 6. if you rewarm, thaw tissue rapidly because greater tissue loss results from slow rewarming 7. transport as quickly as possible as frostbite is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY Differential Diagnosis : 1. superficial cold injury; usually from exposure to dry cold 2. deeper cold injury; u sually from exposure to wet cold, with longer lasting effects 3. trenchfoot 4.

Plummer's disease : this occurs when one nodule of the thyroid hyperfunctions idiopathically; hypert hyroidism does not always occur with the multinodular goiter 3. toxic adenoma : essentially the same as for Plummer's disease 4. silent thyroiditis: recognized by mild to moderate thyroid gland enlargement; lack of tenderness upon palpation 5. hypothyroidism goiter : typically occurs in areas where goiters are endemic from lack of ingested iodine (See euthyroid goiter below) See Hypothyroidism 6. congenital goiter : a. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: disease is theorized to be the leading cause of prim ary hypothyroidism; it is characterized by a painless enlargement of the thyroid that is not tender to palpation; it is much more common in women, esp. between the ages of 30 -50; other autoimmune diseases are frequently seen in these patients, such as RA, SLE and Sjogren's syndrome b. Subacute thyroiditis: disease is thought to be caused by a virus and not infrequently, there is a history of mumps or UTI; the patient presents with a sore throat/neck pain, fever of 100- 101 oF and tenderness on throat palpati on; the thyroid is enlarged and firm; typically the patient develops hyperthyroidism that usually spontaneously resolves to euthyroidism c. Euthyroid goiter: enlargement of the thyroid gland from decreased thyroid hormone production but without the clinic al presentation of hypothyroidism; it can be due to lack of dietary iodine (endemic goiter); ingestion of goitrogens and drugs; this type of thyroid enlargement is the most common and is often seen at puberty, during pregnancy, and at menopause Lab Findin gs: 1.

Plummer's disease : this disease is more common in the elderly and is treated with surgery or radioiodine 3. toxic adenoma : essentially the same as for Plummer's disease 4. silent throiditis : after a self -limiting hyperthyroid episode lasting weeks to months, the patient returns to being euthyroid 5. hypothyroidism goiter : prognosis good with increased iodine intake 6. congenital goiter : this can occur with or without hypothroidism and is classified into 4 types based upon the causative defect: a. Hashimoto's thyroiditis: conventional treatment consists of lifelong replacement with thyroid hormone b. Subacute thyroiditis: conventional treatment is usually not needed c.

Etiology : Inguinal : 1. indirect : a protrusion through the inguinal ring, often producing a bulge over the middle of the inguinal ligament a. common in both sexes and occur often in children b. males: often protrudes into the scrotum; palpation with examiner's finger into the inguinal canal reveals a mass meeting the finger in the canal 2. direct : a protrusion through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal (Hesselbach's triangle), the bulge is noticed close to the pubic tubercle, that is more medially than the indirect hernia a. infrequently seen in females b. usually occur in men over 40 c. males: rarely extrude into the scrotum; palpation reveals a bulge anteriorly which pushes the examiner's finger forward Femoral : 1. protrusion occurs through the femoral canal 2. males: do not protrude into the scrotum and the inguinal canal is empty; palpation below the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral artery and vein A weakness in the wall of he abdomen allows protrusion of a serosa -lined pouch to protrude into the fe moral or inguinal canal. The danger lies in the possibility of strangulation and infarction of the protruding structure, commonly the small intestines. Inguinal hernias are more common in males than females since the spermatic cord and testes descend through the inguinal canal, leaving it more patent and therefore susceptible Signs and Symptoms : 1. pain may or may not be present 2. hernia may or may not be reducible 3.

HERPES SIMPLEX 1 Definition : Chronic, recurrent viral infection with a typical presentation on the skin or mucous membranes. Lesions consist of single or multiple groups of small vesicles filled with serous fluid, on slightly raised erythematous bases which ulcerate. The virus may affect several systems, causing several conditions from minor \"cold sores\" to frequently fatal encephalitis. Etiology : 1. herpes simplex virus (HSV) is responsible for the infections 2. the initial infection is characterized b severe systemic complaints are not present in subsequent recurrences of the lesions 3. systemic complaints are not present in subsequent recurrences of the lesions 4. following the primary disease the virus is not recoverable from the ganglia or from surface viral proteins 5. the virus maintains latency yet it is unknown 6. various stimuli reactivate the virus to elicit another infection; triggers associated with beginning an attack include: a. sunlight b. high arginine content in diet c. fevers d. infections e. physical or emotional stress f. trauma to the skin g. sexual stimulation h. immunosuppression HSV 1 : a. causes herpes labialis and keratitis (oral and ocular lesions) HSV 2 : a. causes genital lesion b. considered a sexually transmitted disease passed b contact with the open lesions c. most common form of genital ulceration in the US d. initial incubation is from 1 -26 days (usually 2 -7 days after exposure) It is now thought that HSV 1 and 2 can interch angeably produce oral and/or genital lesions, though the symptoms of HSV 2 are typically more severe. Signs and Symptoms : General: 1. lesions may appear anywhere on the skin or mucosa; patients usually present with lesions around the mouth, on or just a bove the lips, on the nose, conjunctiva, cornea or anywhere on the genitalia (including the cervix) a. associated lymphadenopathy may be present 2. a pathognomonic symptom of HSV is a prodromal sensation of tingling or itchiness over the e xact area where the lesions later occur (1 -2 days) a. may also be paresthesias or neuralgic pain in adjacent areas 3. cluster size may be from 0.5cm to 1.5cm, although groups may merge together 4. vesicles appear, grow larger (causing pain from pressure), break open to form ulcers, then scab over with a thin, yellowish crust 5. healing begins after -10 days but it usually takes a full 21 days to completely resolve the sore a. lesions on moist body parts heal more slowly 6. there is usually no scarring or atrophy of the tissue under the lesion, unless lesions recur frequently in the same location Specific infections: Oral/facial herpes : a. primary infection is marked by gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis b. commonly seen in children and young adults c. presents with: fever, myalgia, malaise, irritability, refusal to eat and cervical lymphadenopathy 1. may persist for 3 -14 days d. oral/facial lesions frequently involve the hard and soft palates, lips, tongue, gingiva and entire facial area e. recurrent lesions tend to focus on or above the lips 1. less severe and are not accompanied by systemic symptoms 2. usually preceded by neuralgia Genital lesions : a. systemic symptoms include: fever, myalgia, malaise and h/a b. genital conplaints include (can be severe): itching, urethral HERPES SIMPLEX 2 1. cervical and urethral involvement is noted in over 80% of the initial infections c. rectal and anorectal herpes are generally se en in homosexual men and/or heterosexual women after anorectal intercourse with an infected partner 1. symptoms include: tenesmus, anorectal pain, anorectal d/c and constipation (holding in due to the pain of stool passage) d. pateints who already have o ral/facial herpes may have a less intense primary attack of genital herpes e. recurrences of genital herpes are common 1. usually within 1 -4 months of the first outbreak 2. the average number of recurrences experienced by genital herpes sufferers is 4 -7 episodes a year, preceded by typical prodromal symptoms Herpetic whitlow : a. infection of the finger, usually seen in medical practitioners or their support staff b. signs and symptoms include: fever, edema/erythema/tenderness of finger, vesicular/pustu lar lesions of the finger, epitrochlear/axillary lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis Central nervous system infections : a. HSV is responsible for 10 -20% of all cases of acute viral encephalitis in the US b. diagnositic signs and symptoms include: acute ons et of fever and neurologic symptoms (esp. those relating to the temporal lobe) c. HSV meningitis is an acute, self -limiting disease presenting with h/a, mild photophobia and fever lasting from 2 -7 days HSV infection (< 6-7 weeks): a. neonates us ually acquire the disease as they pass through an infected birth canal, although congenitally acquired cases have been reported where the mother developed a primary infection during pregnancy b. skin lesions are usually present c. 70% of untreated neonates will develop CNS involvement d. with therapy, the neonatal morbidity form the disease is less than 25% but less than 10% of neonates with CNS involvement experience normal development Lab Findings : 1.

Etiology : 1. may be a familial or idiopathic, as determined by history, examination and finding a normal amount of testosterone levels a. in these females, normal amounts of androgens stimulate hypersensitive hair folliclesb. has been controlled with ovarian suppression 2. more frequent in people from the Mediterranean area3. an endocrine disorder may be implicated in women and children; most a. menopause: seen frequently with systemic androgenic steroid or corticosteroid therapy and with some antihypertensive drugs 5. may also occur in porphyria cutanea tarda Signs and Symptoms: 1. hair on the face, breasts and abdomen in females Course/Prognosis : 1. may occur in response to hormonal changes associated with puberty, pregnancy and menopause2. depending on etiology, may or may not resolve with medical treatment, leaving only cosmetic approaches where the appearance is deemed unacceptable 3. only permanent local treatment is destruction of individual hair follicles by electrolysis (tedious process and expensive) Differential Diagnosis: 1. virilism: which is accompanied by clitoromegaly, acne, temporal balding and increased muscle mass as greens, in iodine, silicon, phosphorus: kelp, dulse, Swiss chard, turnip greens, egg yolks, wheat germ, cod roe, lecithin, sesame seed butter, seed and nuts, raw goat milk Supplements : 1. vitamin E botanicals: a.Aletris patient with too profuse, too early, too long menses; with pale face; seed warts on left cheek 2.Medorrhinum: hair growth all over the body; women with chronic pelvic disorders; edema of limbs; facial acne; blotches of leukorrhea excoriating or fishy odor 3.Natrum muriaticum: face is oily, shiny as if greased; acne on face; salt retention causing edema and dropsies 4.Oleum jecoris aselli: on chin and upper lip an growth of short, thick hair; menses are re-established 5.Psorinum: humid eruption fetid menses late and scanty 6.Sulphur : dry and hard hair and skin; much offensive perspiration; menses too late, short, scant and difficult 7.Thuja: leukorrhea, anemia; hair on face and legs with offensive perspiration about genitals; heat in face; greasy skin of face; large, hard, dark wart with large base 8.Thyroidinum: fresh growth of hair; face flushing; anemia, emaciation; muscular weakness and sweatingHUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS (HPV) (also see Cervical Dysplasia and Cervical Cancer) 1Definition : HPV is a sexually transmitted virus associated with causing genital warts (Condylomata acuminata). Etiology : 1. types 1, 2, 6, 11, 16 and 18 are cause of genital warts and usually are sexually (horizontally) transmitted by visible warts [11, 12] 2. incubation period of 1-6 months 3. most commonly occur on warm, moist surfaces a.males: in the subpreputial area, the coronal sulcus, within the urethral meatus and on the penile shaft b.females : the vulva, the vaginal wall, the cervix and the perineum c.homosexual males: particularly common in the perianal region and rectum 4. most common sexually transmitted disease in the world [2, 10, 11]5. extremely contagious a. approximately 2/3 of all people who have sexual contact with an infected partner will develop HPV usually within 3 months [11] b. only 1 in 100 with HPV will exhibit any warts [13]c. in 1990, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that 800,000 new cases of HPV infection were diagnosed in the US [11] d. women who have genital warts, there is a 60-90% chance that her partner is also infected by the virus [10] 6. over 70 different types of HPV, 40 which affect the urogenital area HPV Types Clinical Diseases 2, 4, 29, 57 Verruca vulgaris (common warts) 1, 2, 4, 10 Verruca plantaris and plana (deep plantar and palmar warts) 19-25, 36, 46, 47, Epidermodysplasia verruciformis 6, 11, 42, 54 Anogenital condyloma acuminatum 16, 18, 30, 31, 33-35, 39, 40, Cervical intrarpithelial neoplasia and/or cervical carcinoma 42, 43, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 [11] a.

HPV is commonly found in cervical cancer (at least 90% contain HPV DNA) can also lead to cervical dysplasia [12] a. females with cytologic evidence of HPV have a 16-fold increased risk for progression to carcinoma in comparison to women without cytologic evidence of HPV [11] b. HPV 16 is most commonly found in cervical cancer (accounting for 50% of all cervical cancer cases), followed by 18, 45, and 31 [11] 9. HPV and cervical dysplasia: a. cervical dysplasia: is a premalignant or precancerous change to the cells of the cervix (mild, moderate and severe types) b. HPV is one of the most frequent causes of cervical dysplasiac. 80-90% certain that you have the virus if you have been diagnosed with any type of cervical dysplasia [13] 10.

However, one serious limitation is the inability to grow infectious virus in tissue culture as the viral replication is exclusively linked to the differentiated state of the epithelial cell. 1. prophylactic vaccine strategy : recombinant viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2) as a prophylactic subunit vaccine and works by conformational epitopes seem to be the key to inducing a protective antibody response against HPV. L1 and L2 HPV viral capsid proteins self assemble into the native virions therefore making them ideal potential immunogens. [11] 2. therapeutic (tumor) vaccine strategy : these vaccines focus on HPV16 E6 and E7 (HPV oncoproteins). Studies have shown IgG IgG2a antibodies were elicited, along with I1-2 and I1-4 and in vivo protection against challenge with E6 or E7-transfected tumor cells. [11] 11.

Cholesterol is needed for strong cell walls, as a precursor for hormone production and as a coating around nerves, to name just a few of its very important functions. It is made on the liver in amounts up to 2000mg/day. Cholesterol associated with HDL (and Apolipioprotein A-1) is generally considered to be beneficial to the body, as it works to remove cholesterol from blood vessel walls and the blood itself, bringing it to the liver for processing and excretion. It is associated with the LDL (and Apolipioprotein B) which is generally thought of be harmful to the body as it carries cholesterol into the bloodstream and can therefore place it into the intima of the arterial walls, promoting atherosclerotic processes. VLDLs become LDLs in the liver an d are therefore also generally thought to be harmful. For many years , this theory placed the effect of high cholesterol as the major etiologic agent in the epidemic of heart attacks and CVD experienced in Western nations. However, recent evidence suggests other important factors (see Atherosclerosis). Signs and Symptoms: 1. high levels of total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol; of most concern when accompanied by low levels of HDL cholesterol 2. history of poor eating habits, sedentary lifestyle, ,smoking, excessive drinking, etc.3. angina, hypertension, kidney disease4. no signs or symptoms may be present with life-threatening atherosclerotic disease Lab Findings: 1.

The blood sugar level therefore falls severely, causing feedback to the hypothalamus and the pituitary and thyroid glands. During this time the patient can experience the symptoms of hypoglycemia (see signs and symptoms). 2. pituitary releases growth hormone (GH): which causes the liver to change glycogen back into sugar and release it. GH also causes the adrenals to release cortisol (which also tells the liver to make sugar, increases amino acid release from the muscle tissues and cause dells in the body to use less sugar) and epinephrine (which also tells the liver to promote gluconeogenesis) 3. thyroid gland: increases the metabolic rate to help the liver make more sugar quickly while increasing the rate of carbohydrate oxidation in all the tissues. Thus, the body strives to replace the needed blood sugar. 4. The brain does not use insulin for its supply of sugar energy, as insulin does not pass the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, when a lot of insulin is needed following a simple carbohydrate meal, there is essentially less energy for the brain (as the insulin will bring the sugar into the other body cells), which may account for post-prandial fatigue and lethargy. Unfortunately, if the body must constantly send out a lot of insulin to balance the effect of a meal of simple carbohydrates, the pancreas and other organs will begin to suffer; then the load falls on other organs (adrenals, pituitary, liver) which in turn will begin to falter. Etiology : Reactive (after a meal or drugs) hypoglycemia:1. most common type and typically occurs 2-4 hours post-prandially2. if termed \"alimentary or postgastrectomy hypoglycemia\" it is due to a rapid absorption of glucose into the circulation from the intestinal tract followed by a marked release of insulin a. frequently seen after gastrectomy, gastrojejunostomy, pyloroplasty or vagotomy 3. functional reactive hypoglycemia (FRH): the reaction comes after a carbohydrate load and the mechanism is less known, although it is presumably similar to the alimentary type a. probably the most common of all the hypoglycemias, even though its existence is still doubted by many conservative conventional physicians b.mechanism : when complex carbohydrates are eaten, the body breaks them down slowly and the basic sugars are gradually released into the blood stream, where they circulate as energy for the brain (which uses up to 80% of all circulating blood sugar) and other body organs and systems. Chronic ingestion of simple carbohydrates (refined sugar and flour products) is the main causative factor for FRH. When simple carbohydrates are ingested, the body quickly digests them and floods the bloodstream with glucose. The body quickly responds to this excessive level by having the pancreatic beta-cells release insulin, which brings the sugar into the cells (with the aid of GTF chromium and oxygen) c. (see Physiology) after the continuous insulin reaction cycles, the blood will remain low in FRH patients. They will begin to suffer from the array of signs and symptoms associated with low blood sugar [this is the proposed pathogenesis of FRH). 4. \"true hypoglycemia\" is reactive hypoglycemia when patients experience symptoms 2-5 hours after eating but a measurable low blood sugar is not found Spontaneous (during a fast) hypoglycemia:1. occurs in liver disease or other causes that are less common (ie. a large tumor consuming available glucose) NOTE: it has been suggested that the most common form of hypoglycemia exists in individuals whose liver does not use lithium properly in the process of releasing stored glycogen. They experience a chronic low energy state until lack of food or increased stress elicit a massive glycogen release episode, leaving them more drained than ever. It is further observed that the second most common type of hypoglycemia is that where the patient experiences extreme moodiness from amino-acid glycogen-storage dysfunction. A third suggested etiology relates to nickel and diminished capacity to store sugar as glycogen.

Etiology : 1. thyroid deficiency is common, officially affecting about 1% of the population, esp. women2. it is often under diagnosed and physicians have now observed many cases of subclinical hypothyroidism, where patients have hypothyroid symptoms and respond well to thyroid support, although measure normal on thyroid panels 3. tends to run in families 4.Primary hypothyroidism: a. most common type b. is usually a result of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where the thyroid becomes shrunken and fibrotic with markedly diminished function 5. other causes failure/imbalance 6. typically, the onset of hypothyroidism is insidious and gradually progressive (often the patient, family and physician may not notice its development) 7. in infants, symptoms may be evident at birth but usually develop in the first few months of life, depending upon the extent of thyroid deficiency (1 in 5000 neonates) Signs and Symptoms: Infant/Child : 1. extended physiologic jaundice2. constipation3. somnolence4. hoarse cry5.feeding difficulties 6. failure to reach expected milestones of development7. as the child grows he/she manifests the typical physical appearance of the cretin: a. short statureb. protruding tonguec. widely set eyesd.sparse hair e. dry skinf. protuberant abdomen with umbilical herniag. broad flat noseh. decreased mental developmenti. impaired sexual maturation at pubertyj. poor school performance Adult: 1. cold intolerance2. dry skin and hair3. mental slowness, confusion, lethargy, apathy11. dull, expressionless look 12. possible goiter13.decreased Achilles' reflex return 14. decreased basal body temp.: 97 oF or below on first morning readingHYPOTHYROIDISM 2Lab Findings: 1. decreased serum T4: although it may be normal 2. *may see decreased T3-uptake3. decreased FT414. increased TSH: though this is not specific for hypothyroidism and may be normal5. increased serum cholesterol6. T3 assay will often be TRH stimulation test for 2ndary hypothyroidism: if TSH rises, the patient has a hypothalamic disease; if TSH does not rise, then it is diagnostic for pituitary disease 8. hypothyroidism from sympathetic excess/adrenocortical compensation will show low T3 and borderline high T4; treatment with exogenous thyroid eventually stops being effective 9. liver enzymes may be mildly increased Course/Prognosis : 1. with proper replacement therapy, usually by either the synthetic hormone or thyroid extract, USP, the prognosis is excellent, although carpal tunnel syndrome may take up to a year to clear 2. in children, it is imperative that therapy begin as soon as possible to avoid irreversible impairment of mental and/or physical development 3. major complication is myxedema coma (hypothermic, stuporous coma) a possible sequela of an untreated patient with severe hypothyroid disease Differential Diagnosis: 1. simple obesity2.

Etiology : 1. in any year 30% of the population will experience insomnia with 4-6 million people a year receiving prescriptions for sedative hypnotics 2. aging itself tends to decrease the total amounts of sleep needed and the sleep garnered is more restless3. causes of initial insomnia include: a. anxiety or tensionb. environment changec. emotional arousald. fear of insomniae. sleep phobiaf. disruptive environment g. pain or discomforth. caffeine or alcohol ingestion 4. causes of maintenance insomnia include: a. depressionb. environmental pain or discomforth.drugs i. alcohol 5. the boundary between the causes of the two types of insomnia is not clearly established6. another cause may be inverted sleep rhythm: a. seen in the elderly and secondary to the inappropriate use of sedative hyponotics that are often prescribed to combat insomnia b. patients become sleepy in the morning and sleep or catnap most of the day, this sets them up for interrupted and fitful sleep at night c. the problem is made manifest when the medication is increased and the patient wanders around in confusion or a stupor at night d. if the medication is withdrawn, the patient experiences the rebound effect of wakefulness, which the patient interprets as a return of insomnia thus provoking a return to the sedatives 7. a detailed history and PE should be performed: a. history: should include a thorough checking for prescription, non-prescription and recreational drugs (to determine if the patient is taking a stimulant or any other substance known to interfere or interrupt sleep (such as diet pills, oral contraceptives, thyroid medication, marijuana, beta-blockers, alcohol, chocolate, coffee, soda pop or tea) 8. eating or exercising late at night are also known to cause insomnia 9.habit bound insomnia: person knows that they will not get to sleep and each night will be tortured a. people do not achieve multiple brief periods of sleep during the night but they focus on their difficulty and have amnesia for sleep periods b. with this type of insomnia there is usually some past event that has led to an imprint (like behavior of sleep avoidance) c. insomnia may not present for years and may be triggered by a later event or there may be a build up of consciously unrecognized alarm 1. associated with sexual molestation or physical abuse as a child, which usually happens at night with the child being frightened immediately upon waking 2. fear that a relative may die during the night or by having that experience3. trauma during an operation4. recurring traumatic dream that interrupts sleep an eventually results in reluctance to go to sleep Signs and Symptoms: Primary insomnia:1. may be long-standing and hard to attribute to any immediate psychological or somatic events Secondary insomnia:1. from some acquired pain, anxiety, depression or other emotional upset or somatic eventINSOMNIA 2Lab Findings: 1. sleep lab testing can sometimes uncover problems achieving deep REM sleep or sleep apnea 2. a sleep log is suggested to help diagnose as well as a polysomnograph in a sleep lab a. ie. the pattern of unipolar depression is characterized by frequent awakenings with a decreased REM latency (period of time from first fall asleep to first REM sleep) and shortened stages III and IV NREM sleep. Patients with a bipolar disorder show these same polysomnograph traits but also experience daytime drowsiness necessitation naps, while increasing their night-time rest period. In patients who are long-term users of sedative hypnotics, stages III, IV and REM sleep are shortened, there are frequent awakenings and the stages of sleep are not clearly outlined Course/Prognosis : 1. a recent onset insomnia is usually related to a current problem (ie. health concerns, marital troubles, dilemmas at work, etc.) and as such usually last less than 3 weeks 2. if no such mental/emotional reason can be uncovered then physical causes should be investigated3. insomnia that does not respond to simple measures is often due to an emotional upset, esp. in depression4. morbidity can be very discomforting: chronic fatigue, anxiety about sleeping, lack of concentration, etc. 5. conventional treatment is sedative hypnotics if OTC drugs fail to help Differential Diagnosis: 1. narcolepsy, sleep apnea2. affective disorder3. restless leg syndrome or myoclonus4. drug or stimulant use or withdrawal5. mental problems (ie. depression, etc.) Nutrition: 1. foods high in tryptophan: nuts, eggs, meat (turkey), fish, dairy2. foods high in serotonin: whole wheat toast, bananas, walnuts, pineapple 3. increase foods high in vitamin B complex and C Remedies: a.insomnia caused by anemia: 10oz. duck meat, 4oz. pork, 1/2oz. fresh ginger, boil in 2 pints water until reduced by half; SIG: eat and drink the results b.insomnia caused by hypertension: boil 4oz. celery in 1 pint water until reduced by half; SIG: drink before bedtime c. 2oz. fresh walnuts, 2oz. black sesame seeds, crush and mix together, make into 1/8oz. supplements; SIG: take 3 supplements TID d. 3oz. wheat kernels, 15 dried dates, 1oz. honey, boil them together in 1 pint water until reduced to half, eat and drink the results of this e. boil 1oz. mulberries in 6 fluid oz. water until reduced to half; SIG: drink and eat TID Avoid: 1.meat 2. hot sauces, spicy, fried, fatty, rich and/or salty foods3. alcohol, coffee, caffeine4. sweet foods and sugar Supplements : 1.

Etiology : 1. consists of various degrees of constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain2. most common GI disease seen by general practitioner, covering about 30-50% of their referrals to gastroenterologists 3. patients present in one of 3 ways: a. with spastic colitis causing pain and constipation 1. there is a measurable increase in resting colonic peristalsis b. with chronic watery diarrhea showing high levels of mucus 1. if chief complaint is diarrhea, there is a measurable decrease in intestinal motility c. with abdominal pain and alternating constipation and diarrhea 4. there is no anatomic defect found; the basic pathophysiologic abnormality is a change in stability of the small and large bowel motility 5. precipitating and aggravating factors surrounding the onset and maintenance of the disorder include: a.diet b.drugs c. hormonesd. esp. emotional stresses (such as depression, hysteria, obsessive-compulsive traits, anxiety and resentment) e. common psychosocial situations associated with IBS are martial discord, death of a loved one, worrying over children or job, or just excessive anxiety over everyday matters 6. IBS is a disease predominantly of women (3:1 to men) and the average age of onset is 20-407. it is most likely to be a disorder of synergistic nature, that is, a series of triggers which individually would not provoke an outbreak may do so when combined a. food sensitivities and bowel flora imbalance are likely to play a significant role; ie. emotional or stress triggers which might affect the GI system only slightly tip over into IBS when the presence of offending foods or imbalanced flora create GI reaction and instability Signs and Symptoms: Vary based on the type of IBS: a.spastic colon: 1. the patient will complain of irregular, cramping, lower abdominal pain (usually over the sigmoid colon) and constipation or alternating constipation and diarrhea; either way there is an excess of mucorrhea 2. the patient will also usually complain of excessive gas and bloating, although the bloating may not be apparent during PE b.chronic watery diarrhea: 1. may have been going on sporadically for months or even years2. usually morning diarrhea, occurring after awakening or after breakfast3. usually the patient has 3-4 loose stools in the morning and then normal stools for the rest of the day 4. it is rare for the patient to continue to have diarrhea throughout the day or at night5. a variation to water diarrhea palpitations g. weakness 2. occasionally the pain of IBS may present as RUQ pain, necessitating a further investigation of peptic ulcer and/or biliary tract disease 3.PE: a. unremarkable except for evident anxiety in the patientb. the abdomen may be distended if there is intense pain but no rigidity or visible peristalsis will be noticeable c. the LLQ may contain palpable feces, although the rectal ampulla is empty of stoold. sigmoidoscopic exam is normal except for the preponderance of mucus and possible hyperemia that might be encounteredIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (Also see Crohn's disease) 2Lab Findings: 1. stools must be carefully cultured for ova, parasites and occult blood 2. barium enema usually unremarkable except for exaggerated haustra in constipated patients3. (+) test for food sensitivities4. all other tests are normal5. with the exclusion of any other disease process and the typical presentation of chronic, intermittent attacks of symptoms related to environmental and/or emotional stress, the diagnosis of IBS can be made Course/Prognosis : 1. disorder does not lead to serious disease such as inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy (although there might be an association between IBS and the development of diverticular disease) 2. determination of aggravating factors can yield good results, where those stresses prove controllable3. spasmolytic drugs are sometimes given conventionally but do not cure the condition and tend to constipate Differential Diagnosis: 1. dietary abuses or irritating foods: coffee, tea, simple sugars, carbonated beverages, highly spiced foods2. lactose or intestinal or the bowel8.diverticulitis abuse 10. pancreatic insufficiency such as DM, adrenal insufficiency and problem such hypoallergenic/rotation diet2. correct nutrient deficiencies3. provide adequate calories4. be careful with food combinations: esp. avoid starch, sugar, protein combinations (ie. cheesecake)5. avoid eating too many types of foods at one time6. all foods must be eaten slowly, chewed and salivated well; eat in a calm atmosphere, do not read or watch TV while eating 7. stick to one type of starch per meal8. eat more steamed vegetables than raw ones (Bieler's broth)9. short (3-5 day) fasts are recommended as are an alkaline juice fast10. high complex carbohydrate and fiber diet Sample diet: Acute phase: a. breakfast: whole brown rice cereal (cook 3-4 Tbsp. rice flour with 2 cups water, stirring constantly over heat), 2 tsp. olive or corn oil b. morning snack: raw grated apple or applesauce or baked apples (sour or semi-sour only) c. lunch: vegetable soup form celery, parsley, zucchini, pumpkin, carrot, potatoes (blended and strained), steamed carrots and squash, rice or millet or barley or potato, 2 tsp. olive or corn oil d. afternoon snack: same as morninge.dinner: same as lunch As improvement occurs: a. breakfast: oatmeal 3x/meal; add soft boiled egg during one meal 3x/weekb. snacks: add almonds (raw and blanched) with applesc. lunch and dinner: if no intolerance to dairy, add yogurt (preferably goat), green beans, waxed beans, lettuce, cucumber, green onion, parsley, celery, garlic, lentils, peaches, apricots, watermelon, grapefruit, grapes, ripe bananas, goat whey Supplements : a. liquid chlorophyllb.alfalfa tabs c. chlorellaIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (Also see Crohn's disease) 3d. calming herb teas (lemon balm, chamomile, fennel, peppermint) After stabilization: Vegetarian sample diet: a. cruciferous vegetables to be eaten only with carminatives (fennel, caraway, cumin, anise, dill) b. potato broth, cooked carrots, okra, steamed and mashed parsnips, squash, pumpkin, figs and flaxseed tea, steamed zucchini and squash, grated raw apple, applesauce, ripe peaches without skin, banana (not in Cold conditions), rice porridge, miso soup, slippery elm gruel c. psyllium seed powder, flaxseed powderd. foods high in the omega-3 and omega-6 FAs: vegetable, nut, seed oils, cold water fish, EPO, black currant oil, flaxseed oil e. foods high in water soluble fiber: flax seed, pectin, and seedsc. food intolerances (wheat, corn and dairy)2. carrageenan- containing foods3. peanuts, meat, soybeans, most legumes, oranges4. sugar and sweet foods, refined and processed foods5. hot sauces, fried, fatty, rich and/or salty foods6. coffee caffeine, alcohol Supplements : 1. vitamin A (50,000 IU QD)2. folic QD)8. tabs 10. chlorella Hydrotherapy : 1. vinegar pack: with acute abdomen pain2. hot fomentation: to abdomen for stage 3 Physiotherapy : 1. aerobic exercise: regular to decreases stress2. spondylotherapy: concussion or sine to to 5.Mentha piperita : enteric-coated capsules from Phytopharmica (2 caps between meals) 6.Plantago ovata (psyllium): dose 5-10g after soaking several hours in warm water 7.Ulmus spp. : demulcent 8.Valeriana spp. : for smooth muscle spasm; use large add Atropa belladonna (toxic) tincture if necessary, taken at breakfast, midday meal, between evening meal and bedtime, continue at length -Mentha piperita, enteric-coated capsules from Glycyrrhiza glabra, Athea offincianlis, powdered, take 1 tsp.

Keloid formation (esp. in blacks) may be a secondary effect of wound healing (there is an excess of collagen in the scar tissue, which may be raised above the level of the surrounding dermis 5. it is important to ensure that lacerations have been well cleaned before closing or suturing, as dirty wounds may lead to local or systemic complications Differential Diagnosis: 1. abrasion2. incision3.puncture 4. avulsion Nutrition: 1. foods rich in vitamins A, C, E and zinc Supplements : 1. vitamin A (25,000 IU QD)2. vitamin B-53.Vitamin C 1. rinse: thoroughly with water or calendula succus2. use hydrogen peroxide to help remove objects from wound site (bubbles draw up debris) Botanicals: 1.Arnica montana (toxic): dilute 1 Tbsp. to 1 pint water, use fomentation, for indolent wounds with a sticky deposit at the base and poor granulation 2.Calendula officinalis: dilute tincture, use to cleanse open wound, keloids when used locally 3.Digitalis purpurea (toxic): topically; dilute, indolent wounds with a dirty deposit and that have persisted for a long time 4.Echinacea angustifolia: topically; very obstinate and and serous infiltration in open wounds; great tendency to start and twitch with nervouseness 2.Hamamelis: dissecting wounds, hemorrhages 3.Hypericum: intolerable pains, esp. due to nerve damageLACERATIONS 24.Lachesis: small wounds bleed profusely; the blood does not coagulate 5.Ledum: puncture wounds 6.Petroleum: slightest wounds ulcerate and spread 7.Phosphorus: bleeds profusely but bleed coagulates after leaving the body 8.Silica: from needles 9.Staphysagria: clean, incised wounds, d/c is a greenish colorLACTATION (Excess/Deficiency) 1Definition : Too much or too little production esp. during nursing. Etiology : Lactation deficiency: 1. often duet to a deficiency in prolactin a. after birth, a prolactin deficiency may be the first indications of panhypopituitarism from pituitary destruction during the peripartum period (Sheehan's syndrome) b. prolactin stimulation test are needed to discern if the prolactin levels are indeed low 2. another cause includes stopping breast-feeding for a time (ie. due to mastitis) Lactation excess (galactorrhea): 1. breast secretion as a non-puerperal or inappropriate phenomenon 2. the precise definition of the illness in not clearly defined in the literature3. 25% of women who have previously given birth can demonstrate lactation to some degree; this appears to be clinically unimportant 4. the secretion should be checked to ensure that it is milk and not another secretion that may signal serious breast pathology 5. unfortunately there is no sure connection between hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea; in many patients with high prolactin levels, lactation may not occur 6. in patients with galactorrhea, the levels of prolactin may be low (ie. in the wet-nurse phenomenon where repeated stimulation of the breasts in a women who has been previously pregnant will cause lactation without a surge in prolactin level) 7. however, the drug bromocriptine (which causes prolactin levels to be suppressed) decreases galactorrhea , even in women who have low prolactin levels to begin with, so there must be some relationship to the ailment and the hormone, although at this time it is unclear Signs and Symptoms: Lactation deficiency (the woman has given birth): 1. no or insufficient amounts of milk are produced2. other possible hormonal signs indicating Sheehan's syndrome Lactation excess (the woman is postpartal or is non-puerperal): 1. secretion of milk beyond the infant's demand2. secretion of milk when the woman has not given birth Lab Findings: 1. check prolactin levels2. check other pituitary levels if Sheehan's syndrome is suspected3.

Cryoprecipitates (resulting from cooling) and immune complexes may occur in the serum early in the condition,as well as in the synovial fluid. Lyme disease appears to be a systemic, immune mediated inflammatory disorder that becomes localized to the joints. Patients tend to have increased IgM levels in the pre-arthritis phase. By the time arthritis appears, immune complexes are no longer found in most serum samples but are found in the synovial fluid. Etiology : 1. tick-borne infection of spirochete Borrelia burgdorferai 2. the disease was first recognized by mapping close geographic clustering of cases in the small community of Lyme, Connecticut 3. endemic foci exist in other areas Signs and Symptoms: 1.the distinctive skin lesion (ECM): a. has an indurated central area with heavy infiltration of all layers of the epidermis with mononuclear cells b. it begins as a red macule or papule that expands to as large as 50cmc. the lesion is usually hot to the touchd. soon after onset many patients develop multiple, smaller lesions without indurated centerse. ECM usually lasts for several weeks 2. most patients report being bitten by a tick 3-12 weeks before3. most common symptoms fatigue b.chills c.fever less common myalgia, sore throat, lymphadenopathy and spleen enlargement 4.arthritis : a. may occur 2 weeks to months after ECM, in various joints but with the knees being very susceptible 5.neurologic abnormalities: a. may occur in about a quarter of the patients with ECM and before onset of arthritisb. these may last for months but abnormalities: a. occur in 1/10 atrioventricular blocks, myopericarditis and cardiomegaly 7. synovial membranes in affected joints appear similar to those seen in RA Lab Findings: 1. ESR may be elevated2. Specific antigen/antibody studies available for spirochete Course/Prognosis : 1. usually persists for some weeks or months, with transition from ECM to neurologic or cardiac symptoms then arthritis 2. the arthritic stage may remit and exacerbate for years and may lead to chronic arthritic conditions3. conventional sources suggest that administration of tetracycline during the ECM stage may reduce the severity of later stages Differential Diagnosis: 1. juvenile RA (Lyme disease doesn't usually have morning stiffness, subcutaneous nodules, iridocyclitis, mucosal lesions, factor and antinuclear antibodies [ANA]) 2.rheumatic fever 3. spondyloarthopathies (differentiated by the lack of axial skeletal involvement in Lyme disease) Nutrition: 1. organic sodium rich foodsLYME DISEASE 2See: Arthritis (General Immune Support) Botanicals: See: Rheumatoid arthritis Homeopathy : 1.Arsenicum album : skin eruption resembling red petechia, from the size of a flea bite to that of a leatil; burning an ditching parts painful after scratching; peripheral neuritis; fever with fever; shifting red shining, with red streaks radiating; h/a with much throbbing and heat 4.Mercurius vivus: erythema upon which vessicles form and pour out a thin clear fluid; vessicle quickly broken, contents desiccate, redness, remains for a week or 10 days; fever with profuse perspiration and creeping chilliness; dropsical swelling of feet and legs 5.Rhus toxicodendron: erythema, rapidly progressing to vessication, often accompanied with edema and with the final formation of pus and scabs; surface about eruption is red and angry looking; fever with chills; rheumatic pains spread over a large surface at nape of neck, loins and extremities; > motion; pain stiffness and Non-Hodgkin's) a malignant disorder of the lymphoid tissue that begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to adjacent nodes than liver, spleen an bone marrow.

ESR increased 2nd-3rd day 5. glycosuria in 50% of patients Course/Prognosis : 1. damage to the hear muscle results in coagulative necrosis of the muscle fibers and loss of normal contractile and conductive responses of the myocardium 2. in the post infarction phase: scar tissue is the primary consideration 3. there can be many complications (listed under Etiology) but the depth, extent and health of the scar tissue determines the length and quality of life after an MI 4. early intervention with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been shown to reduce mortality by causing early dissolution of vessel obstruction Differential Diagnosis: 1. indigestion, peptic to a soft diet: low fiber slowly progress to the following diet plan: a. low fat dietb. low sugarc. high complex carbohydratesMYOCARDIAL foodsf. low sodium/sodium restricted dietg. vegetarian cleansing diet or short fast 3. flax seed oil, okra, hawthorn berries, millet, buckwheat, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, bananas, potatoes, asparagus, apples, honey in small amounts Avoid: 1.meat 2. hot sauces, spicy, fried, fatty, rich and/or salty foods3. alcohol, coffee, caffeine Supplements : 1. vitamin B-3 (EPA) Hydrotherapy : 1. constitutional hydrotherapy2. foot baths (alternating) Manipulation : 1. spinal percussion to C7, T22. \"milk\" thenar eminence Physiotherapy : 1. aerobic exercise program: absolute must, should assess cardiac fitness level by submax. stress test Botanicals: 1.Aconitum napellus (toxic): acute pain, full bounding pulse, restless, fear of death, sharp cutting pain on left side, suffocating feeling 2.Adonis vernalis: containdicated in function heart disorders (toxic): feeble heart down left arm, fear of death 7.Digitalis purpurea (toxic): cardiac emergency wit cyanosis, pain , tachycardia, irregular pulse, threatened or actual failure failure 11.Lycopus virgingicus: anxiety, irritability, irregularity, cardiac palpitation from organic lesions powerfully increases contraction of heart muscle fibers] 12.Selenicereus grandiflorus (toxic, cactus): cardiac spasm, constrictive pain like a band around the heart or chest, apprehension of danger or death 13.Taraxacum officinale (leaf): diuretic, :MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SEQUELAE 31.Aconitum: fever, tachycardia, pulse blood great prostration; irregular pulse; cold sweat, dyspnea 6.Apis: faintness, > cold, < warmth 7.Cactus grandiflorus: constricting pain as if in a vice; dyspnea > lying on back, sadness, anxiety 8.Carbo vegetabilis: cold sweat; burning, > fanning, eructation 9.Crotalus horridus: MI giving rise to heart block; feeble and tremulous pulse; trembling feeling to heart 10.Lachesis: sensation of fullness; heart feels too large 11.Tarentula hispana : sensation as if heart is burning, as if heart twisted and squeezed; respiration difficultMYOFIBROSITIS/ADHESIONS 1Definition : Scar-type tissue causing restriction of tissue motion. Etiology : 1. traumatic tearing of soft tissues or long standing muscle spasms cause production of thixotropic gel which organizes itself into collagen scar tissue a. this is the body's attempt to stabilize what is perceived as injury 2. three problems result from scar tissue formation: a. scar tissue is more pain-sensitive than normal structural and contractile tissue b. scar tissue is less flexible and therefore diminishes joint motionc. scar tissue is more \"brittle\" than healthy tissue and susceptible to re-injury Signs and Symptoms: 1. diminished joint play2. pain with deep palpation of the tissue3. a \"gritty\" feel esp. in ligaments and muscles4. local areas of muscle spasm; \"trigger points\" Course/Prognosis : 1. this condition occurs after trauma or in long-standing overloading of muscles2. this can occur in a \"postural strain\" situation (ie. when a person works over a desk day after day causing constant relentless contraction of the neck and upper back muscles. Then, these muscles and the adjacent articular ligaments (rib joints and vertebral joints) may become infiltrated with scar tissue adhesions 3. prognosis is good with appropriate treatment and ergonomic changes designed to prevent chronicity Differential rheumatica Nutrition: 1. foods rich in vitamins A, C, E and bioflavinoids2. olives, rye, lima beans, rice bran, bananas, sprouts, watercress, apples Supplements : 1. vitamin B-6 (50mg TID)2.

There is a greater loss of trabecular bone than compact bone, causing the main complication of the disease (crush fracture of the vertebrae, the femur and distal radius). Etiology : Primary osteoporosis:1. idiopathic, with no clear single or multiple reason(s) for the onset2. it is caused by an increase in bone resorption: whether bone formation remains normal or not is not clearly known 3. is most common in post-menopausal white women a. white women have histologically less dense bones at maturity than blacks, which account for the specificity of the disease to Caucasians 4. post-menopausal women produce less estrogens which stimulate osteoblasts to form new bone5. other factors involved in the development of the disease include: a. malabsorption of intestinal calciumb. vitamin D deficiencyc.little muscle mass d. history of smoking cigarettese. high protein (acid) dietsf. use of heparing. failure to maximize bone mass during young adult lifeh. a sedentary lifestyle (lack of impact exercising that creates more bone mass) Secondary osteoporosis:1. may be a response to several medical problems (See: Differential Diagnosis)2. may also appear during nursing and pregnancy Signs and Symptoms: 1. generally affects the entire skeletal system but is seen esp. in the weight-bearing bones (spine, hips, feet and legs) 2.the early stages of the disease or mild disease: may remain asymptomatic for years 3.as the disease progresses: aching pain in the bones may appear, most notably in the back 4.crush vertebrae fractures : a. are usually not related to trauma and are most often seen in the weight-bearing vertebrae (T8 and below) b. pain with the fracture is acute, non-radiating, < weight-bearing and gradually subsides to tenderness over the local area in days or weeks c. patients often do not seek medical help unless the pain is severe 5.cervical lordosis and thoracic kyphosis: a. present as well as constant aching in the lower thoracics and lumbar vertebrae follow multiple cruched vertebrae 6. other patients may not have their osteoporosis uncovered until they suffer from a hip or Colles' fracture Lab Findings: 1. generally undiagnostic2. normal ESR, serum alkaline phosphatase and phosphorus3. if lab values are abnormal: secondary osteoporosis should be suspected and the cause sought4. x-ray changes include: a. loss of radiodensityb. increased visibility of both the cortical endplates and the existing vertical trabeculae of vertebraec. x-ray of fractures will show anterior wedging in the thoracic area and swelling of the vertebral interspaces in the lumbar region d. secondary osteoporosis from corticosteriod excess shows radiolucency of the rib fractures, skull and excessive callus formation 5. may see increased urine calcium Course/Prognosis : 1. the disease is usually gradually progressive and deforms the correct alignment of the spinal vertebrae because of crush fractures 2. hip fractures in elderly women account for a significant amount of mortality from immobilization-induced repercussions (ie. malnutrition and pneumonia) 3. the key element is prevention by maintaining a vigorous exercise program throughout lifeOSTEOPOROSIS 2Differential Diagnosis: 1. osteomalacia (has similar x-ray signs and is differentiated by lab findings) 2. ostergenesis imperfecta3. malignancies to 1g protein/4 lb. body weight)2. increase blood pH by increasing fruit and vegetable intake3. foods rich in calcium, B-complex, magnesium, vitamin D4. sesame seeds, tahini, kale, millet, celery, barley, okra, almonds, collards, turnip greens, mustard greens, raw goat milk, sea vegetables (arame, hijiki, nori) 5.estrogenic foods: animal products, apples, cherries, olives, plums, carrots, yams, nightshade family, peanuts, soy products, coconut, brown rice, barley, oats, wheat Avoid: 1. soda pop, coffee, caffeine, alcohol2.salt 3. smoking4. animal proteins (dairy, meats, eggs) Supplements : 1. vitamin A (20,000 IU QD)2. vitamin B-63. folic : 1. gently! For ribs fracture easily2. induce extension of the thoracic spine Physiotherapy : 1.Avoid: exercises that acutely flex the thoracic spine: rowing machines, sit ups, slouching in chair, etc. 2. physical exercise is the only proven way to increase bone calcium (density) 3.to prevent: aerobic exercise along sutures or at symphyses; tendency of bones to bend or curve; defective bone growth, bones thin and brittle 2.Silica: when a number of cells in the CT are gradually deprived of silica, they become atrophied 3.Symphytum: injury to bone, tendon and periosteum; non-union of fracturesOTITIS EXTERNA 1Definition : Infection or inflammation of the ear canal, aka. \"swimmer's ear\" Etiology : 1. the infection may be localized or generalized 2. is more common during the summer months3. micro-organisms commonly associated with otitis externa include: a.

Proteus 4. factors involved include: a.frequent ear wetness b. trauma to the canal (including hearty use of cotton swabs)c.excessive and impacted cerumen d.irritating substances getting in the canal (ie. hair dye) Signs and Symptoms: 1.itching 2. pain: with pulling the ear lobe or pushing in the tragus3. offensive d/c from the ear4.furuncle 5. canal is hyperemic, swollen and visibly full of infectious matter Lab Findings: 1. possibly (+) staining of causative organism2.culture d/c 1. furuncle should be allowed to suppurate naturally2. conventional treatment consists of topical antibiotic and corticosteriods3. usually resolves easily as long as causative agents are removed Differential Diagnosis: 1. otitis media2. foreign (often otitis externa) Nutrition: 1. eat as little as possible2. increase vitamin A and C foods3.increase fluids 4. a short fast is recommenced during the acute phase or a diet of steamed vegetables and fruit Avoid: 1. dairy products, esp. cow's milk2. catarrh producing foods: oranges, tomatoes, potatoes, tofu, rice, dairy, wheat products3. heavy protein foods, meats, shellfish4.sugars 5. vinegars6.fats Supplements : 1. beta carotene (100,000 IU QD)2. vitamin A (10,000 - 25,000 IU bowel tolerance4.zinc (6g QD) Hydrotherapy : 1. poultice: charcoal over ear, effectiveness can be increased by heat lamp over poultice (keep poultice moist)OTITIS EXTERNA 2Manipulation : 1. check and BID for 1 week, ROC and irrigate, dry and evaluate Homeopathy : 1.Ferrum phosphoricum: after exposure to wet; inflammation is diffuse, systemic; TM is beefy red; mucopurulent d/c, does not relieve pain; pain in paroxysms, and sharp; sensitive to sounds; anemic children 2.Hepar sulphur : supperative otitis; sensitive to slightest touch, acute exacerbations with increased d/c; d/c thick, creamy and parotid due to swollen tonsils; d/c thin and acrid 4.Pulsatilla: outside of ear is hot, red an swollen; sensation of stuffed ear; thick bland d/c; offensive odor; pain > night 5.Silica: fetid d/c; loud report; sensitive to noise; roaring in earsOTITIS MEDIA 1Definition : Acute otitis media is a viral or bacterial infection of the middle ear. Etiology : 1. usually secondary to a URI 2. most common in children 6 to 36 months old and then again at 4-7 years old3. most frequent diagnosis of children in a clinical setting and it is estimated that about 2 billion dollars are spent each year for conventional medical and surgical treatment of the condition 4. the Eustachian tube is the focal point of concern in most cases of acute otitis media (AOM) a. the Eustachian tube protects the middle ear from nasopharyngeal secretions, regulates gas pressure in the middle ear, prevents bacteria and viruses from having easy access in to the middle ear from the mouth and nasopharnyx and clears secretions from the middle ear b. in the child, the tube is at a horizontal level in the head (the tube becomes slightly vertical in the adult), making it easier for organisms to move from the nasopharynx into the middle ear c. the tube opens during the act of swallowing due to the contraction of the tensor veli palatini muscle d. obstruction of the tube and/or abnormal patency are the initiating factors causing acute otitis media. Obstruction may be: A.functional: due to an abnormal opening mechanism and/or increased tubal compliance B.mechanical : due to abnormal hyperpalsia of the tissues around the tubes opening into the nasopharynx or swelling of the tube itself C.infection or allergy: affecting nearby tissues causing them to swell and occlude the tube 5.in infants : the bacteria most involved are E. coli and S. aureus 6. in older children (but less than 8 years ): the most common bacteria are S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Group A-beta hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus 7. over the age of 8 years : H. influenza is less involved in infections of the ear and the other 3 bacteria (E. coli, S. aureus and S. pneumonia) are the main cause 8. OM usually begins when a viral URI or acute otitis media experienced secondary invasion by one of the above mentioned bacterial organisms 9. causative factors involved in susceptibility include: a.substituting early bottle feeding for breast feeding: human breast milk seems to have a prophylactic effect on a baby, although the exact reason why is not understood; that is, whether it has more to do with an intolerance to the cow's milk or the natural immune boost provided by mother's milk or a combination of both b.supine feeding : related factor to bottle feeding is supine feeding with the bottle has been shown to cause regurgitation of milk which then has a chance of entering the Eustachian tube c.one or more food or inhalant allergies: very common cause A. allergens may cause AOM by causing mucus production and mucous membrane swelling, once the allergens are discovered and removed from the child's environment or diet, health can greatly improve B. food allergens which are common include cow's milk, wheat, soy, corn, citrus and egg, although other foods may be implicated on an individual basis C. inhalant allergies include molds, dust, animal dander and hay fever 10. pre-teen OM seems to be related to true food allergies while OM in adults (20+) to be mostly food sensitivities 11. course of AOM see Course/Prognosis Signs and Symptoms: 1. initial complaint of AOM is usually that of a persistent painful earache a. children may pull on their ear or bore their finger into the canal 2. child's mood may often change to irritability or clinginess3. there is not infrequently a history of recent viral URI, although Eustachian tube obstruction from any cause can lead to infection 4. hearing loss may occur but is not that common 5. fever (up to 105 oF/40.5oC), chills nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may be present 6. TM: hyperemic, opaque and bulging; the cone of light is displaced and the landmarks are hard to discern 7. insufflation shows a TM that does not move NOTE: if the TM spontaneously ruptures, there is significant pain relief associated with the flow of bloody, serous and/or purulent otorrhea Lab Findings: 1. WBCs may be increasedOTITIS MEDIA 22. (+) food allergy or other allergen testing 3. (+) culture of any d/c Course/Prognosis : 1. potential complications of AOM perositisc.brain of serous otitis media NOTE: symptoms of the beginning of one of the serious complications (all but serous OM) include: A.h/a B.chills and fever C.vertigo D. sudden severe hearing loss 2. typical course for a child having recurrent infections and seeing an allopath for treamtment would be continuous use of antibiotics, tympanostomy tubes, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, although these procedures have no significant efficacy in the literature when compared to treatment with placebo 3. in a child is taken off of foods they are intolerant of and avoids other allergens, a complete cessation of AOM episodes may often ensue Serous Otitis Media (SOM): 1. is a chronic effusion in the middle ear resulting from the incomplete resolution of AOM or a chronic obstruction of the Eustachian tube 2. it may be recognized by seeing an air fluid level or bubbles behind the TM with otoscopy, as well as retraction of the membrane, a displaced light reflex and an ability to see the landmarks more distinctly 3. it is found in 20-40% of children under 6 years old and may cause conductive hearing loss4. on culture, the exudate present is usually sterile but may contain pathogenic bacteria5. allergies have been firmly implicated in patients with SOM: a.inhalant (16%) b. food (14%)c. both (70%) 6. patients who are treated for allergies by removing the offending antigen and/or by desensitization show a very good success rate in curing SOM Differential Diagnosis: 1. otitis externa2. foreign object in the ear3. head trauma (causing serous or bloody fluid leakage from ear) Nutrition: 1. eat as little as possible2. increase vitamin A and C foods3.increase fluids 4. a short fast is recommended during the acute phase or a diet of steamed vegetables and fruit Chronic:1. hypoallergenic/rotation diet Remedies for chronic: a.poultice: bake whole potato, wrap it in a cloth and apply it behind the ear to provide hear and relief (esp. good for young children) b.poultice: grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed onion poultice applied to ear c.if eardrum is intact : drop 2 drops of warm olive oil in ear, then secure with cotton ball [garlic oil make with olive oil may be substituted for older children and adultsOTITIS MEDIA 3d.ear inhalation: make peppermint herb tea and place in a thermos, let steam enter affected ear with head tilted over thermos e. place walnut oil in ear canal Avoid: 1. food intolerances of baby and if breasted (mother)2. dairy products, esp. cow's milk3.wheat, peanuts, eggs 4. catarrh producing foods: oranges, tomatoes, tofu, rice, wheat, etc. 5. heavy protein foods, meats, shellfish6.sugars 7.fats 8. vinegars Supplements : 1. beta carotene (100,000 IU QD)2. vitamin A (10,000 - 25,000 IU bowel tolerance4.zinc (60mg QD) 5.

When diarrhea occurs, the unchanged trophozoites can be recovered from the stool. They are extremely labile outside the intestine, dying quickly. When they pass from the intestine in normal stool, they usually enter into their cyst form, which is very resistant to environmental change and is how they spread from person to person through food or water. 3. spread is either direct (ie. among children in day -care centers or homosexuals practicing anal -oral sex) or indirect (ie. from contaminated food eaten by travelers) 4. in the US the spread is usually direct and the infection rate is 1 -5% 5. in some areas of the world where sanitation is very poor, the infection rate may increase to 50% 6. can result in intestinal ulceration and the spread of E. histolytica through the portal venous system to the liver and from there to the pleura, right lung and pericardium Giardiasis : 1. also frequently asymptomatic, although symptoms may range from flatulence to malabsorption 2. the organism contains a central sucker, with which it adheres to the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum in its trophozoite form. 3. Found in normal stool in its cyst form, which is resistant to environment changes 4. Like E. histolytica, it is spread by the fecal -oral route, either directly or indirectly 5. It is seen worldwide and is now the single most frequent cause of waterborne -induced diarrhea in the US 6. Common in travelers, hikers, homosexuals and children in day -care centers Signs and Symptoms : Amebiasis : 1. most patient are asymptomatic because of he infrequency of tissue invasion; symptoms develop only when tissue invasion occurs: a. alternatin g diarrhea and constipation b. flatulence c. cramping abdominal pain d. liver and ascending colon tender to palpation e. stools may contain blood and/or mucus f. amebic dysentery (more severe form, usually seen only in the tropics): 1. episodes of frequent fluid or semi -fluid stools 2. stools often contain blood, mucus flecks 3. slight fever occasionally seen 4. emaciation and anemia can worsen between attacks, although intestinal symptoms decrease to abdominal cramps and semisolid stools Giardias is: 1. most patients are asymptomatic or only mildly affected 2. recurring anorexia 3. nausea 4. eructation/flatulence 5. epigastric pain abdominal cramps 6. diarrhea 7. malabsorption causing weight loss and bulky, greasy, malodorous, occasionally foamy stools which float Lab Findings : Amebiasis : 1.

Etiology : 1. although a traumatic event is the trigger for the anxiety disorder known as PTSD, not all people experiencing traumatic events acq uire the continued acute emotional responses to it 2. another factor in developing PTSD, aside from trauma, is the person's own innate ability to cope with the stress. While some soldiers become \"battle -fatigued\" after fighting with the enemy, others eme rge from battle exhilarated by the encounter 3. it is hard to determine who exactly is at highest risk for development of PTSD in situations of severe stress (like soldiers before going to battle, or survivors of a massive natural disaster) a. many \"stro ng\" people wind up unable to cope with stress while \"weak\" people can rise to the occasion b. therefore, all who encounter stresses should be made aware of any untoward personality, emotional or physical changes that might signify the beginnings of PTSD Signs and Symptoms : Diagnostic criteria for PTSD include: 1. a person experiences an identifiable stress that would elicit symptoms of stress in almost anyone 2. the person re -experiences the trauma as noticed by one or more of the following: a. intrusive and recurrent memories of the event: \"can't get it out of my mind\" b. recurrent dreaming of the event c. acute episodes of \"reliving\" the event: acting out the event or feeling as if it were happening all over again (this type of response is triggered suddenly by a person, place, thing or occurrence in the environment) d. withdrawing from or numbed to the external world, beginning some time after the traumatic experience, as noticed by one or more of the following: A. decreased interest in for mer pleasurable or enjoyed activities (ie. sex, hobbies, job, family, sports, etc.) B. feeling of alienation/estrangement from others C. narrowed or flattened emotional range of response 3. the development of 2 or more of the following symptoms that were not present before the traumatic event: a. sleeping problems b. sensitivity to being startled; hypervigilance c. guilt over surviving or over actions that were needed to survive d. decreased ability to concentrate; forgetfulness; poor memory e. avoiding activities that recall the traumatic event f. worsening (intensification) of symptoms at events that symbolize or resemble the stressful event PTSD can therefore include 1 or all of the f ollowing Mental/emotional : 1. anxiety, depression, fear, irritability 2. sleep problems (too much or too little) 3. decreased memory, inability to concentrate or focus thought 4. recurrent nightmares; flashbacks 5. obsessive thoughts of the stressful event 6. poor work or school performance, withdrawal 7. personality changes, no interest in formerly pleasurable pursuits Physical : 1. increased colds/flus 2. stomach pains, GI disturbances 3. h/a 4. generally lowered immune system functioning causing any number of diseases 5. assorted and various pains Lab Findings : 1.

Etiology : 1. is one of the most common skin diseases, affecting approx. 2-4% of the Caucasian population (fewer African-Americans are affected) 2. most experience the onset before the age 20, although the usual ages are between 10-40 years old3. there seems to be a genetic tendency, as 30% of patients have a (+) family history and certain HLA antigens are associated with the disease 4. although the exact cause is unknown, one possible explanation for the development might be the abnormal ratio of cAMP to cGMP in the epidermis of the psoriactic patient (decreased cAMP and increased cGMP levels are present in affected individuals) 5. it is a hyper-proliferative disease, where the normal transit time of the epidermis decreases from 28 days to 3-4 days 6. the presentation can vary from 1-2 lesions to a severe outbreak with accompanying arthritis and exfoliation 7. miasatically speaking, the second we touch the earth we have psora (psoric miasm) therefore depending on how the vital force decides to exhibit symptoms or what miasm the individual is presenting may determine the extent of the psoriasis outbreak. By clearing the psoric miasm and getting the patient to a latent psora state is the ultimate goal. Signs and Symptoms: 1. onset is gradual2. course of disease is marked by remissions and exacerbations of varying acuity3. only 30% of psoric patients experience itching of the lesions4. usually < in winter from low humidity and lack of sunlight5. lesions: a. well-circumscribed papule or plaque with a characteristic salmon-red color and overlapping, slivery, slightly opaque, shiny scales b. removal of the scale results in pinpoint bleeding (Auspitz sign)c. heal without scarring and do not affect hair growthd. pustules may present with inflammation (they are sterile and do not represent infection) 6. if the nails become involved, they resemble fungus infections with pitting, fraying, thickening, discoloration and debris under the nail bed 7. factors which can trigger an eruption include: a. trauma to the area (the Koebner phenomenon)b. bad sunburns, irritationc. topical medicationsd. acute URI (esp. in children) 8. eruptions: a. may be generalized over the entire body, with particular areas of susceptibility: A. hairline of the scalpB. extensor surfaces of extremities (knees, elbows, wrists)C. buttocks and sacrumD. occasionally: the eyebrows, axillae, nails (50% of patients have nail involvement), umbilicus and anogenital regions (psoriasis in the most common cause of pruritis ani) Lab Findings: 1. (+) food sensitivities 2.altered cAMP/cGMP ratio 3.(+) HLA-B27 4. pustular lesions should be checked for Candida Course/Prognosis : 1. no conventional treatment that assures a cure and the prognosis depends on the age of onset and the severity of presentation 2. often, acute attacks can clear up but it is rare for complete remissions to occur and last after conventional treatment 3. 6-7% of psoriatic patients develop posriatic arthritis (usually following skin eruption) and almost all such patients have nail involvement 4. psoriatic arthritis is a rheumatoid-like arthritis with a (-) RF serology, although most patients have a (+) HLA-B27 antigenPSORIASIS 2a. the arthritis can be very severe and quickly causes major joint damage (treatment is similar to RA) Differential Diagnosis: 1. seborrheic dermatitis: with scalp lesions; there is healthy skin between psoriatic lesions 2. squamous cell carcinoma in situ: with truncal lesions 3. 2nd syphilis: (+) blood serology of nail: (+) fungal culture 5.eczema hypoallergenic/rotation diet3.high fiber diet 4.vegetable juice fast 5. foods rich in vitamin A, B complex, E, silicon and lecithin6. liver cleansing foods: guava skins, pearl vinegar, garlic, walnuts, cucumber, beet tops, dandelions, squash, mung beans, black bass, rye, avocados, sea vegetables, whey, apple, millet, rice polishings, rice bran, sprouts Remedies: a. cut and crush 250g fresh ginger and soak in 500ml white wine for 2 days, apply externallyb. crush peeled garlic cloves, mix with sesame oil or lard to make ointment then apply externallyc. mix 20g whole cloves with 70% alcohol to make 100ml, apply externally to affected aread. oil of avocado applied externallye. decoct dried, unripe pitted prunes into tea, then reduce into syrup, take in 2 Tbsp. warm water TID alternative complement system activators: burdock, Echinacea, foods, Heat producing foods, stimulating foods7. fatty, fried and/or rich foods8.citrus fruit 9. animal products, pork, eggs10.dairy, butter 11. sugar and sweet foods, refined foods, processed foods12. foods with hydrogenated fats Supplements : 1. vitamin A (50,000 IU 13. bioflavinoids (2g TID) Hydrotherapy : 1. constitutional hydrotherapy 2. fever treatment: hot half bath, 5x/wk3. daily baths: to assist the removal of scales4.sea water bathing 5.starch bath Manipulation : 1. check and align T6, T9-11 Physiotherapy : 1. daily outdoor exercise: to reduce stress2.

Chronic bacterial pyelonephritis: a chronic, often bilateral, patchy, pyrogenic infection of causing atrophy, calyceal deformity and parenchymal scarring. Etiology : 1. infections most often occur by the ascending route after having entered through the urethral meatus 2. is most common women due to the shortness of their urethra3. is esp. seen in childhood, during pregnancy, when using the diaphragm as birth control, from sexual intercourse or from wiping forward after a bowel movement (the latter two, is when bacteria can be easily introduced to their urinary meatus) 4. the condition is uncommon in men free from any anatomical abnormalities and is usually associated with the obstruction caused by BPH 5. conditions affecting pathogenesis, usually by first causing a urinary bladder infection include: a.obstruction: tumors, BPH, calculi, strictures A. obstruction causes stagnation, stagnation invites bacterial invasion and infection soon follows B. it is of utmost importance to uncover and treat the cause of obstruction to prevent recurrent infections b.pregnancy: due to decreased ureteral tone, ureteral peristalsis, temporary incompetence of the vesicoureteral valves, as well as the pressure of the fetus resting on the bladder causing obstruction or tissue irritation c.vesicoureteral reflux: reflux of the urine out the bladder, back up the ureters into the renal pelvis of the kidneys A. common in children with anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tractB. in children with no abnormalities but with a UTI (where it seems the reflux is a response to, not cause of, the UTI) C. will disappear upon correction of the anatomical abnormality d.neurogenic bladder dysfunction: due to an interruption of the nerve supply to the bladder A. common diseases with neurogenic bladder include tabes dorsalis, spinal cord injury, DM and MS 6. the disease process is often related to the chronic use of a catheter or immobilization causing demineralization and the resulting hypercalciuria, stone formation and obstructive uropathy 7. the most common organisms implicated in pyelonephritis are: a. E. coli (85% and Candida are usually seen in patients needing catheterization, on immumosuppressive or corticosteroid drugs or who are on chronic antibiotic use 8. hematogenous spread of bacteria from another system to the kidneys is usually related to Staphylococci and produces cortical or perinephric abscesses Chronic bacterial pyelonephritis: 1. leads to end-stage renal failure in 10-15% of patients requiring them to be treated with dialysis or transplantation Signs and Symptoms: Symptoms usually develop rapidly over several hours or a day and are characterized by: 1.chills 2. fever (often > 103oF) 3.N/V 4. Flank or back pain in the area of the kidneys; pain can be intense a. PE: (+) kidney punch 5. classic symptoms of cystits such as urgency and frequency may or may not be noted6.

Etiology : 1. systemic manifestations can occur2. the disease can appear in many forms: a. from a mild short-lasting oligoarthritic illness that causes little damage to a severe progressive polyarthropathy that leads to marked joint destruction b. most patients present with an intermediate course of the disease 3. etiology is idiopathic4. occurs in about 1% of the population, with women presenting 3x more often than men5. usually comes on between the ages of 35-506. has a genetic association7. correlated with a class II major histocompatibility gene complex antigen (HLA-DRA), esp. in Caucasians and Japanese with the classic or definite expression of RA 8. it has been suggested that RA in females may be related to low estrogens or in both sexes a liver \"filtering\" dysfunction 9.juvenile onset RA (Still's disease): a. most common cause of chronic synovitis in childrenb. similar to the adult disease Three subtypes: polyarticular: a. mostly seen in females and accounts for 40-50% of all JRA b. no eye involvementc. usually the patient presents with multiple symmetrical joint involvementd. 10% have a (+) RF and a (+) ANA, have a disease onset late in childhood and are usually affected quite severely with a mild anemia and a slight leukocytosis e. 30% have a (-) RF and a (-) ANA, and experience a milder form with a mild anemia and a slight leukocytosis pauciarticular : a. responsible for another 30-40% of JRAb. if affects only a few asymmetrical jointsc. present in 2 ways: A. early onset before the age of 5, 30% of cases, patients often develop iritis, (-) RF and (+) ASA B. late onset mainly seen in boys, with frequent hip an dsacroiliac problems but no iritis and (-) RF and (-) ANA, high association with HLA-B27 systemic-onset: a. responsible for 20% of JRAb. found in any agec. affects boys slightly more than girlsd. symptoms: A.fever, rash C. abdominal painF.severe anemia G. marked leukocytosis, followed by the appearance of a polyarthritis e.(-) RF and (-) ANA Signs and Symptoms: 1. onset may be sudden a. abrupt inflammation of many jointsb.fever c. lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly 2. insidious onset in 75-80% of patients, with systemic complaints including: a. anorexiab. fatigue, generalized weaknessc. vague musculoskeletal symptomsd. the initial symptoms may exist for months, resisting clear diagnosisRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS e. when specific symptoms begin, the joints usually involved are the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, feet, wrists, elbows and ankles, however, any joint may be inflamed A. most commonly the joints are symmetrically affected Diagnostic criteria for RA as defined by the Arthritis Foundation and JAMA (Vol.224, p.799, April 30, 1973): classic RA : diagnosis needs 7 or the following criteria, with the symptoms of the first 5 lasting over 6 weeks 1. morning stiffness > 1 hour 2. pain on motion in at least 1 joint3. swelling (soft tissue; not just bony growth) in at least 1 joint4. swelling of at least 1 other joint5. symmetrical joint swelling not including terminal phalangeal joint involvement6. subcutaneous nodules usually distal to test: (+) inflammatory synovial effusion with over 2000 WBC/ mm 3 and no crystals 10. at least 3 characteristic histologic changes in synovial membrane11. characteristic changes in nodules definitive RA : diagnosis requires 5 of the above criteria; in the first 5 the joint signs/symptoms must be continuous for at least 6 weeks probable RA : diagnosis requires 3 of the above criteria; of the first 5 criteria, only 1 must be continuous for 6 weeks possible RA : diagnosis requires 2 of the following criteria and the duration of the joint symptoms must be at least 3 weeks: 1. morning stiffness2. pain or tenderness on motion for at least 3 weeks3. history or present joint swelling4. subcutaneous nodules5. elevated ESR C-reactive protein6. iritis: of As disease progresses: 1.characteristic joint deformities may occur: a. ulnar splenomegaly and occasionally anemia and thrombocytopenia) Lab Findings: 1. mild or moderate anemia with hemoglobin rarely < 10g/dl, usually hypochromic 2. leukocytosis seen in only 25% of patients and then rarely > 15,000/mm3 3.active RA : elevated ESR and C-reactive protein values usually seen (test is not specific for RA) 4.(+) ANA 5.increased: a.creatinine b.ASO titer c. copper ceruloplasmin causes false (+) for Bence-Jones proteinge.platelets 6. x-ray (+) for RA Course/Prognosis : 1. the course and prognosis varies from patient to patient and is hard to specifyRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 2. conventional treatment can improve as many as 75% during the first year of their disease; however, despite full treatment, 5-10% of patients eventually become disabled 3. 5 years after the onset of the disease, only 1/3 of patients may have evidence of RA, though most patients experience persistent but cyclical illness activity 4. remissions usually occur in the 1st year; sustained RA activity greater the 1 year indicates a serious problem 5. the greatest joint damage takes place during the 1st 6 years of the disease and then progresses at a substantially slower rate 6. the median life span of the RA patient is lowered by 3-7 years 7. an increased mortality rate can be seen in patients with severe disease and is usually due to infections, GI bleeding and drug therapy 8.

Etiology : 1. onset is usually gradual as the nerve becomes inflammed2. many causes: a. pressure can originate in the nerve roots as in discopathy or facet syndrome or can be caused by the gluteal muscles or piriformis tightening over the nerve b. gluteal muscle spasm is often 2 nd to sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SI dysfunction is in turn secondary to short leg syndrome, sacroiliac sprain, lumbar sprain/strain causing tightening of the entire low back musculature, etc.) 3. the nerves are usually irritated by pressure or stretching (use in its investigation) 4. usually causes splinting spasm of other muscles and may cause favoring of the opposite leg5. common scenario: a. the sacroiliac joint becomes subluxated and the gluteus medius muscle gradually spasm to protect the joint which the body perceives as injured. The splinting spasms produce pressure on the sciatic nerve as it exits the pelvis causing irritation b. additionally, in a common anatomical variant, the sciatic nerve may pass through the piriformis muscle, which if in spasm, pressure is then placed on the nerve 6. it is rarely a result of frank trauma although stretch of the nerve can result from an injury to the leg or vertebral trauma 7. Chinese medicine: sciatica along the lateral thigh is often associated with a history of gallbladder problems since that is the path of the associated merdian Signs and Symptoms: 1. burning along the tract of the sciatic nerve, usually in the buttocks and extending downward in the posterior leg a. pain increased by direct pressure to the nerve 2. spasm of the gluteal or piriformis muscles3.straight leg raise: < pain 4. knee may buckle upon loading as long-standing pain causes weakening Lab Findings: 1. imaging: to rule out disc pathologies Course/Prognosis : 1. treat the cause, sciatica is rarely a primary diagnosis2. the practitioner must work to make the person comfortable while seeking the underlying cause Differential Diagnosis: 1.

Etiology : 1. although this syndrome is now being fully recognized as a valid disease, the physiologic pathways are still not well understood 2. the theories surrounding SAD focus on the absence of sunlight during the winter months (artificial indoor light is not a protective or therapeutic measure) causing hormonal imbalances in the patient's system, particularly the pineal secretion of melatonin 3. melatonin is secreted when there is little or no sunlight, when there is sunlight the secretion is inhibited4. exactly how the decreased sunlight and associated increase is melatonin produces the signs and symptoms of SAD is presently unknown, although increased melatonin levels in the body have been associated with increased sleepiness 5. patients most likely to experience SAD are: a. those living in temperate zones (with a lot of rainy, gray days; ie. Portland, OR)b. those with a depressive tendencyc. those living far enough north to experience lengthy periods of darkness for many months of the year 6. the symptoms may begin as early as autumn (October) and end when the spring sun begins to shine (April-May) Signs and Symptoms: 1. the symptoms often begin gradually as the length of sunlight begins to diminish: a. sadness/depressionb.withdrawal/apathy c.irritability d. sleep disturbances (sleeping more and waking unrefreshed)e. decreased physical activityf.weight gain g.increased appetite Lab Findings: 1. at this time appears to be no appropriate tests to confirm SAD2. can test melatonin Course/Prognosis : 1. the illness produces recurrent episodes of depression that are likely to persist until the patient is treated with either light therapy or some other treatment that re-balances and desensitizes the patient to the normal decreased daily sunlight that occurs in fall and winter, thus eradicating the depressive periods at the source Differential Diagnosis: 1. although there are a multitude of other diseases that produce the signs and symptoms listed, the cyclical symptoms of this disorder are its key indicator Nutrition: 1.citrus peel 2. vitamin B complex foods3. liver a. tea from licorice, Chinese black dates and wheat chaff (the part that floats on the surface of water) Avoid: 1.meat 2. hot sauces, spicy, fried, fatty, rich and/or salty foods3. sugar and sweet foods4. alcohol Supplements :SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER (SAD) 21. vitamin A (100-300,000 IU QD) TOXIC DOSE [2nd half of cycle in females] 2. vitamin B-6 (25-100mg : 1. check and align L2-3, SI joints as needed Physiotherapy : 1. massage: abdomen .: nervine 1.Aurum metallicum : suicide; hopeless; sensitive to noise; excitement melancholy; profound depression; longing for death; laughs and cries alternately; sunset to sunrise 2.Natrum muriaticum: melancholy which results in remembering past unpleasant events; weeping < consolation; prefers to be alone; anxiety about the future; < at the oceanSEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS 1Definition : An inflammatory, greasy, scaling, disease usually affecting the scalp and face but also can be seen in other areas rich in sebaceous glands; aka: dandruff (in adults), cradle cap (in infants).

Strep, Pneumococcus, Hemophilus influenza and Staph, which are the bacteria most implicated in acute sinusitis 5. the bacteria overgrowth leads to an influx of serum and leukocytes to fight the infection, setting up a painful positive pressure 6. precipitating factors: a.swimming b. diving c. injury to the area (esp. fractures to the ethmoid or frontal sinuses) 7.chronic sinusitis often associated (25% of maxillary sinusitis) Signs and Symptoms: 1. tenderness to palpation2.swelling redness 3. opague transillumination of involved sinuses4. fever, chills (suggests expansion of the infection beyond the sinuses)5. nasal congestion and serous or mucopurulent d/c (usually yellow or green and can often excoriate the nasal tissues) 6.malaise 7. h/a and/or dizziness that changes with position and is worse lying down or bending over8. history of URI, dental problem, nasal allergy or injury to the area9. nasal mucosa is erythmatous and edemic and the exudate may be seen in the turbinates corresponding to the infected sinus(es) 10.chronic sinusitis: a. may present as acute sinusitis or may be relatively asymptomatic presenting with only mild postnasal d/c, recurrent h/a, musty odor or a non-productive cough b. x-ray: may reveal a thickening of the mucous membranes, though cultures of the nose and nasal d/c uncover no pathogenic organisms 11. specific areas of infection: a.frontal: pain over the forehead, above the eyebrows b.maxillary: pain around cheekbones, toothache and frontal h/a c.ethmoid: \"splitting\" frontal h/a, pain behind and between the eyes d.sphenoid: usually less clearly defined but often manifests as tenderness and pain around the vertex of the skull, the mastoid areas and the occiput Lab Findings: 1. x-ray: clearly show the sites of involvement and to what degree a. picks up the swollen mucous membrane or the exudateb. x-rays of the apices of the teeth are mandatory to rule out a periapical abscess when there is chronic maxillary sinusitis 2. cultures not reliable Course/Prognosis : 1. complications if treatment is not effective or the cause is not treated: a.osteomyelitis of the frontal bone: rare b.bacterial meningitis : usually involves the frontal tissues and osteomyelitis and can lead to a brain abscess c.bronchiectasis d.nasal polyps: may develop in individuals with chronic symptoms, esp. in allergic patients 2. with proper treatment, all the above complications are very rare3. the patients are likely to have the most trouble with their sinuses are those with allergies, chronic viral fatigue or immunosuppressionSINUSITIS 24. most patients respond to treatment and resolve the acute infection (if the causes is not removed, however, recurrent attacks are extremely likely) Differential Diagnosis: Acute sinusitis : 1.dental abscess 2. response to exposure to airborne irritants 3. immunosuppressive disease or chronic viral fatigue syndrome Chronic sinusitis:1.allergies 2. exposure to irritating gases/dusts/tobacco smoke3.

Common causes are bladder infections, idiopathic, spina bifida occulta, MS, and bladder stones 2.stress incontinence: This UI occurs following sneezing, coughing, laughing and straining (activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure) and is due to a somewhat compromised urinary sphincter, It seems to be more common in post-menopausal women due to atrophy of the urethra; although it can occur in men after prostatic surgery 3.overflow (paradoxical) incontinence: This occurs when the pressure of an overfilled bladder eventually overcomes sphincter resistance. The bladder becomes dilated and palpable. Factors involved with this type of UI include: obstruction to urine outflow (BPH and prostate cancer), urethral meatus stricture (esp. in children), urethral strictures and injury to the spinal cord 4.ectopic ureter in women: patients present with leakage day and night their while lives, even though they void normally. The ureter may be found in the vagina, near the bladder neck, or in the urethra and surgical correction is necessary. Ectopic urethra in men does not produce UI 5.psychogenic incontinence: particularly seen in children, this is characterized by a child with normal ability to urinate but who fakes incontinence to gain some emotional need.

The antibodies may have been acquired naturally (ie. passage through the placenta or via colostrum). Passive immunity is relatively short-lived. The proteins are foreign and the body reacts to them as to foreign proteins. 2. conventional medicine further considers routine vaccinations to include: a.diphtheria b.tetanus c.pertussis d. poliomyelitise.measles f.mumps g.rubella 3. many observant physicians have encountered pediatric patients whose general condition or temperament or apparent general susceptibility has permanently changed after vaccination Signs and Symptoms of the vaccines: 1.pertussis/diphtheria : mild fever 2.rubella: arthralgia and body aches 3. depressed immune system response may be a long-term sequelae4. \"never the same since vaccination\" Course/Prognosis : 1. within conventional medicine, immediate vaccination sequelae are usually considered self-limiting but uncomfortable 2. the patient should be observed for severe reaction and treated symptomatically for discomfort3. longer-term \"vaccinosis\" is harder to diagnose but can be strongly suggested by history and appropriate treatment may then help ameliorate the condition Differential Diagnosis: 1. incidental viral or infectious illness2. chronic fatigue syndrome Nutrition: 1. increase vitamin A and C rich foods Supplements : 1. vitamin A2. vitamin B complex3. vitamin C Hydrotherapy : 1. constitutional hydrotherapy2.fever treatments Botanicals: 1.Echinacea spp.: for sequelae and prior to vaccination 2.Thuja occidentalis: counteracts ill effects of smallpox vaccination Homeopathy : 1.Antimonium tartaricum: for bad effect when Thuja fails 2.Kalium muriaticum : may prevent outbreak of any other disease after vaccination 3.Silica: nervous affections, even convulsions, after vaccination 4.Sulphur : as with Kalium muriaticum 5.Thuja occidentalis: for bad effects, high fever or diarrhea 6.Vaccininum : for bad effects with inflammation and oozing out from the affected partsVACCINATION SEQUELAE 2VAGINITIS/LEUKORRHEA 1Definition : Inflammation and/or infection of the vagina with possible concurrent inflammation of the vulva.

it then ravels from the gut into the lungs, up the respiratory tract until it is swallowed in the pharynx, where it then matures in the larvae inter the body through the skin, travel to the lungs, up the respiratory tract until they are swallowed and end up in the small intestines, where they suck blood from the mucosa e.threadworm: 1.infective agent is Strongyloides stercoralis 2. the infection occurs following skin penetration by the larvae, although the fecal-oral route is thought to be another manner of spread 3. the life cycle then follows that of the hookworm, except larvae, no eggs, are passed in the feces 4. severe infestations with threadworm can entail having the biliary and pancreatic tracts, the entire small intestine and the Tapeworms: a.beef tapeworm: 1.infective agent is Taenia saginata 2. humans become infected with the worms upon eating raw or undercooked encysted beef muscle 3. takes approximately 2-3 months for the worms to mature in the intestines4. the disease is uncommon in the US b.pork tapeworm: 1.infective agent is Taenia solium 2. humans are infected by eating raw or undercooked pork3. adult worm disease is similar to that of the beef tapeworm4. in infections with T. solium, humans may serve as an intermediate host and the larvae may penetrate the intestinal wall and invade any and all tissues of the body (cysticercosis) c.fish tapeworm: 1.infective agents is Diphyllobothrium latum 2. ( i n v e g e t a t i o n ) a n d Heterophyes and Metagonimus (in fresh water fish) 2. the disease is uncommon in the US and is seen in patients returninf from the Orient or tropicsWORMS (INTESTINAL) 2Signs and Symptoms: Roundworms: a.pinworms: 1. almost all patients will complain of pruritus ani, typically at night, as that is the time the female pinworm comes out to lay her eggs 2. other symptoms include: a. vaginal d/c b. insomnia and nightmaresc. secondary infection of the anal areas from excoriation 3. often the infection affects the entire family b.whipworms: 1. complaints will only arise in those with heavy infections2. abdominal pain and diarrhea are common3. severe disease: anemia, rectal prolapse and weight loss may occur c.giant intestinal roundworms: 1. the manifestations of the condition may be diverse due to the route the worm takes through the body 2. common symptoms include: a.fever b. cough, wheezing, bronchopneumonia (in the lung phase)c. abdominal pain, malabsorption, intestinal obstruction (in the abdominal phase) 3. patient may appear with a full, pale upper lip and have white lines around their mouth4. there may be marked nose-picking d. hookworms: 1. there is often a maculopapular rash, edema and severe pruritus where the larvae have gone through the skin 2. pulmonary symptoms do not usually appear, although cough, pneumonia and fever may occur during large infestations 3. intestinal symptoms include epigastric pain4. severe cases: much blood loss, the patient may exhibit anasarca and cardiac insufficiency e. threadworms: 1. skin eruptions and itchiness may develop when the larvae enter the skin2. lung complications similar to ascariasis may occur when the worm is in the lungs3. intestinal complaints include epigastic pain and tenderness, nausea, flatulence, vomiting and alternating constipation and diarrhea Tapeworms: a.beef tapeworm: 1. typically, the infection is asymptomatic2. the patient may infrequently experience epigastric pain, diarrhea and weight loss3. sometimes the unhappy patient may feel an active proglottid crawling around in the anus b.pork tapeworm: 1. when humans are infected with the adult worm, the manifestations are identical to that of the beef tapeworm 2. the clinical presentation of cysticercosis differs dramatically: a. cysticerci develop in the subcutaneous tissues, muscles, viscera, eyes and brain b. the patient may exhibit muscular pains, fever, eosinophilia and weaknessc. if the brain is infected symptoms resembling meningoencephalitis, epilepsy or brain tumor may be present c. fish tapeworm: 1. infection is frequently asymptomatic 2. mild GI symptoms may be experienced3. occasionally a B-12 like anemia may develop d. dwarf tapeworm: 1. infection may be asymptomatic, even when the patient has a large infection2. abdominal cramps and diarrhea may occur in extensive disease Flukes/Trematodes: a.intestinal flukes :WORMS (INTESTINAL) 31. infestations are typically asymptomatic; occasionally a patient will present with abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction or diarrhea Lab Findings: Roundworms: a.pinworms: 1. Diagnosis: Scotch tape prep and finding in larvae sputum d.hookworms: 1. may include iron-deficiency anemia 2. hypoalbuminemia3. detecting eggs in the Diagnosis: malaria and beri-beri Tapeworms: a.beef recovering eggs in the stool2. Scotch tape prep3. segments of the worms are passed with bowel movements and may be clearly noticed b.pork tapeworm: 1. finding the adult worm in the stool or by the Scotch tape prep2. 50% of patients will have subcutaneous cysts3. CT scan can identify brain lesions4. CSF is often abnormal5. ELISA testing is available for cysticercosis6. biopsy of brain, skin or subcutaneous lesion is definitive dwarf tapeworms: 1. eggs in stool Flukes/Trematodes: a.intestinal flukes : 1. eggs in the stools Course/Prognosis : Roundworms: a.pinworms: 1. conventional treatment of pinworms includes improved personal hygiene, washing all clothes and linens and pyrantel pamoate 2. re-infection is common b.whipworms: 1. conventional treatment consists of improved hygiene and sanitation2. mevendazole (only in heavy infections) c.giant intestinal roundworms: 1. conventional treatment consists of pyrantel pamoate or mebendazole d.hookworms: 1. conventional treatment includes improved nutrition (esp. high protein) and specific focus on the anemia 2.incases needing anthelminthic drugs, pyrantel pamoate and mebendazole are treatment consists of thiabendazole Tapeworms: a.beef tapeworm: 1. conventional treatment consists of the taenicide niclosamide2. obviously, prophylaxis by cooking meat well (or better, by minimizing or avoiding its consumption) is most recommended b.pork tapeworm: 1. conventional treatment consists of niclosamide in the adult worm infestation2. location of the lesions will determine whether drug therapy or surgery is the treatment of conventional choice c.fish tapeworm:WORMS (INTESTINAL) 41. conventional treatment is niclosamide conventional treatment is niclosamide Flukes/Trematodes: a.intestinal 1. conventional treatment consists Differential Diagnosis: 1.amebiasis 2. protozoal infections 3.
