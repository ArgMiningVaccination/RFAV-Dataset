C. Internet We bsite www.kidessentials.com (excerpt ) (Exhibit C) FAQ : Q: What exactly do probiotics protect my kids from? A: Probiotics are healthy bacteria that must be consumed in order to build up in our digestive system - in the lining of the GI tract. While they occur throughout nature, the y are less likely t o be present i n large numbers in our own GI tract, and therefore need to be consumed to derive a b enefit. They help balance and keep the levels of bad bacteria in check. Most importantly, they help keep our immune system healthy by increasing disease-fighting antibodies.1,2 Referenc es: 1.
