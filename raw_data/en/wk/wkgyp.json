It's particularly helpful after a period of indulgences like special occasions and holidays. Some of the steps might even help address root causes of digestive upset. Advertisement What is a gut reset? A gut reset, also commonly referred to as a \" [detox](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-way-to-detox-your-body-according-to-hormone-experts)\" or \"cleanse,\" aims to restore balance in [the human microbiome](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/signs-of-an-unhealthy-gut) and the GI tract (a [major detoxification organ](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/does-your-body-need-support-detoxing)). While research on the effects of short-term \"detox diets\" or \"gut cleanses\" on the body is limited, with most studies being too small or lacking robust clinical evidence, according to some studies, consuming certain whole foods and nutrients can [modulate the removal of toxins from the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4488002/) [1](#citations). Eating a variety of whole foods will provide an array of nutrients and phytonutrients that may help support the body's intrinsic metabolic detoxification pathways at a mechanistic level, but additional clinical trial research is warranted to elucidate these effects further. Indeed, detoxification is a 24/7 affair (because that's how [detoxification pathways work in our body](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/daily-detox-support-why-it-matters)), so while targeted periods of gut focus to reset digestive health are useful for many individuals, I'll let you in on a secret: The gut reset principles below are broadly useful, each and every day, for promoting a healthy GI tract for life. After all, why care for your gut sometimes when you can nourish it daily? Below, a nine-step routine for keeping your gut healthy and happy. RELATED: [Gut Health Diet: What You Should Eat For A Healthy Gut](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/gut-health-diet) Advertisement Start with an intermittent fast. Just like you, your gut needs a period of rest and rejuvenation to function optimally. Giving it a break can support antioxidant and [anti-inflammatory processes, cellular cleanup (the fancy word here is \"autophagy\")](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29700718/) [2](#citations) and even help shed water weight and ease [bloating](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/bloating). Studies are coming out all the time supporting the [benefits of intermittent fasting](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMx190038) [3](#citations), which gives the body a break for a set number of hours each day so that your gut can repair, reset, and rest. Even [a seminal research review in the journal of longevity nutrition](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/nutrition-phd-breaks-down-comprehensive-longevity-study) (i.e., eating for a long, healthy life). The night before you start your gut reset, plan to [fast for 12 to 16 hours](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/your-definitive-guide-to-intermittent-fasting). To put this in perspective\u2014a 12-hour fast means you stop eating at 7 in the evening and don't eat again until breakfast the next day at 7 in the morning. Summary Advertisement Begin your morning with water. In my opinion, [drinking water](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-drinking-water), especially room temperature (sans ice) or [warm water](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/lemon-water-benefits) on an empty stomach, is one of the best things you can do for digestion. As we know from [Ayurvedic principles](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/ayurveda-for-beginners-how-to-balance-your-doshas), warm water is gentle on the GI tract and [stimulates digestion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27684632/) [5](#citations), which naturally helps food move through the digestive tract and promotes the removal of waste. I recommend you start your detox day with at least one full glass of room-temperature water before you consume any food. Summary Advertisement Have a sugar-free breakfast. In preclinical studies, high-sugar diets promoted metabolic disease, while [the elimination of sugar provided protection from obesity and metabolic syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36041436/) [6](#citations). To give your gut a break, start by avoiding refined sugars and added sugars in your morning meal (and really in general). Fruit sugars are OK (berries are best), but make sure they're accompanied by plenty of [fiber](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/high-fiber-foods) and [fat](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-makes-good-fats-healthy-according-to-md), so you don't spike your blood sugar (and then crash). Try one of these [green smoothie a great choice, as is a [quinoa breakfast bowl](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/quinoa-bowls-that-make-it-easy-and-fun-to-eat-clean). Summary Advertisement Midmorning, have a cup of chai. In very early studies, researchers have found that the release of tea polyphenols have been [shown to help to control the glycemic index and digestibility of starchy foods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32567616/) [7](#citations). A mid-morning cup of tea might help digestion when you've had a breakfast that's heavier in starch. Boil 1 cup of water, then add in 1 tablespoon of loose [chai tea](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/amy-shah-chai-latte-mix-review). Add additional gut-supporting spices like \u00bd teaspoon each of [cinnamon](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/cinnamon-uses-health-benefits-and-side-effects), cardamom, and [ginger](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/health-benefits-of-ginger-x-uses-for-ginger-root-tea-and-extract). You can also add nutmeg or clove. I like to strain the tea and add a splash of almond or coconut milk for creaminess. Summary Have a broth-based meal with probiotics for lunch. The nutrients found in a clean [bone broth](https://cdhf.ca/health-lifestyle/is-bone-broth-healthy/) can help soothe the gut. Bone broth contains the amino acid [glutamine](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/glutamine-a-complete-guide) (among others), which has been [shown to improve intestinal function in preclinical trials](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/20/5232) [8](#citations). Choose broth](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/bone-broth-benefits-and-how-to-make-it-at-home) from high-quality, grass-fed animals or [a vegetable broth](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/potassium-rich-veggie-broth), and add some extra vegetables to it for a filling, gut-friendly meal. In addition to prebiotic fibers from vegetables, adding 1 tablespoon of [fermented foods](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-fermented-foods-list) (like [kimchi](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/our-4-favorite-ways-to-eat-this-3000-year-old-gut-boosting-food), [sauerkraut](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-sauerkraut), or some pickles) to your meals is another easy way to work gut-friendly bacteria into your life. Other ideas: Stir 1 teaspoon or less (it packs a punch!) of miso in your soup, or sip on [kombucha](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-kombucha-health-benefits-risks-and-more), non-dairy [kefir](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/what-is-kefir), or kvass (a fermented cereal-based non-alcoholic beverage) with your meal. Perhaps easiest, try incorporating [a high-quality probiotic](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/9-best-probiotic-supplements-of-2023-for-your-gut) into your routine to further bolster your gut-centric diet. Summary Don't snack between meals. Remember the intermittent fasting discussion before: Giving your gut a break is a big part of this gut reset protocol, whether you try it for over the short- or long-term. Try to limit snacking, and if you're feeling peckish, have another glass of chai or some vegetables with hummus instead. Summary Add prebiotics to your dinner. Hunter-gatherer societies ate roughly 200 grams of fiber daily, while we get [approximately 15 grams with a typical modern-day diet](https://www.ars.usda.gov/arsuserfiles/80400530/pdf/dbrief/12_fiber_intake_0910.pdf). We have a [fiber gap](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-much-fiber-per-day)! The [best source of fiber](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/fiber-benefits) is from complex carbohydrates from fermentable plant fibers or \" [prebiotics](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/probiotics-prebiotics-and-synbiotics-whats-difference),\" which support good bacteria (microbes) already present in the gut. The following foods are especially rich in prebiotic fibers: - Yams and other tubers - Potatoes - Ginger - Leeks (green and white parts) - Fibrous parts of fruit and vegetables - Legumes/beans - Inulin (chicory, agave) - Flaxseeds Add more cellulose fibers into your diet for contributing bulk to your stool. You can find these insoluble cellulose fibers in the tough parts of veggies and fruit (think of broccoli stalks, the bottom of asparagus, kale stems, and orange pulp). Try to include at least one serving (extra credit for two or three!) of prebiotic food in your dinner. These [spiced stuffed sweet potatoes](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/spiced-stuffed-sweet-potatoes) are a great option, as is this [sweet potato breakfast porridge recipe](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/sweet-potato-porridge). Summary [Prebiotic fibers support good bacteria present in the gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470858/). Foods like sweet potatoes, ginger, leeks, and beans are especially rich in prebiotics. 8. Minimize stress. Unchecked stress has a [negative effect on the gut](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/why-stress-management-is-so-important-for-your-health) (and whole-body health). When you're stressed, this can [increased processes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30844962/) [9](#citations), stress: - Try a [mini-meditation](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-start-meditating): Take three long, deep breaths, with five counts in, and five counts out. Try not to think about anything but the breath going in and then going out. Do this two or three times a day. - Do at least five [yoga](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/balance-with-ease-yoga-routine)stretches. Moving and stretching your tight muscles can really help get you into a calm state. I recommend a standing stretch, standing forward fold, seated twist, backbend, and a seated forward fold. Forward folds are especially helpful for stress. - Think to yourself when you start to get rushed: \"I have plenty of time; there is so much time.\" This will give you the calm to do your task without being rushed. You'll be surprised by how much faster you are when you're calm! - When you get angry, repeat [this mantra](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/mantras-to-build-positive-self-talk): \"I am peaceful. I am happy. I don't let anyone change that.\" Positive affirmations go a long way. Summary 9. Go to bed early. [Shortened sleep is associated with an imbalanced gut](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668369/) [10](#citations). Getting adequate sleep\u2014 [seven to nine hours a night](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-much-sleep-do-you-need-and-what-happens-when-you-dont-get-enough) (depending on the individual!)\u2014helps overall physical and neurological health and has a significant impact on stress levels, which will give your body the rest it needs to reset your gut.
