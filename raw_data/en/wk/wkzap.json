Wake up, rush out the door, eat on the way to work, work for eight hours, run errands, make dinner, and a million other things. Regardless of how your daily routine plays out, stress is unavoidable. Does this sound like you? The good news? There are easy ways to help adapt to stress. Finding balance can be as easy as [taking a moment for self-care](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/9-self-care-techniques-that-take-10-minutes-or-less). While self-care looks different for everyone, simple practices that combine yoga and herbs can work symbiotically to help reduce stress and increase well-being. REF#1667 Couple your Daily Herbal Routine with Mindful Self-Care Practices like Yoga Whether you're new to yoga or have a steady practice, stress still has a way of inviting itself in. The combination of yoga and herbs can make an impact on reducing stress and calming nerves. REF#1667 The ultimate mind-body practice combines physical movement, intentional breathing, lifestyle choices, and [yoga](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/how-yoga-helps-you-off-the-mat). Research has shown that regularly making time for yoga can reduce stress, improve memory and cognitive skills, and support sleep quality. REF#1668 [Stress](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/sleep-stress-and-you) can often get stuck in the body and show up as tension in the jaw, neck, shoulders, and hips. Because stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, it keeps us in flight/fight/freeze mode. The rest-and-digest system (the parasympathetic nervous system) kicks in when the breath is slow and steady. Not only can a yoga practice calm the nervous system, but it can also help you bring awareness back to your body, emotions, and feelings.* Herbs can act in the same way. Naturopathic and Ayurvedic medicine both recognize the importance of nourishing the body and mind with herbal medicine and tonics to support overall health and well-being. These traditional medicine systems use medicinal herbs, including [ Ginkgo](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/ginkgo), [ Kava](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/kava), and [ St. John's Wort](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/st-johns-wort), to help support the immune system, bolster mental health, and encourage quality of life. These herbs target specific receptors and neurotransmitters, helping support a balanced mood and soothe irritation.

REF#1660 REF#1661 REF#1662 [Chamomile](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/chamomile-benefits) tea, for example, is often recommended as a natural sleep aid and can be enjoyed before bed to help promote a restful night's sleep.

While these herbal remedies are generally considered safe and have fewer side effects than pharmaceuticals, speak with a qualified herbalist or healthcare provider before beginning any new herbal regimen. It's also important to note that some herbs (such as St. John's Wort) interact with anti-depressants or other medications, so ask your doctor about any contraindications.

This grounding breathwork practice promotes focus and helps calm the body.
