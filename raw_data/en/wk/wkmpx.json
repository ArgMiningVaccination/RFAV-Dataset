In Pandemic flu of 1918-1919 we witnessed 548,000 deaths in the U.S. The shocking difference was found in mortality rate of those who used only homeopathic remedy. When General mortality rate was 30% those under homeopathic care had mortality rate of 1.05%. ------ Dr. Dean W. A. Pearson of Philadelphia, PA Homeopathic treatment is free of side effects and supports healthy state of being when \"Law of Similars\", the basic tenet of homeopathy, is followed closely. It means once you find the most matching remedy to your symptoms, the chances of getting help are much higher. (Homeo=similar, pathos=suffering) In case of epidemics, few remedies are selected on the basis of the symptoms of the existing clients and the group of remedies is called Genus Epidemicus (GE). GE can be given to the affected population group for that particular epidemic as well as for help ward off symptoms. Following information is based on the 2020-2021 flu epidemic. This regimen is applicable even for other common viral colds and flus of 2020-21. Potency (strength) and dosage needed may vary in individuals. 1. Protocol to help boost immune system throughout the flu season without symptoms: Thymuline 9c is a remedy that has been found helpful for anyone with h/o lung problems, autoimmune diseases and elderly with weak immune system. One popular protocol is one dose twice a day for 2 days followed by one once a week for three months then once a month throughout flu season. Influenzinum 30c: This homeopathic remedy helps to boost immune system thus taking this remedy may be a good strategy for people who have chosen not to get the flu vaccine. One popular protocol we recommend is taking one dose once a month for 3 months then every other month throughout the flu season. When indicated, based on symptom similarity to flu symptoms, Influenzinum may help reduce severity of flu symptoms. 2. Protocol to help boost immune system when experiencing flu or flu like symptoms: Oscillococcinum (Sold at Target, Walmart, Walgreen etc): Start immediately when symptoms of cold, cough and flu begin. Follow directions on the package. Best results are seen when you start taking Oscillococcinum in first 24 hours.
