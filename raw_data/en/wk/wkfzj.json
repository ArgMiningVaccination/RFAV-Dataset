of Florida The Honorable Ron DeSantis, Governor The Honorable Bill Galvano, President of the Senate The Honorable Jose R. Oliva, Speaker of the House of Representatives To the Citizens of Florida, Governor DeSantis, President Galvano, and Speaker Oliva: I am pleased to submit the State of Florida's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, in accordance with Section 216.102(3), Florida Statutes (F.S.). This report is prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of the information contained in this report based upon a comprehensive framework of internal control. The objective of internal control is to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The concept of reasonable assurance ensures that the costs do not exceed the benefits derived. The Auditor General has issued an opinion on the state's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The independent auditor's report is located at the front of the financial section of this report. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) immediately follows the independent auditor's report and provides a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. The MD&A complements this letter of transmittal and should be read in conjunction with it. PROFILE OF THE STATE Florida's Constitution divides the governmental structure of the state into three independent branches. The Legislative Branch has exclusive lawmaking power for the state. The Executive Branch, consisting of the Governor, Cabinet, and their agencies, administers the laws made by the Legislature. The Governor shares executive power and responsibility with the Cabinet, which is composed of the Attorney General, Chief Financial Officer, and Commissioner of Agriculture. The Judicial Branch interprets the law and applies the Constitution. The organizational chart following this letter provides an overview of the state's structure. Florida's government provides a range of services to its citizens including education, health and family services, transportation, public safety, law and corrections, natural resources and environmental protection. The financial reporting entity of the state includes the primary government as well as component units for which the state is either financially accountable or a relationship exists with the state such that exclusion would cause the financial statements to be misleading. Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements for a listing of Florida's component units and the Financial Section of the report to obtain an overview of their financial positions. Florida's budget is prepared using the processes set forth in Chapter 216, F.S. The major phases of the budget process are detailed in the Other Required Supplementary Information Section of this report. Florida law strictly prohibits overspending and requires budgetary control to be maintained at the individual appropriation account level. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES THE CAPITOL, TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA 32399-0301 (850) 413-2850 FAX (850) 413-2950February 21, 2020 Page Two ECONOMIC CONDITION Florida marked the conclusion of its tenth consecutive year of positive growth in General Fund collections in June 2019. While the state's recovery from the Great Recession was protracted, most of the key measures of the Florida economy had returned to or surpassed their prior peaks by the close of the 2016-17 fiscal year and have now moved well beyond those levels. The drags- particularly construction-have proven to be more persistent than past events, but the strength in tourism is compensating for this, allowing overall healthy economic conditions to first be achieved three years ago and continue through today. In this regard, the state's Economic Estimating Conference confirmed in mid-December that Florida's overall economy improved as expected in the first half of the 2019-20 fiscal year, although modest slowing of economic growth is expected in the latter part of the 2020 calendar year. This is largely due to national events beyond the state's control and produces a u-shaped pattern, with some variables (primarily related to construction) exhibiting stronger growth rates in fiscal year 2019-20 than in 2020-21. The key drivers underlying the Florida-specific forecasts are discussed in greater detail below. Notably, Florida's population growth and other key indicators continue to show strength. Florida's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 showed healthy growth of 3.2 percent, remaining above the national average for the sixth consecutive year. Newly released data for the second quarter (GDP for 2019:Q2) indicated some slowing in the current year, ranking Florida seventeenth in the nation in real growth and matching the national average (2.0 percent). The Economic Estimating Conference projects that Florida's GDP will grow 2.5 percent for the entire 2019-20 fiscal year, but continue slowing in the near term to 1.6 percent in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 fiscal years. In the longer term, growth is expected to average 2.0 percent per year. On the more real-time measure of personal income, the calendar year results were stronger: Florida ended 2018 with 6.2 percent growth over 2017-above the national growth rate of 5.6 percent. However, Florida's pace for the third quarter of 2019 (2019:Q3) sharply decelerated: Florida ranked 29th in the country with 3.5 percent growth over the prior quarter, which was below the reported growth of 3.8 percent for the United States as a whole. In the near term, the annual growth rates for the state are expected to drift from 5.1 percent (fiscal year 2019-20) down to 4.1 percent (2020-21 and 2022-23 fiscal years). In the longer term, growth is expected to average 4.3 percent per year. Underpinning the projected growth in personal income is continued population growth; these projections were slightly strengthened in December 2019 by the Demographic Estimating Conference. In addition, tourist visits continue to contribute strongly to Florida's economy. The Revenue Estimating Conference met in January in response to the new economic and population forecasts, indicating that the state's revenue collections for the General Fund are still expected to fall below the prior year by 0.5 percent this year; however, this is an improvement from the projected loss of 1.4 percent in August that was mostly caused by the loss of Indian Gaming revenue sharing. This improvement is largely related to the strength of collections in the first half of the fiscal year-some of which is not expected to continue through the remainder of the year. The level of employment in Florida also continues to improve from the low levels of the Great Recession. For the third quarter of the 2019 calendar year, total non-farm employment stood at just over 9.0 million jobs. The forecast indicates that non-farm employment will add approximately 237,500 jobs during the course of the 2019-20 fiscal year, representing a 2.7 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. At 3.1 percent in November, Florida's unemployment rate was 0.4 percentage point below the national rate of 3.5 percent and matched the lowest unemployment rate ever achieved in Florida (March 2006). The Economic Estimating Conference believes Florida is now below the \"full employment\" unemployment rate (about 4.0 percent), and will stay there through the 2022-23 fiscal year. While typical economic recoveries are led by increases in lending and housing construction; the recovery from the Great Recession has behaved differently in Florida. Overall, Florida's economic growth rates are healthy in spite of subdued construction activity, particularly in the residential sector. For now, tourism strength is overwhelming this persistent weakness. In the current forecast, tourism remains at record-breaking levels, while none of the key residential construction measures pass their prior peaks in the forecast horizon, an anticipated slowdown that has been built into all of the recent forecasts. Even though it remains at relatively low levels, the construction sector is improving. Single-Family building permit activity, an indicator of new construction, remains in positive territory, with strong percentage growth rates in six of the last seven calendar years. Single family data was higher than the prior year by 20.3 percent in 2015, 11.1 percent in 2016, 13.5 percent in 2017, and 13.8 percent in 2018. Despite these strong percentage growth rates, the level is still low by historic standards-just over 63 percent of the long-run per capita level. The year-to-date data for the 2019 calendar year is showing marginal growth (4.1 percent)February 21, 2020 Page Three compared to the recent past. The latest forecast calls for continuing improvement in these starts, reaching annual rates of 95.9 thousand units in the 2019-20 fiscal year and 95.9 thousand units in the 2020-21 fiscal year. To put these numbers in perspective, the peak year for single-family starts was the 2004-05 fiscal year at nearly 182 thousand units. Because the most recent sales tax forecast relies heavily on strong tourism growth, the Legislative Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR) feels tourism-related revenue losses pose the greatest potential risk to the economic outlook in the near-term. In terms of magnitude, a recent study by EDR found an estimated 13.4 percent of the state's sales tax collections for the General Fund was directly attributable to purchases made by tourists. In the new forecast, meaningful improvement in the housing market is expected to continue to lag behind the rest of Florida's economy as homeownership rates remain low, mortgage rates increase, and housing affordability becomes a challenge. The latest downward revisions to the national economic forecast for many of these measures have further slowed the construction-related growth rates seen in Florida in the recent past. This means that tourism will need to continue its outsized performance in order for the broader economic measures to stay in normal territory. According to the state's Long-Range Financial Outlook adopted in September 2019, the state is not anticipating a budget gap for the upcoming fiscal year, meaning the projected revenues should meet all anticipated needs. However, this assessment comes with one caveat. The projections for the subsequent years indicate that a structural imbalance is beginning to occur and that the Legislature will need to take future action to head it off. Of note, the nature of the problem has changed over the past year. In the 2018 Outlook, the recurring General Revenue demands exceeded the amount of recurring General Revenue available in the outer years. This year, there is no visible recurring issue, but the projected out-year deficits remain. In addition, the Long-Range Financial Outlook identifies potential future obligations of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and Citizens Property Insurance Corporation as significant risks to the forecast. Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information related to the state's insurance enterprises. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Preparation of the CAFR requires a significant investment of time and resources of fiscal and accounting personnel throughout the state. We appreciate all the contributions made to this effort.

Norman, CPA Auditor General AUDITOR GENERAL STATE OF FLORIDA Claude Denson Pepper Building, Suite G74 111 West Madison Street Tallahassee, Florida 32399-1450 The President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Auditing Committee INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financ ial statements of the governmental ac tivities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the State of Florida, as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Stat e's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. Management's Responsibility fo r the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair pr esentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally ac cepted in the United States of Am erica; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control releva nt to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misst atement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express opin ions on these financial statements base d on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of: The Prepaid College Program Fund, which is a major enterprise fund and represents 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the assets and revenues of the business-type activities. The Florida Turnpike System, which represents 80 pe rcent and 89 percent, respectively, of the assets and revenues of the Transportation major enterprise fund. The Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which is a ma jor enterprise fund and represents 30 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of the assets and re venues of the business-type activities. The College Savings Plan and the trust fund maintained by the State Board of Admi nistration to account for the investments of the Public Employee Optiona l Retirement Program, whic h collectively represent 6 percent of the assets and 3 per cent of the revenues/additions of the aggregate remaining fund information. The Florida Retirement System Trust Fund maintained by the State Board of Admi nistration to account for the assets and investment income of the Florida Re tirement System Defined Benefit Pension Plan which represent 91 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of the assets and additions of the Pension and Other Employee Benefits Trust Funds. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, component units related to the State's universities and colleges, and ce rtain other funds and entities that, in the aggregate, represent 62 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of t he assets and revenues of the discretely presented component units. The financial statements for the above-li sted funds and entities were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinions, insofar as they relate to the amounts included for these funds and entities, are based solely on the reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and t he standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of t he United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit ev idence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor' s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the ent ity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting polic ies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Opinions In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business- type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the State of Flori da, as of June 30, 2019, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the fiscal year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unit ed States of America. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 1 and Note 10 to the financial statements, the State implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct Placements , which is a change in accounting principle that provides for additional note disclosures. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, cert ain State universities' compone nt units changed from the Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting and financial framework to the GASB accounting and financial framework. This affects the compar ability of amounts reported by the State universities' component units for the 2018-19 fiscal year with amounts reported for the 2017-18 fiscal year. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United St ates of America require that management's discussion and analysis on pages 16 through 21 and the budgetary info rmation, funding and contribution information for pension and other postemployment benefits, and informat ion on infrastructure using the modified approach on pages 180 through 193 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appr opriate operational, economic, or historical context. We and other auditors have applied certain limited proc edures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing t he information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic finan cial statements, and other kn owledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or prov ide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Supplementary and Other Information Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the State's basic financial statements. The Introductory Section on pages 6 through 9 and the combining and individual fund statements, related budgetary comparison schedules, and Statistical Section on pages 197 through 315 are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund statements and related budgetary comparison schedul es are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The combining and individual fund stat ements and related budgetary comparison schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additi onal procedures, including comparing and reconc iling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare t he basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additi onal procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America by us and other auditors. In our opinion, based on our audit, the procedures performed as described above, and the r eports of the other auditors, the comb ining and individual fund statements and related budgetary comparison schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. The Introductory Section and the Statistical Section have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statemen ts and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our r eport dated February 21, 2020, on our consideration of the State's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, administrative rules, regulations , contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to de scribe the scope of our testing of inter nal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the State's internal control over financial reporting and compliance. That report will be included as pa rt of our separately issued report entitled State of Florida Compliance and Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting and Federal Awards . Respectfully submitted, Sherrill F. Norman, CPA Tallahassee, Florida February 21, 2020 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The information contained in the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) introduces the basic financial statements and provides an analytical overview of the State of Florida's (the state's) financial activities and performance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 (fiscal year 2018-19). Please read the MD&A in conjunction with the state's financial statements that are presented in the Financial Section of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). Financial Statements Overview The state's basic financial statements are comprised of the following elements: Government-wide Financial Statements Government-wide financial statements provide both long-term and short-term information about the state's overall financial condition. Changes in the state's financial position may be measured over time by increases and decreases in the Statement of Net Position. Information on how the state's net position changed during the fiscal year is presented in the Statement of Activities. Financial information for the state's component units is also presented. Fund Financial Statements Fund financial statements for governmental and proprietary funds focus on individual parts of the state, reporting the state's operations in more detail than the government-wide financial statements. Fund financial statements for fiduciary funds are also included to provide financial information related to the state's fiduciary activities. Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to the full understanding of the government-wide and fund financial statements. Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements for more information on the elements of the financial statements. Table 1 below summarizes the major features of the basic financial statements.

The state's net position at the close of the fiscal year was $66.8 billion for governmental activities and $30.8 billion for business-type activities which was a combined total of $97.6 billion for the primary government. The three components of net position include net investments in capital assets; restricted; and unrestricted. The largest component, totaling $83.8 billion as of June 30, 2019, reflects net investments in capital assets. The state uses these capital assets to provide services to the citizens and businesses in the state; consequently, this component of net position is not available for future spending. Restricted net position is the next largest component, totaling $28.9 billion as of June 30, 2019. Restricted net position represents resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. Governmental activities reflect a negative or deficit fund balance in unrestricted net position of $16.2 billion at June 30, 2019. This deficit primarily results from education-related bonds for which the state is responsible for the liability while the related assets are owned by local school districts and are therefore not included in the state's financial statements. Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements, Governmental Activities - Unrestricted Net Position Deficit, for more information. Business-type activities reflect a restricted net position of $18.7 billion at June 30, 2019, a decrease of $1.3 billion over the prior year. The decrease in the restricted net position over that reported in prior years is explained in the Major Fund Analysis, Proprietary Funds section that follows.

Over time, increases and decreases in the net position measure whether the state's financial position is improving or deteriorating. The state's total net position increased during the fiscal year by $3.6 billion. The net position of governmental activities increased by $4.3 billion, and the net position of business-type activities decreased by $696 million. The majority of the increase in total program expenses for governmental activities relates to a $760 million increase in General Government expense after an offsetting $1.1 billion increase and decrease in Education and Human Services expenses, respectively, while the largest increase in business-type activities expenses is the $1.4 billion increase in Hurricane Catastrophe Fund program expenses. Refer to the Major Fund Analysis section for information regarding the overall increase in revenues from governmental activities.

Revenues increased by $ 2.1 billion or 2.6 percent, other financing sources and uses increased by $360 million or 13.2 percent, and expenditures increased by $ 1.0 billion or 1.2 percent. Overall increases in revenues and expenditures were primarily attributable to a rise in tax revenues. Proprietary Funds The state's proprietary funds report combined ending net position of $30.8 billion at June 30, 2019, of which $10.9 billion is the net investment in capital assets, and $18.7 billion is restricted for specific purposes. The remaining $1.1 billion was unrestricted and available for purposes of the various funds. Information is provided below regarding major funds with significant variances relative to the prior year. Lottery - This fund reported a net position of $85 million at June 30, 2019, an increase of $36 million or 75.3 percent. Revenues increased by $488 million or 7.3 percent while expenses and operating transfers out increased by $446 million or 6.6 percent. Revenues increased as result of an increase on ticket sales, prompted by higher jackpots and introduction of new games during the fiscal year. The increase in expenses and operating transfers out were due to higher ticket sales, which increased related prize expense and transfers to the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. Also, the increase in net position was due to an increase in the market value of investments. Hurricane Catastrophe Fund - The net position at June 30, 2019 , totaled $10.3 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion or 18.99 percent. Revenues increased by $312 million or 23.8 percent while expenses and operating transfers out increased by $1.4 billion or 55.8 percent. The decrease in net position was primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase for the recorded loss reserves for Hurricanes Irma and Michael. Revenues increased over the prior year, primarily due to a $327 million increase in investment income. This increase mainly resulted from changes made to the Fund's guidelines allowing for longer investment maturities. Prepaid College Program - The net position at June 30, 2019, totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of $747 million or 25.3 percent. Revenues increased by $1.1 billion or 176.9 percent while expenses increased by $967 million or 1,948.0 percent. The increase in net position was primarily due to an increase in the market value of invested assets. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in investment income from the fixed income investments and increase in the actuarial determination of the present value of future contract premiums, both resulted from a declining treasury rate environment. Expenses increased over the prior year primarily because of an increase in actuarial determination of the present value of future benefit payments, also as a result of a declining treasury rate environment. General Fund Budget Variances Budgeted expenditures are based on revenues estimated by the Revenue Estimating Conference and other sources. Original expenditures are budgeted for less than total expected available resources. There was a $706 million increase between the original and final estimated revenues. Final budgeted total expenditures increased by $899 million from the original budget. Variances between the original and final budget or between the final budgeted and actual amounts are not expected to significantly affect future services or liquidity. For additional information on the budget variances, refer to the Budgetary Comparison Schedule for the General Fund in the Other Required Supplementary Information section of the CAFR. Capital Asset and Long-term Debt Activity Capital Asset Activity At June 30, 2019, the state reported $78.5 billion in net capital assets for governmental activities and $14.1 billion in net capital assets for business-type activities. Net capital assets for governmental and business-type activities increased from fiscal year 2017-18 to fiscal year 2018-19 by approximately 3.5 percent. The increase is primarily due to the capitalization of construction costs for infrastructure projects. Capitalized infrastructure projects include additions to and/or enhancements of roadways and bridges on the state's highway system. Construction commitments by the Florida Department of Transportation were approximately $14.8 billion. Construction commitments by other state agencies for major projects including office buildings and correctional facilities increased by $16 million compared to the prior year. Refer to Note 5 to the financial statements for information on capital assets and Note 7 to the financial statements for information on construction commitments. Long-term Debt Activity Total bonded debt outstanding decreased by $915 million, or approximately 4.7 percent, from the prior fiscal year to a total of $18.7 billion at June 30, 2019 due to new debt issued being less than scheduled amortization and debt service payments. The majority of the outstanding bonded debt serves to finance educational facilities ($9.8 billion), the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ($2.2 billion) and transportation ($5.1 billion). New and refinanced bonded debt issues for 2019 totaled $2.5 billion. Public-2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 19Private Partnership (PPP) contracts outstanding increased from the prior year by $222 million or 8.3 percent to a total of $2.9 billion. The annual debt service requirements decreased from $2.3 billion in 2018 to $2.0 billion in 2019 . The decrease in debt service in Fiscal Year 2019 reflected the impact of PPP payments. The annual debt service is projected to increase to approximately $2.3 billion though Fiscal Year 2022, then decrease to approximately $1.9 billion in Fiscal Year 2023, reflecting the payment obligations for the PPP I-395 and I-4 Projects. Pursuant to the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68 - Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions - an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27 , the State of Florida recorded $7.7 billion in pension liabilities for the defined benefit plans it administers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The $7.7 billion includes the State's proportionate share of the liability for the Florida Retirement System Pension Plan, the Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy Program, and the Florida National Guard Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan. (See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for further information.) Pursuant to the provisions of GASB Statement No. 75 - Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions , the State of Florida recorded $7.8 billion in other postemployment benefit liabilities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. This resulted in a decrease of $192 million or 2.4 percent. (See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for further information.) The state maintained its credit ratings during the past year. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 , all three major rating agencies (Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Services) rated the state in the highest rating category and have affirmed the State's AAA general obligation rating and Stable outlooks. The state's benchmark debt ratio improved in Fiscal Year 2019 to 4.64 percent and is projected to remain below the 6 percent policy target for the foreseeable future. Section 11 of Article VII of the State Constitution authorizes the state to issue general obligation bonds or revenue bonds to finance or refinance fixed capital outlay projects authorized by law. General obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of the state and payable from specified taxes. Revenue bonds are payable solely from specified revenues. The responsibility to issue most state bonds rests with the Division of Bond Finance of the State Board of Administration. However, certain quasi-governmental entities also incur debt and are reported as part of the primary government. See the State of Florida 2019 Debt Report for more detailed information about the state's debt position. The report can be found at www.sbafla.com/bondfinance or by contacting the Division of Bond Finance, 1801 Hermitage Boulevard, Suite 200, Tallahassee, Florida 32308, (850) 488-4782. Additional information on long-term debt is also found in Notes 6, 8, 9, and 10 to the financial statements and the Statistical Section of this report. Infrastructure Accounted for Using the Modified Approach The state elected to use the modified approach to account for roadways, bridges, and other infrastructure assets of the State Highway System. Under this approach, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) committed to maintain these assets at levels established by FDOT and approved by the Florida Legislature. No depreciation expense is reported for these assets, nor are amounts capitalized in connection with improvements that lengthen the lives of such assets, unless the improvements also increase their service potential. FDOT maintains an inventory of these assets and performs periodic assessments to establish that predetermined condition levels are being maintained. The condition assessments performed during fiscal year 2018-19 show that the roadways and bridges of the State Highway System are being maintained at or near FDOT standards. These condition assessments were consistent with condition assessments conducted during past years. In addition, FDOT makes annual estimates of the amounts that must be expended to maintain the roadways and bridges included on the State Highway System at the predetermined condition levels. These estimates are based on the FDOT five-year plan that is revised as projects are added, deleted, adjusted, or postponed. Refer to the Other Required Supplementary Information of the CAFR for information on FDOT's established condition standards, recent condition assessments, and other information on infrastructure reported on the modified approach. Economic Factors General Fund tax collections for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, came in 5.8 percent higher than the prior fiscal year, the highest level of growth seen since fiscal year 2012-13 when an unexpected large payment from the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement boosted collections. Ten years after the back-to-back negative growth rates seen during the collapse of the housing boom and entry into the Great Recession, Florida has left its long recovery period behind and returned to normalcy on nearly every measure. However, the growth in final collections going forward will be negatively affected by the loss of the Indian Gaming revenue share payment. The last payment was received from the Seminole Tribe in April 2019. This means that the growth rate for fiscal year 2018-19 is at the top-end of the range moving toward the 3.5 percent annual growth projected for the long-run. Most (59.0 percent) of the year-over-year net increase in General Fund receipts (total revenue minus refunds) came from gains in sales tax collections. For fiscal year 2018-19, this revenue source noticeably increased its dominant share of the fund, ending the year with 67.9 percent of total revenue received. As the economy remained strong with gains in the state's Gross Domestic Product and personal income over the prior year, signs of a fully recovered economy were clear in the widespread improvement across all areas of sales tax collections (nondurables, tourism and recreation, autos and accessories, other durables, building investment and business investment). Total sales tax liability grew a solid 5.3 percent from fiscal year 2017-18 to fiscal year 2018-19. This equates to $1.40 billion in growth for this source, with nearly $1.25 billion flowing through to the General Fund.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 20Including sales tax, just over three-fourths of the state's general revenue sources posted gains over the prior year, with a few continuing to make progress against strong headwinds. In this respect, several key revenue sources have continued to track the ebb and flow of the state's one lagging sector, the construction industry. Among them, documentary stamp and intangibles tax collections predominantly rely on activity in the state's real estate market. After the end of the housing boom in 2005-06, Florida's sizable inventory of unsold homes, home prices discounted for quick sale, and towering foreclosures hindered a return to normal conditions in the real-estate market. Thirteen years after the boom's peak, each metric still has a unique story to tell. For statewide existing single-family home sales and their associated median sales price, the magnitude of the growth was uneven with sales growing 3 percent and the median price growing 4.4 percent. This divergence is expected to be even greater in the 2019-20 fiscal year (8.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively). The results also remained in positive territory for single-family private housing starts (up 6.7 percent) and total construction expenditures (up 2.8 percent), with the expected growth in both categories softening in fiscal year 2019-20. However, with the major drivers all showing gains in fiscal year 2018-19, total documentary stamp taxes grew 5.2 percent. This growth brought documentary stamp taxes to 65.3 percent of their prior peak in fiscal year 2005-06. Reflecting a slightly different aspect of the market, intangibles tax collections, which entirely benefit the General Fund, strengthened as refinancing activity responded to low interest rates, ultimately posting a 3.8 percent gain over the prior year. Overall, the collection levels are still low by historic standards for the two sources, sometimes distorting the magnitude of percentage changes. As a result of the federal law changes passed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Florida saw significantly higher collections from its Corporate Income Tax during fiscal year 2018-19. Corporate Income Tax receipts exceeded the monthly estimates adopted by the state's Revenue Estimating Conference in eleven of the twelve months in the fiscal year, making this source the state's second strongest contributor to real revenue growth. Moving well above their prior peak collection level in fiscal year 2006-07, corporate income tax receipts (prior to refunds) posted 30.1 percent growth over fiscal year 2017-18. After accounting for corporate refunds, net collections had even stronger growth of 31.4 percent. In anticipation of the higher collection rate resulting from the federal legislation, the Florida Legislature passed Chapter 2018-119, L.O.F. (HB 7093) which had the practical effect of retroactively reducing the tax rate for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, if net collections exceed forecasted collections by at least seven percent during fiscal year 2018-2019. The provisions in this bill were only effective for one year, but the Legislature has since extended these provisions to additional years. At the end of the 2018-19 state fiscal year, net General Fund collections were $507.2 million above the estimate for the year, a gain of 1.5 percent and over the plus or minus one percent range the Conference usually attributes to statistical noise. However, this was largely due to the induced outsized performance of the Corporate Income Tax. Removing Corporate Income Tax from the calculation shows that the state otherwise would have had its fourth consecutive year of ending the fiscal year within one percent of the estimate, signaling the underlying stability in the economy. Further, General Fund sources collectively performed better than the class of total revenue for the state. Including federal dollars and state trust funds, total revenue increased by 7.4 percent over this period. The Revenue Estimating Conference last met in January 2020 to revise the General Fund forecast for fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21. The near-term National and Florida Economic Forecasts were weaker in several key areas compared to August; however, revenue collections had run above monthly estimates by a combined $414.9 million since the last conference. Focusing on the year-to-date gains to the forecast, anticipated revenues were revised upward by $306.0 million in fiscal year 2019-20 and by $86.0 million in fiscal year 2020-21, for a two-year total of $392.0 million, a change of less than one percent (0.9%) in fiscal year 2019-20 and less than one-half of one percent (0.3%) in fiscal year 2020-21. The relatively small size of the increase recognizes that there is an elevated level of risk to any forecast due to the mature stage of the current economic expansion and geopolitical pressures to global growth. As a buffer against future financial shocks, the latest General Revenue Outlook shows that there will be just over $1.934 billion in unallocated general revenue remaining at the end of the current fiscal year. In addition, the state's major reserve for emergencies, the Budget Stabilization Fund, has a planned balance of $1.574 billion on June 30, 2020. The fund cash balance is now at the highest recorded level in its history. The other source most frequently mentioned as part of the state's informal reserve system is the Lawton Chiles Endowment Fund (LCEF). The LCEF had an estimated market value of $812.0 million as of October 31, 2019, bringing the total of all reserves to nearly $4.320 billion or 13.0 percent of the state's estimated General Fund tax collections for the current year (after payment of refunds). According to the state's Long-Range Financial Outlook adopted in September 2019, the state is not anticipating a budget gap for the upcoming fiscal year, meaning the projected revenues should meet all anticipated needs. However, this assessment comes with one caveat. The projections for the subsequent years indicate that a structural imbalance is beginning to occur and that the Legislature will need to take future action. Of note, the nature of the problem has changed over the past year. In the 2018 Outlook, the recurring General Revenue demands exceeded the amount of recurring General Revenue available in the outer years. This year, there is no visible recurring issue, but the projected out-year deficits remain.

Therefore, the net revenue (expense) of the internal service funds is reported with governmental activities. (43,632 ) Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the Statement of Activities the cost of these assets is allocated over the estimated useful lives of the assets and reported as depreciation expense. This is the amount by which capital outlay expenditures exceeded depreciation in the current period. Capital outlay expenditures 3,290,372 Capital asset transfers, net (174,302) Depreciation expense (285,825) 2,830,245 In the Statement of Activities, the gain or (loss) on the sale of assets is reported whereas in the governmental funds only the proceeds from the sale increase financial resources. Thus, the change in net position differs from the change in fund balances by the cost of the assets sold. (345,879 ) In the Statement of Activities, some revenues are recognized that do not provide current financial resources and are not recognized as revenues in the governmental funds until available, i.e., deferred inflows of resources, unavailable revenue. 73,142 Some expenses reported in the Statement of Activities do not require the use of current financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures in governmental funds.

Neither transaction has any effect on net position. Also, governmental funds report the effect of premiums, discounts, deferred amounts on refundings when debt is issued, whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized in the Statement of Activities.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Reporting Entity The State of Florida's (the state's) financial reporting entity includes the primary government (i.e., legislative agencies, the Governor and Cabinet, departments and agencies, commissions and boards of the Executive Branch, and various offices relating to the Judicial Branch) and its component units. Component units, as defined in Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification Section 2100, Defining the Financial Reporting Entity, and Section 2600, Reporting Entity and Component Unit Presentation and Disclosure, are legally separate organizations for which the elected officials of the state are financially accountable. Financial accountability is the ability of the state to appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing board and to impose its will upon the organization. When the state does not appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body, GASB standards require inclusion in the financial reporting entity if: (1) an organization is fiscally dependent upon the state because its resources are held for the direct benefit of the state or can be accessed by the state and (2) the potential exists for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on the state. In addition, component units can be other organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the state are such that exclusion would cause the state's financial statements to be misleading. Blended Component Units A component unit is reported as blended when either (1) the component unit's governing body is substantively the same as the governing body of the state, and (a) there is a financial benefit or burden relationship between the governing body of the state and the component unit, or (b) management of the governing body of the state has operational responsibility for the component unit, or (2) the component unit provides services entirely, or almost entirely, to the state or otherwise exclusively, or almost exclusively, benefits the state, or (3) the component unit's outstanding debt is expected to be repaid entirely or almost entirely with resources of the state. The following component units provide services entirely or almost entirely to the primary government, or have outstanding debt that is expected to be paid entirely or almost entirely with state resources: CareerSource Florida, Inc. Corrections Foundation, Inc. Florida Board of Governors Florida Citrus Commission (Department of Citrus) Florida Clerks of Court Operations Corporation Florida Commission on Community Service (V olunteer Florida) Florida Department of Transportation Financing Corporation Florida Engineers Management Corporation Florida Intergovernmental Relations Foundation* Florida Prepaid College Board Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind Florida Surplus Lines Service Office Florida Water Pollution Control Financing Corporation Inland Protection Financing Corporation Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Foundation* Scripps Florida Funding Corporation Space Florida State Board of Administration (SBA) State Board of Education (SBE) Wireless Emergency Telephone System Blended component units that are considered major funds are reported in separate columns in the fund financial statements. Other blended component units that are considered non-major funds are reported with other funds in the appropriate columns in the fund financial statements. In addition, the financial data for some blended component units are reported in more than one fund type, some of which are considered major and others that are considered non-major. Refer to Section D of this note for more information on the determination criteria for major funds and a list of major funds and fund types.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 58* The state's financial statements do not include amounts relating to these component units. The assets of these component units at June 30, 2019, are approximately $1,584,332. Discretely Presented Component Units Component units that are not blended are discretely presented. In the government-wide financial statements, discrete presentation entails reporting component unit financial data in a column separate from the financial data of the state. In addition, financial data for discretely presented component units that are considered major are reported in separate columns in the basic financial statements for component units. Discretely presented component units that are considered non-major are combined and reported in one column in the component unit financial statements and are aggregated by type in the combining statements. The state's financial statements are reported for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The state's component units' financial statements are reported for the most recent fiscal year for which an audit report is available. Some component units have a fiscal year other than June 30. Accordingly, amounts reported by the state as due from and to component units on the statement of net position may not agree with amounts reported by the component units as due from and to the state. Refer to Section D of this note for more information on major fund determination and presentation. The state's discretely presented component units are grouped into the following categories: State Universities and Colleges. State universities and colleges receive funding from the state. The State University System is governed by the Florida Board of Governors. The Florida College System is governed by the State Board of Education. Each university and college is administered by a local board of trustees. All state universities and colleges have a June 30 year-end. Component units included in this category are: State Universities Major: University of Florida1 Non-major: Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University Florida Atlantic University Florida Gulf Coast University Florida International University Florida Polytechnic University Florida State University New College of Florida University of Central Florida University of North Florida University of South Florida University of West Florida Florida College System Institutions Non-major: Broward College Chipola College College of Central Florida Daytona State College Eastern Florida State College Florida Gateway College The College of the Florida Keys Florida State College at Jacksonville Florida SouthWestern State College Gulf Coast State College Hillsborough Community College Indian River State College Lake-Sumter State College Miami Dade College North Florida College Northwest Florida State College Palm Beach State College2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 59 Pasco-Hernando State College Pensacola State College Polk State College Santa Fe College Seminole State College of Florida South Florida State College St. Johns River State College St. Petersburg College State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota Tallahassee Community College Valencia College 1 Significant transactions occurring during the 2018-19 fiscal year between the University of Florida and the state totaled $875 million.

These amounts represent less than one percent of total aggregate component unit assets and revenues. Joint Ventures A joint venture is an organization that results from a contractual arrangement and that is owned, operated, or governed by two or more participants as a separate and specific activity subject to joint control, in which the participants retain (1) an ongoing financial interest or (2) an ongoing financial responsibility. Financial data for the state's joint ventures are not included in its statements. The state's joint ventures include the following: Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACFRB) Commission. Section 373.69, F.S., provided for the creation of an interstate administrative agency to promote interstate comity, remove causes of present and future controversies, equitably apportion the surface waters of the ACFRB, and engage in water planning. Operational funding required by the Commission is equally shared among the party states. Board of Control for Southern Regional Education. Section 1000.32, F.S., promotes the development and maintenance of regional education services and facilities in the southern states to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens in the region. The states established a joint agency called the Board of Control for Southern Regional Education to submit plans and recommendations to the states from time to time for their approval and adoption by appropriate legislative action for the development, establishment, acquisition, operation, and maintenance of educational facilities in the region. Regional Planning Councils. Sections 186.501 through 186.513, F.S., the \"Florida Regional Planning Council Act,\" provide for the creation of regional planning agencies to assist local governments in resolving their common problems. The regional planning councils are designated as the primary organizations to address problems and plan solutions that are of greater-than-local concern or scope. Participants in these councils are required by statutes to contribute to the support of these programs. Southern States Energy Compact. Section 377.711, F.S., enacted this compact into law joining the State of Florida and other states to recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy, and the employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products can assist substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy in the region. The State of Florida appropriates funds to support Florida's participation in the compact. Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators. Section 464.0095, F.S., enacted this compact into law joining the State of Florida and other states with the general purpose to facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety with regard to nurse licensure and regulation. This compact is additionally purposed with facilitating the exchange of information among party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions, promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing, and decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses. Related Organizations Organizations for which the state is accountable because the state appoints a voting majority of the board, but for which the state is not financially accountable, are deemed \"related organizations.\" The state's related organizations include certain transportation authorities, hospital districts, port authorities, aviation authorities and a financing corporation. The state is not financially accountable for any of these organizations; therefore, applicable financial data is not included in the state's financial statements.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 61Contact Financial statements of the component units that issue separate statements and other financial statement-related information may be obtained from: Department of Financial Services Bureau of Financial Reporting Statewide Financial Reporting Section 200 East Gaines Street Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0364 Telephone: (850) 413-5511 Department Website: http://www.myfloridacfo.com Joint ventures may be contacted directly for their financial statements. B. Basic Financial Statements The state's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as prescribed by GASB. The basic financial statements of the state, including its component units, are presented in the required format discussed below. Government-wide Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported separately from its discretely presented component units. The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable to a specific function. Some functions may include administrative overhead that is essentially indirect expenses of other functions. The state currently does not allocate those indirect expenses to other functions. Program revenues include: (1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function; (2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational requirements of a particular function; and (3) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the capital requirements of a particular function. Taxes and other items not included in program revenues are reported in general revenues. Fund Financial Statements Separate fund financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statements. C. Basis of Accounting The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are recorded when earned, while expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as they become susceptible to accrual, generally when they are both measurable and available. Revenues collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year are considered available, with the exception of certain tax revenues, which are considered available when collected within 30 days of year-end. For governmental funds, certain long-term liabilities, such as compensated absences, due within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year are expected to be liquidated with expendable financial resources and are recognized within the applicable governmental fund. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, expenditures for insurance and similar services extending over more than one fiscal year generally are accounted for as expenditures of the fiscal year of acquisition. Further, principal and interest on general long-term debt are recognized when due.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 62D. Basis of Presentation Major Funds GASB Codification Section 2200, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, sets forth minimum criteria (percentage of the total assets and deferred outflows of resources, total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, revenues, or expenditures/expenses for either fund category or the governmental and enterprise funds combined) for the determination of major funds. GASB Codification Section 2200 further requires that the reporting government's main operating fund (the General Fund) always be reported as a major fund. Major individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements. The non-major funds are combined in a column in the fund financial statements and detailed in the combining statements. The state reports the following major funds: Major Governmental Funds General Fund - a fund that accounts for the financial resources of the state, except those required to be accounted for in another fund. This is the state's primary operating fund. Natural Resources, Environment, and Growth Management - a special revenue fund that accounts for the operations of various programs such as air pollution control, water quality assurance, ecosystem management, and marine resources conservation. Transfers from other funds, pollutant tax collections, and federal grants are its major sources of revenue. Prior to 6/30/2018, this fund was reported as the Environment, Recreation, and Conservation Fund. Public Education - a special revenue fund that includes funds used to operate education-related programs. Significant sources of revenue for this fund are federal grants, transfers from the Florida Lottery, and utility taxes. Health and Family Services - a special revenue fund that includes funds used to operate various health and family service-related programs such as health care, elder affairs, and public assistance. Federal grants are the predominant sources of revenue for this fund. Transportation - a special revenue fund that accounts for the maintenance and development of the state highway system and other transportation-related projects. It accounts for federal grants, motor fuel and aviation fuel taxes, automobile registration fees, and other revenues that are used for transportation purposes. Major Business-type Funds Transportation - an enterprise fund that primarily accounts for operations of Florida's Turnpike System. Lottery - an enterprise fund that accounts for state lottery operations, which include sale of lottery tickets, payment of lottery prizes, and transfers to the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund - an enterprise fund that accounts for operations of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which was created to help cover insurers' losses in the event of a hurricane disaster. Prepaid College Program - an enterprise fund that accounts for payments from purchasers of the Florida Prepaid College Program. This program was created to provide a medium through which the cost of state post-secondary education may be paid in advance of enrollment at a rate lower than the projected corresponding costs at the time of enrollment. Reemployment Assistance - an enterprise fund that accounts for contributions, benefit payments, grants, loans, and investments for the Unemployment Compensation Fund, which was created to pay reemployment assistance benefits to eligible individuals. Fund Types Additionally, the state reports the following fund types: Internal Service Funds These proprietary-type funds are primarily used to report activities that provide goods or services to other funds or agencies within the state, rather than to the general public. Internal service funds are classified into the following categories: Employee Health and Disability - includes funds that account for state employees' health and disability plans. Data Centers - includes funds that account for services provided by data processing centers operated by various agencies.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 63Communications and Facilities - includes funds that primarily account for services provided by the Department of Management Services such as those related to the construction, operation, and maintenance of public facilities, and management and operation of the SUNCOM (state communication) Network. Other - includes funds that account for services provided to other state agencies such as legal services, records management, and community services (inmate work squads). Fiduciary Fund Types Fiduciary funds are used to report assets held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and, therefore, cannot be used to support the state's own programs. Private-Purpose Trust Funds - funds that are used to report trust arrangements under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments including funds accounting for unclaimed property, federally guaranteed higher education loans, contributions to a college savings plan, and various others. Pension and Other Employee Benefits Trust Funds - funds that are used to report resources that are required to be held in trust for the members and beneficiaries of the state's pension plans and other employee benefit plans. Agency Funds - funds that are used to report resources held by the state in a purely custodial capacity. For example, these funds account for asset and liability balances related to retiree health care, taxes collected and held by the Department of Revenue for other entities, and student funds held by the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind. Investment Trust Funds - funds that are used to report the external portion of investment pools reported by the state. E. Assets, Deferred Outflows of Resources, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position/Fund Balance Cash and Cash Equivalents The state's cash includes cash on hand and on deposit in banks, including demand deposits, certificates of deposit, and time deposits. Most deposits are held by financial institutions qualified as public depositories under Florida law. Cash equivalents are short- term, highly liquid investments. For the purposes of GASB Codification Section 2450, Cash Flows Statements , pooled investments with the State Treasury are considered cash equivalents. Details of deposits are included in Note 2. Investments Florida Statutes authorize the state to invest in various instruments. The state reports investments in accordance with GASB Codification Section I50, Investments. Investments with the State Treasury are reported at fair value which is obtained from independent pricing service providers. Independent pricing service providers use quoted market prices when available and employ various, sometimes proprietary, multifactor models for determining a security's fair value if it is not available from quoted market prices. Some securities, including U.S. government, municipal bonds, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, are priced using evaluated bid prices. Evaluated bid prices are determined by taking bid prices and adjusting them by an evaluated adjustment factor derived from the independent pricing service's multifactor model. If values are not available using the above methods, secondary methods such as non-evaluated mid-price and bid price are used. If no source of values is available, cost or last available price from any source is used, or other pricing methodology as directed by the State Treasury. Investments managed by the State Board of Administration (SBA) are reported in various funds. Investments of the Debt Service Escrowed Fund, which meet the requirements of a legal or in-substance defeasance, are reported at cost. Investments of the Local Government Surplus Funds Trust Fund are reported based on amortized cost. Other investments managed by the SBA, including those related to the state's defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, are reported at fair value at the reporting date. For SBA-managed investments, fair values are obtained or estimated in accordance with the Global Pricing Guidelines established with the SBA's custodian, BNY Mellon Bank. BNY Mellon Bank uses a variety of independent pricing vendors and designates certain vendors as the primary source based on asset type, class or issue. BNY Mellon Bank monitors prices supplied by primary sources and may use a supplemental price source or change the primary price source if any of the following occurs: The price of a security is not received from the primary price source. The primary price source no longer prices a particular asset type, class or issue. The SBA or its portfolio investment manager challenges a price and BNY Mellon Bank reviews the price with the vendor, who agrees that the price provided by that vendor may not be appropriate.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 64 The price from the primary source exceeds BNY Mellon Bank's price tolerance checkpoints and results in a vendor comparison review where another source is deemed to be more appropriate by the BNY Mellon Bank. When a portfolio includes securities or instruments for which BNY Mellon Bank does not receive fair value information from its vendor price sources, BNY Mellon Bank uses a \"non-vendor price source.\" Examples include, but are not limited to, limited partnerships or similar private investment vehicles that do not actively trade through established exchange mechanisms; other private placements where there is limited or no information in the market place; and unique fixed income and equity instruments. The SBA does not provide direction regarding the substitution of prices in such instances where securities or instruments are in the portfolio of an investment manager appointed by the SBA. In such cases where the SBA directed the purchase of such securities or instruments, BNY Mellon may obtain the non-vendor prices by contacting the SBA only if it is not commercially reasonable to directly obtain the non-vendor price information from the broker of record, as identified by the SBA. For private market investments, where no readily ascertainable market value exists (including limited partnerships, hedge funds, directly-owned real estate, and real estate pooled funds), fair values for the individual investments are based on the net asset value (capital account balance) at the closest available reporting period, as communicated by the general partner and/or investment manager, adjusted for subsequent contributions and distributions. The valuation techniques vary based upon investment type and involve a certain degree of judgment. The most significant input into the net asset value of an entity is the value of its investment holdings. The net asset value is provided by the general partner and/or investment manager and reviewed by management. Annually, the financial statements of all private market investments are audited by independent auditors. Private market investments in which the SBA has a controlling interest are also required to be valued annually by independent, licensed external appraisers selected by an appraisal management company retained by the SBA. All derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value in the statements of net position. The instruments are adjusted to fair value at least monthly, with valuation changes recognized in investment earnings. Gains and losses are recorded in the statements of changes in net position as \"net increase (decrease) in fair market value\" during the period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation using pricing methodologies other than the quoted market prices, the estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed. Investment detail is included in Note 2. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of expendable supplies. Inventories are recorded according to the consumption method as expenditures when consumed. At the end of the fiscal year, inventory is reported as an asset and identified in fund balance as non-spendable. The method used to determine the cost of inventories varies by agency responsible for the inventories. Capital Assets Capital assets are real, personal, and intangible property that have a cost equal to or greater than an established capitalization threshold and have an estimated useful life extending beyond one year. For additional information, refer to Note 5. Deferred Outflows of Resources A consumption of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period is presented as a deferred outflow of resources. Long-term Liabilities Refer to Note 6 for information on pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) liabilities; Note 8 for information on bonds payable and certificates of participation; Note 9 for information on installment purchases, capital leases, and public-private partnership agreements; and Note 10 for changes in long-term liabilities. Compensated Absences Liability Employees earn the right to be compensated during absences for vacation and illness, as well as, for unused special compensatory leave earned for hours worked on legal holidays and other specifically authorized overtime. Compensated absences for annual leave are recorded as a liability when the benefits are earned. Compensated absences for sick leave are calculated based on the vesting method. Within the limits established by law or rule, the value of unused leave benefits will be paid to employees upon separation from state service. The amounts reported for compensated absences are based on current year-end salary rates and include employer Social Security and Medicare tax and pension contributions at current rates.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 65Deferred Inflows of Resources A deferred inflow of resources is an acquisition of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. Components of Net Position The government-wide statement of net position classifies net position into the following categories: (1) net investment in capital assets, (2) restricted, and (3) unrestricted. The \"net investment in capital assets\" component of net position consists of capital assets, including restricted capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances of any bonds, mortgages, notes, or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. \"Restricted\" net position is reported when constraints are placed on net position that are either (a) externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. \"Unrestricted\" net position consists of net position that does not meet the definition of \"restricted\" or \"net investment in capital assets. \" When both restricted and unrestricted resources are to be used for the same purpose, the agency responsible for administering the resources determines the flow assumption used to identify the portion of expenses paid from restricted resources. At June 30, 2019, the government-wide statement of net position reported a restricted net position of $28.9 billion, of which $15.2 billion is restricted by enabling legislation. Components of Fund Balance Nonspendable fund balance includes amounts that cannot be spent. This includes activity that is not in a spendable form such as inventories, prepaid amounts, and long-term portion of loans and notes receivable, net, unless the proceeds are restricted, committed or assigned. Additionally, activity that is legally or contractually required to remain intact, such as a principal balance in a permanent fund, is considered to be nonspendable. Restricted fund balance has constraints placed upon the use of the resources either by an external party, such as the Federal Government, or imposed by law through a constitutional provision or enabling legislation. Committed fund balance includes amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the state's highest level of decision-making authority, the Legislature and the Governor, i.e. through legislation passed into law. Commitments may only be modified or rescinded by equivalent formal, highest-level action. Unassigned fund balance is the residual amount of the General Fund not included in the three categories described above. Also, any remaining deficit fund balances within the other governmental fund types are reported as unassigned. When an expenditure is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted resources are available, it is the state's general policy to use restricted resources first. When expenditures are incurred for which unrestricted (committed or unassigned) resources are available, and amounts in any of these unrestricted classifications could be used, it is the state's general policy to spend committed resources first. However, the agency responsible for administering the resources determines the flow assumption used to identify the portion of expenses paid from restricted resources.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 66Fund Balances Classifications and Special Revenue by Purpose - GASB Codification Section 2200, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, requires presentation of governmental fund balances and special revenue fund revenues by specific purpose. In the basic financial statements, the fund balance classifications are presented in the aggregate. The table presented below displays further detail of nonspendable fund balance and appropriation of resources existing at June 30, 2019 (in thousands).

Interfund Activity and Balances The effect of interfund activities, except those between funds reported as governmental activities and funds reported as business- type activities, has been eliminated from the government-wide statements. In the fund financial statements, transfers represent flows of assets without equivalent flows of assets in return or a requirement for repayment. Transfers are recorded when a fund receiving revenue provides it to the fund which expends the resources. Transfers between funds are made to accomplish various provisions of law. Interfund receivables and payables have been eliminated from the statement of net position, except for the residual amounts due between governmental and business-type activities. For additional information, refer to Note 11. G. Nonmonetary Transactions The state participates in various activities that are, in part, represented by nonmonetary transactions. Examples include nonmonetary assistance in the form of Federal grants, such as vaccines, Electronic Benefit Transfer cards for food assistance, and donated food commodities. The state also acts as an agent for the United States Department of Agriculture in the distribution of donated food commodities to qualifying organizations outside the state's reporting entity. The fair value of these items is reported in the governmental fund financial statements.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 67State Attorneys and Public Defenders of the State of Florida are furnished certain office space and other services by counties under the provisions of Chapter 29, F.S. Some counties also provide certain facilities and services to other officers and staff of the judicial branch. The value of the facilities and services provided by the counties is not reported as revenue. H. Operating and Non-Operating Revenues Proprietary funds distinguish operating from non-operating revenues. Operating revenues are typically derived from providing goods or services, and include all transactions involved in delivering those goods or services. These revenues are a direct result of exchange-type transactions associated with the principal activity of the fund. Cash flow resulting from capital and related financing, noncapital financing and investment activities are considered non-operating for reporting purposes. I. Accounting and Reporting Changes The state implemented GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations. This Statement addresses accounting and financial reporting for certain asset retirement obligations (AROs). An ARO is a legally enforceable liability associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. A government that has legal obligations to perform future asset retirement activities related to its tangible capital assets should recognize a liability based on the guidance in this Statement. The state implemented GASB Statement No. 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct Placements. This Statement is to improve the information that is disclosed in notes to government financial statements related to debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information related to debt. Effective July 1, 2018, certain State Universities component units, which had previously reported under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards of accounting and financial reporting for not-for-profit organizations, transitioned to GASB standards of accounting and financial reporting as a result of Chapter 2018-004, Laws of Florida.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 68J.

(573) Net Position, June 30, 2018, as restated $ 62,538,217 $5,652,782 $ 26,181,538 K. Budget Stabilization Fund The State Constitution mandates the creation and maintenance of a Budget Stabilization Fund, in an amount not less than 5 percent nor more than 10 percent of the last complete fiscal year's net revenue collections for the General Revenue Fund. Monies in the Budget Stabilization Fund may be transferred to the General Revenue Fund to offset a deficit therein or to provide emergency funding, including payment of up to $38 million with respect to certain uninsured losses to state property. Monies in this fund are constitutionally prohibited from being obligated or otherwise committed for any other purposes, in accordance with Section 216.222, F.S. Any withdrawals from the Budget Stabilization Fund must be restored from general revenues in five equal annual installments, commencing in the third fiscal year after the expenditure, unless the Legislature establishes a different restoration schedule, in accordance with Section 215.32, F.S. The Budget Stabilization Fund had $1.48 billion in cash at June 30, 2019 . During fiscal year 2018-19 , the General Revenue Fund was authorized to transfer $66.5 million to the Budget Stabilization Fund. There were no disbursements made from the fund.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 69 NOTE 2 - DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS A. Deposits At June 30, 2019 , the state's deposits in financial institutions totaled approximately $2.3 billion for primary government and $2.0 billion for discretely presented component units. 1.Custodial Credit Risk The custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, the state will not be able to recover deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The state mitigates custodial credit risk by generally requiring public funds to be deposited in a bank or savings association that is designated by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) as authorized to receive deposits in the state and meets the collateral requirements as set forth in Chapter 280, Florida Statutes (F.S.). The CFO determines the collateral requirements and collateral pledging level for each Qualified Public Depository (QPD) following guidelines outlined in Section 280.04, F.S., and Department of Financial Services Rules, Chapter 69C-2, Florida Administrative Code. Collateral pledging levels include 25, 50, 110, and 150 percent of a QPD's average daily deposit balance, or, if needed, an amount as prescribed by the CFO. Section 280.13, F.S., outlines eligible types of collateral including direct obligations of the United States (U.S.) Government, federal agency obligations fully guaranteed by the U.S. Government, certain federal agency obligations, state and local government obligations, corporate bonds, and letters of credit issued by a Federal Home Loan Bank. Also, with the CFO's permission, eligible collateral includes collateralized mortgage obligations, real estate mortgage investment conduits and securities or other interests in any open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. However, the portfolio of the investment company must be limited to direct obligations of the U.S. Government and to repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such direct obligations of the U.S. Government, and the investment company must take delivery of such collateral either directly or through an authorized custodian. In accordance with Section 280.08, F.S., if a QPD defaults, losses to public depositors are first satisfied with any applicable depository insurance, followed by demands of payment under any letters of credit or sale of the defaulting QPD's collateral. If necessary, any remaining losses are to be satisfied by assessments against the other participating QPDs according to a statutory based ratio. At June 30, 2019, the following deposits were not secured pursuant to Chapter 280, F.S., and were exposed to custodial credit risk because they were uninsured and (1) uncollateralized, (2) collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution, or (3) collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution's trust department or agent but not in the state's name (in thousands). Schedule of Deposits with State Treasury Exposed to Custodial Credit Risk As of June 30, 2019 Bank Statement Balance (in U.S. $) Custodial Credit Risk Primary Government Component Units (1) $ 1,085,178 $ 462,212 (2) 10,523 229,730 (3) \u2014 9,132 Total deposits subject to custodial credit risk $ 1,095,701 $ 701,074 2. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of a deposit. Under Section 215.47, F.S., and subject to the limitations and conditions of the State Constitution or of the trust agreement relating to a trust fund, moneys available for investment by the State Board of Administration (SBA) may be invested in fixed income obligations or stocks denominated in foreign currency. The SBA has developed total fund investment policies for the investment of assets in the Florida Retirement System (FRS) Pension Trust Fund and the Lawton Chiles Endowment Fund (LCEF) that set ranges on investments by asset class in each fund. Under the FRS Pension Trust Fund and LCEF investment policy statements approved by SBA Trustees effective July 1, 2018, and June 17, 2014, respectively, foreign and domestic equity securities are included in the global equity2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 70asset class. The FRS Pension Trust Fund and LCEF have target allocations to global equities of 53% and 71%, respectively, with policy ranges from 45-70% for FRS and 61-81% for LCEF, but within these ranges there are no limits on the amount of foreign equity securities that are denominated in foreign currency. The FRS Pension Trust Fund is not limited to holding securities in foreign currency only in the global equity asset class. All asset classes may hold non-U.S. securities, depending on portfolio guidelines. The Florida Prepaid Program's comprehensive investment plan limits investment in foreign equities to 25% of total equities, with the target for total equities to be 70% of the actuarial reserve. In all cases, Florida law limits the exposure to foreign securities held outside of commingled funds to 50% of the total fund. The investment plans may be modified in the future if the SBA or Florida Prepaid adopts changes. This investment activity in foreign investments resulted in deposits in foreign currency as of June 30, 2019 , as illustrated in the following schedule (in thousands): Schedule of Investments with State Board of Administration Foreign Currency Deposits Held As of June 30, 2019 Bank Statement Balance (in U.S. $) CurrencyFRS Pension Trust Fund LCEFFlorida Prepaid Program and Investment Plan Total Australian dollar $ 2,593 $ 1 $ 15 $ 2,609 Bangladesh taka 18 \u2014 \u2014 18 Brazilian real 1,365 98 \u2014 1,463 British pound sterling 7,870 95 94 8,059 Canadian dollar 3,508 282 \u2014 3,790 Chilean peso 167 \u2014 \u2014 167 Chinese yuan renminbi 3,598 84 \u2014 3,682 Colombian peso 4 \u2014 \u2014 4 Czech koruna 12 4 \u2014 16 Danish krone 392 \u2014 \u2014 392 Egyptian pound \u2014 11 \u2014 11 Euro currency unit 19,872 \u2014 229 20,101 Hong Kong dollar 10,342 75 57 10,474 Hungarian forint 167 26 \u2014 193 Indian rupee 2,287 \u2014 \u2014 2,287 Indonesian rupiah 360 73 \u2014 433 Israeli shekel 1,029 8 2 1,039 Japanese yen 18,316 214 1,023 19,553 Malaysian ringgit 354 36 \u2014 390 Mexican peso 996 9 \u2014 1,005 Moroccan dirham 8 \u2014 \u2014 8 New Taiwan dollar 7,313 \u2014 \u2014 7,313 New Zealand dollar 762 \u2014 \u2014 762 New Zimbabwe dollar 127 \u2014 \u2014 127 Norwegian krone 1,167 \u2014 65 1,232 Pakistan rupee 124 \u2014 \u2014 124 Philippines peso 164 23 \u2014 187 Polish zloty 108 \u2014 \u2014 108 Qatari riyal 13 \u2014 \u2014 13 Russian ruble 94 \u2014 \u2014 94 Singapore dollar 1,040 17 96 1,153 South African rand 642 107 \u2014 749 South Korean won 5,656 2 \u2014 5,658 Sri Lanka rupee 186 \u2014 \u2014 186 Swedish krona 663 5 \u2014 668 Swiss franc 896 \u2014 \u2014 896 Thailand baht 4 6 \u2014 10 Turkish lira 250 55 \u2014 305 United Arab Emirates dirham 469 \u2014 \u2014 469 Vietnam dong 795 \u2014 \u2014 795 Total deposits subject to foreign currency risk $ 93,731 $ 1,231 $ 1,581 $ 96,5432019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 71B. Investments At June 30, 2019, the state's investments reported in governmental and business-type activities and fiduciary funds totaled $252.6 billion, consisting of pooled investments with the State Treasury in the amount of $26.1 billion and other investments in the amount of $226.5 billion. The State Treasury also had holdings at June 30, 2019, of $4.3 billion for discretely presented component units in total. These investments are not reported as part of the primary government and may be different from the amounts reported by some component units due to different reporting periods. Other investments for discretely presented component units, excluding those investments held by SBA, totaled $22.8 billion. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury Unless specifically exempted by statute, all cash of the state must be deposited in the State Treasury. The State Treasury, in turn, keeps the funds fully invested to maximize earnings. In addition, the State Treasury may invest funds of any board, association, or entity created by the State Constitution, or by law. As a result, pooled investments with the State Treasury contains deposits from funds and component units of the reporting entity (internal portion) as well as deposits from certain legally separate organizations outside the reporting entity (external portion). The external portion of pooled investments with the State Treasury is reported in a governmental external investment pool. Pooled investments with the State Treasury are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Oversight of the pooled investments with the State Treasury is provided by the Treasury Investment Council per Section 17.575, F.S. The authorized investment types are set forth in Section 17.57, F.S. Redemptions are on a dollar in/dollar out basis adjusted for distributed income. The fair value of the pooled investments with the State Treasury is determined at fiscal year-end for financial reporting purposes. See Note 1E, Investments, for further detail on fair value. The State Treasury does not contract with an outside insurer in order to guarantee the value of the portfolio, or the price of shares redeemed. Per Section 17.61(1), F.S., the State Treasury shall invest all general revenue funds, trust funds, all agency funds of each state agency, and of the judicial branch. As a result, state agencies and the judicial branch are considered involuntary participants in pooled investments with the State Treasury. The total involuntary participation as of June 30, 2019, was $24 billion or 79% of the pool.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 72At year-end, the condensed financial statements for the Investment Pool maintained by the State Treasury were as follows (dollars in thousands): Schedule of Pooled Investments with State Treasury Condensed Statement of Fiduciary Net Position June 30, 2019 ASSETS Current and Other Assets $ 31,362,664 Total Assets 31,362,664 LIABILITIES Other Liabilities 2,160,085 Total Liabilities 2,160,085 NET POSITION Net position held for Internal Pool Participants 28,730,408 Net position held for External Pool Participants 472,171 $ 29,202,579 Condensed Statement of Changes of Fiduciary Net Position June 30, 2019 ADDITIONS Net income (loss) from investing activity $ 1,137,256 DEDUCTIONS Distributions paid and payable (1,137,256 ) DEPOSITOR ACTIVITY Deposits 115,514,858 Withdrawals (112,800,744 ) Excess (deficiency) of deposits over withdrawals 2,714,114 Change in net position 2,714,114 Net position, beginning 26,488,465 Net position, ending $ 29,202,5792019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 73The following table provides a summary of the fair value, the number of shares or the principal amount, ranges of interest rates, and maturity dates of each major investment classification (dollars in thousands): Schedule of Pooled Investments with State Treasury Summary of Investment Holdings Par Fair ValueRange of Interest Rates* Range of Maturity Dates Commercial paper $ 236,000 $ 235,880 2.291% - 0.001% - 9.455% 7/1/2019 1.125% - - 3.510% $30,331,983 * The coupon rate in effect at June 30, 2019 , is reported.

Credit Risk and Concentration of Credit Risk of Debt Securities Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of the state's investment in a single issuer. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury The State Treasury follows the investment guidelines set forth in Section 17.57, F.S., for reducing exposure to investment credit risk. The State Treasury's rated debt investments as of June 30, 2019, were rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's. S&P ratings were primarily used. If S&P did not rate a security, or if the Moody's rating was lower for a security, then Moody's ratings were used.

For other investments, the investment policies address concentration of credit risk by placing limits on amounts invested per issuer (taking into account the maturity date and duration of the investment). In addition, the policies also address limits on certain investments by credit ratings. Limits on amounts invested are expressed in dollar amounts per issuer and also in total amounts per investment type as a percentage of the investment pool's market value. As of June 30, 2019, more than five percent of the State Treasury's investment pool is invested in the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). These investments are approximately 8 percent, 10 percent, and 8 percent of the of the State Treasury's investments pool, respectively. Other Investments The SBA, in compliance with Section 215.47, F.S., has adopted certain investment policies with regard to credit risk of debt securities. Investment policies vary by fund or portfolio. Below are the investment policies and credit risk disclosures for the FRS Pension Trust Fund, which constitutes the primary portion of other investments. FRS Pension Trust Fund - Investments are generally managed through individual portfolios within various asset classes, as listed below. Some of the individual portfolios have slightly different restrictions on credit quality. Short-term Portfolio - Securities must be high quality at the time of purchase. For short-term investment ratings, this is defined as the highest applicable rating from one of the NRSROs. For long-term investment ratings, this is defined as a minimum mid- single A rating from one of the NRSROs. Securities of a single issuer are generally limited to 5% of the market value of the portfolio (excluding U.S. Treasuries and Agencies). Generally, securities in other major portfolios, such as the Mortgage Index Portfolio, Intermediate Aggregate Less MBS Index Portfolio and the Core Portfolio, should be rated investment grade by at least one of the NRSROs at the time of purchase [allowing a very small allocation to below investment grade (down to BB-/Ba3) for the Core Portfolio]. Securities for a single issuer are generally limited to 5% of the fair value of the portfolio (excluding U.S. Treasuries and Agencies). Mortgage Index Portfolio - Securities are generally limited to those issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), FNMA, and FHLMC. No specific credit rating criteria are listed. Intermediate Aggregate Less MBS Index Portfolio and the Core Portfolio - These portfolios allow U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Government agencies, corporates, mortgage and asset backed securities, foreign sovereign debt, and municipals. Lending Portfolios - Under investment policy guidelines in effect for the FRS Pension Trust Fund, eligible cash collateral investments are: Tri-party qualified repurchase agreement transactions collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and/or strips, U.S. Government Agency securities, U.S. Government Agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. equity securities. Collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury and Government Agencies must maintain a market value of at least 102% of the market value of the securities subject to being repurchased. Collateral consisting of U.S. equities must maintain a market value of at least 110% of the market value of the securities subject to being repurchased, Money market mutual funds regulated by SEC rule 2a-7 and rated the highest applicable rating by at least one NRSRO and U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Security lending investments that were purchased prior to the policy guidelines established in December 2008 are being held to maturity in existing lending portfolios. Lawton Chiles Endowment Fund - Policy guidelines allow cash collateral to be invested only in tri-party repurchase agreements and certain government money market funds, similar to those allowed for the FRS Pension Fund. Florida Prepaid College Program Lending Program - Short-term obligations should be limited to obligations rated in the highest rating category by all NRSROs or, if only rated by one NRSRO, rated at the time of purchase in the highest rating category by that NRSRO (S&P A-1, Moody's P-1, Fitch F1 or equivalent). A \"short-term obligation\" means any eligible security or instrument (other than a repurchase agreement) which has an original maturity of 397 days or less at the time of purchase or has a put that entitles the holder to receive the principal amount at specified intervals not exceeding 397 days. With respect to bonds and other long-term obligations, investment is limited to obligations backed by the United States Government and have a maximum maturity2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 80of 762 days. A \"long-term obligation\" means any eligible security or instrument (other than a repurchase agreement) which has a remaining maturity of greater than 397 days at the time of purchase and is not subject to a demand feature in 397 days or less. The FRS Pension Trust Fund did not hold any investments with a single issuer representing 5% or more of the fund's fair market value at June 30, 2019.

The FRS Pension Trust Fund may enter into contracts that allow for close-out netting with certain counterparties. In the event of default or early termination, the contract permits the non-defaulting party the right to close-out all transactions in a single net settlement to one net amount payable by one counterparty to the other.

Custodial Credit Risk Custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty to a transaction, the state will not be able to recover the value of investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury The State Treasury's custodial risk policy states that securities must be held in an account in the state's name. As required by negotiated trust and custody contracts, many of the state's investments were held in the state's name by the Treasury's custodial financial institution at June 30, 2019. Investments that were uninsured and unregistered, and held by the counterparty, or by its trust department but not in the State's name, included the following (in thousands): State Treasury Custodial Credit Risk As of June 30, 2019 Fair value Invested security lending collateral: Repurchase agreements $ 289,441 Federal agencies 366,079 Bonds and notes - domestic 337,067 Bonds and notes - international 195,998 Total $1,188,585 Other Investments The SBA's custodial credit risk policy states that custodial credit risk will be minimized through the use of trust accounts maintained at top tier third party custodian banks. To the extent possible, negotiated trust and custody contracts shall require that all deposits, investments, and collateral be held in accounts in the SBA's name, or in the case of certain foreign investments, in an omnibus client account, but separate and apart from the assets of the custodian banks. This policy applies to investments evidenced by cash or securities, and does not apply to investments evidenced by contractual agreements such as private equity or real estate investments.

Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of debt investments. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury Through its investment policy, the State Treasury manages its exposure to interest rate risk by limiting either the maturities or durations of the various investment strategies used for the investment pool. The maximum effective weighted duration allowed is in the Long Duration portfolio: six (6) years or the benchmark's effective duration if higher. In addition, the security lending portfolio manages exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the maximum weighted average maturity gap. The maximum weighted average maturity gap is defined as the difference between the weighted average days to maturity of the portfolio minus the weighted average days to maturity of the liabilities (loans). The maximum weighted average maturity gap for security lending portfolios is 30 days. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 86Presented below is the interest rate risk table for the debt investments with the State Treasury (in thousands). Investment types related to debt portfolios are presented using effective weighted duration.

Policies and interest rate risk disclosures for debt investments within the FRS Pension Trust Fund are presented below. Investments authorized by Section 215.47, F.S., are managed through individual portfolios within various asset classes. The individual portfolios may have different policies regarding interest rate risk. Major types of debt portfolios are listed below. Short-term Portfolio - Weighted average maturity to final maturity date (WAL) is limited to 120 days in the internally managed FRS Short-term Investment Pool (STIPFRS) portfolio and weighted average time to coupon reset (WAM) is limited to 60 days. For securities without a fixed interest rate, the next coupon reset date is used as the maturity for the reset WAM calculation. No individual security shall have a final maturity date longer than 397 days except for U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, which shall not exceed five years. Mortgage Index Portfolio - Portfolio duration should be similar to the duration of the mortgage-related fixed income market and should remain within plus or minus 0.25 years of the Barclays Capital U.S. MBS Index duration. Swaps and/or Agency debentures may contribute no more than 25% of the portfolio's total duration. Intermediate Aggregate Less MBS Index Portfolio - Portfolio duration should remain within plus or minus 0.25 years of the Barclays Capital U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Bond Index duration less the MBS Index component. Interest rate swaps and interest rate futures, on a net basis, may contribute no more than 25% of the portfolio's total duration. Core Portfolios - Portfolio duration should remain within plus or minus 0.50 years of the Barclays Capital U.S. Intermediate Aggregate Bond Index duration. Interest rate swaps and interest rate futures may contribute no more than 25% of the portfolio's total duration. The Core Portfolio contains certain investments, known as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), which are more sensitive to interest rate changes than others. Examples of CMO securities that qualify as \"highly interest rate sensitive\" include interest- only (IOs), principal-only (POs), and inverse floaters (INVs). IO and PO securities are transactions that involve the separation of the interest and principal components of a security. They are highly sensitive to prepayments by mortgagors, which increase the value of a PO and decrease the value of an IO. INVs have an inverse relationship to a benchmark rate, and the coupon payment is adjusted as the interest rate changes. If the benchmark interest rate decreases, the coupon rate increases and vice versa, which allows the bondholder to benefit from declining interest rates. Similar to an IO, an interest-only inverse floater's value increases as interest rates rise. Security Lending Portfolios - Investment policy guidelines in effect for the FRS Pension Trust Fund allow investment in: Tri-party qualified repurchase obligations, with a term to repurchase not to exceed 45 calendar days that are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds and/or strips, U.S. Government Agency securities, U.S. Government Agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. equity securities, Money market mutual funds regulated by SEC rule 2a-7, and U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds maturing within 92 days or less. Security lending investments that were purchased prior to the investment policy guidelines established in December 2008, are still held in the FRS Pension Trust Fund lending programs, but are slowly paying down. For investments that had floating interest rates, interest rate reset dates were used to calculate the WAM. The LCEF allows investment of cash collateral only in overnight repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government and/or agency securities, and in certain money market funds with a rating of AAAm, Aaammf, or AAAmmf by S&P, Moody's or Fitch, respectively. For the Florida Prepaid lending program, investment policy guidelines state that the maximum rate sensitivity is 60 days. The \"rate sensitivity\" of a security or instrument shall mean (a) in the case of a fixed rate security or instrument (i) the date on which final payment is due or (ii) the principal amount can be recovered through demand (if applicable) or (b) in the case of a floating or variable rate security or instrument, the shorter of the period of time remaining until either (i) the next readjustment of the interest rate or (ii) the principal amount can be recovered through demand (if applicable). 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 88Presented in the following schedule is the interest rate risk table for the FRS Pension Trust Fund (in thousands).

Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates that will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury The State Treasury does not have any investments in foreign currency. State law and investment policy do not authorize investments in foreign currency related to State Treasury investment operations. Other Investments The FRS Pension Trust Fund, the LCEF, and the Florida Prepaid College Program had exposure to foreign currency risk at June 30, 2019 . These funds are managed primarily by the use of \"asset classes\". The FRS Pension Trust Fund investment policy, approved on June 13, 2018 (effective July 1, 2018), by the Trustees, limits the global equity asset class (including domestic and foreign equities) to a policy range of 45-70% and a target allocation of 53%. All asset classes may hold non-U.S. securities, depending on portfolio guidelines. Within the global equity asset class, the FRS Pension Trust Fund also holds units in commingled international equity funds. The FRS Pension Trust Fund owns only a portion of the overall investment in the funds, which are also owned by other investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFS) are investment funds that hold assets such as stocks or bonds and are traded on the stock exchanges. Participatory notes (P-notes) allow the FRS Pension Trust Fund to participate in certain foreign equity markets where direct participation is not possible due to local government regulations, tax policies, or other reasons. The FRS Pension Trust Fund's unit holdings in the overall investments or notes themselves may be valued in U.S. dollars, but a portion of the underlying assets are exposed to foreign currency risk in various currencies. Within the alternative investment asset class, the FRS Pension Trust owns an interest in several alternative investment commingled funds (primarily limited partnerships) with other investors and, therefore, owns only a portion of the overall investment in the funds. The alternative investment funds denominated in foreign currency are presented in the foreign currency risk table below by currency. For the alternative investment funds denominated in U.S. dollars, some of the underlying investments may be exposed to foreign currency risk in various currencies. Alternative investments with potential exposure to foreign currency risk totaled $26.7 billion as of June 30, 2019 . For the LCEF, Trustees approved an investment policy on June 17, 2014, that set the global equity asset class with a policy range of 61-81% and a target allocation of 71%. Other asset classes in the LCEF may hold non-U.S. securities as well, depending on portfolio guidelines. The Florida Prepaid Program's comprehensive investment plan limits investment in foreign equities to 25% of total equities, with the target for total equities to be 70% of actuarial reserve. In all cases, Florida law limits the total exposure to foreign securities outside of commingled funds to 50% of the total fund. There is no requirement that this exposure to foreign currency be hedged through forward currency contracts, although some investment managers use them in many cases. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 93Presented below in U.S. dollars are the FRS Pension Trust Fund investments exposed to foreign currency risk as of June 30, 2019 , listed in total, by currency (in thousands).

A futures contract is an agreement between two parties, a buyer and a seller, to exchange a particular good for a particular price at a particular date in the future, all of which are specified in a contract common to all participants in a market on an organized futures exchange. Upon entering into a futures contract, collateral is deposited with the counterparty, in the SBA's name, in accordance with the initial margin requirements of the counterparty. Futures contracts are marked to market daily by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. The resulting gain/loss is received/paid the following day until the contract expires. The frequency of cash flows depends upon specified collateral and margin limits mutually agreed upon by the SBA and the third-party counterparty. The margin payments are exposed to foreign currency risk.

An option gives the buyer a stipulated privilege of buying or selling a stated property, security, or commodity at a given price (strike price) within a specified time (for an American-style option, at any time prior to or on the expiration date). A securities option is a negotiable contract in which the seller (writer), for a certain sum of money called the option premium, gives the buyer the right to demand within a specified time the purchase (call) from or sale (put) to the option seller of a specified number of bonds, currency units, index units, or shares of stock, at a fixed price or rate, called the strike price.

The FRS Pension Trust Fund, LCEF, and the Florida Prepaid Program and Investment Plan also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts which are agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price and settlement date. Currently, there are two types of foreign currency contracts being utilized by the FRS Pension Trust Fund. Spot currency contracts are used primarily for trade settlement and currency repatriation and are valued at spot (traded) currency rates. Forward currency contracts are valued at interpolated forward rates and may be used to mitigate currency risk for changes in value associated with foreign holdings, payables and/or receivables. On the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position, individual forward currency contract positions are recorded as net in Other investments, and spot currency contracts are recorded as receivables and payables. In addition, such contracts may be used to seek additional value independent of underlying equity assets. The LCEF and Florida Prepaid Plans currently utilize only spot currency contracts. All of the contracts are subject to foreign currency risk.

Security Lending Pooled Investments with the State Treasury Section 17.61(1), F.S., authorizes the State Treasury to participate in a security lending program. Agents of the State Treasury loan securities, including U.S. government and federally guaranteed obligations, bonds, and notes to broker/dealers for collateral with a simultaneous agreement to return the collateral for the same securities in the future. Collateral for loaned securities cannot be less than 100 percent of the fair value of the underlying security plus accrued interest. Such collateral may consist of cash or government securities. Cash collateral is invested by the agent in investments authorized by Section 17.57, F.S. Maturities of investments made with cash collateral generally are not matched to maturities of the securities loaned because security loan agreements are generally open-ended with no fixed expiration date. The collateral under security lending agreements (including accrued interest) exceeded the fair value of the securities underlying those agreements (including accrued interest) on June 30, 2019 . If a situation occurs where an agent does not receive collateral sufficient to offset the fair value of any securities lent, or the borrowers fail to return the securities or fail to pay the State Treasury for income distributions by the securities' issuers while the securities are on loan, the agent is required to indemnify the State Treasury for any losses that might occur. The State Treasury received $ 1,189,219,592 cash collateral and $1,937,782,659 non-cash collateral for securities loaned to others. Since the State Treasury does not have the ability to pledge or sell non-cash collateral securities, any non-cash portion of the collateral is not reported on the balance sheet. Securities held with others under security lending agreements with cash collateral totaled $1,157,009,469. Securities held with others under security lending agreements with non-cash collateral totaled $1,889,211,786.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 98Security lending asset and liability balances are allocated at fiscal year-end and reported among all participating funds of the primary government. The securities held with others under security lending agreements as of June 30, 2019 , are as follows (in thousands): State Treasury Investments on Loan Under Security Lending Agreements As of June 30, 2019 Securities on Loan for Cash Collateral, by Security TypeFair Value of Securities on Loan* U.S. guaranteed obligations $ 678,350 Federal agencies 50,658 Bonds and notes - domestic 363,365 Bonds and notes - international 64,636 Total securities on loan for cash collateral 1,157,009 Securities on Loan for Non-Cash Collateral, by Security Type U.S. guaranteed obligations 1,883,837 Bonds and notes - domestic 647 Bonds and notes - international 4,728 Total securities on loan for non-cash collateral 1,889,212 Total securities on loan $ 3,046,221 * The fair value equals the carrying value of the investments on loan. Other Investments Through the SBA, various funds, including the FRS Pension Trust Fund, the LCEF, and the Florida Prepaid College Program participate in security lending programs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 . Initial collateral requirements for securities on loan range from 100% to 105%, depending on the lending agent, the type of security lent and the type of collateral received. The SBA had received and invested $2,668,946,859 in cash and $15,278,498,020 in U.S. government securities as collateral for the lending programs as of June 30, 2019 . At June 30, 2019 , the collateral held for the security lending transactions exceeded the fair value of the securities underlying the agreements (including accrued interest) except with three borrowers in the LCEF totaling $1,346. Most security lending programs have indemnity clauses requiring the lending agent to assume borrower's risk from default. The FRS Pension Trust Fund also participated indirectly in security lending through investments in four commingled funds that do not offer borrower indemnification. The Fund receives a proportionate share of the security lending income generated from these activities. The SBA does not have the ability to pledge or sell the non-cash collateral securities, so the non-cash portion is not reported on the balance sheet or the Statement of (Fiduciary) Net Position. Maturities of investments made with cash collateral generally are not matched to maturities of the securities loaned because security loan agreements are generally open-ended with no fixed expiration date. As such, investments made with cash collateral are primarily in short-term investments. However, investments purchased for some security lending programs included investments with final maturities of six months or more representing a range of approximately 10% to 47% of total collateral invested. There are no restrictions on the amount of securities that can be loaned at one time to one borrower for most funds. At June 30, 2019, the collateral re-investment portfolios for the FRS Pension Trust Fund and the LCEF were primarily reinvested in repurchase agreements (repos) or selected money market funds in order to maximize earnings and reduce risk. The portfolios contain some legacy non-repo securities that will remain until they are either sold or mature. At June 30, 2019, there were four lending agents, including the two master custodians and two third-party agents. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 99The schedule below discloses the fair value and carrying value of investments on loan at June 30, 2019 (in thousands): Schedule of Other Investments on Loan Under Security Lending Agreements As of June 30, 2019 Fair value of Securities on Loan1 Securities on Loan for Cash Collateral, by Security typeFRS Pension Trust FundOther funds Managed by SBA Total U.S. guaranteed obligations $ 68,399 $ 1,745,852 $ 1,814,251 Federal agencies bonds loan for cash collateral 506,584 2,089,820 2,596,404 Securities on Loan for Non-Cash Collateral, by Security type U.S. guaranteed obligations $ 2,251,502 $ 178,448 $ 2,429,950 Federal agencies 142 \u2014 142 Domestic bonds and notes 27,325 \u2014 29,398 56,723 International bonds and for non-cash collateral 14,429,832 285,871 14,715,703 Total securities on loan $ 14,936,416 $ 2,375,691 $ 17,312,107 1 The fair value of debt securities on loan includes accrued interest. 6. Derivatives A derivative instrument is defined as a financial instrument or other contract that has all of the following characteristics: a. Settlement factors - It has (1) one or more reference rates and (2) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both. These terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required. b. Leverage - It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors. c. Net Settlement - Its terms require or permit net settlement, it can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or it provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement. Derivative instruments consisted of futures, options, forward currency contracts, and swaps. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury Pursuant to the State Treasury's established investment policy guidelines, interest rate futures are used as part of the investment strategy related to interest rate risk, duration adjustments, and yield curve strategies. Although put and call options on any security are permitted under the State Treasury's investment guidelines, interest rate futures were the only type of derivative held as of June 30, 2019. The State Treasury did not utilize derivatives for hedging activities during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. All of the State Treasury investment derivatives were reported at fair value in the accompanying financial statements as of June 30, 2019 .2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 100A summary of investment derivatives traded in the State Treasury is presented below (in thousands): Changes in Fair Value Fair Value at June 30, 2019 Notional (in U.S. $) Classification Amount Classification Amount State Treasury Investment derivative instruments: Futures $ (978,800) Investment Income $ (3,475) Receivable/(Payable) $ (1,047) This schedule includes both long and short positions. See section 1E of Note 1 to these financial statements regarding State Treasury's securities pricing policies and independent pricing services methodologies related to securities not available on quoted market pricing exchanges. Other Investments The SBA has established investment policy guidelines for each investment portfolio. Pursuant to these guidelines, derivative investment instruments are authorized to be used as tools for managing risk or executing investment strategies more efficiently than could otherwise be done in cash markets, and may only be used as part of a prudent investment process. Various derivative investment instruments are used as part of the investment strategy to hedge against interest rate risk, currency risk in foreign markets, default risk, and mortgaged-backed security prepayment risk, and to effectively manage exposure to domestic and international equities, bonds, and real estate markets. A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange a particular good for a particular price at a particular date in the future, all of which are specified in a contract common to all members in a market on an organized futures exchange. Upon entering into a futures contract, collateral (cash and/or securities) is deposited with the counterparty, in SBA's name, in accordance with the initial margin requirements of the counterparty. Futures contracts are marked to market daily by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. The resulting gain/loss is received/paid the following day until the contract expires. The frequency of cash flows depends on specified collateral and margin limits mutually agreed upon by the SBA and third-party counterparty. Future contracts involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the variation margin disclosed in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Losses may arise from future changes in the value of the underlying instrument. An option gives the buyer a stipulated privilege of buying or selling a stated property, security, or commodity at a given price (strike price) within a specified time (for an American-style option, at any time prior to or on the expiration date). A securities option is a negotiable contract in which the seller (writer), for a certain sum of money called the option premium, gives the buyer the right to demand within a specified time the purchase (call) from or sale (put) to the option seller of a specified number of bonds, currency units, index units, or shares of stock, at a fixed price or rate, called the strike price. A forward currency contract is a contractual obligation, typically over-the-counter, traded between two parties to exchange a particular good or instrument (i.e., currency) at a set price on a future date. The buyer of the forward agrees to pay the price and take delivery of the good or instrument and is said to be \"long\" the forward contract, while the seller of the forward, or \"short\", agrees to deliver the good or instrument at the agreed price on the agreed date. A swap is a contractual agreement to exchange a stream of periodic payments utilizing a central clearing house, whereby, each party in the transaction enters into a contract with the central counterparty. These agreements may be over-the-counter or exchange- traded. Upon entering into a swap contract through a clearing house, collateral is deposited with the counterparty, in SBA's name, in accordance with the initial margin requirements of the counterparty. Swaps are available in and between all active financial markets. Examples include: Interest rate swap - An agreement between two parties where one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified principal amount. Interest rate swaps often exchange a fixed payment for a floating payment that is linked to an interest rate. Credit default swap - An agreement that allows one party to \"buy\" protection from another party for losses that might be incurred as a result of default by a specified reference credit (or credits).

Fair Value Hierarchy The state categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 inputs are either directly or indirectly observable for an asset (including quoted prices for similar assets), which may include inputs in markets that are not considered to be active. Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. The categorization of investments within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the instrument and should not be perceived as the particular investment's risk. Pooled Investments with the State Treasury Securities classified in Level 1 are valued using quoted prices from the custodian bank's primary external pricing vendors. Securities classified in Level 2 are evaluated prices from the custodian bank's primary external pricing vendors. The pricing methodology involves the use of evaluation models such as matrix pricing, which is based on the securities' relationship to benchmark quoted prices. Other evaluation models use actual trade data, collateral attributes, broker bids, new issue pricings and other observable market information. Debt and equity securities classified as Level 3 are valued with prices from the custodian bank's external pricing vendors or an alternative pricing source, utilizing inputs such as stale prices, cash flow models, broker bids, or cost. Cost or book value may be used as an estimate of fair value when there is a lack of an independent pricing source. Certain investments, such as money market funds and repurchase agreements, are not included in the table, because they are carried at cost and not priced at fair value. Unemployment compensation funds are not included in the table, because this money is pooled with deposits from other states and is managed by the Federal Government. No disclosures can be made of specific securities owned. At June 30, 2019, the State Treasury had the following recurring fair value measurements: Investments and Derivative Instruments Measured at Fair Value As of June 30, 2019 Investments by fair value level Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Commercial paper $ 235,880 $ \u2014 $ 235,880 $ \u2014 U.S. guaranteed obligations 7,798,466 7,165,503 632,963 \u2014 Federal agencies 7,473,094 \u2014 7,473,094 \u2014 Bonds and notes - domestic 5,968,798 \u2014 5,968,798 \u2014 Bonds and notes - international 1,062,421 Commingled STIF 492,398 \u2014 \u2014 492,398 Lending collateral investments: Commercial Paper \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Federal agencies 366,079 \u2014 366,079 \u2014 Bonds and notes - domestic 337,067 \u2014 337,067 \u2014 Bonds and notes - international 195,998 \u2014 195,998 \u2014 Total investments by fair value level $23,933,382 $7,168,684 $16,272,300 $ 492,398 Investment derivative instruments Futures contracts $ (1,047 ) $ (1,047 ) $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Total investment derivative $ (1,047 ) $ (1,047 ) $ \u2014 $ \u20142019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 103Other Investments Debt and equity securities classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using quoted prices at June 30 (or the most recent market close date if the markets are closed on June 30) in active markets from the custodian bank's primary external pricing vendors, which utilize primary exchanges. Debt securities classified in Level 2 are valued using evaluated prices from the custodian bank's external pricing vendors. The pricing methodology involves the use of evaluation models such as matrix pricing, which is based on the securities' relationship to benchmark quoted prices. Other evaluation models use actual trade data, collateral attributes, broker bids, new issue pricings and other observable market information. Equity securities classified as Level 2 are valued using evaluated prices provided by the custodial bank's external pricing vendors, or alternative pricing source, such as investment managers, if information is not available from the primary vendors. Debt and equity securities classified as Level 3 are valued with prices from the custodian bank's external pricing vendors or an alternative pricing source, utilizing inputs such as stale prices, cash flow models, or broker bids. Cost or book value may be used as an estimate of fair value when there is a lack of an independent pricing source. Derivative instruments classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are exchange traded prices as provided by the custodian bank's external pricing vendors. Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 receive clearing house prices, which are based on models that reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives. Private equity funds and real estate direct investments classified as Level 3 are valued using the methodology as described in the footnotes for the Additional GASB 72 Required Disclosures table, footnotes 11 and 13, respectively. Other private equity funds are measured at net asset value (NA V). Certain investments, such as money market funds, repurchase agreements and U.S. guaranteed State and Local Government Series (SLGS) securities are not reported at fair value in the tables below because they are carried at cost and not priced at fair value. Additionally, U.S. guaranteed securities in the Debt Service Escrowed Fund and all investments of the Local Government Surplus Funds Trust Fund are not included in the tables below because they are carried at cost and amortized cost, respectively.

Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of donation. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the assets or materially extend the assets' lives are not capitalized. For financial statement purposes, the state reports capital assets under the following categories and has established a reporting capitalization threshold for each category. Applicable capital assets are depreciated over the appropriate estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

Under this approach, the Department of Transportation has made the commitment to maintain these assets at levels established by the Department of Transportation and approved by the Florida Legislature. No depreciation expense is reported for such assets, nor are amounts capitalized in connection with improvements that lengthen the lives of such assets, unless the improvements also increase their service potential. The Department of Transportation maintains an inventory of these assets and performs periodic condition assessments to establish that the predetermined condition level is being maintained. In addition, the Department of Transportation makes annual estimates of the amounts that must be expended to maintain these assets at the predetermined condition levels. Refer to the Other Required Supplementary Information for additional information on infrastructure using the modified approach. Not included in the reported capital assets are the irreplaceable collections at various historic sites and museums throughout the state. For example, the Museum of Florida History, located in Tallahassee, currently has artifacts illustrating the history of Florida since the arrival of human beings on the peninsula. It also has access to collections that include Florida upland and underwater archaeology, Florida archives, and Florida and Spanish colonial numismatics.

Pensions The Florida Department of Management Services (Department) is part of the primary government of the State of Florida and is responsible for administering the Florida Retirement System (FRS) Pension Plan and Other State-Administered Systems. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Department administered three defined benefit plans, two defined contribution plans, a supplemental funding of defined benefit plans for municipal police officers and firefighters, and various general revenue funded pension programs. Beginning with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, the Department issued a publicly-available, audited comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) that includes financial statements, notes and required supplementary information for each of the pension plans which it administers. Detailed information about the plans is provided in the FRS CAFR which is available online or by contacting the Department. Copies of this report, as well as the plans' actuarial valuations, can be obtained from the Department of Management Services, Division of Retirement (Division), Research and Education Section, P.O. Box 9000, Tallahassee, Florida 32315-9000; by telephone toll free at 877-377-1737 or 850-488-5706; by email at rep@dms.myflorida.com; or at the Division's website (www.frs.myflorida.com). 1. Defined Benefit Plans The Florida Retirement System The FRS is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public-employee retirement system with two primary plans - the FRS defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) and the FRS Investment Plan. The FRS Pension Plan was created in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes (F.S.), effective December 1, 1970, by consolidating and closing these existing plans to new members: the Teachers' Retirement System (Chapter 238, F.S.), the State and County Officers and Employees' Retirement System (Chapter 122, F.S.), and the Highway Patrol Pension Trust Fund (Chapter 321, F.S.). In 1972, the Judicial Retirement System (Chapter 123, F.S.) was closed and consolidated into the FRS. The FRS was created to provide a defined benefit pension plan for participating public employees. The FRS was amended in 1998 to add the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) under the defined benefit plan and amended in 2000 to provide the Investment Plan as a defined contribution plan alternative to the defined benefit plan for FRS members effective July 1, 2002. The FRS Investment Plan is an integrated defined contribution plan administered by the State Board of Administration (SBA). Effective July 1, 2007, the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) Supplemental Retirement Program, established under Section 121.40, F.S., was consolidated under the FRS Pension Plan as a closed retirement plan. Participation in the IFAS Supplemental Retirement Program does not constitute membership in the FRS. Chapter 121, F.S., also provides for nonintegrated, optional retirement programs in lieu of the FRS to certain members of the Senior Management Service Class (SMSC) employed by the state, state elected officials who chose SMSC membership in lieu of Elected Officers' Class membership (EOC), and faculty and specified employees in the State University System and Florida College System institutions. Provisions relating to the FRS are also contained in Chapter 112, F.S. Membership FRS membership is compulsory for eligible employees filling a regularly established position in a state agency, county agency, state university, state college, or district school board, unless restricted from FRS membership under Sections 121.053 or 121.122, F.S., or allowed to participate in a non-integrated defined contribution plan in lieu of FRS membership. Participation by cities, municipalities, special districts, charter schools, and metropolitan planning organizations, although optional, is generally irrevocable after election to participate is made. Members hired into certain positions may be eligible to withdraw from the FRS altogether or elect to participate in the non-integrated optional retirement programs in lieu of the FRS except faculty of a medical college in a state university who must participate in the State University System Optional Retirement Program (SUSORP). Retirees initially reemployed in regularly established positions on or after July 1, 2010, may not participate in the FRS except for defined contribution plan retirees employed in a regularly established position on or after July 1, 2017. FRS Pension Plan retirees remain ineligible for renewed membership. Retirees of the FRS Investment Plan, the SUSORP, the State Community College System Option Retirement Program (SCCSORP), and the Senior Management Service Optional Annuity Program who are initially reemployed on or after July 1, 2010, and who are employed in a regularly established position on or after July 1, 2017, will be enrolled in the FRS Investment Plan, SUSORP, or SCCSORP based upon the position held as renewed members on or after July 1, 2017. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 126There are five general classes of membership, as follows: Regular Class - Members of the FRS who do not qualify for membership in the other classes. Senior Management Service Class - Members in senior management level positions in state and local governments as well as assistant state attorneys, assistant statewide prosecutors, assistant public defenders, assistant attorneys general, deputy court administrators, and assistant capital collateral representatives. Members of the EOC may elect to withdraw from the FRS or participate in the SMSC in lieu of the EOC. Special Risk Class - Members who are employed as law enforcement officers, firefighters, firefighter trainers, fire prevention officers, state fixed-wing pilots for aerial firefighting surveillance, correctional officers, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, community-based correctional probation officers, youth custody officers (from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2014), certain health-care related positions within state forensic or correctional facilities, or specified forensic employees of a medical examiner's office or a law enforcement agency, and meet the criteria to qualify for this class. Special Risk Administrative Support Class - Former Special Risk Class members who are transferred or reassigned to nonspecial risk law enforcement, firefighting, emergency medical care, or correctional administrative support positions within an FRS special risk-employing agency. Elected Officers' Class - Members who are elected state or county officers and the elected officers of cities and special districts that choose to place their elected officials in this class. Beginning July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2011, the FRS Pension Plan provided for vesting of benefits after six years of creditable service for members working on or after July 1, 2001, and initially enrolled before July 1, 2011. Members not actively working in a position covered by the FRS Pension Plan on July 1, 2001, must return to covered employment for up to one work year to be eligible to vest with less service than was required under the law in effect before July 1, 2001. Members initially enrolled on or after July 1, 2011, vest after eight years of creditable service. Members are eligible for normal retirement when they have met the requirements listed below. Early retirement may be taken any time after vesting within 20 years of normal retirement age; however, there is a 5% benefit reduction for each year prior to the normal retirement age. Regular Class, Senior Management Service Class, and Elected Officers' Class Members - For members initially enrolled in the FRS Pension Plan before July 1, 2011, six or more years of creditable service and age 62, or the age after completing six years of creditable service if after age 62. Thirty years of creditable service regardless of age before age 62. For members initially enrolled in the FRS Pension Plan on or after July 1, 2011, eight or more years of creditable service and age 65, or the age after completing eight years of creditable service if after age 65. Thirty-three years of creditable service regardless of age before age 65. Special Risk Class and Special Risk Administrative Support Class Members - For members initially enrolled in the FRS Pension Plan before July 1, 2011, six or more years of Special Risk Class service and age 55, or the age after completing six years of Special Risk Class service if after age 55. Twenty-five years of special risk service regardless of age before age 55. A total of 25 years of service including special risk service and up to four years of active duty wartime service and age 52. Without six years of Special Risk Class service, members of the Special Risk Administrative Support Class must meet the requirements of the Regular Class. For members initially enrolled in the FRS Pension Plan on or after July 1, 2011, eight or more years of Special Risk Class service and age 60, or the age after completing eight years of Special Risk Class service if after age 60. Thirty years of special risk service regardless of age before age 60. Without eight years of Special Risk Class service, members of the Special Risk Administrative Support Class must meet the requirements of the Regular Class. Benefits The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the benefit terms of the FRS Pension Plan. Benefits under the FRS Pension Plan are computed on the basis of age, average final compensation, creditable years of service, and accrual value per year by membership class. Members are also provided in-line-of-duty or regular disability and survivors' benefits. Pension benefits of eligible retirees and annuitants are increased each July 1 by a cost-of-living adjustment. If the member is initially enrolled in the FRS Pension Plan before July 1, 2011, and all service credit was accrued before July 1, 2011, the annual cost-of-living adjustment is 3% per year. If the member is initially enrolled before July 1, 2011, and has service credit on or after July 1, 2011, there is an individually calculated cost-of-living adjustment. This individually calculated annual cost-of-living adjustment is a proportion of 3% determined by dividing the sum of the preJuly 2011 service credit by the total service credit at retirement multiplied by 3%. FRS Pension Plan members initially enrolled on or after July 1, 2011, will not have a cost-of-living adjustment after retirement.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 127The DROP became effective July 1, 1998, subject to provisions of Section 121.091(13), F.S. FRS Pension Plan members who reach normal retirement are eligible to defer receipt of monthly benefit payments while continuing employment with an FRS employer. An employee may participate in the DROP for a maximum of 60 months. Authorized instructional personnel may participate in the DROP for up to 36 additional months beyond their initial 60-month participation period. Monthly retirement benefits remain in the FRS Trust Fund during DROP participation and accrue interest until the member terminates to finalize retirement. As of June 30, 2019, the FRS Trust Fund held in trust $2,542,917,693 in accumulated benefits and interest for 33,490 DROP participants. Of these 33,490 DROP participants, 31,749 were active in the DROP with balances totaling $2,277,211,830. The remaining participants were no longer active in the DROP and had balances totaling $265,705,863 to be processed after June 30, 2019 . Administration The Division administers the FRS Pension Plan. The SBA invests the assets of the FRS Pension Plan held in the FRS Trust Fund. Costs of administering the FRS Pension Plan are funded from earnings on investments of the FRS Trust Fund. Reporting of the FRS Pension Plan is on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when the obligation is incurred. Contributions All participating employers must comply with statutory contribution requirements. Section 121.031(3), F.S., requires an annual actuarial valuation of the FRS Pension Plan, which is provided to the Legislature as guidance for funding decisions. Employer and employee contribution rates are established in Section 121.71, F.S. Employer contribution rates under the uniform rate structure (a blending of both the FRS Pension Plan and Investment Plan rates) are recommended by the actuary but set by the Legislature. Statutes require that any unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) be amortized within 30 plan years. Pursuant to Section 121.031(3)(f), F.S., any surplus actuarial amounts available to offset total retirement system costs are to be amortized over a 10 year rolling period on a level-dollar basis. The balance of legally required reserves for the FRS Pension Plan at June 30, 2019 , was $163,573,726,217. These funds were reserved to provide for total current and future benefits, refunds, and administration of the FRS Pension Plan. The table below presents FRS employer contribution rates. Rates indicated are uniform rates for all FRS members and include UAL contribution rates. These rates do not include a 1.66% contribution rate for the Retiree Health Insurance Subsidy (HIS) Program and a 0.06% assessment for the administration of the FRS Investment Plan and the educational program available to all FRS members. In addition, the July 1, 2018, statutory employer rates do not include the 3.00% mandatory employee contribution for all membership classes except for members in the DROP.

The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the contribution requirements and benefit terms of the HIS Program. The benefit is a monthly payment to assist retirees of state-administered retirement systems in paying their health insurance costs and is administered by the Division. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, eligible retirees and beneficiaries received a monthly HIS payment equal to the number of years of creditable service completed at the time of retirement multiplied by $5. The payments are at least $30 but not more than $150 per month, pursuant to Section 112.363, F.S. To be eligible to receive a HIS benefit, a retiree under a state-administered retirement system must provide proof of eligible health insurance coverage, which can include Medicare. The HIS Program is funded by required contributions from FRS participating employers as set by the Legislature. Employer contributions are a percentage of gross compensation for all active FRS members. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the contribution rate was 1.66% of payroll pursuant to Section 112.363, F.S. The state contributed 100% of its statutorily required contributions for the current and preceding two years. HIS contributions are deposited in a separate trust fund from which HIS payments are authorized. HIS benefits are not guaranteed and are subject to annual legislative appropriation. In the event the legislative appropriation or available funds fail to provide full subsidy benefits to all participants, the legislature may reduce or cancel HIS payments. The Florida National Guard Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan The Florida National Guard Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan (National Guard Benefit) is a single-employer, non-qualified defined benefit pension plan established under Section 250.22, F.S., and is administered by the Division. The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the plan. Florida National Guard retirees must have at least 30 years of Florida National Guard service. Normal retirement is at age 62 with early retirement available beginning at age 60. The monthly benefit is equal to 50% of the federal military pay table for the highest rank held while in the Florida National Guard less the benefit received from the Federal Government for military service. The benefit amount is recalculated whenever the federal military pay table is increased or the federal benefit is increased by a cost of living adjustment. The benefit is payable for the lifetime of the retiree without a survivor benefit option. The table below shows the number of employees covered by the benefit terms. Active Members 10,954 Retirees 753 Terminated Vested Members 299 Total 12,006 The National Guard Benefit is funded by an annual appropriation from General Revenue by the Legislature. Any appropriated funds not obligated for benefit payments owed at June 30 each year revert to the General Revenue Fund. Pension Amounts for Defined Benefit Pension Plans Net Pension Liability At June 30, 2019, the State reported a total liability of $7,709,641,876 for its proportionate share of the net pension liabilities of the defined benefit, multiple-employer cost-sharing pension plans and its single-employer, non-qualified pension plan.

The Department determines the assumptions in the valuations for GASB Statement No. 67 reporting purposes. The FRS Pension Plan's GASB Statement No. 67 valuation is performed annually. The HIS program has a valuation performed biennially that is updated for GASB reporting in the year a valuation is not performed. The most recent experience study for the FRS Pension Plan was completed in 2014 for the period July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2013. Because the HIS Program is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, no experience study has been completed for that program. The actuarial assumptions that determined the total pension liability for the HIS Program were based on certain results of the most recent experience study for the FRS Pension Plan. The total pension liability for each of the defined benefit plans was determined by an actuarial valuation as of the measurement date of July 1, 2018, using the entry age normal actuarial cost method. Inflation increases for the FRS Pension Plan and the HIS is assumed at 2.60%. Payroll growth for both plans is assumed at 3.25%. Both the discount rate and the long-term expected rate of return used for FRS Pension Plan investments is 7.00%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions from participating employers will be made at the statutorily required rates. Based on these assumptions, the plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the discount rate for calculating the total pension liability is equal to the long-term expected rate of return and was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 130Because the HIS Program uses a pay-as-you-go funding structure, a municipal bond rate of 3.87% was used to determine the total pension liability for the program. Mortality assumptions for both plans were based on the Generational RP-2000 with Projection Scale BB tables. There were changes in benefit terms for the FRS Investment Plan prior to the measurement date that affected the total pension liability. An in-line-of-duty presumption was created for firefighters whose death or total and permanent disability results from 21 specified cancers or from the treatment of the cancer. There were no changes in benefit terms for HIS that affected the total pension liability since the prior measurement date. There were no changes between the measurement date and the reporting date which significantly impact the State's proportionate share of the net pension liability, deferred outflows, deferred inflows and pension expense for either FRS Pension Plan or HIS. The following changes in actuarial assumptions occurred in 2018 : FRS Pension Plan: The long-term expected rate of return was reduced from 7.10% to 7.00%. HIS: The municipal rate used to determine total pension liability increased from 3.58% to 3.87%. The long-term expected rate of return on FRS Pension Plan investments was determined using a forward-looking capital market economic model, which includes an adjustment for the inflation assumption. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table: Asset ClassTarget AllocationLong-Term Expected Real Rate of Return Cash 2.9% Fixed income 18.0% 4.4% Global equity Strategic investments 6.0% 6.0% 100.0% The National Guard Benefit has not had a formal actuarial experience study performed. Due to the pay-as-you-go nature of the program, full actuarial valuations will be conducted in even-numbered years. Liabilities for odd-numbered years will be developed based on the results of a full actuarial valuation using standard actuarial roll-forward techniques. The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of the valuation date, July 1, 2018, using the individual entry age normal actuarial cost method. The inflation rate was assumed at 2.60%, the annual increase in Federal Military Pay tables is assumed at 2.00%, and the Cost-of-Living adjustments are assumed at 2.60%. Because the National Guard Benefit uses a pay-as-you-go funding structure, a municipal bond rate of 3.50% was used to determine the total pension liability for the program. Mortality assumptions for the plan was based on the Generational RP-2000 with Projection Scale BB tables. There were no changes in benefit terms to the National Guard Benefit that affected the total pension liability since the prior measurement date. The following changes in actuarial assumptions occurred in 2019 for the National Guard Benefit: The municipal bond rate used to determine total pension liability decreased from 3.87% to 3.50%. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 131Sensitivity Analysis The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity of the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate. The sensitivity analysis shows the impact to the State's proportionate share of the FRS and HIS plan's net pension liability and the National Guard Benefit net pension liability if the discount rate was 1.00% higher or 1.00% lower than the current discount rate.

For each of the following, a portion is recognized in pension expense in the current measurement period, and the balance is amortized as deferred outflows or deferred inflows of resources using a systematic and rational method over a closed period, as defined below: Differences between expected and actual experience with regard to economic and demographic factors - amortized over the average expected remaining service life of all employees that are provided with pensions through the pension plan (active and inactive employees). Changes of assumptions or other inputs - amortized over the average expected remaining service life of all employees that are provided with pensions through the pension plan (active and inactive employees). Changes in proportion and differences between contributions and proportionate share of contributions - amortized over the average expected remaining service life of all employees that are provided with pensions through the pension plan (active and inactive employee). Differences between expected and actual earnings on pension plan investments - amortized over five years. The average expected remaining service life of all employees provided with pensions through the pension plans at June 30, 2018, was 6.4 years for FRS Pension Plan and 7.2 years for HIS. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 132The State's proportionate share of the components of collective pension expense and deferred outflows and inflows of resources reported in the pension allocation schedules for the measurement date year ended June 30, 2018, are presented below for each plan.

Defined Contribution Programs FRS Investment Plan The SBA administers the defined contribution plan officially titled the FRS Investment Plan. The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the contribution requirements and benefit terms of the plan. Retirement benefits are based upon the value of the member's account upon retirement. The FRS Investment Plan provides vesting after one year of service regardless of membership class. If an accumulated benefit obligation for service credit originally earned under the FRS Pension Plan is transferred to the FRS Investment Plan, the years of service required for vesting under the Pension Plan (including the service credit represented by the transferred funds) is required to be vested for these funds and the earnings on the funds. The employer pays a contribution as a percentage of salary that is deposited into the individual member's account. Effective July 1, 2011, there is a mandatory employee contribution of 3.00%. The FRS Investment Plan member directs the investment from the options offered under the plan. Costs of administering the plan, including the FRS Financial Guidance Program, are funded through an employer assessment of 0.06% of payroll and by forfeited benefits of plan members. After termination and applying to receive benefits, the member may rollover vested funds to another qualified plan, structure a periodic payment under the FRS Investment Plan, receive a lump-sum distribution, or leave the funds invested for future distribution. Upon receiving a distribution, other than a de minimis distribution or required minimum distribution, the member is a retiree. Disability coverage is provided for total and permanent disability (non-duty or line of duty); the employer pays an employer contribution to fund the disability benefit which is deposited in the FRS Trust Fund. The member may either transfer the account balance to the FRS Pension Plan when approved for disability retirement to receive guaranteed lifetime monthly benefits under the FRS Pension Plan, or remain in the FRS Investment Plan and rely upon that account balance for retirement income. Survivor benefit coverage is provided to the surviving spouse or dependent children of members who die in line of duty; the employer pays an employer contribution to fund the survivor benefit which is deposited in the FRS Trust Fund. The member's account balance must be transferred to the FRS Pension Plan when approved for survivor benefits to receive guaranteed lifetime monthly benefits under the FRS Pension Plan for the surviving spouse or on behalf of the dependent children until the youngest unmarried dependent child reaches age 18, or up to age 25 if unmarried and enrolled as a fulltime student. State University System Optional Retirement Program Section 121.35, F.S., created the SUSORP for eligible State University System faculty, administrators, and administrative and professional staff. The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the contribution requirements and benefit terms of the program. This program is designed to aid universities in recruiting employees who may not remain in the FRS long enough to vest. The SUSORP is a defined contribution plan that, upon signing an investment contract, provides full and immediate vesting of all contributions paid on behalf of the participants to the participating provider companies to invest as directed by the participant to provide retirement and death benefits. Employees in eligible positions are compulsory participants in the SUSORP unless they elect FRS membership. Faculty in a college of medicine with a faculty practice plan are mandatory SUSORP participants and cannot elect FRS membership. The employing universities were statutorily required to contribute 5.15% of the participants' gross monthly compensation from July 2018, through June 2019. In accordance with Chapter 60U-2, Florida Administrative Code, 0.01% of the employer contribution rate was used for the administration of the SUSORP program and 5.14% was distributed to the provider companies designated by the participant. SUSORP members are not eligible to receive HIS Payments from the HIS Trust Fund. There is a HIS component included in the employer's contribution deposited in the members' accounts. Effective July 1, 2011, there is a mandatory employee contribution of 3.00%. A participant may contribute by salary reduction an amount not to exceed the percentage contributed by the university. In addition to the employer funding to the participants' accounts, the employing universities are required to make a contribution as a percent of covered payroll that is transferred to the FRS Trust Fund to help amortize any UAL. The required UAL contribution rate for fiscal year 2018-19 was 3.50%. Senior Management Service Optional Annuity Program (SMSOAP) Section 121.055, F.S., created the SMSOAP as an optional retirement program alternative for state members of the SMSC. Employees in eligible state positions may make an irrevocable election to participate in the SMSOAP in lieu of the SMSC. The Florida Legislature establishes and amends the contribution requirements and benefit terms of the program, and closed the program to new members effective July 1, 2017. The SMSOAP is a defined contribution plan that, upon signing an investment contract, provides full and immediate vesting of all contributions paid on behalf of the participants to the participating provider companies. Participants direct the investment of contributions to provide retirement and death benefits. Employers were required to contribute 6.27% of covered payroll from2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 135July 2018 through June 2019. The employers' contributions were paid to the provider companies designated by the participant. Effective July 1, 2011, there is a mandatory employee contribution of 3%. A participant may contribute by salary reduction or deduction an amount not to exceed the percentage contributed by the employer. In addition to the employer funding to the participants' accounts, the state agencies are required to make a contribution as a percent of covered payroll that is transferred to the FRS Trust Fund to help amortize the UAL. The required UAL contribution rate for fiscal year 2018-19 was 17.89%. Pension Amounts for Defined Contribution Plans As of June 30, 2019 , the State reported the following pension amounts related to the defined contribution plans: Reporting Period Ended June 30, 2019FRS Investment PlanOptional Retirement PlanOptional Annuity Program Pension Expense1,2$ 70,259,823 $ 46,380,396 $ 71,153 Forfeitures 5,079,654 \u2014 \u2014 Pension Liability 2,965,352 \u2014 \u2014 1 Pension expense excludes the required UAL which is recognized in the Defined Benefit Pension Plan as contributions. 2 The amount of forfeitures is not reflected in pension expense recognized by the State and is used to offset administrative costs. B. Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) The Division of State Group Insurance (DSGI) within the Department is responsible for administering the State Employees' Group Health Insurance Program. The program covers retired employees and is considered an other postemployment benefits plan. Plan Description The DSGI Other Postemployment Benefits Plan (OPEB Plan) is a multiple-employer defined benefit plan which provides healthcare benefits to retired state and university employees in accordance with Section 110.123, Florida Statutes (F.S.). Pursuant to the provisions of Section 112.0801, F.S., all public employers that offer benefits through a group insurance plan shall allow their retirees and their eligible dependents the option to continue participation in the plan during retirement. As a part of normal retirement, a retiree has 60 days after separation to elect post-retirement health coverage. After 60 days, they are no longer entitled to benefits. A retiree is defined as any officer or employee who retires under a State retirement system or State optional annuity or retirement program or is placed on disability retirement and who begins receiving retirement benefits immediately after retirement from employment. In addition, any officer or employee who retires under the Florida Retirement System Investment Plan is considered a \"retiree\" if he or she meets the age and service requirements to qualify for normal retirement or has attained the age of 59.5 years and has the years of service required for vesting. The law also requires the claims experience of the retirees under 65 group to be combined with the claims experience of active employees for premium determination and the premium offered to retired employees to be no more than the premium applicable to active employees. As a result, the state implicitly subsidizes the premium rates paid by retirees due to increasing health care costs with age and the commingling of the claims experience in a single risk pool with a single premium determination for active employees and retirees under age 65. There are six participating employers including, the primary government of the state and 14 discretely presented component units which are reported as one employer in the valuation, along with five other governmental entities. No assets are accumulated in a trust that meets the criteria in paragraph 4 of GASB Statement No. 75. Benefit provisions as described by Section 110.123, F.S., and contributions, can be amended by the Florida Legislature. The Governor's recommended budget and the General Appropriations Act provide for a premium level necessary for funding the program each year on a pay-as-you-go basis.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 136Benefits Provided The benefits provided are the same as those provided for active employees. Spouses and dependents of eligible retirees are also eligible for medical coverage. All non-OPS employees of the State are eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits. Four types of health plans are offered to eligible participants: Standard statewide Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan. High Deductible PPO Plan. Standard Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plan. High Deductible HMO Plan. HMO coverage is available only to those retirees who live or work in the HMO's service area. The four PPO and HMO options are considered managed-care plans and have specific provider networks. Employees covered by benefit terms At valuation date of July 1, 2017, there were 190,666 employees covered by the OPEB Plan, as shown in the following table: Active members 137,962 No coverage active members 15,658 Retired and inactive members 37,046 Total employees 190,666 There are currently zero inactive plan members entitled to but not yet receiving benefits because the OPEB Plan does not provide a vested termination benefit. Contributions Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the State of Florida are required to contribute 100% of the premiums. The State of Florida implicitly subsidizes the healthcare premium rates paid by retirees by allowing them to participate in the same health plan offered to active employees. Retirees under age 65 pay the same premium amounts as applicable to the active employees. Retirees over age 65 are included in the overall risk pool but pay a lesser premium amount than is applicable to active employees because Medicare is the primary payer. Retirees are required to enroll in the Federal Medicare (Medicare) program for their primary coverage as soon as they are eligible. Note that the projected post-65 employee contributions for the fully-insured HMO plan are assumed to cover the entire cost of the program. Total OPEB Liability As of June 30, 2019, the State reported a total OPEB liability of $10,551,552,000 of which the State (primary government) and its component units reported $7,807,094,000 and $2,744,458,000 , respectively, for its proportionate share of the total OPEB liability measured as of June 30, 2018. The table below presents the State and its component units proportion change since the prior measurement date: State Component Units Proportion at prior measurement date, June 30, 2017 73.99 % 26.01 % Proportion at measurement date, June 30, 2018 73.99 % 26.01 % Increase / (Decrease) in proportion \u2014% \u2014%2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 137Actuarial Assumptions and Other Inputs The total OPEB liability was determined using the following actuarial assumptions and other inputs, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified: Valuation date July 1, 2017 Measurement date June 30, 2018 Actuarial cost method Entry age normal Amortization method The recognition period for the changes in assumption and proportionate share is 8 years Actuarial value of assets N/A Inflation 2.60% Salary Increases Varies by FRS Class Discount rate 3.87% Healthcare cost trend rates7.8% and 5.2% for PPO and HMO respectively for 2018, increasing to 10.6% and 8.0% by 2022, then decreasing to 5.2% for both PPO and HMO by 2044. Afterward decreasing by 0.1% for each per year to an ultimate rate of 3.8% by 2076 and thereafter. Retirees' share of benefit-related costs 100% of projected health insurance premiums for retirees Medical aging factors4% per year prior to age 65 3% per year between ages 65 and 75 2% per year between ages 75 and 85 0% per year thereafter Marital status 80% assumed married, with male spouses 3 years older than female spouses Health care participation (HMO) 50% participation assumed, with 25% electing spouse coverage. Members who elected no coverage as actives are assumed to elect coverage in the same proportion as active members with coverage Health care participation (PPO) 50% participation assumed, with 35% electing spouse coverage. Members who elected no coverage as actives are assumed to elect coverage in the same proportion as active members with coverage The discount rate of 3.87% was based on the Bond Buyer General Obligation 20-year Municipal Bond Index. The discount rate changed from 3.58% for the opening balance as of June 30, 2017 to 3.87% as of June 30, 2018 actually resulting in an overall decrease in total OPEB liability. Mortality rates were based on the Generational RP-2000 with Projected Improvement Scale BB. Disabled mortality has not adjusted for mortality improvements. The demographic actuarial assumptions for retirement, disability, withdrawal and salary merit scales used in the June 30, 2017 OPEB valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study for the period January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014, adopted by the Florida Retirement System July 1, 2016 Actuarial Valuation. Comparing with the previous valuation as of July 1, 2015, all the demographic assumptions remain unchanged except active mortality which was based on the Generational RP-2000 with Projected Improvement Scale BB and updated using the rates mandated by Chapter 2015-17, Florida Statutes for pension plans. The overall effect of the mortality change was an increase in the actuarial liability and normal cost. The healthcare trend rates for the first five years used in this valuation were consistent with the Report on the Financial Outlook for the Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2017 through June 30, 2023 as presented on August 3, 2017 at the Self-Insurance Estimating Conference. For out years, the long-term healthcare trends were generated by the Getzen Model, but no longer reflect the potential impact of the excise tax due to its uncertainty. The actuarial liability increased, and normal cost decreased slightly due to the changes in healthcare trend rate assumptions. Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the State of Florida are required to contribute 100% of the premiums. Retiree contributions were not as high as expected based on the expected increases from July 1, 2015, to July 1, 2017. As such, the net implicit subsidy gap further widened and costs increased.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 138Changes in Total OPEB Liability (in thousands) See chart below for details.

Advance Refundings and Current Refundings During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the state took advantage of favorable conditions and issued bonds for the purpose of refunding previously issued bonds.

The proceeds of the current refundings were used to immediately call the refunded bonds or deposited in Special Purpose Investment Accounts with the State Treasury and used to call refunded bonds within 90 days of the issuance of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of the advance refundings were deposited into irrevocable trusts and invested in direct obligations of the Federal government, obligations guaranteed by the Federal government, or Special Purpose Investment Accounts with the State Treasury.

Governmental Activities - Unrestricted Net Position Deficit Governmental activities reflect a negative unrestricted net position balance of $16.2 billion at June 30, 2019. This deficit is primarily the result of education-related bonds in which the state is responsible for the debt, but the state colleges, state universities, or the local school districts own the capital assets. Because the state does not own these capital assets, the bonded debt is not netted on the line item \"Net investment in capital assets.\" Instead, this bonded debt is netted with unrestricted net position. Education-related bonds include SBE Capital Outlay Bonds; PECO Bonds; State University System Improvement Bonds; and Lottery Education Bonds; which have a total ending balance at June 30, 2019, of $9.1 billion. The state has an additional $0.7 billion in other bonds, including Florida Forever bonds in which the state does not own the related capital assets. The resources related to the payment of this debt will be provided from future revenue sources. If these bonds were removed, the adjusted unrestricted net position for governmental activities would be a negative $6.4 billion. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 152B. Certificates of Participation 1.

Public-Private Partnerships Pursuant to Section 334.30, Florida Statutes, the Department of Transportation (Department) executed two 35-year, Public Private Partnership concession agreements in March and October of 2009 for the design, build, finance, operation and maintenance of the Interstate 595 Corridor and the Port Miami Tunnel. Payments consist of construction-period payments, lump-sum final acceptance payments upon completion of construction, and annual performance-based availability payments to be made during the 30-year operations and maintenance period. The Department executed a 40-year concession agreement in September 2014 for the design, build, finance, operation and maintenance of 21 miles of the Interstate 4 Corridor in Seminole and Orange Counties. Annual availability payments are all-inclusive payments consisting of unpaid portions of construction costs, annual operations costs, and maintenance expenses. The payment schedule below includes the full amount of the estimated payments for the Interstate 595 Corridor and the Port Miami Tunnel and is an estimate of unpaid construction payments during the term of the agreements based on the percentage of completion of the projects at June 30, 2019 , for the Interstate 4 Corridor. The annual availability payments for Interstate 595 Corridor and the Port Miami Tunnel are performance-based and are subject to change based on a fixed percentage as defined in the agreement and on the Consumer Price Index, which could impact the payment schedule. In October 2015, the Department executed a supplemental agreement with the I-595 concessionaire reflecting overall cost reductions for this project as a result of the concessionaire's debt refinancing. The annual availability payments for the Interstate 4 Corridor are performance-based with a portion of the payment that is level and another portion that is indexed based on the Consumer Price Index, which could impact the payment schedule. The lanes were open to traffic on Interstate 595 and Port Miami Tunnel in March and August 2014, respectively. Construction for the Interstate 4 Corridor is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021. The Department has one other public-private partnership agreement for the design, build, and finance of another transportation project. The unpaid construction costs for this agreement as of June 30, 2019 represents 1% of payments due in 2020.

If the Corporation elects not to terminate the lease upon an event of default, it may exclude the Department, sell or lease certain equipment, and hold the Department liable for monetary damages. Additionally, following an event of non-appropriation, the lease automatically terminates, and the Department must immediately surrender all projects to the Trustee, who may then liquidate, rent, or lease the projects. The Trustee may also exercise all remedies available to the Corporation or cause the Corporation to pursue such remedies.

Additionally, upon an event of default, without terminating the lease, it may take possession of the project, exclude the Department, and sublet the project. In each case the Department is liable for monetary damages. The Trustee may exercise all remedies available to the Corporation, and may take possession of the projects, or any portions thereof, and dispose of the Corporation's interest therein for the benefit of the owners of the outstanding certificates.

State Risk Management Trust Fund The State Risk Management Trust Fund (Fund) provides property insurance coverage for state buildings and contents against loss from fire, lightning, sinkholes, flood, and other hazards customarily insured by extended coverage. The property insurance program has a self-insured retention of $2 million per occurrence for losses arising from all perils listed above except named windstorm and flood. The property insurance program also has a self-insured retention of $2 million per occurrence for losses arising from named windstorm and flood, but with an additional annual aggregate self-insured retention of $40 million. Commercial reinsurance is purchased for losses over the self-insured retention up to $68.5 million per occurrence for named windstorm and flood losses through February 15, 2020, and $225 million per occurrence for covered perils other than named wind and flood. The Fund's estimated liability for unpaid property insurance claims at the fiscal year-end is determined by an actuarial method and includes an amount for losses incurred but not yet reported. The amount paid for property claim losses did not exceed the self-insured retentions for the last two fiscal years. Changes in the Fund's property insurance claims liability amount for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 , and June 30, 2019, were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year EndedBeginning of Fiscal Year LiabilityCurrent Year Claims and Changes in EstimateClaim PaymentsBalance at Fiscal Year-end June 30, 2018 $ 1,235 $ 785 $ (940) $ 1,080 June 30, 2019 $ 1,080 $ 519 $ (511) $ 1,088 The estimated liability for unpaid property insurance claims for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, does not include outstanding property claim loss payments resulting from Hurricane Irma that struck Florida in September of 2017 or outstanding property claim loss payments resulting from Hurricane Michael that struck Florida in October of 2018. Estimated unpaid loss payments for Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Michael total $16.5 million. The Fund also provides casualty insurance coverage for the risks of loss related to federal civil rights and employment actions, workers' compensation, court-awarded attorney fees, automobile liability, and general liability. The state is self-insured for all claims associated with liability risks and in-state workers' compensation coverage. The state purchases an insurance policy for out-of-state workers' compensation coverage. The estimated liability for unpaid casualty insurance claims at June 30, 2019, was $1.15 billion. This amount was determined through an actuarial method based on historical paid and incurred losses and includes an amount for losses incurred but not yet reported. In addition, this amount includes the present value of workers' compensation indemnity claims liability of $252.5 million, discounted using a 4 percent annual percentage rate per Section 625.091, Florida Statutes. The undiscounted workers' compensation indemnity claims liability is $352.6 million.

Employee and Retiree Health Insurance Funds Employees and retirees may obtain health care services through participation in the state's group health insurance plan or through membership in a health maintenance organization plan under contract with the state. The state's risk financing activities associated with state group health insurance, such as the risks of loss related to medical and prescription drug claims, are administered through the State Employees Group Health Insurance Trust Fund, an internal service fund. It is the practice of the state not to purchase commercial coverage for the risks of losses covered by this program. The program's estimated fiscal year-end liability includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported, which is based on analyses of historical data performed by both the state and its contractors. Changes in claims liability amounts for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 , and June 30, 2019, were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year EndedBeginning of Fiscal Year LiabilityCurrent Year Claims and Changes in EstimateClaim PaymentsBalance at Fiscal Year-end June 30, 2018 $ 171,010 $ 1,946,441 $ (1,950,153 ) $ 167,298 $ 2,118,454 $ (2,088,265 ) $ 197,487 During the year, for program operations, both employee and retiree participation in the state group health insurance program are accounted for in the State Employees Group Health Insurance Trust Fund. Retiree participation in the program is considered an Other Postemployment Benefit (OPEB) for purposes of this report. See Note 6, Section B regarding OPEB for additional information. Asset and liability balances related to retiree participation in the program as of June 30, 2019, were transferred from the State Employees Group Health Insurance Trust Fund and reported in Other Agency Funds in accordance with the requirements of GASB Codification Section P53, Reporting Assets Accumulated for Defined Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions not Provided Through Trusts that Meet Specified Criteria. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 167NOTE 13 - FLORIDA PREPAID COLLEGE PROGRAM The Stanley G. Tate Florida Prepaid College Program (Program) was created in 1987 to provide a medium through which the costs of tuition, tuition differential fee, local fees, and dormitory residence may be paid in advance of enrollment in a state postsecondary institution at a rate lower than the projected corresponding cost at the time of actual enrollment. The Florida Prepaid College Board (Board) administers the Program, and the State of Florida guarantees the obligations of the Board to qualified beneficiaries if moneys in the Program are insufficient. The Program is accounted for in an enterprise fund. An actuarial study is performed to determine the Program's funding status. The actuarial present value of future contract benefits reflects the present value of estimated future contract benefits and expenses and is adjusted for the effects of projected tuition and fees increases, dormitory housing fees increases, and termination of contracts. Additional information as of June 30, 2019, is as follows: Actuarial present value of future contract benefits and expenses payable $ 11,292,893,208 Net position available (net of outstanding refund payments and unrealized gain/loss on securities lending portfolio) $ 14,990,000,000 Net position as a percentage of future contract benefits and expenses obligation 132.7 %2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 168NOTE 14 -INSURANCE ENTERPRISES The State of Florida has established multiple enterprises that provide insurance, reinsurance, and guarantee services. The primary risk exposures to the state relate to catastrophic hurricane losses, access to liquidity from credit markets, and ultimate dependence on public assessments. A. FLORIDA HURRICANE CATASTROPHE FUND The Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) was created in 1993 by the Florida Legislature, as a state fund administered by the State Board of Administration (SBA) to provide a source of reimbursement to most residential property insurers for catastrophic hurricane losses, thereby creating additional insurance capacity. Most admitted residential property insurers writing FHCF covered policies are required to purchase reimbursement coverage with the FHCF. The reimbursement coverage covers a portion of hurricane losses in excess of an insurer's share of an industry wide retention, up to the lesser of either the statutory limit or the actual claims-paying capacity of the FHCF. For the contract year ended May 31, 2019, the industry retention for determining each insurer's retention was $7.255 billion per hurricane for the two hurricanes with the largest losses and $2.418 billion for each additional hurricane in the contract year. The aggregate coverage capacity for the contract year (in excess of retention) was $17.0 billion. The statute requires that an actuarially indicated formula developed by an independent actuary be used to calculate the reimbursement premiums collected for the coverage. The SBA is required to contract with each insurer writing covered policies in the state to reimburse the insurer for a specified percentage of losses from covered events in excess of the insurer's retention. The total obligation of the SBA with respect to all contracts covering a particular contract year is statutorily capped at the \"actual claims-paying capacity\" of the FHCF, defined by law as the sum of the balance of the fund as of December 31 of the contract year, plus any reinsurance purchased by the fund, plus the amount the SBA is able to raise through the issuance of post-event revenue bonds. This amount is determined by the FHCF based on reports of its financial advisors and bond underwriters and is reviewed by the FHCF Advisory Council. The FHCF has a fiscal year end of June 30 and its reimbursement contracts expire on May 31. As of June 30, 2019, the FHCF had a net position of $10.29 billion, including the net position of the State Board of Administration Finance Corporation. If available resources and pre-catastrophe debenture financing are not adequate to satisfy reimbursement claims, the State Board of Administration Finance Corporation may issue revenue bonds secured by emergency assessments. The SBA has the sole authority to direct the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation to levy assessments on most property and casualty insurance policy premiums on behalf of the FHCF. Aggregate assessments may not exceed 10% and assessments in relation to losses in one contract year may not exceed 6%. This assessment authority is neither related to nor restricted by the assessments levied by either Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens), a discretely presented component unit, or the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, Inc. (FIGA). As of June 30, 2019, the FHCF is not levying assessments. Hurricane losses represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported claims during the year that exceed the participating insurers' individual company retention levels. The estimates for current year and prior year losses are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known and such adjustments are included in current operations. During the 2018 hurricane season, the State of Florida experienced Hurricane Michael, which made landfall at Mexico Beach, Florida, as a major Category 5 storm on October 10, 2018. As of June 30, 2019, the estimated ultimate loss to the FHCF for this hurricane was $1.45 billion. Hurricane Irma, which occurred during the 2017 hurricane season, had an estimated ultimate loss to the FHCF of $2.50 billion as of June 30, 2018. Due to increased loss development, Hurricane Irma's estimated ultimate loss to the FHCF as of June 30, 2019 was increased to a total of $5.00 billion, an additional $2.50 billion increase for fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. In April 2013, pre-event Series 2013A Revenue Bonds were issued in the amount of $2.0 billion to maximize the ability of the FHCF to meet future obligations. The proceeds from these bonds may be used to pay for losses incurred from future covered events. Investment earnings on these funds, as well as reimbursement premiums, if necessary, are used to pay the debt service requirements of these bonds. The remaining amount due at maturity and the maturity date for these bonds is $1.0 billion on July 1, 2020. In March 2016, pre-event Series 2016A Revenue Bonds were issued in the amount of $1.2 billion to provide funds, together with other available funds, to maximize the ability of the FHCF to meet future obligations. The proceeds from these bonds may be used to pay for losses incurred from future covered events. Investment earnings on these funds, as well as reimbursement2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 169premiums, if necessary, are used to pay the debt service requirements of these bonds. The amounts due at maturity and the maturity dates for these bonds will be $550 million on July 1, 2019, and $650 million on July 1, 2021. In addition to the issuance of bonds, the FHCF purchased aggregate excess catastrophe reinsurance providing coverage to the FHCF for 92% of $1.0 billion of losses in excess of $10.5 billion of losses, effective June 1, 2019 through May 31, 2020; and $1.0 billion of losses in excess of $10.5 billion of losses, effective June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2019. B. CITIZENS PROPERTY INSURANCE CORPORATION Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens) was established on August 1, 2002, pursuant to Section 627.351(6), Florida Statutes (the Act), to provide certain residential and non-residential property insurance coverage to qualified risks in the State of Florida under circumstances specified in the Act. This legislation was enacted such that property insurance be provided through Citizens to applicants who are in good faith entitled to procure insurance through the voluntary market but are unable to do so. Citizens results from a combination of the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (the FRPCJUA) and the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association (the FWUA). The FRPCJUA was renamed Citizens and the FWUA's rights, obligations, assets, liabilities and all insurance policies were transferred to Citizens. Unlike private insurers offering coverage through the admitted market, Citizens is not required to obtain or to hold a certificate of authority issued by the Florida Department of Financial Services, Office of Insurance Regulation (the Office). Likewise, Citizens is not subject to Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements or required to have a pledged deposit on file with the State of Florida. For purposes of its tax-exempt status, Citizens is considered a political subdivision and an integral part of the State of Florida. As such, Citizens' operations may be affected by the legislative process. Citizens operates pursuant to a Plan of Operation (the Plan), under the Act, approved by the Financial Services Commission (the Commission) of the State of Florida. The Commission is composed of the Governor, the Chief Financial Officer, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of Florida. Citizens is supervised by a Board of Governors (the Board) which consists of nine individuals who reside in the State of Florida. The Governor appoints three members, and the Chief Financial Officer, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives each appoint two members of the Board. At least one of the two members appointed by each appointing officer must have a demonstrated expertise in the insurance industry. The Chief Financial Officer designates one of the appointees as the Board's chair. All Board members serve at the pleasure of their appointing officers. Citizens' President and Chief Executive Officer (Executive Director) and senior managers are engaged by and serve at the pleasure of the Board. The Executive Director is subject to confirmation by the Florida Senate. Pursuant to the Act, all revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of Citizens shall remain divided into three separate accounts: the Personal Lines Account, the Commercial Lines Account and the Coastal Account (collectively, the Accounts). A brief history of each account follows: Personal Lines Account History - The FRPCJUA began operations on January 21, 1993, after Hurricane Andrew, pursuant to Section 627.351(6), F.S., to provide certain residential property insurance coverage to qualified risks in the State of Florida for applicants who were in good faith entitled to procure insurance through the private market but were unable to do so. Residential property coverage consists of the types of coverage provided to homeowners, mobile homeowners, tenants, condominium unit owners, and similar policies. The policies provide coverage for all perils covered under a standard residential policy, subject to certain underwriting requirements. Such policies may exclude windstorm coverage on property within eligible areas. This portion of the FRPCJUA's activities became the Personal Lines Account (PLA) under Citizens. Commercial Lines Account History - The Florida Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (FPCJUA) was activated in early 1994 to provide commercial residential coverage (i.e., coverage for condominium associations, apartment buildings and homeowner associations) to organizations unable to obtain such coverage from a private insurer. During 1995, legislation was enacted to transfer all obligations, rights, assets, and liabilities related to commercial residential coverage from the FPCJUA to the FRPCJUA. The legislation required that the premiums, losses, assets and liabilities be accounted for separately from the FRPCJUA's personal residential business. This portion of the FRPCJUA's activities became the Commercial Lines Account (CLA) under Citizens. In 2006, the FPCJUA was re-activated to provide commercial non-residential wind-only coverage. In 2007, legislation was enacted which resulted in the transfer and assumption of the FPCJUA's commercial non-residential policies by Citizens. These policies were added to the CLA.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 170Coastal Account History - The FWUA, which was a residual market mechanism for windstorm and hail coverage in select areas of the State of Florida, was created by an act of the Florida Legislature in 1970 pursuant to Section 627.351(2), Florida Statutes. FWUA was a Florida unincorporated association, the members of which were all property insurance companies holding a certificate of authority to provide property insurance coverage in the State of Florida. FWUA provided policies of windstorm insurance for property owners within the eligible areas who were unable to obtain such coverage from private insurers. Insured properties include personal residential, commercial residential and commercial non-residential properties. This portion of the FWUA's activities became the High-Risk Account under Citizens. In 2007, Citizens received authority to issue multi-peril policies in the High-Risk Account. Pursuant to legislative changes during 2011, the High-Risk Account was renamed the Coastal Account. ASSESSMENTS Citizens' enabling legislation and the Plan establish a process by which Citizens is required to levy assessments to recover deficits incurred in a given plan year for any of its three accounts. Deficits are calculated separately, and assessments are levied separately, for each of the three accounts. The Plan provides for deficits to be determined in accordance with standards promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, adjusted for certain items. In the event of a Plan Year Deficit in any Account, Citizens must first levy an assessment against the premium of each Citizens policyholder (the Citizens Policyholder Surcharge) in each of Citizens' Accounts, as a uniform percentage of the premium of the policy of up to 15% of such premium. Citizens Policyholder Surcharges are not subject to commissions, fees, or premium taxes; however, failure to pay a Citizens Policyholder Surcharge will be treated as failure to pay premiums. If the Citizens Policyholder Surcharge is insufficient to eliminate a deficit in the Coastal Account, Citizens would then levy a Regular Assessment on assessable insurers, as defined in Section 627.351(6), F.S. The assessment is based upon each assessable insurer's share of direct written premium for the Subject Lines of Business in the State of Florida for the calendar year preceding the year in which the deficit occurred, and is applied as a uniform percentage of up to 2% of subject premiums. The Regular Assessment is not available for deficits within the PLA or CLA. If the deficit in any year in any account is greater than the amount that may be recovered through Citizens' Policyholder Surcharges and Regular Assessments, Citizens is required to levy any remaining Plan Year Deficit as an Emergency Assessment. An Emergency Assessment is to be collected by all assessable insurers, Surplus Lines Agents, and Citizens from policyholders upon the issuance or renewal of policies for Subject Lines of Business for as many years as necessary to cover the Plan Year Deficit in the account. The primary difference between the assessment base for Regular Assessments and Emergency Assessments is the inclusion of Citizens' direct written premium in the assessment base for Emergency Assessments, in addition to the Regular Assessment being limited to the Coastal account only. For purposes of Regular Assessments and Emergency Assessments, the \"Subject Lines of Business\" are all lines of property and casualty insurance, including automobile lines, but excluding accident and health, workers' compensation, and medical malpractice insurance, and also excluding insurance under the National Flood and Federal Crop insurance programs. In November 2012, Citizens received notice of an assessment from FIGA totaling $27.8 million. Amounts recouped from policyholders relating to this assessment were $154 thousand and $1.1 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, Citizens reported an over-collection in the amount of $152 thousand within other current liabilities on the statements of net position. Citizens discontinued collections effective March 1, 2018 and settled the net over-collection in May 2018 with FIGA pursuant to Section 631.57(3)(f), Florida Statutes, and filed a final reconciliation with the Office. Effective March 5, 2015, the 2005 Emergency Assessment was terminated for all policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2015. The 2005 Emergency Assessment was anticipated to be collected over a ten year period commencing July 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, collections in excess of the Emergency Assessment were $141.7 million and $143.6 million, respectively. These balances are reported as the reserve for future assessments on the accompanying statements of net position until such time as the Board approves a change to direct these excess collections to be used for any lawful purpose available within the Plan. 2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 171C. FLORIDA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION, INC. The Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, Inc. (FIGA), a not-for-profit corporation, was established by the Florida Legislature through the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association Act of 1970 (the Act). FIGA was created to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims of insolvent insurers and to assist in the detection and prevention of insurers' insolvencies. FIGA operates under the supervision and approval of a board of directors, comprised of five to nine persons, recommended by the member insurers pursuant to Section 631.56, F.S., and subsequently appointed by the Department of Financial Services. The members of FIGA are all insurers that hold a certificate of authority to provide property and casualty coverage in the State of Florida. The funding of FIGA's activities is provided by distributions from the estates of insolvent insurers and assessments of members. The assessments are calculated and, as considered necessary, levied against member insurers on the basis of net direct written premiums in the State of Florida in the classes protected by the Act. FIGA obtains the amount of the net direct written premiums, by company and by class of protection, to use as the basis for assessment calculations. The maximum regular assessment rate is 2%. In addition to the regular assessment, during 2006, the Florida Legislature granted FIGA the authority to levy an emergency assessment up to an additional 2% of net direct written premiums for the account specified in Section 631.55(2)(b), F.S., to pay covered claims of insurers rendered insolvent by the effects of a hurricane. Also in 2006, FIGA was granted the authority to work with an affected municipality, county, or financing conduit organization under Chapter 163, F.S., to issue tax-exempt bonds should the funding need arise for the account specified in Section 631.55(2)(b), F.S. As of June 30, 2019, FIGA has not needed to utilize this bonding authority and no tax-exempt bonds have been issued. D. FLORIDA WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION, INC. The Florida Workers' Compensation Insurance Guaranty Association, Inc. (FWCIGA), a not-for-profit corporation, was established by the Florida Legislature in 1997 as a merger of the workers' compensation account of the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, Inc., and the Florida Self-Insurance Fund Guaranty Association. FWCIGA was created to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims of insolvent workers' compensation insurers and to assist in the detection and prevention of insurers' insolvencies. FWCIGA operates under the supervision and approval of a board of directors, comprised of eleven persons. Eight directors are recommended by member insurers pursuant to Section 631.912, F.S., and subsequently appointed by the Florida Department of Financial Services. The remaining three directors are the Florida Insurance Consumer Advocate, designee of the state's Chief Financial Officer, and one person with commercial insurance experience appointed by the Governor. The members of FWCIGA are all insurers that hold a certificate of authority to provide workers' compensation coverage in the State of Florida. The funding of FWCIGA's activities is provided by distributions from the estates of insolvent insurers and assessments of members. The assessments are calculated and, as considered necessary, levied against member insurers on the basis of workers' compensation net direct written premiums in the State of Florida without taking into account any applicable discounts or credits for deductibles. FWCIGA obtains the amount of the net direct written premiums, by company, to use as the basis for assessment calculations. The maximum assessment rate is 2% for insurance companies and self-insurance funds. In addition to the regular assessment, the Florida Legislature granted FWCIGA the authority to levy an up to an additional 1.5% of net direct written premiums if the 2% assessment is insufficient to make payments for the calendar year.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 172NOTE 15 - CONTINGENCIES A. Federal Family Education Loan Program The Florida Department of Education (FDOE) administers the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), 20 USC s. 1071 et. seq. The primary purpose is to guarantee the repayment of principal and accrued interest of eligible student loans made by participating lenders under the FFELP. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (the Amendments) were enacted on October 7, 1998, with a retroactive date of October 1, 1998, for most provisions. The Amendments changed the financial and reporting structure of guaranty agencies. Pursuant to the amendments, the FDOE established a Federal Student Loan Reserve Fund (Federal Fund) and a Guaranty Agency Operating Fund, as required, to account for the FFELP activities, 20 USC s. 1072a and s. 1072b. The regulations for administering the program are found in Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 682. Student loans are issued by participating financial institutions to eligible students and their parents under FFELP. If a student loan guaranteed by FDOE defaults, the Federal Fund pays the lender for the defaulted student loan. The United States Department of Education (USDOE) is the program's reinsurer. Reinsurance amounts received from the USDOE to replenish the Federal Fund are currently 100%. Once the loan has defaulted, the FDOE begins collection activities with the borrower. The passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ended the guarantor portion of the program after June 30, 2010. FDOE still maintains administrative and collection activities for the loans guaranteed by FDOE prior to July 1, 2010, as required by FFELP. The Federal Fund is used to account for assets held by FDOE as an agent for the Federal government and therefore is custodial in nature and is the property of USDOE. At June 30, 2019, approximately $278 million of Program loans were still outstanding from loans that had been made prior to the Program ending on June 30, 2010. The amount of potential liability to the federal fund is indeterminable. B. Federally Assisted Grant Programs Medicaid Program - The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is requesting state reimbursement of amounts determined unallowable under the Florida Medicaid Reform Section 1115 Demonstration Waiver Special Terms and Conditions for state fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, through June 30, 2014. The CMS alleged the State of Florida submitted Low Income Pool (LIP) cost limit reconciliations showing LIP payments in excess of allowable costs for LIP providers. The disallowance notice was issued on September 28, 2016, and the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) filed its Request for Reconsideration with the CMS on November 21, 2016. On January 19, 2017, AHCA's Request for Reconsideration was denied by CMS. AHCA has filed an appeal with the Department Appeals Board (DAB). At this time, the briefing has concluded and a decision is expected to be issued. If AHCA is ultimately unsuccessful in its challenges, it may be required to return $97,570,183 to the Federal Government. Medicaid Program - CMS is requesting state reimbursement of the federal share paid for claimed Medicaid expenditures associated with LIP payments made under Florida's Medicaid Reform Section 1115 Demonstration covering the period from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2009. The disallowance notices were issued on September 28, 2016, and AHCA filed its Request for Reconsideration with the CMS on November 21, 2016. On January 19, 2017, AHCA's Request for Reconsideration was denied by CMS. AHCA has filed an appeal with the DAB. At this time the briefing has concluded, and a decision is expected to be issued. If AHCA is ultimately unsuccessful in its challenges, it may be required to return $63,233,036 to the Federal Government. Medicaid Program - On July 29, 2016, AHCA posted amended outpatient Medicaid rates for state fiscal year 2016-2017 to its website. Those Medicaid reimbursement rate change forms were dated July 29, 2016 (\"July 29 Rate Letters\"). The Public Health Trust of Miami-Dade County, Florida filed its Petition for Formal Administrative Determination of Invalidity of Agency Statements and Existing Rule 59G-6.030 on October 31, 2016. The petition was then consolidated with other petitions that challenged the same issue. Petitioners alleged the July 29 Rate Letters and the methodology by which AHCA used to calculate the outpatient Medicaid rates are statements that constitute an unadopted rule. On February 13, 2017, the Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) issued an Order Extending Stay of Unadopted Rule Challenge and Rescheduling Final Hearing in Existing Rule Challenge. On February 23, 2017, the final hearing was held at DOAH. The Petitioners were unsuccessful and the Agency prevailed. The hospitals filed an appeal. The appeal has concluded and the Court entered an Order in favor of the Hospitals. At this time the Agency is attempting to calculate the impact of this challenge which could result in a net fiscal impact in excess of $25 million.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 173Medicaid Program - This is a statewide class action lawsuit filed in 2005 related to children's access to medical and dental services. After a protracted trial, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in 2014 that were unfavorable to the AHCA, without regard to the fact that in the meantime Florida's Medicaid program had been entirely transformed by the implementation of Statewide Medicaid Managed Care. In 2015, the State entered into a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs requiring ongoing meetings and performance measures over the next four years. The measures reached in 2019 will determine whether the case will conclude or potentially go back to trial. If certain measurements are not met, the State may be required to seek an appropriation from the legislature in order to pay all pediatric physicians 100 percent of the Medicare rate. Depending on the outcome of the ongoing settlement negotiations, the cost of this case could reasonably exceed $25 million going forward. C. Other Disability Rights Florida Inc. v. Julie Jones, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, Case No. 3:18-cv-179- J-25JRK (U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida) - Plaintiffs alleged that the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) denied mental health care to mentally ill inmates confined in the inpatient mental health units, in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. In February 2018, the Court approved a consent decree under which DOC agreed to implement widespread changes to its psychiatric treatment system. Potential costs to implement this agreement exceed $115 million. Inpatient/Outpatient hospital rate challenges - Approximately 60 petitioner hospitals challenged Notice of Agency Action letters issued by the AHCA in February 2015 regarding inpatient and outpatient hospital rates. The hospitals filed petitions with the Agency Clerk, which were forwarded to the Division of Administrative Hearings. By mutual agreement between AHCA and the petitioners, the cases were relinquished back to AHCA in March 2015 for settlement negotiations, which continue. Approximately half of these petitions have been resolved by final order. An adjustment to inpatient and outpatient reimbursement rates could result in a net fiscal impact exceeding $25 million.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 174NOTE 16 - LITIGATION Due to its size and broad range of activities, the State is involved in various, though sometimes routine, legal actions. The following are the significant loss contingencies associated with legal proceedings: A. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, et al., v. Dolliver, et al., Case No. SC19-2047 (Fla. Supreme Court); Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, et al., v. Dellaselva, et al., Case No. 2D18-1393 (Fla. 1st DCA); Dellaselva, et al., v. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, et al., Case No. 03-CA-1947 (20th Cir. Lee County); Ayers, et al., v. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Case No. 05-CA-4120 (9th Cir. Orange County); In re Citrus Canker Litigation, Case No. 03-8255 CA 13 (11th Cir. Miami-Dade County) Plaintiffs in these actions are homeowners seeking compensation for the removal of their canker-exposed citrus trees by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (DACS) after January 1, 2000. Dellaselva (styled Dolliver in the Supreme Court) , Case No. 03-CA-1947, concerns homeowners in Lee County. Plaintiffs were awarded judgments of $13,625,249 for compensation and $892,886 in attorneys' fees and costs, plus interest. The 2017 Florida Legislature appropriated $16,475,800 for these judgments, but the Governor vetoed the appropriation and no such appropriation was made in either 2018 or 2019. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus ordering the DACS to pay the judgments, with interest. The Second District Court of Appeal affirmed the writ. The Department's appeal to the Florida Supreme Court is currently pending. Ayers, Case No. 05-CA-4120, concerns homeowners in Orange County. Plaintiffs were awarded judgments of $31,534,722 for compensation, and $770,813 for attorneys' fees and costs, plus interest. These judgments remain unpaid, while accruing post-judgment interest. In re Citrus Canker Litigation, Case No. 03-8255 CA 13, concerns homeowners in Miami-Dade County. The Court found no liability on behalf of the DACS. Plaintiffs' appeal is pending. B. McLane Suneast, Inc. v. Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Case No. 14-CA-372 (9th Cir., Osceola County) McLane Suneast, Inc., a major distributor of tobacco products including cigars, cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco, alleged that the State's taxes and surcharges of cigarettes and other tobacco products, including those established by the \"Protecting Florida's Health Act\" (Chapter 2009-79, Laws of Florida), violate the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the U. S. Constitution, as well as the Due Process Clause and Equal Rights Clause of the Florida Constitution, by taxing different kinds of tobacco products disparately, without taxing or levying surcharges upon cigars. Plaintiff sought declaratory and monetary relief, including a refund of all cigarette and other tobacco taxes and surcharges paid to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation since July 1, 2009, the total amount of which exceeded $5.5 billion by the beginning of 2019. The Department settled the case in May 2019 as part of a comprehensive settlement involving numerous, unrelated refund claims by Plaintiff, including those based on Micjo v. Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, 78 So. 3d 124 (Fla. 2nd DCA 2012), previously estimated at $49 million. The parties settled the case and all unrelated claims for $42.5 million total, after which Plaintiff dismissed the case in August 2019. C. Hoffer, et al., v. Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, Case No. 19-11921 (U.S. Court of Appeals, 11th Cir.); Hoffer, et al., v. Secretary, Department of Corrections, Case No. 4:17-cv-214-MW-CAS (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Florida) Plaintiffs allege that the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) failed to provide proper medical treatment to inmates with chronic Hepatitis C, thus violating the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. In November 2017, the Court certified the class and in December 2017 issued a preliminary injunction ordering DOC to provide certain treatment. On April 18, 2019, the U.S District Court issued a final order requiring DOC to treat all inmates with Hepatitis C and, among other requirements, to improve its identification of people with the disease. DOC's appeal of the order is pending. The claim potentially represents future costs exceeding $46 million for testing, treatment and staffing.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 175D. Geffin, et al., v. DeSantis, et al., Case No. SC20-27 (Fla. Supreme Court); DeSantis, et al., v. Geffin, et al., Case No. 1D19-928 (Fla. 1st DCA); Geffin, et al., v. DeSantis, et al., No. 2017-CA-1364 (2nd Cir. Leon County) and Villacorta, et al., v. DeSantis, et al., No. 2017-CA-1526 (2nd Cir. Leon County). These two cases have been consolidated under Case No. 2017-CA-1364. Plaintiffs allege that the State of Florida Governor, Board of Governors, Board of Education, Department of Education, and Commissioner of Education are liable for failure to match private donations to public colleges, universities, and their students pursuant to four statutory programs. Plaintiffs allege breach and impairment of contract and seek declaratory relief and damages of over $1 billion. The First District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's denial of Defendants' motions to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds. Plaintiffs are currently seeking discretionary review by the Florida Supreme Court. E. Florida Education Association, et al., v. Department of Education, et al., Case No. 4-17-cv-414-RH/CAS (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Florida) Plaintiffs, including the Florida Education Association and seven individual teachers, sought to maintain a class action against the Department of Education (DOE) and certain school districts. Plaintiffs allege violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Florida Civil Rights Act based on claims of racial and age discrimination related to the application of the Best and Brightest Teacher Scholarship Program. The parties reached a settlement for which the 2019 Florida Legislature appropriated $15.5 million and the Court has issued preliminary approval. F. UMB Bank, National Association, v. Florida Department of Transportation, Case No. 2018-CA-2677 (2d Cir., Leon County) Plaintiff, as successor trustee of the bonds sold to fund construction of the Garcon Point Bridge, filed suit against the Florida Department of Transportation (DOT), which insures, operates, and maintains the bridge pursuant to a Lease Purchase Agreement with the Santa Rosa Bay Bridge Authority. Plaintiff alleges that a toll increase is necessary to facilitate debt service and seeks damages of $75 million for failing to increase tolls when initially requested by Plaintiff. In December 2019, the trial court granted Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to DOT's counterclaim and ordered DOT to implement the toll recommendations of its independent traffic consultant. The case remains open as to Plaintiff's claims for damages and attorneys' fees.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 176NOTE 17 - DEFICIT FUND BALANCE AND NET POSITION A. Governmental Funds The Public Education Fund has a deficit unassigned fund balance of approximately $821.1 million. The deficit is primarily the result of establishing an advance (long-term liability) on potential future claims by the Department of Financial Services' Unclaimed Property Trust Fund. The Department of Financial Services pays claims as they are due from current remittances. If sufficient funds are not available to pay claims, requests are made by the Department of Financial Services to the Department of Education to return the amount of funds necessary to pay claims or funds are borrowed from the Department of Financial Services' Trust Funds Control Fund and repaid prior to year-end. B. Proprietary Funds The Lottery has a deficit unrestricted net position of approximately $53.2 million. This deficit is a result of certain liabilities being recorded for reporting purposes only and being excluded from the calculation of transfers to the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund. This deficit does not affect the Lottery's ability to pay prizes or to provide services. The Internal Service Fund, Data Centers, has a deficit net position of approximately $15.6 million. This deficit is primarily due to long-term obligations, consisting mainly of a compensated absences liability and an accrual of pension and other post- employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities. The compensated absences liability will be liquidated on a pay-as-you-go basis. The pension and OPEB liabilities do not require cash flows and have no effect on the ability to provide services. The Internal Service Fund, Other , has a deficit net position of approximately $98.9 million. This deficit is primarily due to long-term obligations, consisting mainly of a compensated absences liability and an accrual of pension and OPEB liabilities. The compensated absences liability will be liquidated on a pay-as-you-go basis. The pension and OPEB liabilities do not require cash flows and have no effect on the ability to provide services. C. Component Units The Component Units, Florida Colleges and Other State Universities , have deficit unrestricted net positions of approximately $358.4 million and $448.0 million, respectively. Those deficits are primarily due to long-term obligations, consisting mainly of a compensated absences liability and an accrual of pension and OPEB liabilities. The compensated absences liability will be liquidated on a pay-as-you-go basis. The pension and OPEB liabilities do not require cash flows and have no effect on the ability to provide services.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 177NOTE 18 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS A.

develop the budget for the State of Florida. Each year, the head of each state agency and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for the Judicial Branch submit a final annual legislative budget request to the Governor and Legislature by October 15 as required in Section 216.023(1), F.S. Then, at least 30 days before the scheduled annual legislative session in each year, the Governor, as Chief Budget Officer, submits his recommended budget to each legislator. The Governor also provides estimates of revenues sufficient to fund the recommended appropriations. Revenue estimates for the General Fund and selected trust funds are made by the Revenue Estimating Conference. This group includes members of the Executive and Legislative branches with forecasting experience who develop official information regarding anticipated state and local government revenues as needed for the state budgeting process. Revenue estimates for trust funds not projected by the Revenue Estimating Conference (consisting mainly of special revenue funds) are provided by state agencies. These estimates may be revised during the course of the Legislature's consideration and adoption of a final budget. These estimates, together with known available cash balances, are further considered by the Governor and the Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court during the preparation of annual release (spending) plans. Further adjustments to the original budget's trust fund revenue estimates may be made to conform agency revenue estimates to actual and projected revenue streams. The Governor's recommended budget is considered and amended by the Legislature and a final appropriations bill is then approved by the Legislature (subject to the line-item veto power of the Governor and override authority of the Legislature); this bill then becomes the General Appropriations Act. The Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, under certain conditions and subject to the review and objection procedures set forth in Section 216.177, F.S., establish appropriations and corresponding releases for amounts not appropriated by the Legislature to agencies and the Judicial Branch, respectively. This includes appropriations for non-operating disbursements, such as the purchase of investments and the transfer of money between state funds. If circumstances warrant, the head of a department or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may transfer appropriations (other than fixed capital outlay appropriations) but only to the extent of 5 percent of the original appropriation or $250,000, whichever is greater, or within certain programs and between identical funding sources and specific appropriation categories. Transfers of general revenue appropriations in excess of 5 percent or $250,000, whichever is greater, or for fixed capital outlay, or for transfers of general revenue appropriations not allowed within the departments' program flexibility may be approved by the Legislative Budget Commission. The Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may approve changes of expenditure authority within any trust fund for agencies and the Judicial Branch, respectively, if the changes are less than $1 million. The Legislative Budget Commission may approve trust fund changes in excess of $1 million. At the end of the fiscal year, any balance of an operating appropriation which has not been disbursed but is expended (recorded as a payable) or contracted to be expended (recorded as a reserve for encumbrances in governmental fund types), may be carried forward into the next fiscal year. If these appropriations, however, have not been disbursed by September 30 they will revert pursuant to Section 216.301(1), F.S. The Chief Financial Officer approves disbursements in accordance with legislative authorizations. The budget is controlled at the account code level, which is defined as an appropriation category (e.g., salaries and benefits), and funded within a budget entity. The Governor and the Chief Financial Officer are responsible for detecting conditions which could lead to a deficit in any agency's funds and reporting that fact to the Legislative Budget Commission and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Constitution of the State, Article VII, Section 1(d), states, \"Provision shall be made by law for raising sufficient revenue to defray the expenses of the state for each fiscal period.\"2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 186Budgetary Basis of Accounting The budgetary basis of accounting required by state law differs materially from the basis used to report revenues and expenditures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Appropriations are made from funds that are prescribed by law. These legal basis fund types (known as state funds) are the General Revenue Fund, numerous trust funds, and the Budget Stabilization Fund. Certain moneys maintained outside of the State Treasury, known as local funds, are available to agencies for their operations. Because the funds are located in banks outside of the State Treasury, budgetary authority and the disbursement of these funds are not controlled by the Chief Financial Officer. For example, the State Board of Administration operates from such funds. The state presents budgetary comparison schedules for the General Fund and major special revenue funds as part of the other required supplementary information. In addition, budgetary comparison schedules for non-major special revenue funds which have legally adopted annual budgets are presented with other combining and individual fund statements and schedules. Budgetary basis revenues are essentially reported on a cash basis and include amounts classified by GAAP as other financing sources. Budgetary basis expenditures include disbursements, except those for prior year carry/certified forwards, plus current year payables and encumbrances which are carried/certified forward into the next fiscal year. They also include amounts classified by GAAP as other financing uses. State law requires prior year payables and encumbrances not carried/certified forward to be paid from the current year budget. The Lump Sum expenditure category presented in the budgetary comparison schedules is used as a budgetary tool to track moneys appropriated to a particular fund until subsequent allocations are made to other expenditure categories. The presentation of budgetary comparison information for the major governmental fund for transportation excludes the State Transportation Trust Fund within the Department of Transportation because it accounts for projects of a multi-year nature, and comparison of actual annual expenditures to a multi-year appropriated amount is not meaningful. Appropriations are made in total the first year of a project even though they are released and expended over the period of construction for a project. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, State Transportation Trust fund revenues and expenditures totaled $2.61 billion and $7.08 billion, respectively, with $4.49 billion of net other financing sources. Budget to GAAP Reconciliation The budgetary comparison schedules for the General Fund and the major special revenue funds present comparisons of the original budget and final budget with actual revenues and expenditures on a budgetary basis. A budget to GAAP reconciliation is presented following the budgetary comparison schedules because accounting principles for budgetary basis differ significantly from those used to present financial statements in conformity with GAAP.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 187OTHER REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION SCHEDULE OF PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE NET PENSION LIABILITY FLORIDA RETIREMENT SYSTEM LAST 10 FISCAL YEARS* (in thousands) 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Proportion of the net pension liability 17.802202632 % 17.961696240 % 18.150587866 % 17.591496280 %17.733845390% Proportionate share of the net pension liability $ $ 2,319,994 $ 4,583,038 $ 5,203,447 $ 4,621,442 $ 4,791,286 Proportionate share of the net pension liability as percentage of covered payroll 23.93 % 50.53 % 99.72 % 112.59 % 111.48 % Plan fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability 96.09 % 92.00 % 84.88 % 83.89 % 84.26 % Notes to Schedule: Changes in actuarial assumptions: The long-term expected rate of return was decreased from 7.10% to 7.00%. * Fiscal year 2015 was the first year of GASB Statement No. 68 implementation; therefore, information was not available for a full 10- year presentation.

The discount rate changed from 3.58% for the opening balance as of June 30, 2017, to the discount rate of 3.87% as of June 30, 2018. This change resulted in a decrease in total OPEB liability.2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 191OTHER REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION INFORMATION ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS REPORTED USING THE MODIFIED APPROACH Pursuant to GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements - and Management' s Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local Governments, the state has adopted an alternative process to record depreciation expense on selected infrastructure assets. Under this alternative method, referred to as the modified approach, the state expenses certain maintenance and preservation costs and does not report depreciation expense. Assets accounted for under the modified approach include approximately 12,115 centerline miles of roads and 7,060 bridges that the state is responsible for maintaining. In order to utilize the modified approach, the state is required to: Maintain an asset management system that includes an up-to-date inventory of eligible infrastructure assets. Perform condition assessments of eligible assets and summarize the results using a measurement scale. Estimate each year the annual amount to maintain and preserve the assets at the condition level established and disclosed by the state. Document that the assets are being preserved approximately at, or above, the established condition level. Condition and Maintenance Programs Resurfacing Program: Road pavements require periodic resurfacing. The frequency of resurfacing depends on the volume of traffic, type of traffic, pavement material variability, and weather conditions. Resurfacing preserves the structural integrity of highway pavements and includes pavement resurfacing, pavement rehabilitation, and minor reconstruction. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) conducts an annual Pavement Condition Survey. Pavements are rated on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 being the best) in each of three criteria: ride smoothness, pavement cracking, and wheel path rutting. Ride smoothness is what the motorist experiences. It directly affects motor vehicle operation costs. Pavement cracking refers to the structural deterioration of the pavement, which leads to loss of smoothness and deterioration of the road base by water seepage if not corrected. Wheel path rutting refers to depressions in pavement caused by heavy use. Ride smoothness and wheel path rutting are measured mechanically using lasers. Pavement cracking is determined through visual observation by experienced survey crews. The condition rating scales were set by a statewide committee of pavement engineers, so that a pavement segment receiving a rating of six or less in any of the three rating criteria is designated a deficient pavement segment. In low-speed areas, the ride rating must drop to five or less before a pavement segment is considered deficient due to ride. The FDOT standard is to ensure that 80% of the pavement on the State Highway System remains non-deficient. Bridge Repair/Replacement Program: The FDOT Bridge Repair Program places primary emphasis on periodic maintenance and specified rehabilitation work activities on State Highway System bridge structures. The FDOT Bridge Replacement Program's primary focus is on the replacement of structurally deficient or weight restricted bridges on the State Highway System. In addition, the Bridge Replacement Program addresses bridges that require structural repair but which are more cost effective to replace. The FDOT conducts bridge condition surveys using the National Bridge Inspection Standards to determine condition ratings. Each bridge is inspected at least once every two years. During the inspection process, the major components such as deck, superstructure, and substructure are assigned a condition rating. The condition rating ranges from 0 to 9. By FDOT policy, a rating of 8 to 9 is excellent. A rating of 6 to 7 is good. A rating of 5 indicates fair condition. A rating of 4 or less identifies bridges in poor condition requiring major repairs or replacement per FDOT policy. A rating of 2 indicates a critical bridge condition, and a rating of 1 indicates imminent bridge failure and is used for a bridge that is closed, but with corrective action may be put back into light service. A rating of 0 indicates that the bridge is out of service and beyond corrective action. Per FDOT policy, bridges rated fair or poor do not meet performance standards. The FDOT standard is to ensure that 90% of all department maintained bridges do not need major repairs or replacement. Routine Maintenance Program: The FDOT is responsible for managing and performing routine maintenance on the State Highway System to help preserve the condition of the system. Routine maintenance includes many activities, such as repairing2019 STATE OF FLORIDA CAFR 192highways, keeping up roadsides, responding to emergencies, maintaining signs, striping roadways, and keeping storm drains clear and structurally sound. The quality and effectiveness of the routine maintenance program is monitored by periodic surveys, using the Maintenance Rating Program (MRP), which results in an annual assessment. The MRP has been used since 1985 to evaluate routine maintenance of the transportation system in five broad categories or elements. The five rating elements are roadway, roadside, vegetation/aesthetics, traffic services, and drainage. The MRP provides a maintenance rating of 0 to 100 for each category and overall. The FDOT standard is to achieve and maintain an overall maintenance rating of 80.

As of June 30, 2019, the total outstanding balance of tax-supported debt was approximately $16,958,800,000. (2) The state debt fiscal responsibility policy, Section 215.98, Florida Statutes, establishes the ratio of tax-supported debt service to tax-supported revenues as the benchmark debt ratio for purposes of setting the state's legal debt margin. Under the present policy, if the ratio exceeds 6%, additional tax-supported debt may be authorized only if the legislature determines the additional debt is in the best interest of the state. If the ratio exceeds 7%, additional tax-supported debt may be authorized only if the legislature determines it is necessary to address a critical state emergency. The 6% ratio has been used to determine the debt limit in this schedule. (3) In Fiscal Years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax-supported debt service exceeded 7% of tax-supported revenues.

Our report is included in the Florida Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, issued by the Chief Financial Officer. SUMMARY OF REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We noted and consider the following matter involving internal control over financial reporting and its operation to be a significant deficiency: The Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS), Statewide Financial Reporting Section (SFRS), recorded incorrect amounts for debt related to capital assets to Net Position - Net investments in capital assets (Net investments in capital assets). (Finding No. 2019-001) We noted the following additional matters that we reported to management but do not consider to be significant deficiencies: The FDFS incorrectly recognized tobacco settlement amounts owed to the State as revenues prior to the amounts becoming available. Additionally, the FDFS did not record net receivables and unavailable revenue for all tobacco settlement amounts. (Finding No. AM 2019-01) The Florida Department of Transportation overstated disposition gain (loss) and Capital contributions amounts. (Finding No. AM 2019-02) The Florida Department of Health did not properly account for all construction work in progress and recorded incorrect amounts for construction work in progress to Capital assets, net and Human services, expenses for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years. (Finding No. AM 2019-03) SUMMARY OF REPORT ON FEDERAL AWARDS State agencies, universities, and colleges adminis tered approximately 565 Federal awards programs and program clusters during the 2018-19 fiscal year. Expenditures for the 23 major programs totaled $25.6 billion, or approximately 69 percent of the total expenditures of $36.9 billion, as reported on the supplementary Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. Compliance requirements for Federal awards programs are established in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB ) Compliance Supplement . Types of compliance requirements include: Activities Allowed or Unallowed; Allowable Costs/Cost Principles; Cash Management; Eligibility; Equipment and Real Property Management; Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking; Period of Performance; Procurement and Suspension and Debarment; Program Income; Reporting; Subrecipient Monitoring; and Special Tests and Provisions. Report No. 2020-170 Page ii March 2020 Compliance The State of Florida complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements applicable to each of its major Federal awards programs, except as described in the following instances: The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) did not always obtain and maintain documentation to support costs charged to the 2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program (WHIP). Additionally, the FDEM did not evaluate subrecipient risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward or develop appropriate subrecipient monitoring plans based on an assessed risk of noncompliance and did not verify that all applicable subrecipients of the Disaster Grants program were audited. These instances of noncompliance resulted in opinion qualifications. (Finding No. 2019-002 - WHIP, and Finding Nos. 2019-040 and 2019-041 - Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters)) The Florida Department of Military Affairs (FDMA) could not demonstrate that, prior to entering into covered transactions, the FDMA determined that the contractors were not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded by the Federal Government. Additionally, the FDMA did not include in applicable contractual agreements a clause requiring the contractor to comply with Federal guidance on suspension and debarment. These instances of noncompliance resulted in an opinion qualification. (Finding No. 2019-004 - National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance Projects) For the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program, we are unable to express, and do not express, an opinion on the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's (FDEO's) compliance with the Reporting compliance requirement because the FDEO did not submit the required Federal Financial Reports to the Employment and Training Administration. (Finding No. 2019-014 - Unemployment Insurance) For the UI program, we are unable to express, and do not express an opinion on the Florida Department of Revenue's (FDOR's) compliance with the Special Tests and Provisions - Match with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 940 Federal Unemployment Tax Act Tax Form compliance requirement because the FDOR could not provide a copy of the certification files provided to the IRS evidencing the match of employer tax payment s with credits claimed for the payments on the employer's Form 940 or Schedule H. (Finding No. 2019-016 - Unemployment Insurance) The Florida Department of Children and Families did not always timely review and process Income Eligibility and Verification System data exchange responses, which resulted in an opinion qualification. (Finding No. 2019-030 - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities records did not always evidence that continued stay reviews were completed for beneficiaries of Intermediate Care Facility Services for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities in accordance with the time frame specified by Federal regulations, resulting in an opinion qualification. (Finding No. 2019-035 - Medicaid Cluster) The results of our audit also disclosed other instances of noncompliance pertaining to programs administered by various State agencies and a college, as described in the SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS . Some of the instances of noncompliance resulted in questioned costs subject to disallowance by the grantor agency. Internal Control Over Compliance We noted numerous matters at various State agencies and one college involving internal control over compliance and its operation that we consider to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Material weaknesses and significant deficiencies are described in the SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page iii QUESTIONED COSTS and pertained to several compliance requirements. The instances described in the previous paragraphs on compliance for the WHIP (Finding No. 2019-002), National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance Projects (Finding No. 2019-004), Unemployment Insurance (Finding Nos. 2019-014 and 2019-016), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (Finding No. 019-030), Medicaid Cluster (Finding No. 2019-035), and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) (Finding Nos. 2019-040 and 2019-041), are deficiencies in internal control over compliance considered to be material weaknesses. SUMMARY OF REPORT ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS The State's SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS (SEFA) is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the State's basic financial statements. The State's SEFA does not include Federal awards expenditures for the State's blended component units; CareerSource Florida, Inc. and the Florida Commission on Community Service; discretely presented component uni ts of the State's universities and colleges; or discretely presented component units other than the Stat e's universities and colleges. In our opinion, the SEFA is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. AUDIT SCOPE As a condition of receiving Federal funds, the OMB requires, as described in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), an audit of the State's financial statements and major Federal awards programs. Pursuant to Section 11.45, Florida Statutes, we conducted an audit of the basic financial statements of the State of Florida as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We also subjected supplementary information contained in the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and the State's SEFA to auditing procedures applied in our audit of the basic financial statements. Additionally, we audited the State's compliance with governing requirements for the Federal awards programs and program clusters that we identifi ed as major programs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We also performed procedures to assess the reasonableness of the SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS prepared by the State of Florida. AUDIT OBJECTIVES The objectives of our audit were to: Express opinions concerning whether the State's basic financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Express an opinion concerning whether the State's SEFA was presented fairly, in all material respects, in relation to the State's basic financial statements as a whole. Obtain an understanding of the internal control over financial reporting and the internal control over compliance for each major Federal awards program or program cluster, assess the control risk, and perform tests of controls, unless the controls were deemed to be ineffective. Report No. 2020-170 Page iv March 2020 Express opinions concerning whether the State complied, in all material respects, with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect applicable to each of the major Federal awards programs and program clusters. Determine whether management had taken appropriate actions to correct deficiencies noted in our previous audit reports. Assess the reasonableness of the Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings prepared by the State. AUDIT METHODOLOGY We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, applicable standards contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the Uniform Guidance. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 1 Phone: (850) 412-2722 Fax: (850) 488-6975 Sherrill F. Norman, CPA Auditor General AUDITOR GENERAL STATE OF FLORIDA Claude Denson Pepper Building, Suite G74 111 West Madison Street Tallahassee, Florida 32399-1450 The President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Auditing Committee INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United St ates, the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the State of Florida, as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the State of Florida's basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated February 21, 2020. Our report includes a reference to other auditors who audited the financial statements of the Prepaid College Program Fund, Florida Turnpike System, Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, College Savings Plan and the trust fund maintained by the State Board of Administration to account for the investments of the Public Employee Optional Retire ment Program, assets and investment income of the Florida Retirement System Defined Benefit Pension Plan, Florida Housing Finance Corporation, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, component units related to the State's universities and colleges, and certain other funds and entities as described in our report on the State of Florida's financial statements. This report does not inc lude the results of the other auditors' testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and other matters that are reported on separately by those auditors. Internal Control over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statement s, we considered the State's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control. Report No. 2020-170 Page 2 March 2020 A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the State's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. We did identify a certain deficiency in internal control, described in Finding No. 2019-001 in the Financial Statements Findings section of the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS , that we consider to be a significant deficiency. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the State's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, administrative rules, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Additional Matters We noted three additional matters that we reported to management as Finding Nos. AM 2019-01, AM 2019-02, and AM 2019-03 in the ADDITIONAL MATTERS section as listed in the table of contents. Management Responses to Findings Management's response to the significant deficienc y identified in our audit is described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Financial Statements Finding No. 2019-001. Management responses to the additional matters identified in our audit are included in the ADDITIONAL MATTERS section as listed in the table of contents. The responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them. Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the result of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 3 Government Auditing Standards in considering the State's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. Respectfully submitted, Sherrill F. Norman, CPA Tallahassee, Florida February 21, 2020 Report No. 2020-170 Page 4 March 2020 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 5 AUDITOR GENERAL STATE OF FLORIDA Claude Denson Pepper Building, Suite G74 111 West Madison Street Tallahassee, Florida 32399-1450 The President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Auditing Committee INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited the State of Florida's compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the State of Florida's major Federal programs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The State of Florida's major Federal programs are identified in the Summary of Auditor's Results section of the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS . The State of Florida's basic financial statements include the operations of component units which received Federal awards during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, that are not included in the State's SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS . Our audit of the State of Florida's major Federal programs did not include the operations of the blended component units, CareerSource Florida, Inc. and the Florida Commission on Community Service; discretely presented component units of the State of Florida's universities and colleges; or discretely presented component units other than the State of Florida's universities and colleges. As applicable, Federal awards administered by these component units are the subjects of audits completed by other auditors. Our audit also did not include the operations of the Legislature. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its Federal awards applicable to its Federal programs. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the State of Florida's major Federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , Phone: (850) 412-2722 Fax: (850) 488-6975 Sherrill F. Norman, CPA Auditor General Report No. 2020-170 Page 6 March 2020 issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major Federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the State of Florida's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our qualified and unmodified opinions on compliance for major Federal programs. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the State of Florida's compliance. Basis for Qualified Opinion on the 2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program, National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects, Unemployment Insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid Cluster, and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) As described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS , the State of Florida did not comply with requirements regarding the following: Finding No. 2019 CFDA No. Major Program (or Cluster) Name Compliance Requirement 002 10.120 2017 Wildfires and Hurricane Indemnity Program Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles 004 12.401 National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects Procurement and Suspension and Debarment 030 93.558 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Special Tests and Provisions - Income Eligibility and Verification System 035 93.775, 93.777, 93.778 Medicaid Cluster Special Tests and Provisions - Utilization Control and Program Integrity 040 97.036 Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disas ters) Subrecipient Monitoring 041 97.036 Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) Subrecipient Monitoring Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the State of Florida to comply with the requirements applicable to the respective programs. As described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS , we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence supporting that the State of Florida complied with requirements regarding the following: Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 7 Finding No. 2019 CFDA Nos. Major Program (or Cluster) Name Compliance Requirements 014 17.225 Unemployment Insurance Reporting 016 17.225 Unemployment Insurance Special Tests and Provisions - Match with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 940 Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) Tax Form Consequently, we were unable to determine whether the State of Florida complied with those requirements applicable to the programs. Qualified Opinion on the 2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program, National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Pr ojects, Unemployment Insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid Cluster, and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) In our opinion, except for the noncompliance and possible effects of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraphs, the State of Florida complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on the 2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program, National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects, Unemployment Insu rance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid Cluster, and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Unmodified Opinion on Each of the Other Major Federal Programs In our opinion, the State of Florida complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its other major Federal programs identified in the Summary of Auditor's Results section of the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Other Matters The results of our auditing procedures disclosed other instances of noncompliance which are required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS as: Finding Nos. 2019: 003 013 018019 025026 028029 033 036039 042 Our opinion on each major Federal program is not modified with respect to these matters. The State of Florida's responses to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS. The State of Florida's responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses. Report No. 2020-170 Page 8 March 2020 Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Management of the State of Florida is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the State of Florida's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major Federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major Federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of Florida's internal control over compliance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. However, as discussed below, we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the following findings and included in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS to be material weaknesses: Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 9 Finding No. 2019 CFDA Nos. Major Program (or Cluster) Name Compliance Requirements 002 10.120 2017 Wildfires and Hurricane Indemnity Program Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles 004 12.401 National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects Procurement and Suspension and Debarment 014 17.225 Unemployment Insurance Reporting 016 17.225 Unemployment Insurance Special Tests and Provisions - Match with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 940 Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) Tax Form 030 93.558 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Special Tests an d Provisions - Income Eligibility and Verification System 035 93.775, 93.777, 93.778 Medicaid Cluster Special Tests and Provisions - Utilization Control and Program Integrity 040 97.036 Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) Subrecipient Monitoring 041 97.036 Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) Subrecipient Monitorin g A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the following findings and included in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS to be significant deficiencies: Finding Nos. 2019: 003 005013 015 018 020024 032034 036 039 042 The State of Florida's responses to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS . The State of Florida's responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses. Report No. 2020-170 Page 10 March 2020 The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. Respectfully submitted, Sherrill F.

We issued our Independent Auditor's Report thereon dated February 21, 2020, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the State of Florida's basic financial statements. The accompanying SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles , and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with audit ing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 15 SECTION II - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINDINGS Our audit of the State of Florida's basic financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, disclosed a certain matter that we communicated in the INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS . The finding is categorized in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that findings be categorized in a manner that discloses their significance. The categorizations established and defined by the standards are as follows: A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Report No. 2020-170 Page 16 March 2020 SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY NET INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL ASSETS Finding Number 2019-001 Opinion Unit Governmental Activities Financial Statements Account Titles Net Position - Net investments in capital assets; Net Position - Unrestricted SW Fund Number N/A State Agency Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS) OLO-GF-SF-FID N/A Financial Statement Line Codes 5310 and 5910 Adjustment Amount $14,503,526,000 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding The FDFS, Statewide Financial Reporti ng Section (SFRS), recorded incorrect amounts for debt related to capital assets to Net Position - Net investments in capital assets (Net investments in capital assets). Criteria Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification Section 1800.156 specifies that the net investment in capital assets component of net position is to consist of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of debt inst ruments that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Significant unspent related debt proceeds or deferred inflows of resources should not be included in the calculation of Net investments in capital assets. Chief Financial Officer Procedures for Government-Wide Financial Statements provide a list of the documents and calculations needed to complete the government-wide statements, including t he calculation of Net investments in capital assets. Condition The SFRS established financial statement forms for State agencies to assist the SFRS in the compilation of the State' s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, including the determination of total outstanding bonds payable and the Amount deferred on refunding of debt. Additiona lly, the SFRS receives documentation from State agencies indicating which outstanding bonds were related to Governmental Activities capital assets. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the Governmental Activities, Capital assets, net totaled $78.54 billion and outstanding bonds related to capital assets totaled $2.3 billion. Our review of the SFRS ca lculation for Net investments in capital assets disclosed instances in which incorrect amounts were recorded. Specifically, we noted that the SFRS: Converted the amounts provided by State agencies in the Net investments in capital assets calculation to thousands, except for the Deferred inflow and Deferred outflow amounts for the Amount deferred on refunding of debt, resulting in deferred for refunding amounts totaling $16.4 million being recorded as $16.4 billion. Used unamortized premiums totaling $2.1 billion to calculate the net of related debt portion of Net investments in c apital assets instead of the actual unamortized premiums of $155.9 million. Cause According to SFRS management, while established procedures provided steps and calculations needed to determine Net investments in capital assets, such procedures did not provide for and SFRS staff did not evaluate the amounts used in the calculation for consistenc y and reasonableness. Additionall y, SFRS Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 17 management did not review the appropriateness of the Net investments in capital assets calculation to ensure that errors, if any, were timely detected and corrected. Effect Prior to audit adjustment, the Governmental Activities, Net investments in capital assets account was overstated by $ 14,503,526,000 and the Net Position - Unrestricted account was understated by $14,503,526,000. Recommendation We recommend that SFRS management enhanc e controls to ensure that SFRS staff evaluate all governmental activities amounts provided by State agencies for consistency and reasonableness prior to completion of the government-wide financial statements. Additionally, we recommend that SFRS management enhance controls to ensure that supervisory review of government-wide net position calculations is conducted to promote the timely detection and correction of errors. State Agency Response We concur. The SFRS will enhance its review process through the creation and implementation of a financial statement reconcilation tool which will assist management in the review, identification, and correction of presentation errors noted between the respective financial stat ement line items. Additionally, updates to SFRS procedures will be made to include the use of the tool during review and include a comprehensive list of validation criteria that will be used by management to ensure the consistency and reasonablene ss of the amounts presented in the financial statements of the State of Florida. Report No. 2020-170 Page 18 March 2020 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 19 Section III - Federal Awards Findings and Questioned Costs Our audit findings with regard to compliance and internal controls over compliance with the requirements of major Federal awards programs are disclosed on the following pages. Where applicable and determinable, we have disclosed actual questioned costs where known or likely questioned costs exceeded $25,000. To identify the nature and significance of each finding, we have identified each finding with one or more of the following designations: Disclaimer of Opinion. A finding that presents conditions where the auditor is unable to express an opinion on a compliance requirement for a major Federal program. A disclaimer would be appropriate when the auditor is not able to perform procedures sufficient to enable the auditor to form an opinion on compliance. This would include findings of inadequate records that resulted in restrictions being placed on the scope of the audit. Opinion Qualification . A finding presenting a condition that affects the auditor's ability to give an unqualified opinion on compliance. This would include findings of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major Federal program, the effects of which are material to the major Federal program as a whole. Noncompliance. A finding presenting noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major Federal program caused by error or fraud, the effects of which are material in relation to a type of compliance requirement identified in the OMB Compliance Supplement . Material Weakness . A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A material weakness is considered in relation to a type of compliance requirement identified in the OMB Compliance Supplement. Significant Deficiency. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a Federal program on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is considered in relation to a type of compliance requirement identified in the OMB Compliance Supplement. Questioned Costs. Costs that are questioned by the auditor because of an audit finding that reported: (a) a violation or possible violation of a statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of a Federal award, including funds used to match Federal funds; (b) costs, at the time of the audit, which were not supported by adequate documentation; or, (c) costs incurred that appeared unreasonable and did not reflect the actions a prudent person would take in the circumstances. As part of the audit process, our findings were provided to the applicable entities for management's response. The responses were prepared by entity management and are included within the audit findings as well as Management's Corrective Action Plan. Report No. 2020-170 Page 20 March 2020 We have presented our findings, generally, by Federal grantor agency and in the order of the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number (CFDA No.) assigned to each applicable Federal award program. Findings that pertain to multiple programs are generally presented as the first findings within the Federal grantor agency section. In some instances, a finding may pertain to programs provided by more than one Federal grantor agency. In such instances, the finding is presented within the section for the Federal grantor agency that provided the most funding for the applicable agency. An Index of Federal Findings by Federal Agency and Compliance Requirement is included to assist Federal grantor agencies in identifying applicable findings. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 21 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Finding Number 2019-002 CFDA Number 10.120 Program Title 2017 Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program (WHIP) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles State Entity Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year USDA-FSA-2018-001 2018 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Opinion Qualification and Material Weakness Questioned Costs - $917,256.70 Finding The FDEM did not always obtain and maintain documentation to support costs charged to the WHIP. Criteria 2 CFR 200.403(g) - Factors affecting a llowability of costs - Except where otherwise authorized by st atute, costs must be ade quately documented to be allowable under Federal awards. 2 CFR 200.404 - Reasonable costs - A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that whic h would be incurred by a prudent person under the circumstances preva iling at the time the decision was made to incur the cost. Consideration must be given to market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic area. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FD EM provided $81,154,535 in WHIP funds to 451 subrecipients (citrus producers). To receive reimbursement for WHIP project expenditures, the FDEM required ci trus producers to submit an application and provide supporting documentation for each expense item for which reimbursement was requested. Our examination of FDEM records for 25 expenditure transactions, totaling $19,496,193.19, disclosed that, for 10 transactions totaling $4,533,340.85, FDEM records did not support that the transactions were allowable or reasonabl e. Subsequent to audit inquiry, the FDEM obtained supporting documentation from the citrus producers for some expenditures. However, for 6 unsupported expenditure transactions, questioned costs totaled $917,256.70. Cause According to FDEM management, the expenditures were not supported due to staff oversight during the payment review process. Additionally, the FDEM did not require staff to review certain types of expenditure documentation for reasonableness prior to payment. Effect Absent appropriate documentation, the FDEM cannot demonstrate the allowability or reasonableness of WHIP expenditures and such amounts could be subject to disallowance by the Federal grantor agency. Recommendation We recommend that FDEM management strengthen reimbursement processing controls to ensure that FDEM records evidence that all costs charged to the WHIP are allowable and reasonable. State Entity Response Subsequent to audit inquiry, FDEM has substantiated $326,624.85 of the questioned costs and is in the process of obtaining additional documentation to support $46,700.00 to comply with 2 CFR 200.403(g). FDEM does not expect recoupment will be necessary. The re maining $543,931.85 in questioned costs are related to arm's length transactions. The transactions described regularly occur as an industry standard. Many Citrus Recovery Block Grant (CRBG) applicants own groves and the caretaking companies that service and manage them. While the companies have the same owner, each company is operating as a separate legal entity. FDEM compar ed claimed costs to prices from other unaffiliated producer records as well as other market data sources area in Report No. 2020-170 Page 22 March 2020 accordance with 2 CFR 200.404. A ll costs are evaluated and must be deemed eligible, reasonable and appropriate prior to payment. Subsequent to audit inquiry and prior to the audit report, the analyses found all claimed costs to be eligible and reasonable. FDEM concurs with the auditor' s recommendation and will strengthen reimbursement controls to ensure all costs are validated and determined reasonable prior to payment. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 23 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Finding Number 2019-003 CFDA Number 10.558 Program Title Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Compliance Requirement Subrecipient Monitoring State Entity Florida Department of Health (FDOH) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 5FL300350 2019 and 5FL300340 2019 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency Finding The FDOH did not include the correct citations to Federal regulations in subaward agreements. Criteria 2 CFR Part 200.331 - Requirements for pass-through entities - All pass-through entities must ensure that ever y subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and include certain informat ion at the time of the subaward (e.g., applicable Federal regulations) and, if an y of those data elements change, include the changes in subsequent subaward modifications. Condition Pursuant to Federal regulations, the FDOH used a Permanent Contract to document the FDOH's notification to subrecipients of applicable Federal regulations. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOH disbursed CACFP funds totaling approximately $291 million to 2,204 subrecipients. Our review of the Permanent Contract disclosed that the Contract did not include the correct citations to applicable Federal regulations. According to the CACFP grant award, effective December 2014 CACFP funds were subject to the requirements included in 2 CFR 200 (Uniform Guidan ce); however, the Pe rmanent Contract directed subrecipients to comply with regulations that predated the Uniform Guidance. Cause According to FDOH management, the FDOH did not notify subrecipients of the changes in applicable Federal regulations through the subaward because the FDOH is still in the process of revising the Permanent Contract to ensure compliance with Federal and State contract requirements. Effect The failure to notify subrecipients of the correct Federal regulations through the subaward may result in subrecipient noncompliance with Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that FDOH management revise the Permanent Contract to ensure that subrecipients are appropriately notified of the correct Federal regulations. State Entity Response The Bureau of Child Care Food Programs (CCFP) is working with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) on an amendment to the Permanent Contract for CCFP contractors that executed agreem ents from July 1, 2019 through January 31, 2020. The existing Permanent Contract has been updated with the correct citations from 2 CFR 200, and will be used for any new contractors that come on the program starting February 1, 2020. CCFP is also working with OGC on comprehensive revisions to the Permanent Contract and Attachments which will be given to all 2,200+ subrecipients for execution on or before June 30, 2020. As part of the annual renewal process, all subrecipients are notified of the applicable 2 CFR Part 200 requirements through a question on the renewal application, through financial management training, and through an Audit Report Certification Form sent to all CCFP contractors from the FDOH Federal Compliance and Audit Management section. Report No. 2020-170 Page 24 March 2020 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 25 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Finding Number 2019-004 CFDA Number 12.401 Program Title National Guard Milit ary Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects Compliance Requirement Procurement and Suspension and Debarment State Entity Florida Department of Military Affairs (FDMA) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year W911YN-19-2-1000 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Opinion Qualification and Material Weakness Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-005 Finding The FDMA could not demonstrate that, prior to entering into covered transactions, the FDMA determined that the contract ors were not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded by the Federal Government. Additionally, the FDMA did not include in applicable contractual agreements a clause requiring the contractor to comply with Federal guidance on suspension and debarment. Criteria 2 CFR 180.300 - What must I do before I enter in to a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier? - When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by: (a) Checking System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions, (b) Collecting a certif ication from that person, or (c ) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person. United States Department of De fense, National Guard Bureau - Master Cooperative Agreement - The grantee agrees to check SAM to verify contractor eligibility to receive contracts. The verification shall be documented in the contract files. Also, for each contra ct for an amount equal to or greater than $25,000, the grantee must include a claus e requiring the contractor to comply with the guidance on suspension and debarment included in 2 CFR 180. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDMA entered into 55 contractual agreements with 35 contractors utilizing O&M Projec ts funds totaling $24,290,219. We examined FDMA records for 3 contract ual agreements, totaling $535,630, entered into with 3 contractors during t he 2018-19 fiscal year. Our examination disclosed that FDMA records did not evidence that, prior to entering into the contractual agreements, the FDMA veri fied through SAM that the contractors were not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded. In addition, our examination disclosed that, although each contract exceeded $2 5,000, the FDMA did not include in the 3 contractual agre ements a clause requiring the contractor to comply with guidance on suspension and debarment. Our review of the FDMA Construction Facility Management Office Contract Management Branch Standard Operating Procedures disclosed that the Procedures did not require FDMA staff to verify that a contractor was not su spended, debarred, or otherwise excluded prior to entering into a contractual agreem ent or require that applicable contracts include a clause related to suspension and debarment compliance. Cause FDMA policies and procedures did not require staff to verify through SAM that a contractor was not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded prior to entering into a contract, nor require that a clause related to suspension and debarment compliance be included in applicable contractual agreements. Effect Absent adequate controls, the risk is increased that the FDMA could unknowingly enter into covered transactions with contractors who have been suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded b y the Federal Government. In addition, Report No. 2020-170 Page 26 March 2020 O&M Projects funds provided to contractors could be subject to disallowance by the United States Depa rtment of Defense. Recommendation We again recommend that FDMA management enhance policies and procedures to ensure that FDMA records evidence that, prior to entering into covered transactions, the FDMA verified th rough SAM that contractors were not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded by the Federal Government. We also continue to recommend that FDMA management enhance policies and procedures to require that all contract s equal to or greater than $25,000 include a clause requiring the contractor to comply with the guidance on suspension and debarment included in 2 CFR 180. State Entity Response We concur with your finding and recommendation. We are still in the process of enhancing our policies to include reviewing SAM for exclusions prior to contracting with a company. Additionally, we are working to require that all new contracts include proper language requiring the contractor to comply with the guidance on suspension and debarment. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 27 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-005 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-013 Finding Internal controls for the Electronic Payment Card (EPC) Processing and Settlement System need improvement Criteria 2 CFR 200.303 - Internal Controls - The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federa l entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition The FDEO contracted with a service organization to provide services that enable UI claimants to receive UI benefits to wh ich they are entitled through an electronic access card (debit card). During the 20 18-19 fiscal year, the FDEO processed UI benefit payments totaling approximate ly $358 million. Benefit payments distributed via debit card totaled approximately $76 million. The service organization obtained an independent service auditor's report for the period July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, in which the service organization's auditors qualified their opinion related to logical access, network security, and computer operations controls. Giv en the significance of the service organization's role in the UI program, internal control weaknesses reported in the service auditor's report could sign ificantly impact the UI program. Cause The service organization had not effectively established certain IT controls, including controls related to logical access, network security, and computer operations. Effect Absent appropriate EPC Processing and Settlement System controls, the FDEO has reduced assurance that UI data is appropriately safeguarded. Recommendation We again recommend that the FDEO ensure that the service organization takes timely and appropriate corrective action to resolve the deficiencies noted in the independent service auditor's report. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. The contracted service organization is implementing process improvements and system enhanc ements to improve internal controls. Report No. 2020-170 Page 28 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-006 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allow able Costs/Cost Principles, Eligibility, Reporting, and Special Tests and Prov isions - UI Benefit Payments and UI Program Integrity - Overpayments State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-012 Finding In our information technology operational audit report No. 2019-183, dated March 2019, we noted in Finding 4 that Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System (RA System ) application edits for postmark and received dates and related date sequencing need improvement. As of June 2019, the FDEO had not correc ted the identified deficiencies. Criteria Effective application controls include edits to reasonably assure that data is valid and recorded in the proper format a nd include, among others, field format controls, required field controls, limit and reasonableness controls, valid combination of related data field values, and master file matching. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. Our information technology operational audit disclosed that the controls over postmark and received dates and related date sequencing in the RA System need improvement. Specifically, the Date Received field erroneously updated automatically to the current date ea ch time the document was assigned, reassigned, or indexed in the RA Syst em. Also, when FDEO and contractor employees made manual entries to the Date Received field to correct the automatic updating or to the Date Received or the Date Postmarked fields in the normal course of work, no system edits existed to ensure that the dates sequenced correctly. For example, the RA System did not prevent the user from entering a date in the Date Received field that was prior to the date in the Date Postmarked field. Also, no edit existed to prevent the user from manually entering a future date in the Date Received field. While the FDEO identified application edits to ensure the accuracy and integrity of dates in the RA System during the scanning and indexing process, as of June 2019, the edits had not been impl emented. Consequently, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause While FDEO management issued a program change request to prevent the RA System from automatically updating the Date Received field to the current date, the program change request had not been prioritized for implementation. FDEO management also indicated that there had been no program changes to the RA System to ensure dates sequenced correctly and that the FDEO would address the date sequencing issues after the program changes for the Date Received fiel d had been implemented. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 29 Effect The lack of appropriate application edits in creases the risk that the accuracy of claims, benefit payments, and employer chargeab ility may be compromised and that benefit payments and employer charges may be based on incorrect information. Recommendation We recommend that FDEO management improve application edits to help ensure the accuracy and integrity of the dates in the RA System. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. Applicati on edits have been identified to improve the accuracy and integrity of the dates in the RA System. Application edits were completed in September 2019. Report No. 2020-170 Page 30 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-007 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allow able Costs/Cost Principles, Eligibility, Reporting, and Special Tests and Prov isions - UI Benefit Payments and UI Program Integrity - Overpayments State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-012 Finding In our information technology operational audit report No. 2019-183, dated March 2019, we noted in Finding 5 Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System (RA System ) control deficiencies causing language translation errors on forms and documents and incorrect error messages. As of June 2019, the FDEO had not corr ected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Effective application input controls during data entry include system-generated error messages that provide timely and useful information and error handling procedures to reasonably ensure that errors and irregularities are timely and accurately detected, reported, and corrected. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. Our information technology operational audit disclosed control deficiencies in the RA System causing language translation errors on forms and documents and incorrect error messages. While FDEO m anagement indicated that they initiated a four-phased project to address the identif ied deficiencies, as of June 2019, the project was not expected to be completed until the end of 2020. Consequently, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause Certain language translation deficiencies previously identified had not been prioritized for implementation and additional language translation deficiencies were subsequently identified as part of our audit report No. 2019-183, but not corrected. For an error message provided in response to a claimant's failure to fully complete the Discharged-Intoxication and Use of Intoxicants During Working Hours questionnaire that had not been corrected, the existing ticket to correct the problem had not been prioritized. We also noted that an incorrect error message that prevented the subm ission of a straight Disaster Unemployment Assistance application was subsequently identified but not corrected. Effect Effective controls related to language translations on forms and documents and appropriate error messages are essential to the timely and accurate detection, reporting, and correction of errors and irregularities and to ensure the completeness, accuracy, and validity of input data. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 31 Recommendation To help ensure the completeness, accuracy, and validity of RA System input data, we recommend that FDEO management continue efforts to implement effective controls related to language translations on forms and documents and enhance the appropriateness of error messages. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO has identified a project-level effort to address language translations on forms and documents as well as appropriateness of error messages. The four-phased project continues to be an on-going priority of FDEO. Report No. 2020-170 Page 32 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-008 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allow able Costs/Cost Principles, Eligibility, Reporting, and Special Tests and Prov isions - UI Benefit Payments and UI Program Integrity - Overpayments State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-012 Finding In our information technology operational audit report No. 2019-183, dated March 2019, we noted in Finding 6 that the procedures for the document intake and indexing processes need improvement to help ensure that all documents received for processing in the Reempl oyment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System (RA System) are ti mely and accurately indexed to the appropriate claimant, claim, and claim iss ue. As of June 2019, the FDEO had not corrected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Effective input controls include procedures to provide reasonable assurance that all inputs into the application have been authorized, accepted for processing, and accounted for and any missing or unaccounted for source documents or input files have been identified and investigated. As part of the claimant application process, claimants, employers, and third parties may be required to submit certain documents and information to t he FDEO or respond to fact-finding documents issued by the FDEO. Response due dates are determined by the RA System or FDEO staff based on the document type. For appropriate processing, documents and information received by the FDEO should be timely linked to the appropriate claimant, claim, and claim issue to avoid unnecessary delays or cause the system to inappropriately process a claim or claim issue without consideration of documentati on received but not yet indexed or processed. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. Our information technology operational audit disclosed that the FDEO lacked procedures to provide reasonable assura nce that all received documents were timely and accurately indexed to the appropriate claimant, claim, and claim issue, including the reconciliation of received documents through the intake mail and fax processes with the documents indexed to the claimant, claim, and claim issue in the RA System. Also, documents receiv ed by the FDEO that did not contain sufficient information to index the document to the appropriate claimant, claim, or claim issue were placed in a folder on a shared drive for further investigation by adjudication staff and subsequent indexing to the appropriate claimant, claim, or claim issue in the RA System. However, if the investigation was unsuccessful after 30 days, adjudication staff purged the document from the shared drive. While the FDEO continues to identify and develop improved procedures for the document intake and indexing process, as of June 2019, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 33 Cause Due to the lack of procedures, the FDEO could not demonstrate that it made good faith efforts to investigate and identify so urce documents received prior to purging them. While FDEO management had submitted program change requests in March 2015 and May 2015 related to accurate indexing and document tracking, efforts to remediate the indexing and document tracking issues had not been implemented. Effect The lack of adequate procedures for the document intake and indexing processes limits FDEO management's assurance that all documents received for processing in the RA System were sufficiently investigated and timely and accurately indexed to the appropriate claimant, claim, and claim issue, thereby increasing the risk of inaccurate claim determinations that ma y result in erroneous benefit payments and employer charges. Recommendation We recommend that FDEO management improve procedures for the document intake and indexing processes to help ensure that all documents received for processing in the RA System are timely and accurately indexed to the appropriate claimant, claim, and claim issue to improve the accuracy of claim determinations, benefit payments, and employer charges. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO continues to identify and develop improved operating procedures for the document intake and indexing processes. Report No. 2020-170 Page 34 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-009 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allow able Costs/Cost Principles, Eligibility, Reporting, and Special Tests and Prov isions - UI Benefit Payments and UI Program Integrity - Overpayments State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-012 Finding In our information technology operational audit report No. 2019-183, dated March 2019, we noted in Finding 7 that c ontrols over the distribution of written claimant and employer claim notices continue to need improvement to help ensure that claim notices are timely distri buted. As of June 2019, the FDEO had not corrected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Effective application processing controls include procedures to identify, analyze, and correct the incomplete execution of transactions, and monitoring procedures to ensure that data is timely and accurately processed. Section 443.151(2)(a), Florida Statutes, Procedure concerning claims - The FDEO must notify claimants and employers regarding monetary and nonmonetary determinations of eligibility. Section 443.151(3)(a), Florida Statutes, Procedure concerning claims - The FDEO shall promptly provide a notice of claim to the claimant's most recent employing unit and all employers whose employment records are liable for benefits under the monetary determination. The employer must respond to the notice of claim within 20 days after the mailing date of the notice, or in lieu of mailing, within 20 days after delivery of the notice. If a contributing employer or its agent fails to timely or adequately respond to the notice of claim or request for information, the employer's account ma y not be relieved of benefit charges. Section 443.151(5), Florida Statutes, Procedure concerning claims - The FDEO shall notify each employer who is liable fo r reimbursements in lieu of contributions for payment of the benefits at the address on file with the FDEO or its tax collection service provider, of the initial determination of the claim and must be given 10 days to respond. A contributing employer who responds within the allotted time limit may not be charg ed for benefits paid under an erroneous determination if the decision is ultimately reversed. 20 CFR 625, Appendix B - Standard for Claim Determinations - Separation Information - The State must include in written notices of determinations furnished to claimants sufficient informat ion to enable them to understand the determinations, the reasons therefor, and their rights to protest, request reconsideration, or appeal. Condition The Reemployment Assistance Clai ms and Benefits Information System (RA System) is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to mana ge UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 35 communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. Our information technology operational audit disclosed that controls related to the distribution of written claimant and employer claim notices needed improvement. Specifically, we noted that: During nightly processing, some claim issues remained in an \"in progress\" status after a determination or redetermination was recorded in the RA System for the claim issue. As a result, some written claimant and employer claim notices were not created and distributed. For claims that were determined to be monetarily eligible, some employer claim notices were not generated. As a result, the claim notices were not distributed on the following business day. Contrary to Federal regulations, writt en claim notices for claimants who were determined ineligible due to a claimant identity issue identified by the Fraud Initiative Rating and Rules Engine (FIR RE) process were not distributed to the claimants and claimants' records were indefinitely locked. As part of our information technology operational audit, we also evaluated RA System FIRRE proces ses to determine whether the FDEO timely distributed written determination letters to claimants when claimants' records were locked due to claimant identity issues being identified by the FIRRE processes. The FDEO's standard for ti mely distribution of the determination letters was within 48 hours of the respon se due date that was stated within the Suspicious Activity Notification Delivery le tter previously sent to the claimant. We evaluated 40 of the 5,086 determination le tters distributed from July 1, 2017, through September 13, 2018, to determine whether the letters were timely distributed to the claimants. Because of the absence of documentation, we were unable to determine whether the letters were timely distributed for 2 of the 40 determination letters evaluated. For 8 of the remaining 38 determination letters evaluated, we concluded that the letters were not timely distributed and ranged from 2 to 376 days late. While the FDEO continues to identify and correct RA System issues preventing the timely distribution of written claimant and employer claim notices, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause FDEO management indicated that certain work-arounds, which included running daily scripts, were created to bypass system defects related to the distribution of claim notices. While the work-arounds forced the RA System to create and distribute certain claimant and employer claim notices, the work-arounds did not correct the original system defect and the failure of the RA System to timely distribute some claimant and empl oyer claim notices persisted. Effect Without appropriate controls over the dist ribution of written claimant and employer claim notices, the risk is increased th at claimants may be denied due process or determination decisions may be made bas ed on incorrect data causing benefit payments and employer charges to be inappropriately processed. Recommendation We recommend that FDEO management continue efforts to identify and correct RA System defects and improve the controls over the distribution of written claimant and employer claim notices to hel p ensure that claim notices are timely distributed. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. System enhancements have been identified to address the first two bullets with an expe cted resolution by the end of 2020. The third bullet was previously resolved with a business process update in September 2019. Report No. 2020-170 Page 36 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-010 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allow able Costs/Cost Principles, Eligibility, Reporting, and Special Tests and Prov isions - UI Benefit Payments and UI Program Integrity - Overpayments State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-012 Finding In our information technology operational audit report No. 2019-183, dated March 2019, we noted in Finding 8 that Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System (RA System) processes related to System-generated claim issues need improvement to help ensure that claims are accurately and timely processed. As of June 2019, the FDEO had not corrected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Data processing controls include procedures to ensure that data is processed completely, accurately, and timely, and retains its validity during processing. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. The RA System is designed to automatically generate issues for a claim based on predefined parameters in the System . FDEO staff are responsible for resolving the claim issues to avoid a delay in eligibility determinations and benefits payments. As part of our info rmation technology operational audit, we reviewed documentation and defect ticket s initiated by the FDEO to correct defects related to the appropriate generation of claim issues in the R A System. Our review disclosed that t he RA System encountered processing defects related to the appropriate generation of claim issues. While the FDEO identified a potential system enhancement to address the appropriate generation of claim issues, due to competing priorities, the enhancement had not been implemented as of June 2019. Consequently, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause FDEO management indicated that, initially, they were unable to reproduce the circumstances of the defect that prevented the generation of claim issues in the RA System and a data fix was performed to correct the claims. Subsequently, in May 2017, FDEO Information Technology staff determined that the defect may be caused by paging back and forth by the claimant; however, FDEO management indicated that, as of February 21, 2019, a solution was still being investigated to remediate the defect. Effect The appropriate generation of claim issues by the RA System would promote data completeness, accuracy, and validity and provide assurance that determination decisions are based on correct data and that claims will be accurately and timely processed. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 37 Recommendation We recommend that FDEO management continue efforts to identify and correct RA System processes related to the appr opriate generation of claim issues to help ensure that claims are accurately and timely processed. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO has identified a proposed plan of action to detect and provide resolution to errors related to the appropriate generation of claim issues.

As of June 2019, the FDEO had not corrected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Automated application controls help ensure consistent treatment of data and that data processing consistently adheres to management's intention and requirements. Information systems process groups of identical transactions similarly; therefore, any inaccuraci es arising from erroneous computer programming or design will occur consistently in similar transactions. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. Our information technology operational audit disclosed that the FDEO experienced deficiencies in the automated c ontrols and processing of data in the RA System causing inaccurate and er roneous claimant benefit payments, claimant overpayment charges, and empl oyer charges in the RA System. While the FDEO identified system enhanc ements to address the issues noted, due to competing priorities and the large- scale efforts identified to resolve the finding, the system enhancements had not been implemented as of June 2019. Consequently, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause FDEO management acknowledged that RA System claim processing deficiencies continued and that such deficiencies re sult in inaccurate claimant benefit payments, claimant overpayment charge s, and excess employer charges. Effect Effective automated controls and controls that promote the consistent and accurate processing of data would prevent inaccurate claimant benefit payments, claimant overpayment charges, and excess em ployer charges that may affect the integrity of RA System data. Recommendation To prevent inaccurate and erroneous claimant benefit payments, claimant overpayment charges, and excess employer charges from being generated by the RA System, we recommend that FD EO management enhance RA System automated controls and improve the processing of data. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 39 State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO has i dentified a large-scale project-level effort enhancement to resolve automated controls and improve the processing of data.

As of June 2019, the FD EO had not corrected the identified deficiencies. Criteria Effective access controls include measures that restrict user access privileges to data and IT resources to only those f unctions that promote an appropriate separation of duties and are necessary for the user's assigned job duties. Agency for State Technology Rule 74-2. 003(1)(d)(3), Florida Administrative Code, specifies that each agency shal l ensure that access permissions and authorizations are managed incorporating the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. Workers shall be granted access to agency IT recourses based on the principles of least privilege and need-to-know determination. Condition The RA System is a Web-based claims management system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO made UI benefit payments totaling approximately $358 million. As part of our IT operational audit, we re viewed the accounts for 50 RA System users assigned one or more of the five roles identified as high-risk by FDEO management to determine the appropriateness of the access privileges assigned. Our review disclosed that users had been assigned three of the five high-risk roles that were not required for the user s' assigned job duties. Based on these role assignments: 33 RA System users could update clai mant contact information including claimant addresses. 3 RA System users c ould update claimant payment information including check and direct deposit information. 43 RA System users could request claimant payments. 3 RA System users could update claima nt authentication information such as social security numbers. 16 RA System users could issue and authorize (release) manual payments. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 41 According to FDEO management, the FDEO has identified a project-level effort to establish procedures to restrict users to only those function s necessary for their assigned job duties; however, the pr ocedures had not been implemented as of June 2019. Consequently, the uncorrected deficiencies remained a significant deficiency for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Cause According to FDEO management, design lim itations in the RA System prevented the users from being restricted to func tions necessary for their assigned job duties. Effect Assigning access privileges to high-risk f unctions within the RA System that are inappropriate or not required for the user's job duties increases the risk of unauthorized modification, loss, or disclosure of claimant data. Recommendation We recommend that FDEO management limit access privileges to the RA System to promote an appropriate separation of duties and to restrict users to only those functions necessary for their assigned job duties. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO has discussed a project-level effort and is working to establish procedures to restri ct users to only those functions necessary for their assigned job duties. Report No. 2020-170 Page 42 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-013 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Period of Performance State Entity Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year UI-29835-17-55-A-12 2017, UI-31287-18-55-A-12 2018, and UI-30211-17-60-A-12 2017 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency Questioned Costs - $23,634.26 to the UI program were not always incurred during the authorized period of performance. Criteria 2 CFR Part 200.309 - Period of Performance - A non-Federal entity may charge to the Federal award only allowable costs incurred during the period of performance. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO expended approximately $449 million in UI program funds, including approximat ely $358 million in benefit payments. Our analysis and examination of records relating to selected expenditures paid by the FDEO during the 2018-19 fiscal year disclosed five expenditures, totaling $23,634.26, that were not incurred during the authorized period of performance. Cause FDEO management indicated that FDEO review procedures did not include a comparison of expenditures to a grant's authorized period of performance. As a result, expenditures were inadvertently charged to the wrong grant number. Effect Expenditures charged to a Federal award that are not incurred during the authorized period of performance could be subject to disallowance by the Federal grantor agency. Recommendation We recommend that the FDEO enhance review procedures to ensure that expenditures are incurred during the authorized period of performance and charged to the appropriate grant. State Entity Response FDEO will move the referenced expenditures to an allowable grant with a period of performance consistent with their dates of service. FDEO's processes have also been updated to review transactions for period of performance during the life of the grant as well as the closeout period.

Criteria UI Report Handbook No. 401, ETA 227 - Overpayment Detection and Recovery Activities - The ETA 227 report is due to t he U.S. Department of Labor, ETA, quarterly on the first day of the second mont h after the quarter of reference. Condition The FDEO processes all UI claims payment transactions through the Reemployment Assistance Claims and Benefits Information System (RA System), a Web-based claims managem ent system that allows UI claimants to apply for weekly UI benefits, monitor their accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System also allows employers and third parties to manage UI claims and appeals, update and monitor UI accounts, and communicate with FDEO staff. The RA System is designed to be used by FDEO staff to evaluate claims information, authorize and proc ess payments, adjudicate issues, and maintain claimant and employer data. The ETA 227 report provides information on overpayments of intrastate and interstate claims under the regular State UI program and under Federal UI programs, including the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees, Unemployment Compensat ion for Ex-Service members, and Extended Benefits programs. FDEO accomp lishments related to benefit payment controls are shown in the ETA 227 report and the ETA and the FDEO need such information to monitor the integrity of the benefit payment processes in the RA System. However, our inquiries of FDEO management disclosed that, during the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEO did no t submit the required quarterly ETA 227 reports to the ETA. Cause FDEO management indicated that the ET A 227 reports were not submitted due to a line by line review of the ETA 227 report initiated by the FDEO in May 2018 to address known data errors in the RA System. According to FDEO management, as of October 2019, the validation of the ETA 227 report was completed. Effect Absent the ETA 227 report information, the ETA and FDEO are unable to effectively monitor the integrity of the UI benefit payment processes. In addition, the FDEO is not in compliance with Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that FDEO take appropriate steps to ensure that ETA 227 reports are submitted in accordance with Federal regulations. State Entity Response We concur with the finding. FDEO comp leted its ETA 227 report validation project in October 2019 and has submitted all ETA 227 reports due as of January 2020. The next required submission is scheduled for May 2020.

Criteria 2 CFR 200.303 - Internal Controls - The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federa l entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition The FDOR contracted with a service organization to provide tax filing solutions for multiple tax type types, including UI ta xes. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOR received UI tax payments from employers totaling approximately $525 million. The service organization was responsible for processing $132.6 million in UI tax payments. The service organization obtained an independent service auditor's report for the period January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018, in which the service organization's auditors qualified their opinion related to risk management and application development activities. Gi ven the significance of the service organization's role in the UI program, internal control weaknesses reported in the service auditor's report could signif icantly impact the UI program. Cause The service organization had not effectively established certain IT controls, including the establishment of a risk management program, the separation of application development duties, and the proper design of the change management process. Effect Absent appropriate UI tax payment processing controls, the FDOR has reduced assurance that the UI tax data is appropriately safeguarded. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOR ensure that the service organization takes timely and appropriate corrective action to resolve the deficiencies noted in the independent service auditor's report. State Entity Response FDOR will ensure the service organization takes timely and appropriate corrective action to resolve the deficiencies noted in the independent service auditor's report. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 45 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Finding Number 2019-016 CFDA Number 17.225 Program Title Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compliance Requirement Special Tests and Provisions - Match with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 940 Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) Tax Form State Entity Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year Various Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Disclaimer of Opinion and Material Weakness Finding The FDOR could not provide a copy of the certification files provided to the IRS evidencing the match of employer tax payments with credits claimed for the payments on the employer's Form 940 or Schedule H. Criteria 26 CFR 31.3302(a)-3 - Proof of credit under section 3302(a) - States are required to annually certify for each taxpayer the total amount of contributions required to be paid under State law for the calendar year and the amounts and dates of such payments for the taxpayer to be allowed the credit against FUTA tax. To accomplish this certific ation, States annually match employer tax payments with credits claimed for these payments on the employer's Form 940 or Schedule H. IRS Publication 4485 - Guide for the Certification of State FUTA Credits - In September of each year, the IRS creates a FUTA Identification Data file of Form 940 or Schedule H filers to send to each state agency. The IRS distributes the FUTA Identification Data file to t he states in October. State agencies are required to provide FUTA certification data to the IRS by January 31 of the following year. Condition The FUTA provides for cooperation betwe en the Federal Government and state governments in the establishment and administration of UI. The employer is subject to a payroll tax levied by the Federal Government and state governments. The IRS uses the FUTA Certification Program to verify with the states that the credit claimed by the employer on the Form 940 or Schedule H was actually paid to the states' unemployment funds. On January 4, 2019, the FDOR uploaded FUTA certification files to the IRS. However, although we requested, the FDOR could not provide copies of the certification files provided to the IRS evidencing the match of employer tax payments with credits claimed for the payments on the employer's Form 940 or Schedule H. Cause FDOR management indicated that copies of the certification files submitted to the IRS were inadvertently deleted and the files were unable to be recovered. Effect Absent documentation that the FDOR's certification of FUTA tax credits was supported by a match of employer tax payments with credits claimed, the FDOR cannot demonstrate that employer credits claimed on the Form 940 or Schedule H related to amounts paid to the State's unemployment fund. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOR enhance cont rols to ensure that copies of FUTA certification files submitted to the IRS are retained and evidence the match of employer tax payments with credits claimed for the payments. State Entity Response The archiving and retention of FUTA certification files had been manually performed in the past. FDOR's Informati on Services Program is currently testing a new process that will automatically archiv e copies of the cert ification copies for retention, and prevent this issue from reoccurring.

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Finding Number 2019-018 CFDA Number 66.468 Program Title Capitalization Grants for Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (DWSRF) Compliance Requirement Procurement and Suspension and Debarment State Entity Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 98452218 2018 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency Finding The FDEP did not appropriately verify t he suspension and debarment status of all subrecipients receiving DWSRF funds. Criteria 2 CFR 180.300 - What must I do before I enter in to a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier? - When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by: (a) Checking System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions, (b) Collecting a certif ication from that person, or (c ) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person. Condition Pursuant to Federal regulations, the FDEP utilized two separate standard application forms for private and public s ubrecipients seeking funding for DWSRF projects. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEP made 15 subawards, totaling $42,567,681, to public subrecipients and 2 subawards, totaling $2,608,433, to private subrecipients utilizing DWSRF funds. We examined the standard application forms and noted that, while the application form for private subrecipients included a clause requiring the subrecipient to comply with the suspension and debarment requirements, the application for public subrecipients did not have a similar certification requ irement. Additionally, FDEP records did not evidence that, prior to entering into the subaward agreements with the public subrecipients, that the FDEP verified th rough SAM that the subrecipients were not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded or that the FDEP had obtained a certification from each subrecipient de monstrating that the subrecipient was not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded. Cause FDEP management was not aware that suspension and debarment requirements applied to public subrecipients as well as private subrecipients. Effect Absent the verification of the suspension and debarment status of all subrecipients, the risk is increased that the FDEP may enter into covered transactions with subrecipients w ho have been suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded by the Federal Government. In addition, DWSRF funds provided to ineligible subrecipients could be subject to disallowance by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Recommendation We recommend that FDEP management re vise the standard application for public subrecipients to include a certificat ion requiring the subrecipient to comply with the suspension and debarment requirements specified in Federal regulations. State Entity Response Upon receiving this finding, the State Revolving Fund Program implemented a procedure to verify all applicants in SAM.gov during loan application review. In addition, the Program will request permission to do rulemaking to update the standard State Revolving Fund loan applicat ion to include a certification from the subrecipient that they are in compliance with Federal regulations for suspension and debarment.

Criteria 34 CFR 682.409 - Mandatory assignment by guaranty agencies of defaulted loans to the Secretary - The state must assign to the USED any loan that meets all of the following criteria as of April 15 each year: The unpaid principal balance is at least $100. The loan, and other loans held by the state for that borrower, have been held by the state for at least 5 years. A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year. A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the borrower. Guaranty Agency Assignments Operational Procedures - Appendix I - All loans meeting the assignment criteria must be transmitted to the USED by December 31. The transmittal must be completed by submitting the eligible loan data in batches through the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG). Additionally, the hard copy files must be sent to the USED no later than 2 weeks after the batch file has been accepted by the USED. Condition According to FDOE records, 38,520 loans were eligible for assignment to the USED as of April 15, 2018. During the period May 2018 through December 2018, the FDOE submitted eight batches of lo an data to the USED SAIG that included 13,678 loans eligible for assignment. Of the 13,678 loans, 12,782 loans were accepted by the USED; however, the FDOE did not assign the remaining 25,738 loans before December 31, 2018. Cause According to FDOE management, staff limitations prevented the FDOE from assigning all eligible loans before the December 31, 2018, deadline. Effect By not assigning all eligible loans to the USED, the USED does not have the loan information necessary to manage defaulted loans. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOE ensure that all eligible loans are assigned to the USED in accordance with Federal regulations and procedures. State Entity Response In connection with the Department's subrogation process, OSFA is required to send the USDOE an official forecast and timeline for submission. The Department sent to the USDOE the number of eligible loans and the number of loans per month that OSFA would be s ubmitting for Subrogation. The USDOE acknowledged the forecast and timeline without issue or comment, and only asked to be notified if there were any changes to the timeline. The USDOE requires the Department to provide a full borrower file for each loan that will be assi gned for Subro gation. The files contain all borrower information Report No. 2020-170 Page 50 March 2020 which include Lender information prior to OSFA's ownership and any documents or correspondence after claim payment, until the loan is assigned to USDOE. To ensure fulfillment of this requirement , the Department has contracted with an external vendor to carry out this aspect of the servicing requirements for OSFA. The use of the vendor will increase OSFA's ability to efficiently meet the program's obligations in the future.

Criteria 2 CFR 200.303 and 45 CFR 75.303 - Internal controls - The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective inter nal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Fede ral statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition The FDCF contracted with a service or ganization to provide annual licenses, hosting, and support for the Web-based Random Moment Sampling (WebRMS) Application. The WebRMS Application uses random sampling techniques to determine the percentage of time spent on a particular Federal program by employees who deliver services that b enefit various Federal programs. The FDCF utilizes the labor distribution inform ation to allocate Federal awards to benefitting Federal programs. While the FDCF tracked and reviewed the labor distribution information prepared by the service organization, the FDCF did not evaluate the design or operating effectiveness of the service organization's internal controls, either internally or by obtaining and reviewing an independent service auditor's report that adequately described the service organization's internal controls and the auditor's opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls re lated to the allocation of costs for FDCF employees performing functions directly related to various Federal programs. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the WebRMS Application was used by the FDCF to allocate costs, totaling $68,833,773, to the following major Federal programs: Report No. 2020-170 Page 52 March 2020 CFDA Number Program Federal Grant Number and Grant Year Federal Expenditures at the FDCF Costs Allocated to Federal Program Using WebRMS Application 10.561 State Administrative Matching Grants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 5FL400402 - 2019 $ 80,464,068 $38,521,410 93.558 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 1801FLTANF - 1901FLTANF - 2019 220,823,636 5,603,274 2018 1901FLRCMA 2019 35,131,878 451,830 93.667 Social Services Block - 2018 - 2019 84,910,585 4,720,602 93.778 Totals $548,922,777 $68,833,773 Cause The FDCF did not require the service organization to provide an independent service auditor's report. Effect Absent an evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of the service organization's internal controls over the WebRMS Application, the FDCF has reduced assurance that the sampling tec hniques used by the service organization are statistically valid, are operating as designed, and costs are appropriately allocated to Federal programs. Recommendation We recommend that the FDCF ensure t hat the service organization's internal controls related to the WebRMS Application are appropriately designed and operating effectively either internally or by obtaining and reviewing an independent service auditor's report. State Entity Response FDCF concurs with this recommendation and will either require the vendor to provide an independent service auditor's report or perform internally an evaluation of the internal controls rela ted to the WebRMS Application to ensure internal controls are appropriately designed and operating effectively. The service organization is a for-profit organiza tion that specializes in the provision of cost allocation services. FDCF has used this vendor for the past 20 plus years to provide its RMS and webRMS services, which are used by other states and is known by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Cost Allocation.

Criteria Effective access controls include measures that restrict user access privileges to data and IT resources to only those f unctions that promote an appropriate separation of duties and are necessary for users' assigned job responsibilities. Appropriately restricted access privileges help protect data and IT resources from unauthorized modification, loss, or disclosure. Section 282.201(1)(f), Florida Statutes - State data center - The State Data Center (SDC) shall assume administrative access rights to resources and equipment, including servers, network components, and other devices, consolidated into the State Data Center. State agencies are to relinquish administrative rights to consolidated resources and equipment and the SDC is to provide customer entities with access to applications, servers, network components, and other devices necessary for entities to perform business activities and functions. Condition The SDC, established within the FAST , provides data center services for customer entities. As part of our IT operational audit, we evaluated administrative access privileges to the mainframe, Windows server, and Oracle database environments, and the interconnected ne twork domains. Our audit procedures disclosed user accounts with administrative access privileges to mainframe environment resources that were not as signed to SDC staff. Specifically, we noted that: For the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) mainframe security environment applicable to three logical partitions (LPARs) assigned to one State agency, 20 of the 35 active accounts with one or more administrative access authorities were assigned to the State agency's staff as of April 26, 2019. The administrative access authorities included the ability to copy, reorganize, catalog, scratch user or data sets, specify logging options, and have full control over all RACF user profiles. For the CA Top Secret mainframe security environment applicable to one State agency's LPAR, 1 of the 7 active ad ministrative accounts with unlimited scope privileges as of May 2, 2019, wa s assigned to State agency staff. This account had the ability to create a terminal session. Report No. 2020-170 Page 54 March 2020 Our audit procedures also disclosed server accounts with administrative access privileges that were not appropriate an d that administrative access accounts for the Oracle production database clusters were not assigned to current SDC staff. Additionally, our audit procedures disclosed the existence of user accounts with administrative access as of April 12, 2019, on three of the six SDC-managed network domains that were not appropriate, including active administrative user accounts assigned to employees who had separated from employment. Specifically, as shown in the table bel ow, 7 of the 163 active accounts with administrative access were not appropriate.

Additionally, SDC management indicated that the administr ative accounts required analysis to determine whether the accounts were necessary and that, as part of an ongoing effort to remove unnecessary accounts with excessive pe rmissions, database administration staff were working with the respective customer entities to ensure the accounts could be removed. Effect Inappropriate and unnecessar y administrative access privileges to the mainframe, Windows server, and Oracle database environments, and the interconnected network domains, increase the risk of unauthorized modification, loss, or disclosure of data and IT resources. Recommendation To promote compliance with State law a nd an appropriate separation of duties, we recommend that FDMS management properly restrict administrative access privileges to the mainframe, Windows servers, and Oracle database environments, and the interconnected network domains, to only those functions necessary for the user's assigned job re sponsibilities and ensure administrative accounts are timely disabled when no longer necessary. State Entity Response The Department concurs. The Department will continue to evaluate and improve access control processes to ensure acce ss to IT resources is appropriately restricted.

Criteria FAST Rule 74-2.003(1)(a)(6), Florida Administrative Code - Access Control - Agency information owners are to review ac cess rights (privileges) periodically based on system categorization or assessed risk. FAST Procedure AST-BWS-AP-001, Active Directory Account Audit Procedure FAST Procedure AST-BIOS-P-100, Physical Access Control Procedure FAST Procedure AST-ED-P-0021, Employee Action Procedure Condition The SDC, established within the FAST , provides data center services for customer entities. As part of our IT operational audit, we evaluated the SDC's periodic review of access privileges. FAST rules require agency information owners to review access rights (pri vileges) periodically based on system categorization or assessed risk. Periodic reviews of user access privileges help ensure that only authorized users have access and that the access provided to each user remains appropriate. An effective periodic review consists of identifying the current logical and physic al access privileges of all users and evaluating the assigned access privileges to ensure that they align with users' job responsibilities. Our audit procedures disclosed that the periodic access privilege review processes performed by the SDC need improvement. Specifically: In response to our request for docum entation of periodic reviews performed for Windows server local administrative and Active Directory administrative accounts, SDC management stated that in accordance with Active Directory Account Audit Procedure, periodic reviews of some administrative accounts were initiated using a scheduled task t hat ran a script biweekly in all SDC domains. The script generated a report of administrative access for each domain and automatically converted the reports to service requests requiring staff review. The reviewer created a change ticket for any account requiring changes (e.g., disabling). Our examination of the reports disclosed that: o A report generated on March 25, 2019, for one domain did not contain all administrative accounts for the domain. SDC management further stated that reports were not generated, nor access reviewed, for Windows server local administrative accounts. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 59 o 1 of the 20 active accounts listed on the report dated March 25, 2019, was for an employee who had separated from AST employment on January 31, 2019. The biweekly revi ews were ineffective as the account remained active and was not discovered during four biweekly reviews, including the review of the report generated on March 25, 2019. Although SDC management responsible for Oracle access within the Database Section of the Bureau of Ce ntral Services reviewed the access of current staff members within the Bureau on a periodic basis, not all active accounts, including accounts assigned to customer entities, were evaluated. Additionally, SDC staff had not establis hed ownership of all active accounts to ensure that all noncustomer accounts were included in the SDC review. SDC management responsible for open systems access within the Open Systems Section of the Bureau of Central Services performed a quarterly review of access privileges granted to Open Systems Section staff. Reports were generated individually for each employee within the Open Systems Section with assigned server access. The reviews were not comprehensive as accounts on some servers could be omitted because the reviews were not performed on a server by server basis and did not encompass administrative accounts within the service management system assigned to others, including other SDC staff, customers, or historic al accounts from prior data center administrations. As part of our IT operational audit, we also evaluated the Physical Access Control Procedure and Employee Action Procedure and related process for periodic reviews of physical access privileges to the SDC buildings. The Physical Access Control Procedure required reviews of access be initiated in March and September of each year. The procedure further stated that supervisors would receive a notice to review access, including access to SDC buildings, according to the process details documented in the Employee Action Procedure . We found that periodic reviews of assigned physic al access privileges were performed for staff with unlimited access privileges to the data center facility; however, periodic reviews were not performed for SDC sta ff with limited access privileges to the data center facility or for FDMS staff with access to the Sadowski Building. The SDC provides services for various systems managed by the Florida Department of Children and Families (FDCF), Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (FDEO), Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR), and the Florida Department of Health (FDOH).

Report No. 2020-170 Page 60 March 2020 These systems are used to administer as pects of the following major Federal programs: 10.551, 10.561 - Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Cluster 10.558 - Child and Adult Care Food Program 17.225 - Unemployment Insurance 93.268 - Immunization Cooperative Agreements 93.558 - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) 93.566 - Refugee and Entrant Assist ance State/Replacement Designee Administered Programs 93.645 - Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program 93.667 - Social Services Block Grant 93.775, 93.777, 93.778 - Medicaid Cluster 93.917 - HIV Care Formula Grants 93.958 - Block Grants for Community Mental Health Services 93.959 - Block Grants for Prevention a nd Treatment of Substance Abuse 97.036 - Disaster Grants - Public Assistanc e (Presidentially Declared Disasters) Cause According to SDC management, the script generated to document review of access only reported the Enterprise , Schema, and Domain Admins security groups for Active Directory and did not include the Administrators security group. SDC management also stated that custom er entity user and application accounts were managed by the customers and were not reviewed by the SDC. In response to our audit inquiry related to the physical access controls, SDC management stated that, although a periodic review wa s not performed, all badge requests were submitted by supervisors through the ticketing system, which served as documentation of a review. Effect Without documented effectiv e processes for performi ng comprehensive reviews of access privileges using complete ac cess lists, management's assurance that user access privileges were properly autho rized and remain appropriate is limited. Recommendation We recommend that FDMS management perform comprehensive periodic reviews of logical and physical access privileges for users, maintain documentation of the reviews conducted, and ensure that access privileges are timely removed when no longer needed. State Entity Response The Department concurs. The Department will continue to evaluate and improve access control processes to ensure acce ss to IT resources is appropriately restricted.

Criteria Security controls are intended to prot ect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and IT resources. Condition The NWRDC provides data center servic es for various customer entities and IT systems, including the Federal Fa mily Education Loan Program (FFELP) System at the Florida Department of Education (FDOE) and the Child Support Automated Management System (CAMS) at the Florida Department of Revenue (FDOR). The FDOE, Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA), is responsible for providing access to and administering State and Federal grants, scholarships, and loans to students seeking financial assi stance for postsecondary study. The OSFA is the designated guaranty agency for the State of Florida for all FFELP loans with first disbursements prior to July 1, 2010, and the OSFA utilizes the FFELP System to administer FFELP loans. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOE expended $49,749,552 under the FFELP program. The Florida Department of Children and Families (FDCF) is responsible for providing cash assistance under the TANF program. Benefit payments under the program are contingent upon the client's cooperation with child support enforcement (CSE). The FDOR operates the CSE program and utilizes CAMS to provide services to parents and to maintain case member information, paternity and support establishment, enforcement of ordered obligations for support, and collection and distribution of support payments. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDCF made TANF cash assistan ce payment totaling $132,470,380. Our IT operational audit disclosed that cert ain NWRDC security controls related to physical access, logging and monitoring, and logical access needed improvement. We are not disclosing the specific details of the issues to avoid the possibility of compromising NWRDC customer entity data and related IT resources. However, appropriate NWRDC mana gement were notified of the Report No. 2020-170 Page 62 March 2020 specific issues. The deficiencies noted we consider collectively to be a significant deficiency. Cause We are not disclosing the specific details of the issues in this report to avoid the possibility of compromising NWRDC customer entity data and related IT resources. Effect Without appropriate security controls related to physical access, logging and monitoring, and logical access, the risk is increased that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer entity data and re lated IT resources may be compromised. Recommendation We recommend that NWRDC management improve certain security controls related to physical access, logging and monitoring, and logical access to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and avail ability of NWRDC customer entity data and related IT resources. State Entity Response NWRDC agrees with the finding and has impr oved controls in these areas. The following are updates for the three named items: Physical Access - Complete. NWRDC has improved its controls, and we plan to work with the Florida Auditor General personnel during their next operational audit to ensure they are sati sfied with control improvements to address this item. Logging & Monitoring - Complete. NWRDC has implemented the audit recommendation. Logical Access - Complete. NWRDC has implemented the audit recommendation. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 63 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Finding Number 2019-025 CFDA Number 10.558 and 93.917 Program Title Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) HIV Care Formula Grants Compliance Requirement Subrecipient Monitoring State Entity Florida Department of Health (FDOH) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 5FL300350 2018 and 2019, 5FL300340 2018 and 2019, X08HA32362 2018, and X07HA00057 2018 and 2019 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Noncompliance Finding The FDOH did not verify that all applicable subrecipients were audited or timely issue management decisions for subrecipient audit findings. Criteria 2 CFR 200.331 - Requirements for pass-through entities - All pass-through entities must verify that every subrecipient is audited as required by Subpart F - Audit Requirements when it is expected that the s ubrecipient's Federal awards expended during the respective fiscal year equaled or exceeded the threshold set forth in 2 CFR 200.501 - Audit requirements . The pass-through entity's monitoring of the subrecipient must include following up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies pertaining to the Federal award detected through audits. The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings pertaining to the Federal award within 6 months of accept ance of the audit report by the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.521 - Management decision . Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FD OH provided approximately $291 million in CACFP funds to subrecipients and approximately $76 million in HIV Care Formula Grants funds to subrecipients. To determine which subrecipients are required to be audited, the FDOH analyzes expenditure data and utilizes Audit Report Certification Forms that require s ubrecipients to certify whether or not an audit is required. The FDOH documented on an audit tracking log the dates audit reports were received, the dates corrective actions were taken, and the dates that the FDOH determined that sufficient corrective actions had been taken to address audit findings. Upon receipt of an audit report, the FDOH was to review the report and complete a Single Audit Report Checklist to document the review of the audit report. Our examination of the FDOH audit tracking log and FDOH expenditure data disclosed that the FDOH did not send to 5 CACFP subrecipients and 2 HIV Care Formula Grants subrecipients an Audit Report Certification Form or otherwise verify that the subrecipients were audited. In addition, our review of 21 audit reports included on the FDOH's audit tracking log disclosed that, for 11 of the reports related to 7 CACFP subrecipients and 4 HIV Care Formula Grant subrecipient s, the FDOH was unable to provide completed Single Audit Report Checklists evidencing that the FDOH obtained and reviewed the audit reports to ensure the timely issuance of management decisions, if necessary. We also noted that 1 of the 11 audit reports included audit findings related to the HIV Care Formula Grant program. Our examination of the management decision disclosed that the FDOH did not issue the management decision until subsequent to our audit inquiry (406 days late). Report No. 2020-170 Page 64 March 2020 Cause According to FDOH management, the FDOH did not verify that the subrecipients were audited and the subrecipient audits were not timely obtained and reviewed due to coding errors in the data used to identify subrecipients, staffing reductions, and a review backlog. These issues contributed to the untimely issuance of the required management decision. Effect Absent verification that all applicable subrecipients were audited, the FDOH may not obtain the required audit reports to verify that all subrecipients complied with applicable Federal laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts and grant agreements. In addition, absent this verification and timely review of all required subrecipient audit reports, the FDOH may not ensure that any deficiencies noted during audit were appropriately followed up on or timely issue required management decisions. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOH take steps to verify that audit reports from all applicable subrecipients are timely obtained and reviewed to ensure that the subrecipients took timely and appropriate action to address all applicable deficiencies and to facilitate the time ly issuance of management decisions. State Entity Response FDOH agrees that out of 2,499 records, seven providers (five sub-recipients from the CACFP and two from HIV Care Form ula Grant) were omitted from the Export_FLAIR_Master_File that FDOH us es to generate certification forms to sub-recipient providers. The \"glitch \" was discovered, and the program codes were updated by the Florida Accounting Information Resource system team November 11, 2019. FDOH will perform a review of the Master File program codes each year prior to running the report to further reduce the potential for a similar incident. In addition, FDOH will modify the single audit report review workflow beginning July 1, 2020 to prioritize management decision letters to those providers with audit findings at the start of each audit reporting cycle, rather than on a first in/first out method. This will a llow FDOH to meet the additional workload requirements under 2 CFR 200, while at the same time increasing the compliance level for the timeline prescribed under 2 CFR 200.521 - Management decision. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 65 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-026 CFDA Number 93.268 Program Title Immunization Cooperative Agreements Compliance Requirement Period of Performance State Entity Florida Department of Health (FDOH) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 6 NH23IP000741-05-02 2018 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency Questioned Costs - $348,618.89 Finding FDOH expenditures charged to the Immunization Cooperative Agreements program were not always incurred during the authorized period of performance. Criteria 2 CFR 200.309 - Period of performance - A non-Federal entity may charge to the Federal award only allowable costs incurred during the period of performance. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOH expended $306,600,812 in Federal funds, including $293,881,585 for vaccines, for the Immunization Cooperative Agreements program. Our analysis and examination of records related to expenditures paid by the FDOH during the 2018-19 fiscal year disclosed 13 expenditures, totaling $348,618.89, that were not incurred during the authorized period of performance. Cause According to FDOH management, upon the change of a fiscal year, the accounting codes used to identify expenditu res to a particular grant are updated in the FDOH's accounting system. FDOH management indicated that the expenditures were charged to the incorrect grant because the expenditures were paid during the accounting codes updat e and FDOH staff did not identify the expenditures as being charged incorrec tly during the review process. Effect Expenditures charged to a Federal awar d that were not incurred during the authorized period of performance could be subject to disallowance by the Federal grantor agency. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOH enhance revi ew procedures to ensure that costs are attributable to the authorized period of performance and are charged to the correct grant. State Entity Response Moving forward, when fiscal codes (Other Cost Accumulators (OCA) and Grant Number) for a new grant year are upda ted, all monthly expenditures will be audited internally by the Immunization Se ction's Grant Analyst and the Bureau of Epidemiology's Grant Manager to ensure that each payment is charged to the appropriate grant OCA for the time period indicated on the invoices. Any necessary corrections will be made as soon as they are identified and verified prior to the submission of the Federal Financial Report. Additionally, the program office will communicate with county health departments and other partners, to review invoices to ensure they were processed with the correct coding, and reflect the correct period of performance. These new proces ses will ensure the program complies with the project period integrity for each year of the grant.

Criteria Agency for State Technology (AST) Rule 74-2.003(1), Florida Administrative Code - Access Control - Each agency shall ensure that access to information technology resources is limited to authorized users, processes, or devices, and to authorized activities and transactions. AST Rule 74-2.003(5), Florida Administrative Code - Information Protection Processes and Procedures - Each agency shall ensure that security policies, processes and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets. Condition The FDOH uses PEAR, a Federally owned system, to document field staff and provider interactions to ensure compliance with program requirements. As of June 30, 2019, 41 FDOH employees h ad access to PEAR. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOH expended Immunization Cooperative Agreements program funds totaling $306,600,812. Our review of FDOH access controls for PEAR disclosed that controls over access needed improvement. Specifically , although requested, the FDOH could not provide documentation demonstrating the request for and approval of access privileges for 2 of 5 of the FDOH users selected for testing. Cause FDOH management indicated that the FDOH had not established procedures for maintaining documentation evidencing the request for and approval of access to PEAR. Effect Absent procedures requiring that appropriate user access authorization documentation be prepared and maintained, the FDOH cannot demonstrate that access to PEAR is appropriately limit ed to authorized users for authorized purposes. Additionally, the data stored in PEAR may be at increased risk of compromise. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOH establis h procedures addressing the preparation and maintenance of PEAR user access authorization documentation. State Entity Response Vaccines for Children (VFC) Field Staff are responsible for conducting VFC-related site visits at VFC-enrolle d provider sites. Requirements for conducting these types of visits are out lined in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Immunization Program Operations Manual and its Vaccines for Children Operations Guide. For purposes of conducting VFC- related site visits, field staff are referred to as reviewers. Reviewers joining the VFC program must have access to CDC's PEAR. Access to PEAR is initiated by the Immunization Section's VFC Unit. Access to PEAR is granted b y the CDC. Once access to PEAR is granted b y the CDC, the VCF Unit Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 67 can manage a reviewer's status (deactiv ate or reactivate reviewers and update reviewer email addresses, as applicable). To initiate the process of gaining PEAR access: The VFC Unit's Manager (VFC Manager) or VFC Assistant Manager will provide the site visit reviewer with PEAR Access Request Form. The reviewer will complete the form and retu rn it to the VFC Manager or Assistant Manager. The VFC Manager or Assistant Manager will sign the form. The signed form will be scanned and emailed to the CDC Public Health Advisor. The CDC Public Health Advisor (PHA) will email CDC's Project Officer asking that the reviewer be granted access to the CDC's Secure Access Management Services (SAMS) system. SAMS will send an email invitation to join SAMS along with identity proofing documents. The reviewer will complete the identity proofing document and provide it to the PHA for signature. The PHA will sign the form, scan the fo rm along with the PEAR Access Request Form and store it at the following loca tion: I:\\IMM\\Field Operations\\PEAR Access Requests. The reviewer will then email the complet ed identity proofing document to SAMS, as instructed by the CDC invitation to join SAMS. Report No. 2020-170 Page 68 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-028 CFDA Number 93.558 and 93.667 Program Title Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Cluster and Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed and Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles State Entity Florida Department of Children and Families (FDCF) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1801FLTANF 2018 and G-1801FLSOSR 2018 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance Questioned Costs - $47,194.43 G-1801FLSOSR 2018 Finding The FDCF used incorrect allocation percen tages for a protective investigations cost objective, resulting in costs being c harged to the incorrect Federal program. Criteria 2 CFR 200.405 - Allocable costs - If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can determin ed without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit. Condition The FDCF utilizes the Grants and Other Revenue, Allocation and Tracking System (GRANTS) to provide for a detailed analysis of grant activity. GRANTS tracks grant related expenditures and revenues, assigns expenditures to funding sources, calculates Federal earnings, assists in financial and Federal reporting, and the drawing of cash from the Federal Government. The primary flow of data within GRANTS starts with expenditure data in the Florida Accounting Information Resource Subsystem (FLAIR). Expenditures in FLAIR are assigned to various cost objectives, depending on the budget entity, category, and other cost accumulator that the expenditure is coded to in FLAIR. The expenditures (costs) charged to the cost objectives are then allocated based on factors such as the percentage of clients eligible for a Federal program or the percentage of abuse hotline calls received fo r adults and children. The allocation percentages for each cost objective are reviewed and approved by management and then entered into GRANTS. Our review of the allocation percentages included in GRANTS disclosed that, for one protective investigations cost objective, the FDCF entered the incorrect allocation percentages for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. As a result, the FDCF overallocated $47,194.43 in prot ective investigations costs to the SSBG program and $125,875.79 to State general revenue, and underallocated costs totaling $173,070.22 to TANF. Cause According to FDCF management, the last six digits of the allocation percentages were transposed when entered into GRANTS and the error was not discovered during supervisory review. Effect Expenditures were incorrectly allocated, resulting in costs being charged to the incorrect Federal program. Recommendation We recommend that the FDCF enhance supervisory review procedures to ensure that accurate allocation percentages are entered into GRANTS and used as the basis to allocate protective investigations costs to Federal programs. State Entity Response FDCF concurs with this recommendation and is currently in the process of transitioning from a quarterly manual input of cost allocation statistics to an automated quarterly cost allocation statis tical upload into the GRANTS system to eliminate the risk of error. In the interim, FDCF will enhance supervisory review procedures to ensure that accurate allocation percentages are input to the GRANTS s ystem.

Effect Expenditures charged to a Federal award that were not incurred during the authorized period of performance could be subject to disallowance by the Federal grantor agency. Recommendation We recommend that the FDCF establish a monitoring process to ensure that costs are attributable to the authorized period of performance and are charged to the correct grant. We also recommend that the FDCF review expenditure data and records to determine the total costs that were charged to the grants in error. Report No. 2020-170 Page 70 March 2020 State Entity Response FDCF concurs with this recommendation. FDCF will work with our various Federal agencies to discuss challenges with respect to period of performance. In addition, FDCF is taking steps to ensure expendi tures are identified in the appropriate period where the benefit to the state was realized. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 71 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-030 CFDA Number 93.558 Program Title Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Compliance Requirement Special Tests and Provisions - Income Eligibility and Verification System State Entity Florida Department of Children and Families (FDCF) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1801FLTANF 2018 and 1901FLTANF 2019 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Opinion Qualification and Material Weakness Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-026 Finding The FDCF did not always timely revi ew and process Income Eligibility and Verification System (IEVS) data exchange responses. Criteria 42 USC 1320b-7 - Income and eligibility verification system - A State must have in effect an income and eligib ility verification system. 45 CFR 205.55 - Requirements for requesting and furnishing eligibility and income information Program Policy Manual Section 3020.0100 - Data Exchange and Section 3020.0102 - Processing Time Standards - FDCF staff are to dispose of data exchange responses considered verified upon receipt within 10 calendar days and all other data exchange responses within 45 calendar days. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDCF made TANF cash benefit payments totaling $132,470,380. Federal regulations require the FDCF to verify certain eligibility information through electronic data exchanges with other State and Federal agencies. Eligibility informatio n is maintained in the Florida Online Recipient Integrated Data Access (FLORI DA) System. As part of the IEVS data exchange process, the FLORIDA System compares the data exchange response to eligibility information in the Syst em; however, resolving data exchange responses requires employee action. As part of our audit, we examined FDCF eligibility records for 25 clients (cases), including 20 cases for which the FDCF was required to review and process IEVS data exchange responses. Our examinat ion disclosed 9 instances related to 5 cases where the FDCF did not review and process the IEVS data exchange responses within the established time frames. Of the 9 instances, we noted 5 instances where the data exchanges were required to be reviewed and processed within 45 days but were reviewed and processed 11 to 102 days late. In the other 4 instances, the data exchan ges were required to be processed within 10 days but were reviewed and processed 6 to 86 days late. In addition, we obtained IEVS Data Exchange Reports for August 2018, November 2018, and May 2019 to determine the number of data exchange responses that were not timely revi ewed and processed. The three reports included a total of 767,591 data exchange responses that were not timely reviewed and processed, including 288, 756 responses that were verified upon receipt. Specifically, the 767,591 data exchange responses were reviewed and processed 143 to 379 days late. Cause According to FDCF management, the co mpletion of IEVS data exchanges is a manual process requiring employee action. Due to the volume of data exchanges and the inability of the FLORIDA System to integrate IEVS data, actions were not timely performed. Effect Failure to timely review and process data exchange information may preclude the FDCF from promptly identifying changes in client eligibility status. Report No. 2020-170 Page 72 March 2020 Recommendation We recommend that the FDCF take appr opriate actions to improve controls, including evaluating staffing resources and necessary system enhancements, to ensure that data exchange responses are reviewed and processed within established time frames. State Entity Response Regarding the identified cases where t he Income Eligibility and Verification System data exchanges were not processed timely, t he department concurs. Due to the overall volume of data exchanges for the Economic Self-Sufficiency Program, and the inability of the FLORIDA System to integrate data, the department will establish an extensive project management component to determine system enhancements and ident ify process improv ements to ensure data exchanges are processed timely. Furthermore, the department is actively working a request for funds from the Florida Legislature to improve system and data integration and the overall functionality of the department's information technology systems. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 73 Finding Number 2019-031 Not Used. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN Finding Number 2019-032 CFDA Title Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid Cluster Compliance Requirement Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles State Entity Florida Department of Health (FDOH) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1805FL5021 2018, 1905FL5021 2019, 1805FL5MAP 2018, and 1905FL5MAP 2019 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Finding The FDOH did not obtain or review t he required independent service auditor's report that would ensure t hat the service organization's internal controls related to processing Children's Medical Services (CMS) medical claims payments were appropriately designed and operating effectively. Criteria 2 CFR 200.303 and 45 CFR 75.303 - Internal controls - The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective inter nal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Fede ral statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition The FDOH contracted with a service organization to process and pay claims submitted by health care providers for the payment of services provided to CMS recipients that met CMS Plan requirements. The contract specified that the service organization was to submit an i ndependent service auditors report to the FDOH by October 1st of each year of the contract. The service organization paid CMS medical claims totaling $57,946,562 during the 2018-19 fiscal year. Effective February 1, 2019, the FDOH cont racted with a provider to assist in the administration of the CMS Plan through a Managed Medical Assistance Program. The service organization is to process outstanding CMS medical claims through the end of the contract in February 2020. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOH did not obtain or review the required independent service auditor's report to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of the service organizati on's internal controls related to the processing of CMS medical claims payments. Cause FDOH management indicated that the report was unavailable due to an unresolved compliance matter with the service organization. Effect Absent an evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of the service organization's internal controls related to the payment of CMS medical claims, the FDOH has reduced assurance that CMS claims payments are accurate and appropriate. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOH ensure that the service organization's internal controls related to CMS medical claims payments are appropriately designed and operating effectively by obtaining and reviewing an independent service auditor's report and, as necessary, ensuring approp riate corrective action is taken to resolve noted deficiencies. State Entity Response The State of Florida and the FDOH CMS Managed Care Plan (CMS Plan) management fund appropriately designed effective medical claims payment systems with two third-party administr ators (TPA) as of February 1, 2019. MED3000 is the TPA for the service delivery model that ended January 31, 2019. WellCare Health Plans (WellCare) is contractually responsible to FDOH CMS Plan mana gement as the TPA for the service deliver y model implemented Report No. 2020-170 Page 74 March 2020 February 1, 2019. The FDOH CMS Plan management will continue to require compliance from the two TPAs providing CMS Plan services. For example, the CMS Plan management received WellCare's independent service auditor's report for the period April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019. While MED3000 made a business economies of scale decision to not comply with the Annual Service Organization Cont rol (SOC) 1 Type II Audit and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance Review, other internal controls and processes have remained in place. CMS Plan management will continue to execute internal controls for the MED3000 claims lag payment and continue to seek compliance regarding the breach of the requirement for the SOC 1 report.

Criteria 42 CFR 447.45(f)(iv) - Timely claims payment - For all claims, the agency must conduct prepayment claims review consisting of verification that a payment does not exceed any reimbursement rates or limits in the Medicaid State Plan. FAHCA Rule 59G-4.002, Florida Administrative Code - Provider Reimbursement Schedules and Billing Codes (Provider Fee Schedule) - Florida Medicaid reimburses for services rendered in the fee-for-service delivery system based on a fee schedule. Condition The FAHCA contracted with a fiscal agent to provide the Florida Medicaid Management Information System (FMMIS) t hat is used to process Medicaid and REAP fee for service claims submitted by providers. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, $5.8 billion in Medicaid and $1.2 million in REAP fee for service medical claims were processed. We examined FAHCA records for claim payments made to providers to determine whether the claim payments were in accordance with the Provider Fee Schedule. Our examination disclosed that, for one provider type and procedure code, the claims were not paid in accordance with the Provider Fee Schedule, resulting in an $133,386.66 overpayment to eight providers. Cause FAHCA management indicated that t he incorrect payment rates were programmed in FMMIS, resulting in the claims being paid in the incorrect amount. Effect Absent appropriate controls, claims ma y be paid in incorrect amounts and not be timely detected by FAHCA personnel. Recommendation We recommend that the FAHCA implement c ontrols to ensure that all claims are paid for the correct amount and that FAHCA review the payment rates programmed in FMMIS to ensure that the payment rates are correct. State Entity Response To ensure that future Medicaid Fee Schedules are implemented into the Florida Medicaid Management Information System (FMMIS) correctly, the FAHCA has developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The CAP has two components: 1. FAHCA will document a standard proc ess for tracking the annual Medicaid fee schedule updates. The new procedure guide will include detailed instruction and processes for cross bureau meetings, tracking fee schedule updates, and system update verifications. 2. FAHCA will reprocess all fee-for-service claims identified in the audit as paying an incorrect rate. When the reproces sing occurs, the FMMIS will adjust the claims, and the Federal Share reduction will be automatically reported on the CMS-64. Report No. 2020-170 Page 76 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-034 CFDA Number 93.775, 93.777, and 93.778 Program Title Medicaid Cluster Compliance Requirement Allowable Costs/Cost Principles State Entity Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1805FL5MAP 2018 and 1905FL5MAP 2019 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Significant Deficiency Prior Year Finding Report No. 2019-186, Finding No. 2018-029 Finding The FAHCA did not adequately ensure that the service organization's internal controls related to the invoicing, colle cting, and reporting of drug rebates were operating effectively. Criteria 2 CFR 200.303 and 45 CFR 75.303 - Internal controls - The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective inter nal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Fede ral statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Condition The FAHCA contracted with a service organization to invoice and collect rebates from, and resolve related disputes with, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and to provide required utilization data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Each quarter, the FAHCA provided the service organization, from the Florida Medicaid Management Information System, pharmacy and medical claims data for drug costs paid during the quarter. The claims data included both Medicaid fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care claims. The service organization merged the claims data with rebate rates provided by the CMS and the State's Supplemental/Preferred Drug List vendor to calculate the amount of drug rebates to be invoiced to pharmaceutical manufa cturers. Rebate collections for the 2018-19 fiscal year totaled approximately $1.9 billion and approximately 2.6 million prescriptions were associated with the invoiced rebates per month. The contract, effective February 1, 2014, specified that the FAHCA may conduct, or have conducted, performance reviews, compliance reviews, or both, of the service organization's procedures, computer system, and accounting records. Effective February 2018, the FAHCA amended the contract to require the service organization to provide the FAHCA with a System and Organization Controls (SOC 1) report prepared in accordance with applicable attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A subsequent contract amendm ent required the service organization to provide a SOC 1 Type 1 report on May 31, 2019, and a SOC 1 Type 2 report for the fiscal years thereafter. While the FAHCA tracked and reviewed contractually required reports and scorecards prepared by the service organization that indicated compliance with contractual requirements, and obtained t he SOC 1 Type 1 report which evaluated the design of the service organization's inter nal controls related to the invoicing, collecting, and reporting of drug rebat es, the FAHCA did not adequately evaluate the operating effectiveness of the service organization's internal controls, either internally or by obtaining a SOC 1 Type 2 report. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 77 Cause According to FAHCA management, the FA HCA amended the contract with the service organization to require the service organization to provide SOC 1 reports; however, due to the timing of the amend ment, a SOC 1 Type 2 report could not be provided for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Effect Absent an evaluation of the operating effe ctiveness of the service organization's internal controls for the invoicing, colle ction, and reporting of drug rebates, the FAHCA has reduced assur ance that drug rebate invoices are accurate. Recommendation We recommend that the FAHCA ensure t hat the service organization's internal controls related to the invoicing, colle cting, and reporting of drug rebates are appropriately designed and operating effect ively by obtaining and reviewing a SOC 1 Type 2 report. State Entity Response The contract between FAHCA and the service organization has been amended. The amendment required the service organization to obtain an SSAE-18 Audit Report to ensure that the service organi zation internal controls related to invoicing, collecting, and reporting of dr ug rebates are appropriately designed and operating effectively. The service organization submitted an SSAE-18 Audit Report to FAHCA on May 31, 2019, pertain ing to the SOC1, Type 1 audit which reported on the design of the vendor's internal controls. The service organization is also requi red to submit an SSAE-18 Audit Report by August 15, 2020 pertaining to the SOC 1 Ty pe 2 audit that will cover the operating effectiveness of the vendor's controls.

Criteria 42 CFR Part 456.431 - Continued stay review required Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, Medicaid payments for ICF services totaled $299,113,570 and related to 2,519 ICF-IID beneficiaries. Federal regulations specify that a continued stay review must be completed every 6 months to determine whether the beneficiary's conti nued stay in the ICF-IID facility is needed. The FAPD is responsible for conducting continued stay reviews for all residents of public and private ICF-IID facilities and ensuring that resident utilization review plans provide for a revi ew of each beneficiary's continued stay in the ICF at least every 6 months. We examined FAPD continued stay review records related to 60 ICF-IID beneficiaries to determine whether the review s were timely completed. We noted that FAPD records did not evidence the conduct of a required continued stay review for 12 ICF-IID beneficiaries in accordance with the time frame specified by Federal regulations. Cause FAPD management indicated that docum entation evidencing conduct of the required continued stay reviews could not be located due to employee turnover. Effect Absent documentation of completed co ntinued stay reviews, the FAPD cannot demonstrate that continued stay determi nations for ICF-IID beneficiaries are completed within the time frame specified by Federal regulations or that a beneficiary's continued stay in an ICF-IID facility is needed. Recommendation We again recommend that FAPD management take steps, including implementing adequate record retention controls, to ensure that continued stay reviews of ICF-IID beneficiaries ar e timely completed and appropriately documented in accordance with Federal regulations. State Entity Response The Agency for Persons with Disa bilities concurs with this finding. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 79 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-036 CFDA Number 93.775, 93.777, and 93.778 Program Title Medicaid Cluster Compliance Requirement Special Tests and Provisions - Utiliza tion Control and Program Integrity State Entity Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1805FL5MAP 2018 and 1905FL5MAP 2019 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency Finding The FAHCA did not ensure that all exte rnal quality review activities were performed in accordance with Federal requirements. Criteria 42 CFR 438.358(b) - Activities related to external quality review - For each managed care organization (MCO), prepaid inpatient health plan (PIHP), or prepaid ambulatory health plan (PAHP), the State or an external quality review organization (EQRO) must perform external quality review (EQR) activities, including a validation of performance improvement projects (PIPs) that were underway during the preceding 12 months; a validation of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP performance measures during the preceding 12 months; and a review, conducted within the previous 3-year period, to determine the MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's compliance with Federal standards and quality assessment and performance improvement requirements. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FAHCA contracted with an EQRO to perform certain EQR activities for FAHCA Medicaid managed care programs, in addition to the EQR activities conducted by the FAHCA. The EQR activities the EQRO was to perform included a validation of PIPs and applicable performance measures. As part of our audit, we exami ned records related to the EQR activities conducted by the FAHCA and the EQRO during the 2018-19 fiscal year. Our examination disclosed that the FAHCA did not conduct a 3-year compliance review for the period December 2015 through December 2018. Cause According to FAHCA management, to fac ilitate the completion of the 3-year compliance review, a standardized compliance review tool had been developed to allow multiple FAHCA Bureaus to link information captured through FAHCA monitoring activities to the Federal standards, including an established threshold to determine health plan compliance; however, the compliance review tool had not been incorporated into current FAHCA monitoring practices. Effect Absent a 3-year review of complia nce with Federal standards and quality assessment and performance improvement requirements, the FAHCA cannot demonstrate compliance with Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that the FAHCA incorporate the standardized compliance review tool into FAHCA monitoring activities and take actions to ensure that the 3-year compliance review and all EQR activities performed by the EQRO are timely conducted in accordance with Federal regulations. State Entity Response FAHCA, in conjunction with its EQRO, has developed a comprehensive compliance review tool that integrates both federal and state monitoring requirements. The tool identifies the FAHCA unit that is responsible for the monitoring activity and the frequency with which monitoring must occur for every federal EQRO regulation and all state contract requirements. FAHCA is in year two of the three-year federally required review cycle. At this time, FAHCA has completed approximately 80% percent of the requirements for the federally required review and has scheduled all remaining review activities to be completed by the end of the 3-year cycle. Report No. 2020-170 Page 80 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-037 CFDA Number 93.775, 93.777, and 93.778 Program Title Medicaid Cluster Compliance Requirement Special Tests and Provisions - Inpatient Hospital and Long-Term Care Facility Audits State Entity Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1805FL5MAP 2018 and 1905FL5MAP 2019 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding Type Noncompliance Finding The FAHCA did not ensure that inpatient hospital cost reports were periodically audited in accordance with the approved Florida Medicaid State Plan and Federal regulations. Criteria 42 CFR 447.253(g) - Audit requirements - The Medicaid agency must provide for periodic audits of the financial and statis tical records of participating providers. 42 CFR 447.253(i) - Rates paid - The Medicaid agency must pay for inpatient hospital and long-term care services using rates determined in accordance with methods and standards specified in an approved State plan. Florida Medicaid State Plan - Florida Titl e XIX Inpatient Hospital Reimbursement Plan, Version XLV, Effective July 1, 2018 - Cost Finding and Cost Reporting - Each hospital participating in the Florida Medicaid program shall file a cost report no later than 5 calendar months after the close of its cost reporting year. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FAHCA reimbursed inpatient hospitals participating in the Medicaid program, ex cept for State mental health hospitals, utilizing the Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) payment method. The DRG is a classification system that reflects clinica lly similar groupings of services that can be expected to consume similar amounts of hospital resources and is intended to provide for payment in full, without the need for subsequent cost settlement. Although inpatient hospitals reimbursed using the DRG payment method are not subject to subsequent cost settlement, cost reports continue to be required to determine inpatient cost-to-charge ratios that are used to calculate outlier payments and evaluate payment levels within the Medicaid program. As part of our audit, we requested that FAHCA management provide audited cost reports used to calculate payment rates fo r inpatient hospitals participating in the Medicaid program. Our inquiry disclosed that the FAHCA did not obtain audited cost reports or perform periodic audits of inpatient hospital cost reports, as required by the approved Medicaid State Plan and Federal regulations. Cause According to FAHCA management, with the implementation of the DRG payment method, the FAHCA no longer obtained or used cost report data to calculate inpatient hospitals payment rates because the DRG payment method classifies inpatient stays and determines the rates based on a combination of the classification of services and the hospital where the services were rendered. Effect Absent evaluation of audited inpatient hos pital cost reports, the FAHCA cannot demonstrate the reasonableness of re imbursements using the DRG payment method. Additionally, the FAHCA cannot demonstrate compliance with the approved Medicaid State Plan and Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that FAHCA management ta ke steps to ensure that inpatient hospital cost reports are obtained and audi ted in accordance with the approved Medicaid State Plan to help evaluate payment levels within the Medicaid program and ensure compliance with Federal regulations. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 81 State Entity Response FAHCA agrees that the State Plan could be updated to provide the clarity that the cost report audits only apply to the hosp itals reimbursed on a cost basis. The State Plan effective July 1, 2019 has be en updated to reflect that only the state mental health hospitals, which are paid on a cost basis, must submit cost reports for audits. Report No. 2020-170 Page 82 March 2020 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Finding Number 2019-038 CFDA Number 93.775, 93.777, and 93.778 Program Title Medicaid Cluster Compliance Requirement Special Tests and Provisions - Provider Eligibility (Screening and Enrollment) State Entity Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA) Federal Grant/Contract Number and Grant Year 1805FL5MAP 2018 and 1905FL5MAP 2019 Statistically Valid Sample No Finding Type Noncompliance Questioned Costs - $1,074,169.66 (CFDA No. 93.778 - Federal $656,141.08; 1805FL5MAP $154,072.59 and 1905FL5MAP $502,068.49) Finding FAHCA records did not evidence that site visits of Medicaid Program providers were conducted in accordance with Federal regulations. Criteria 42 CFR 455.432(a) - Site visits - The State Medicaid agency must conduct pre-enrollment and post-enrollment site visits of providers who are designated as \"moderate\" or \"high\" categorical risks to the Medicaid Program. The purpose of the site visit is to verify that the in formation submitted to the State Medicaid agency is accurate and to determine compliance with Federal and State enrollment requirements. 42 CFR 455.414 - Revalidation of enrollment - The State Medicaid agency must revalidate the enrollment of all providers regardless of provider type at least every 5 years. 42 CFR 455.450(b)(2) - Screening for provides designated as moderate categorical risk - When the State Medicaid agency designates a provider as a \"moderate\" categorical risk, a State Medicaid agency must conduct on-site visits in accordance with Federal enrollment requirements. Condition We examined FAHCA records for 40 providers enrolled in the Medicaid Program, including 17 designated as a \"high\" or \"moderate\" categorical risk, who received payments during the 2018-19 fiscal year to determine whether the providers met Program eligibility requirements. Our examination disclosed that, for 4 of the 17 providers, FAHCA records did not ev idence that the FAHCA conducted a pre-enrollment site visit. In addition, fo r 2 of the 17 providers, the FAHCA could not provide documentation evidencing that a revalidation enrollment site visit was conducted at least every 5 years. Ou r review of the payments made to the 6 providers during the 2018-19 fiscal y ear disclosed that the FAHCA paid the providers $656,141.08 in Federal funds. Cause FAHCA management indicated that the providers had hospital privileges and therefore, site visits were not r equired. In addition, FAHCA management indicated that the revalidation site visits were not conducted due to established procedures not being followed. Effect Absent site visits, the FAHCA cannot verify that the information submitted by providers is accurate or demonstrate that the providers are eligible for enrollment, or continued enrollment, in the Medicaid Program in accordance with Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that the FAHCA ensure t hat providers seeking enrollment in the Florida Medicaid Program receive site visits in accordance with Federal regulations. In addition, we recommend that the FAHCA revalidate the enrollment of providers at least every 5 years in accordance with Federal regulations. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 83 State Entity Response FAHCA will initiate an internal workgrou p to review and compare FAHCA's site visit rules with the applicable federal re gulations. Any deviations will be analyzed and, where appropriate, the Florida Medicaid policy will be modified. FAHCA will schedule site visits for the providers identified in the audit.

Criteria The United States Social Security Ad ministration (SSA) Program Operations Manual DI 39506.230 requires the FDOH to submit an SSA-4514 form quarterly to the SSA. Condition The SSA-4514 form is used to report t he number of hours worked and the number of equivalent full-time positions for employ ees engaged in DI/SSI Cluster activities by staffing category and employment status (i.e., full-time, part-time, or temporary). The report should reflect al l hours worked by employees engaged in DI/SSI Cluster activities during the reporting period. Our examination of the SSA-4514 form submitted by the FDOH to the SSA for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, disclosed that the FDOH did not accurately report the number of hours worked or the number of equivalent full-time positions. Specifically, the FDOH understated the number of hours worked for on-duty, holiday and leav e, and overtime by 108,556.50, 26,172.50 and 7,636.25 hours, respectively. A dditionally, the FDOH the number of equivalent full-time positions for full-time, part-time, and temporary employees by 246.67, 0.18, and 29.65 positions, respectively. Cause FDOH management indicated that an unidentified system error caused the report to be misstated. Additionally, FDOH review processes were insufficient to detect and correct the reporting errors. Effect The SSA-4514 form submitted by the FDOH to the SSA did not include accurate data. Recommendation We recommend that the FDOH take approp riate steps, including identifying the system error and enhancing review processes, to ensure amounts reported on SSA-4514 forms submitted to the SSA are accurate. State Entity Response Florida Division of Disability Determinations' (DDD) Finance and Accounting (F&A) in conjunction with DDD's Bureau of Information Services has identified the error as a general network error that occurred while downloading the People First data. This error caused only a portion of the timesheet data to be downloaded and processed for this report. DDD's Bureau of Information Services is adding an automated check that will verify the integrity of the data that has been downloaded. F&A is also implementing an internal monitoring tool that will compare t he previous report submission with the current report to identify abnormal changes in hours being reported, from quarter to quarter. This monitoring tool will be reviewed by management in conjunction with the United States Social Security Administration (SSA) - 4514 form prior to submissi on to SSA. The next SSA-4514 submission is due by April 30, 2020.

Criteria 2 CFR 200.331 - Requirements for pass-through entities - All pass-through entities must evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring. All pass-through entities must monitor the activities of the subrec ipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes , in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward, and that subaward performance goals are achieved. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEM was responsible for 1,553 active large projects, with obligations totaling $1,831,373,057, related to 17 declared disasters. Our audit disclosed that t he FDEM had not evaluated subrecipient risk of noncompliance with Federal statut es, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. Additionally, our audit found that, although the FDEM conducted subrecipient monitoring, the FDEM had not developed subrecipient monitoring plans based on an assessed risk of subrecipient noncompliance. Subsequently, in August 2019, the FDEM finalized and implemented policies and procedures for evaluating subrecipient risk of noncompliance and developing monitoring plans based on the assessments. Cause As of June 2019, the FDEM had not established policies and procedures for conducting subrecipient risk assessments and developing monitoring plans based on an assessed risk of s ubrecipient noncompliance. Effect Absent evaluating the risk of subrecipie nt noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward, and developing appropriate subrecipient monitoring plans based on a risk assessment, the FDEM cannot demonstrate that the monitoring performed appropriately addressed the highest risk subrecipients or adequately evaluated subrecipient compliance with financial and programmatic grant agreem ent requirements. Additionally, the FDEM cannot demonstrate compliance with applicable Federal regulations. Recommendation We recommend that FDEM management assess subrecipient risk of noncompliance for all subrecipients and develop monitoring plans based on the assessed level of risk in accordance with established FDEM policies and procedures and applicable Federal regulations. Report No. 2020-170 Page 88 March 2020 State Entity Response FDEM developed a Subrecipient Compliance Program SOP, created a Compliance Unit to perform these duties, and began subrecipient risk assessments during the audit period. As recognized in the Condition above, the SOP was finalized and implemented in August 2019. All subrecipients for all open Public Assitance grants have been assessed for risk of non-compliance and have been assigned a risk rating based on the procedures outlined in the SOP. These risk rating correspond to monitoring plans that are being implemented.

Criteria 2 CFR 200.331 - Requirements for pass-through entities - All pass-through entities must verify that every subrecipient is audited as required by Subpart F - Audit Requirements when it is expected that the s ubrecipient's Federal awards expended during the respective fiscal year equaled or exceeded the threshold set forth in 2 CFR 200.501 - Audit requirements . The pass-through entity's monitoring of the subrecipient must include following up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies pertaining to the Federal award detected through audits. The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings pertaining to the Federal award in accordance with 2 CFR 200.521 - Management decision . Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDEM provided $652,957,092 in Disaster Grants funds to 909 subrecipients. Our inquiries of FDEM management disclosed that the FDEM did not perform proce dures to verify that all applicable subrecipients were audited as required by 2 CFR 200.501. As a result, the FDEM could not demonstrate that all required audits were obtained and reports reviewed to ensure that subrecipients took timely and appropriate action on all applicable deficiencies noted in the audits or whether the FDEM issued management decisions for applicable audit findings. Subsequently, in August 2019, the FDEM finalized and implemented policies and procedures for obtaining and reviewing subrecipient audits from all applicable subrecipients. Cause As of June 2019, the FDEM had not established policies and procedures for obtaining and reviewing audit reports from all applicable subrecipients. Effect Absent verification that all applicable subrecipients were audited, the FDEM may not obtain the required audit reports to verify that all subrecipients complied with applicable Federal laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts and grant agreements. In addition, the FDEM may not ensure that any deficiencies noted during audit were appropriately followed up on or issue required management decisions. Recommendation We recommend that FDEM management obtain and review audit reports from all applicable subrecipients in accordance with established FDEM policies and procedures and applicable Federal regulations. State Entity Response During the audit period, FDEM determined the population of subrecipients with Federal Single Audits needing reviews and began obtaining and reviewing reports. As recognized in the Conditi on above, the Subrecipient Compliance Program SOP was finalized and implemented in August 2019. FDEM has obtained and reviewed all audit reports required to be submitted by law, regulation, and policy. Management letters and subsequent follow up is completed as needed.

Criteria 34 CFR 668.22 - Treatment of Title IV funds When a Student Withdraws (a)(1) When a recipient of Title IV grant or loan assistance withdraws from an institution during a payment period or peri od of enrollment in which the recipient began attendance, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV grant or loan assistance the student earned as of the student's withdrawal date. (j)(1) For a student who begins attendance , an institution must return the amount of unearned Title IV funds as soon as po ssible, but no later than 45 days after the date of the institution's determinat ion that the student withdrew. Condition From the population of 546 students who withdrew from classes and received $1,288,815 in Pell and Direct Loan funds during the Spring 2019 Term, we examined DSC records to determine whether DSC accurately and timely calculated the funds earned by the students and timely returned any unearned funds to the USED. Our examination disclosed that DSC did not include book voucher funds as institutional charge s when calculating the student's earned Title IV funds and, consequently, unders tated the amount of unearned funds due to the USED. Subsequent to our audit inquiry, DSC reviewed the records for all students who withdrew from classes and received Pell and Direct Loan funds during the Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and Summer 2019 Terms and identified, for 321 students, $14,927 in Pell and $26,609 in Direct Loan unearned funds not previously identified or returned to the USED. Cause According to DSC management, an unkn own coding issue in the PeopleSoft Campus Solutions module that occurred prior to the start of the Fall 2018 Term impacted the calculation of student's earn ed financial aid by excluding Title IV book voucher funds from institutional charges. Effect Absent the accurate calculation of Title IV grant or loan funds earned by students at their withdrawal dates, unearned funds were not accurately determined or timely returned to the USED. Recommendation DSC should work with the software vendor to address the coding issue in the PeopleSoft Campus Solutions module and ensure that unearned Title IV grant and loan funds for students who withdraw from DSC are accurately calculated and timely returned. State Entity Response DSC identified there was an issue in mid-September 2019 and subsequently traced it back to the coding in People Soft Campus Solutions not reading the correct information beginning June 2018. S hortly after it was identified, DSC not onl y reached out to the vendor, but also updated the codin g to ensure the Report No. 2020-170 Page 92 March 2020 students who were issued book vouchers and withdrew had accurate charges picked up. Additionally, DSC conducted an analysis of all students during the period of review and returned the additional Pell and Direct Loan funds back to their respective programs via COD on 12/9/19 and 11/20/19, respectively. Moving forward the College will continue to monitor unearned funds sent to the USED to ensure all qualifying funds are returned in a timely manner. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 93 ADDITIONAL MATTERS Our audit of the State of Florida's basic financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, disclosed additional matters that we communicated in the Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Additional matters are issues that, in the auditor's opinion, should be reported, but which are not categorized as a significant deficiency or material weakness. Report No. 2020-170 Page 94 March 2020 ADDITIONAL MATTER UNAVAILABLE REVENUE Finding Number AM 2019-01 Opinion Unit Aggregate Remaining Fund Information Financial Statements Account Titles Fines, forfeits, settlements and judgments; Unavailable revenue; and Receivables, net SW Fund Number 203400 State Agency Florida Department of Valid Sample N/A Finding The FDFS incorrectly recognized tobacco settlement amounts owed to the State as revenues prior to the amounts becoming available. Additionally, the FDFS did not record net receivables and unavailable revenue for all tobacco settlement amounts. Criteria Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification Section N50.126 specifies that revenues should be recogni zed in the accounting period when the revenues become available and measurable . The FDFS, Statewide Financial Reporting Section (SFRS), Statewide Financial Statement Guidance manual provides that the modified accrual me thod of accounting is to be used by governmental funds, revenues are considered available if collection occurs within 60 days of fiscal year end, and amounts are considered receivable as soon as an enforceable legal claim is obtained. Am ounts not considered available are to be recorded to a receivable and deferred inflows as unavailable revenue. Condition Section 17.41, Florida Statutes, estab lished the Tobacco Settlement Clearing Trust Fund to receive payments pursuant to the settlement of State of Florida v. American Tobacco Co., No. 95-1466AH (Fla. 15th Cir. Ct. 1996) . During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDFS incorrectl y recorded the principal amount owed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R.J. Rey nolds), but not collected within 60 days of fiscal year end, as revenue - Fines, forfeits, settlements and judgements, instead of a deferred inflow, Unavailable re venue. Additionally, although the FDFS recorded a receivable for the principal amount, the FDFS did not record an asset, Receivables, net, or a deferred inflow, Unavailable revenue, for the interest R.J. Reynolds owed the FDFS. According to FDFS management, the FDFS had not received the principal payment from R.J. Reynolds as of November 4, 2019. Cause According to FDFS management, the receivable and revenue were recorded within 60 days of fiscal year end as part of year-end closing; however, no subsequent evaluation of the appropr iateness of the amounts recorded was performed. Additionally, the FDFS inadvertently did not record the interest portion of the receivable. Effect Prior to audit adjustment, Fines, forfeits, settlements and judgments were overstated by $130,016,297, Unav ailable revenue was understated by $132,769,405, and Receivables, net was understated by $2,753,108. Recommendation We recommend that FDFS management enhance year-end closing procedures to ensure that only amounts received within 60 days of fiscal year end are recorded as revenues. Additionally, we recommend that FDFS management ensure that all receivables, including interest, are properly recorded. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 95 State Agency Response The Office of Finance and Budget concurs with the Auditor General's finding. OFB Reconciliation and Reporting unit has reviewed and updated the year end checklist to include: Establishing receivables for the outstanding amounts owed by the tobacco companies Reviewing receivables at 09/30 and up to the completion of the CAFR to reclass as needed. OFB Reconciliation and Reporting unit has also reviewed and updated procedure 2.8.01 Year End Financial Statements Preparation to include: Review of receivables at 09/30 to determine if any need to be reclassed. Estimated Corrective Action Date 1/7/2020 Agency Contact and Telephone Number Alexandra Weimorts, Bureau Chief, 850/413-2092 Report No. 2020-170 Page 96 March 2020 ADDITIONAL MATTER PROPERTY DISPOSITION GAIN (LOSS) AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS Finding Number AM 2019-02 Opinion Unit Transportation Fund (Proprietary) Financial Statements Account Titles Property disposition gain (loss) and Capital contributions SW Fund Number 505501 State Agency Florida Department of Transportation 550000-80-9-000001 GL Codes $180,109,458 Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding The FDOT overstated Property dispositi on gain (loss) and Capital contributions amounts. Criteria Governmental Accounting Standards B oard Codification Section 2200.191 specifies that the reassignment of capital assets from governmental activities to an enterprise fund is to be reported as a capi tal contribution. In the reverse situation in which capital assets are reassigned from an enterprise fund to governmental activities, the disposal of the capital asse ts is to be reported by the enterprise fund as a nonoperating expense. The Florida Department of Financial Services (FDFS) FLAIR Procedures Manual requires governmental assets purchased wi th general capital asset funds to be accounted for in Governmental Activi ties. The FDFS, Statewide Financial Reporting Section, Statewide Financial Statements Guidance manual specifies that the movement of capital assets between Governmental Activities and proprietary funds are to be accounted for as transfers in general ledger codes 652XX and 752XX. Condition Information related to the FDOT's SunRail fund is reported as part of the State's Transportation Fund (Proprietary). In accordance with FDFS procedures, to account for changes in SunRail fund capital assets during the 2018-19 fiscal year, the FDOT recorded a property transfer in to Governmental Activities and a Property disposition loss to the SunRa il fund totaling $180,109,458. Subsequent to accounting for current year Capital contributions, the FDOT correctly recorded a property transfer out to Government al Activities totaling $244,752,020. However, instead of eliminating the S unRail fund Property disposition loss and only recording current year Capital cont ributions totaling $64,642,562, the FDOT incorrectly recorded to Capital contribu tions the June 30, 2019, capital asset balance totaling $244,752,020. Cause In response to our audit inquiry, FDOT management indicated that an oversight resulted in incorrect entries being recorded that overstated the Property disposition gain (loss) and Capital contributions accounts. Effect Prior to audit adjustment, the Property disposition gain (loss) and Capital contributions accounts were overstated by $180,109,458. Recommendation We recommend that FDOT management enhance review procedures to ensure that entries to record capital assets are appropriate and to promote the timely detection and correction of financial statement reporting errors. State Agency Response The Department concurs with the finding. Upon discovery of the issue, the Department has completed training for the Property Accountants on the proper accounting entries for transfers between proprietary and governmental funds. In addition, we have updated our year-end processes to include a management review of such entries to ensure accurate financial reporting. Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 97 Estimated Corrective Action Date 07/31/2020 Agency Contact and Telephone Number Jason Adank, 850-414-4864 Report No. 2020-170 Page 98 March 2020 ADDITIONAL MATTER CAPITAL ASSETS , NET Finding Number AM 2019-03 Opinion Unit Governmental Activities Financial Statements Account Titles Net position - beginning, as restated; Human services, expenses; and Capital assets, net SW Fund Number 800000 State Agency Florida Department of Statistically Valid Sample N/A Finding The FDOH did not properly account for all construction work in progress and recorded incorrect amounts for construction work in progress to Capital assets, net and Human services, expenses for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscal years. Criteria Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification Section 2250.123 specifies that the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements should be accounted for and reported as a prior-period adjustment and excluded from the change in net posi tion section of the government-wide statement of activities. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Memorandum No. 05 (2011-12), Statewide Financial Statements Capital Asset Guidance and Rules for Tangible Personal Property , states that construction work in progre ss is to reflect the economic construction activity status of buildings and other structures, infrastructure, additions, alterations, reconstruction, and installation, which are substantially incomplete. CFO Procedures for Government-Wide Financial Statements provide that amounts recorded to Capital assets, net ar e used to determine the Net investments in capital assets amount. FDOH policies and procedures, Preparation of Financial Statements , specify that the Office of Budget and Revenue Management (OBRM) is to prepare, based on a construction report provided by the Bureau of General Services (BGS), a schedule of construction work in progre ss amounts for the fiscal year, including the life-to-date (LTD) expenditures for each project. The OBRM is to provide the schedule to the Bureau of Finance and Accounting (BFA) for use in determining and recording the fiscal year-end amounts for construction work in progress and current expenditures. Condition During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the OBRM did not provide and the BFA did not request LTD construction work in progress expenditure amounts. Instead, year-to-date (YTD) expenditure amounts totaling $9,711,988 were provided and used to record construction work in progress and current expenditure amounts. Subsequent to our audit inquiry, BFA management obtained a corrected 2018-19 fiscal year construction work in progress schedule from the OBRM that showed LTD expenditure amounts totaling $53,8 68,050. During the 2017-18 fiscal year, although the OBRM provided the BFA LTD construction work in progress expenditure amounts totaling $48,956,470, BFA staff used YTD expenditure amounts totaling $7,577,138 to record construction work in progress and current expenditure amounts. Cause According to FDOH management, for the 2018-19 fiscal year, the BGS Design and Construction Section Budget Manager was responsible for confirming the accuracy of construction work in pr ogress amounts prepared by the BGS and the OBRM and the BFA had not established a pr ocess to ensure amounts provided by the BGS and used to record construction work in pro gress and current Report No. 2020-170 March 2020 Page 99 expenditures were accurate. Additionally, FDOH management indicated that, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, staff turnover and inadequate oversight resulted in BFA staff using YTD instead of LTD amounts. Effect Prior to audit adjustment, the Governmental Activities, Human services, expenses and Capital assets, net accounts were understated by $2,776,730 and $44,156,062, respectively, and the Net position - beginning, as restated account was understated by $41,379,332. Additiona lly, the Governmental Activities, Net investments in capital assets acco unt was understated by $44,156,062. Recommendation We recommend that FDOH management enhance controls to ensure that BGS, OBRM, and BFA staff adhere to established policies and procedures for accounting for construction work in pr ogress and current expenditure amounts. State Agency Response We concur. The Department of Health will be reviewing and updating procedures for the Preparation of Financial Statements and trai ning applicable staff to ensure that all are adhering to the established procedures. Additionally, the construction work in progress spreadsheet will be prepared by the Bureau of General Services and provided to the Bureau of Finance and Accounting and the Office of Budget and Revenue Management to ensure the same report is used consistently throughout the agency.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION ANDSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards has been prepared in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and presents the Federal awards expended by the State of Florida. The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (Public Law 104-156) and the Uniform Guidance in subpart F define Federal awards as Federal financial assistance and Federal cost-reimbursement contracts that non-Federal entities receive directly from Federal awarding agencies or indirectly from pass-through entities. Federal financial assistance is defined as assistance that non-Federal entities receive or administer in the form of grants, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, interest subsidies, insurance, food commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance. The following summary of the State of Florida 's significant accounting policies and related information is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and should be viewed as an integral part of theaccompanying schedule. Reporting Entity The reporting entity for the purposes of the accompanying schedule is the State of Florida primary government (i.e., legislative agencies, the Governor and Cabinet, departments and agencies, commissions, boards of the Executive Branch, and various offices relating to the Judicial Branch), the State Universities (SU), and the State Community Colleges and Florida Colleges (SCC) exclusive of any component units of the State Universities and Community Colleges and Florida Colleges. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance is a government-w ide compendium of individual Federal programs. A five- digit program identification number (CFDA No.) is assigned to each program included in the catalog. Those programs that have not been assigned a CFDA number by the Federal Government and those programs for which CFDA numbers could not be identified are entitled \"Other Federal Awards\" on the accompanying schedul e and listed as CFDA No. \"XX.UXX\". The \"U\" stands for unknown, while the following \"XX\" represents the sequential numbering of the Federal Awarding Agency. Unknown programs that are also research and developmen t programs are listed as CFDA No.\"XX.RD\". Federal Expenditures The column on the accompanying schedule captioned \"Federal Expenditures,\" includes amounts using different bases of accounting. The reporting entities also include expenditures related to transfers received from other State Agencies, State Universities, State Community Colleges, and Florida Colleges in this column. Amounts reported by State Agencies, State Universities, State Community Colleges, and Florida Colleges were determined in accordance with the accrual and modified accrual basis of accounting, with the exception of 7KH\u0003'HSDUWPHQW\u0003RI\u00030LOLWDU\\\u0003 $IIDLUV\u000f\u0003 Florida International University, Florida State University, and the University of Florida, which reported expenditures using the cash basis of accounting. Appropriate expenditures are recognized, as applicable, in accorda nce with either OMB Cost Principles or cost principles contained in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Aw ards, wherein certain types of ex penditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursements. Expenditures reported for the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Program (CFDA No. 17.225) and the Direct Loans Program (CFDA No. 84.268) are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Appropriate adjus tments have been made to the e xpenditures re ported on the accompanying sche dule to preclude reporting both the transfers of Federal awards between the various State Agencies, State Universities, State Community Colleges, and Florida Colleges, and the subsequent expenditures. Amounts Passed Through to Subrecipients Column The column on the accompanying schedule captioned \"Am ounts Passed T hrough to Subrecipients\" represents the amounts transferred by the State Agencies, State Universities, State Commu nity Colleges, and Florida Colleges to subrecipients that are not included in the State's Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards.

The Recovery Act's three main goals are to create and sav e jobs, jump-start economic activity and invest in long-term economic growth, and promote accountability and transparency in government spending. To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the Recovery Act, recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and Uniform Guidance must separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. ARRA funds reported during the 2018-2019 Fiscal Year are included within the accompanying schedule. Expenditures reported on the accompanying schedule for ARRA awards totaled $16,569,215. Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (CFDA No 97.036) After a Presidential-Declared disaster, FEMA provides a Public Assistance Grant to reimburse eligible costs associated with repai r, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged facilities. The Federal government reimburses in the form of cost-shared grants which requires state matching funds. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, $50,835,829 of approved eligible expenditures that were incurred in a prior year are included on the Schedule.

Consequently, the FAHCA paid an unknown number and amount of unallowable behavior analysis services c laims to providers of Medicaid services. Fully Corrected The FAHCA is continuing to engage in a number of activities to ensure that behavior analysis services are appropriately authorized and paid in accordance with the coverage policy and fee schedule. In addition to contracting with a new utilization management vendor, the FAHCA also implemented several system edits to enforce policy limits and has engaged in extensive monitoring of providers. In r egard to the amount of any unallowable claims, this i s an ongoing effort through the Bureau of Medicaid Program Integrity, which is pursuing overpayments from providers . The FAHCA has returned the federal matching portion for any amounts that have been recovered through our monitoring efforts to date . As such, we continue to believe that any unallowable funds paid during this time period have already, or are in the process of, being returned to the federal government, and the Agency will continue to do so, as more overpayments are collected. Shev aun Harris (Medicaid/Policy & 93.778 The FAHCA did not adequately ensure that the service organization's internal controls related to the invoicing, collectin g, and reporting of drug rebates were appropriately designed and operating effectively .

Many of t hese policies, procedures, and tasks were implemented prior to June 30, 2019. A module was added to the FDEM Recovery Bureau Grants Management system whereby a notification is sent to all subrecipients that they must submit a single audit or certify that th ey are not subject to the requirement. This is done for every subrecipient, every fiscal year. This module was added in August 2019, after the end of the audit period and therefor although in development as of June 30, 2019, was not fully implemented as of that date. In the period between the report date and August 2019, FDEM used a Recovery Single Audit Tracking Spreadsheet. This spreadsheet did not fully address the prior fiscal year audit requirements.

In addition, college staff will review School Transmission Detail for each submission and review all instances where reported details differ from expected results. These actions have been completed, and the issues that initially led to this finding have been resolved. In the course of the current audit, the auditors have identified instance s where the college accurately and timely reported enrollment status changes to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) that were not reflected in NSLDS records. We are working with NSC to resolve these discrepanc ies and prevent future occurrences. The college will develop and implement monitoring procedures to confirm the NSC accurately and timely reports enrollment statu s changes to the NSLDS.

MAYHEW SECRETARY State of Florida Management's Corrective Action Plan - Florida Agency for Health Care Administration For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 Finding Number: 2019-033 Planned Corrective Action: To ensure that future Me dicaid Fee Schedules are implemented into the Florida Medicaid Management Information System (FMMIS) correctly, the FAHCA has developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The CAP has two components: 1. FAHCA will document a standard process for tracking the annual Medicaid fee schedule updates. The new procedure guide will include detailed instruction and processes for cross bureau meetings , tracking fee schedule updates, and system update verifications. 2. FAHCA will reprocess a ll fee-for-service claims identified in the audit as paying an inco rrect rate. When the reproc essing occurs, the FMMIS will adjust the claims, and the Federal S hare reduction will be automatically reported on the CMS-64. Anticipated Completion Date: July 31, 2020 Responsible Contact Person: Carla Sims 850-412-4013 Finding Number: 2019-034 Planned Corrective Action: The contract between FAHCA and the service organization has been amended. The amendment required the service organization to obtain an SSAE-18 Audit Report to ensure that the service organization internal controls related to invoicing, collecting, and repo rting of drug rebates are appropriately designed and operating effectively. The service organization submitted an SSAE-18 Audit Report to FAHCA on May 31, 2019, pertaining to the SOC1, Type 1 audit which reported on the design of the vendor's internal controls. The service organization is also requ ired to submit an SSAE-18 Audit Report pertaining to the SOC 1 Type 2 audi t that shall cover the operating effectiveness of the vendor's controls by August 15, 2020. Anticipated Completion Date: August 15, 2020 Responsible Contact Person: Carla Sims 850-412-4013 Facebook.com/AHCAFlorida Youtube.com/AHCAFlorida Finding Number: 2019-036 Planned Corrective Action: FAHCA's monitoring of the managed care plans is both broad and deep. It includes regular measurement of standardized, nationally recognized measures of managed care performance, including Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Satisfaction (CAHPS), as well as regular review of dozens of plan submitted reports. FAHCA staff weekly reviews all complaints and issues submitted about the program and takes action if a plan is found to have violated its contract. Complaints raised by stakeholders and issues revealed in regular reporting also lead to targeted monitoring, which can take an array of forms (e.g., secret shopper calls to providers, onsite reviews, in depth records reviews). These activities lead to routine \"contract actions\" including liquidated damages, corrective action plans, and sanctions. This multi- faceted approach ensures that FAHCA fo cuses on both routine activities that ensure the program is operating effectively as well as reviewing and taking action on actual, emerging issues in the managed care environment. The monitoring requirements in the required EQRO three-year review are a subset of the overall FAHCA managed care compliance approach. FAHCA does not consider that these require ments alone constitute a sufficient managed care monitoring program. That said, FAHCA completed 11 of the 14 federal standards required for the 3-year review and has taken steps to ensure that, in the next 3-year cycle, all EQRO requirements will be met. FAHCA, in conjunction with its EQRO, has developed a comprehensive compliance review tool that integr ates both federal and state monitoring requirements. The tool identifies the FAHCA unit that is responsible for the monitoring activity and the frequency wi th which monitoring must occur for every federal EQRO regulation and all state contract requirements. FAHCA is in year two of the three-year federally required review cycle. At this time, FAHCA has completed approximately 80 % percent of the requirements for the federally required review and has scheduled all remaining review activities to be completed by the end of the 3-year cycle. Anticipated Completion Date: Complete Responsible Contact Person: Carla Sims 850-412-4013 Finding Number: 2019-037 Planned Corrective Action: FAHCA provides for the audit of hospital cost repo rts for providers that remain on a cost-based reimbursement methodology. Specifically, this applies to the state mental health hospitals. As such, we are in compliance with the guidance in relation to cost -based reimbursement provided in 42 CFR 447.202 which states, \"The Medicaid agency must assure appropriate audit of records if payment is based on cost s of services or on a fee plus cost of materials.\" FAHCA has transitioned to a prospectiv e payment system that no longer uses cost reports for the reimbursement of almost all hospital providers. We are not aware of federal intention or di rective for states to continue auditing cost reports if they are not used to establish reimbursement rates. In addition, a strict interpretation of this CF R is not consistent with the fact that CMS allows for states to rely on the Medicare audited cost reports even in cost-based reimbursement systems. 3 In addition, we do not believe 42 CFR 447.253(g) applies to auditing cost reports for hospital providers when those cost reports are not being used to set rates. 42 CFR 447.253(g) states \"the Medicaid agency must provide for periodic audits of the financial and st atistical records of participating providers.\" Florida does ensure there are reviews of hospital financial and statistical records, includ ing the review of hospital Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) reimbursement through the DSH audit and reviews of financial data through the Florida Hospital Uniform Reporting System. The outlier component of the inpatient hospital reimbursement accounts for an estimated 14% of the simulated pa yment. The Agency will explore ways to review or audit the financial and stat istical records of the components used in the outlier calculation. Also, FAHCA agrees that the State Pl an could be updated to provide the clarity that the cost report audits only apply to the hospitals reimbursed on a cost basis. The State Plan effective July 1, 2019 has been updated to reflect that only the state mental health hospit als, which are paid on a cost basis, must submit cost reports for audits. Anticipated Completion Date: September 30, 2020 Responsible Contact Person: Carla Sims 850-412-4013 Finding Number: 2019-038 Planned Corrective Action: FAHCA will initiate an internal workgr oup to review and compare FAHCA's site visit rules with the applicable federal regulations. Any deviations will be analyzed and, where appropriate, the Florida Medicaid policy will be modified. FAHCA will schedule site visits for the providers identified in the audit.

(KEPRO) to outsource the Utilization Review/Continued Stay Reviews (UR/CSR) function. One performance goal in the contract is to ensure 100% of the reviews are conducted every 6 months for beneficiaries of Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. KEPRO began reviewing records in June 2019 and assumed responsibility for the UR/CSR function in July 2019. KEPRO has an electronic system that tracks due dates for CSRs, certif ication and UR plans. In addition to the executed c ontract, FAPD continues to conduct monthly Medical Cas e Management conference calls (Statewide and Regional) for FAPD staff (including supervisors).

Also discussed during our conference calls are upcoming reviews and any potential barriers of the CSRs that are coming due and to account for all the CSRs t hat should have been completed. FAPD continues to focus on ens uring that all reviews are completed timely. Additiona lly, FAPD continues to be responsible for eligibility and admissions (initial paperwork and notification to KEPRO of the admission).

CCFP is also working with OGC on comprehensive revisions to the Permanent Contract and Attachments which will be given to all 2,200+ subrecipients for execution on or before June 30, 2020. As part of the annual renewal process, all subrecipients are notified of the applicable 2 CFR Part 200 requirements through a question on the renewal application, through financial management training, and through an Audit Report Certification Form sent to all CCFP contractors from the Florida Department of Health Federal Compliance and Audit Management section. Anticipated Completion Date: June 30, 2020 Responsible Contact Person: Renee Kane, Chief, Bureau of Childcare Food Programs Brenda Lane, Policy and Program Development Administrator Florida Department of Health Office of the State Surgeon General 4052 Bald Cypress Way, Action: The Florida Department of Health (FDOH) agrees that out of 2,499 records, seven providers (five sub-recipients from the Child and Adult Care Food Program and two from HIV Care Formula Grant) were omitted from the Export_FLAIR_Master_File that FDOH uses to generate certification forms to sub-recipient providers. The \"glitch\" was discovered, and the program codes were updated by the Florida Accounting Information Resource system team November 11, 2019. FDOH will perform a review of the Master File program codes each year prior to running the report to further reduce the potential for a similar incident. In addition, FDOH will modify the single audit report review workflow beginning July 1, 2020 to prioritize management decision letters to those providers with audit findings at the start of each audit reporting cycle, rather than on a first in/first out method. This will allow FDOH to meet the additional workload requirements under 2 CFR 200, while at the same time increasing the compliance level for the timeline prescribed under 2 CFR 200.521 - Management decision. Anticipated Completion Date: September 30, 2020 Responsible Contact Person: K\u00e9nol Saint-Fort, Federal Compliance & Audit Management Section Finding Number: 2019-026 Planned Corrective Action: Moving forward, when fiscal codes (Other Cost Accumulators (OCA) and Grant Number) for a new grant year are updated, all monthly expenditures will be audited internally by the Immunization Section's Grant Analyst and the Bureau of Epidemiology's Grant Manager to ensure that each payment is charged to the appropriate grant OCA for the time period indicated on the invoices. Any necessary corrections will be made as soon as they are identified and verified prior to the submission of the Federal Financial Report. Additionally, the program office will communicate with county health departments and other partners, to review invoices to ensure they were processed with the correct coding, and reflect the correct period of performance. These new processes will ensure the program complies with the project period integrity for each year of the grant.

To initiate the process of gaining PEAR access: 1. The VFC Unit's Manager (VFC Manager) or VFC Assistant Manager will provide the site visit reviewer with PEAR Access Request Form. 2. The reviewer will complete the form and return it to the VFC Manager or Assistant Manager. 3. The VFC Manager or Assistant Manager will sign the form. 4.
