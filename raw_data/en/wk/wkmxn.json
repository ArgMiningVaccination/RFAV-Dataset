Our mission is to help our patients accomplish these goals in a safe, natural, and drug-free approach to pain relief and prevention. We aim to educate our patients in a safe environment while offering them the necessary comprehensive care. Chiropractic care provides a safe, gentle hands-on approach to locating and correcting joint restrictions known as \"subluxations.\" These subluxations can get in the way of proper nerve communication resulting in pain and discomfort. Chiropractic care relieves these subluxations through what is called the \"adjustment,\" which is a gentle hand force technique supplied to the subluxated joint. At our office, we also incorporate additional therapies such as physiotherapy, soft-tissue massage techniques, rehabilitative exercises, and herbal and nutritional recommendations. We understand that patients have many choices in chiropractic care, so we created a concierge approach to care by offering customized wellness plans. By combining the latest technology with traditional techniques, we give our patients the best care. "}
