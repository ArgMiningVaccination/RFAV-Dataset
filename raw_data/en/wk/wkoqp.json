Some of these interactions can be life-threatening. [By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors) Herbal supplements are natural, so they must be safe, right? No, that's not true all the time. Herbal supplements can strongly affect the body. Some don't work well with prescription medicines. This is called a medicine interaction. Herbal supplements can interact with medicines used to treat heart and blood vessel problems, such as high blood pressure and heart failure. Some of these medicine interactions can be risky. Herbal supplements and prescription medicines About one-half of adults in the United States say they have used one or more supplements in the past 30 days. Almost 70% of older adults use them. But only about 25% of people who take herbal supplements tell their health care providers. And as many as 25% of people also take medicines ordered for them by their health care providers, also called prescription medicines. Yet many herbal supplements may interact with heart disease medicines. For instance, many herbal supplements that are used often interact with the blood thinner warfarin (Jantoven). That's why you need to talk with your health care provider before you take herbal supplements if you take prescription medicines. Your health care provider and pharmacist can help you stay away from unsafe interactions. Herbal supplements and drug interactions Many common herbal supplements interact with common heart medicines. This list covers only some interactions. Be sure to talk to your health care provider before you take any herbal supplements if you take prescription medicines.
