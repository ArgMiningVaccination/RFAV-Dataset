My main Doctor is Dr Jensen, but I have also seen Dr Shaw and the other female Dr for B12 shots. All the Doctors are helpful and nice. Dr Jensen really listens and ordered blood work and went over all the results with me, and got me going on a vitamin regimen that has helped me during my not so fun time of the month. I love that all in one place I can see my doctor, get a massage, bloodwork, and they have a small area with supplements and oils. They also have a great lady that does thermography in their location once a month. Don't forget the super helpful and friendly front desk ladies. - Aug 3, 2021 I had an awesome experience with doctor Shaw. I think diet and exercise can be the best medicine. When my body becomes unbalanced I like to start with a natural route and seek a natural practitioner. This medicine seems to work for my needs. There is a time and place for mainstream medicine as well! This is just what has worked for my needs over the years. She became a natural practitioner as she was seeking help within her own family's needs which ended up turning into a blessing for many of us. Dr.Shaw was a good listener. She was patient and understanding. Most importantly I saw results. If there is a concern and mainstream medicine doesn't seem to be able to address your concerns Dr. Shaw's office might be a great step to fulfill your bodies needs for health and wellness. - Feb 14, 2023 I have been to Cascade Medicine a couple times now, first for an initial appt and then a follow-up and review of lab work. The doctor I saw was very thorough in getting information and never made me feel rushed. She welcomed questions and did a great job of explaining everything. I'm not really able to yet review if I have had success in treating my symptoms because I just am starting on some new supplements now, but so far I am glad that I chose Cascade! The only reason I did 4/5 stars and not 5/5 is because of the price. It is so dang expensive to see a naturopath! I'm not saying Cascade is more expensive than other naturopaths, it is just frustrating that it costs soooo much and that many people who could benefit from their help are not able to see them because of the expensive cost. - Apr 6, 2023 My husband had very high blood pressure at one point but we knew a lot of BP medication is not the best thing for long term, over-all health. Dr. Shaw worked with him to find the safest med that would bring his BP down. His BP is normal now with no side effects from bad meds. I've seen Dr. Shaw for sinus infections and regular check-ups. She treats the whole person. Cascade Natural Medicine is a breath of fresh air in today's world of big business medicine! - Feb 13, 2023 Dr. Jensen really listens and takes into account my desires for my overall care. He's a WEALTH of knowledge and has helped me navigate my journey with my gut problems without me having to take a single medication. Solely through lifestyle changes and supplemental support I feel sooooo much better. This is not a place of 5 minute office appts at an urgent care medication mill, Cascade Natural Medicine is truly about HEALTHcare. I highly recommend! - Feb 14, 2023 This place is amazing! I have spent so much time and money going to doctors and specialist to find answers for chronic issues I've had for years, but no one could figure out the problem, until Dr. shaw. Not only was she so patient and understanding with me, but she knew exactly how to treat my issues. Her holistic approach is incredibly thorough and worked wonders for me. I have had a great experience with everyone in the office and would highly recommend them! - Feb 20, 2023 I was diagnosed with hashimotos and hypothyroidism after my 2nd baby and I was so sick. Dr Shaw was able to pinpoint all the areas my body was struggling and created a wellness regime that helped my body heal and recover. She also helped me maintain a healthy pregnancy and postpartum with my 3rd child. - Feb 13, 2023 AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! I am so excited I found someone who listens to me and cares about my health as much as I do or more! - Feb 13, 2023 Dr. Shaw is a wonderful naturopathic doctor who truly cares about you feeling your best. I always feel very welcome when I arrive and don't want to leave the rooms because I'm so relaxed. Often I walk out already feeling better than when I arrived or do within a short time! I also love that I can pop into the store when I need more supplements from trusted brands. - Jun 10, 2021 I started going to Cascade Natural Medicine in mid April seeing Dr. Shaw to get back to feeling 100% my initial intake was great spending time talking about my health goals and seeing what supplements i was missing which was affecting how i was currently feeling. She's been helping me so much I never realized I was lacking so much that was contributing my body to feeling so bad, the supplements she's recommended and I've been taking have been helping a lot. I was also concentrated on losing weight while going to my appointments and I've changed a lot of habits and listened to her regarding my weight loss journey and as of today I'm 15lbs down from the initial day I started going to see Dr.Shaw which is awesome. Can't forget her amazing staff Andrea, Alissa, and Jazmyn. I'm so happy that I found a naturopathic doctor that can help me get back to natural health without big pharma.
