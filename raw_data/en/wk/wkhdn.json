However, subsequent studies have shown that high intake of Vitamin C does not correspond to a lower rate of respiratory viral infections. Additionally, diets high in Vitamin C were found to be detrimental to a persons health. For example, ascorbic acid can react with [ iron ions](http://www.gfhnrc.ars.usda.gov/pubs/pub0911.htm) to produce hydroxy radicals, which leads to cellular damage. In addition, a condition called withdrawal [ scurvy](http://www.healthanswers.com/database/ami/converted/000355.html) is associated with megadoses of Vitamin C. This condition is observed with a high [ ascorbic acid](http://www.lgcy.com/users/h/health&wealth/c.html) diet, when the body begins to excrete the excess vitamin C at a common rate. When the intake of vitamin C is decreased, the excretion rate from before continues at the same rate, eliminating the lower dosage amount at a high rate. Therefore, people begin to exhibit signs of scurvy due to this phenomenon. Another side effect from megadoses of Vitamin C is the formation of [ kidney stones](http://pulsar.cs.wku.edu/~travibr/kidney.html) from the buildup of oxalic acid and uric acid. A final negative side effect is the experiencing of diarrhea and skin rashes, if the megadoses are taken suddenly in large amounts without allowing the body to adjust to the high concentrations by taking slowly increasing amounts. With the lack of evidence and detrimental effects we have seen because of high dosage, we conclude that no more than 60 mg of Vitamin C should be taken daily. "}
