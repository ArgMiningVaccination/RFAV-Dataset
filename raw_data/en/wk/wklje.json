The capitated, risk -based Managed Care Program was implemented under a Section 1915(b) Waiver which established a mandatory Managed Care Program, serving recipients in urban Clark County and Washoe County. The mandatory program became effective on January 1, 1996 and served eligible recipien ts in the programs that were then known as \"Aid to Families with Dependent Children /Aid to Dependent Children (AFDC/ADC)\" and related prog rams as well as the Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) and other child welfare programs. On April 1, 1997, the volu ntary Medicaid Managed Care Program was also implemented in Nevada. Subsequent to the close of the 1997 Nevada Legislature, the U.S. Cong ress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. Under the BBA, states are given the ability to implement managed care programs without a waiver. This generally simplified approval at the federal level. On October 1, 1998, Nevada's Managed Care Program w as approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) , which was formerly known as the Health Care Finan cing Administration (HCFA) as a state plan amendment. The State of Nevada Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP ) oversees the administration of all Medicaid Managed Care Organization s (MCOs ) in the state. Nevada Medicaid operates a Fee-for-Service (FFS) and a managed care reimbursement and service delivery system with which to provide covered medically necessary ser vices to its eligible population. MCO contracts are comprehensive risk contracts and are paid a risk -based capitated rate for each eligible, enrollee on a Per -Member, Per -Month (PMPM) basis. These capitated rates are certified to be actuarially sound. Ther e is also a formula for Stop Loss, when costs of inpatient care exceed a threshold during a specified time period ; Very Low Bi rth Weight Newborns (VLBW); and the Primary Care Physician (PCP) enhancements, according to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and as approved by CMS . The mandatory Managed Care Program is currently available to Medicaid and Nevada Check Up (NCU) recipients in urban Clark and Washoe counties. DHCFP may, at a future date, designate other geographical locations as mandatory managed care areas in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code ( NAC ) 695C.160. All MCOs mu st be in compliance with all applicable Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) , NAC , the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) , the United States Code (USC) , and the Social Security Act (the Act ) which assure program and operational compliance as well as assuring servi ces that are provided to Medicaid and NCU recipients enrolled in an MCO are done so with the same timeliness, amount, duration, and scope as those provided to FFS Medicaid and NCU recipients. Participating MCOs shall provide to enrolled Medicaid and NCU r ecipients a benefits pack age covering inpatient and outpatient hospital care, ambulatory care, physician services, a full range of preventive and primary health care services, and such other services as DHCFP determines to MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3600 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: INTRODUCTION January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3600 Page 2 be in the best interests of the S tate and eligible recipie nts to include in benefits package. The MCO is responsible for reimbursing claims of eligible enrollees for services covered under the contract or for each month a capitated payment is made. DHCFP will continue to provide, on a FFS basis, certain services that are not contained in the MCO contracts or the capitated benefits package. Currently, DHCFP contracts with four Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) as MCOs and one Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plan (PAHP) as the Dental Benefits Administrator (DBA) for the State of Nevada. Enrollment in an MCO is mandatory for the Family Medical Category (FMC) categories of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) (Section 1931) and CHAP (poverty level pregnant women, infants, and children) recipients when there i s more than one MCO option from which to choose in a geographic service area. Enrollment in an MCO is mandatory for all NCU recipients when there is at least two MCO option s in the recipient's geographic service area. The eligibility and aid code determina tion functions for Medicaid and NCU applicant s and eligible population s are the responsibility of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services (DWSS) . The enroll ment function is the responsibility of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). All Medicaid policies and requirements (such as prior authorization) are the same for NCU , with the exception of the certain areas where Medicaid and NCU policies d iffer as documented in the NCU Manual Chapter 1000.

The MCO is required to adhere to the MSM Chapter (s) 400 and 2500 for all SED and SMI referrals and determinations and must reimburse providers of these services pursuant to the referenced MSM Chapters. Such services include but are not limited to: case management; lab work; prescription drugs; acute in -patient; and, other ancillary medical and mental health services required by the plan of treatm ent. Title XIX Medicaid eligible recipients have the option of disenrolling from the MCO, if determined to be SED. Title XXI, NCU recipients must remain enrolled with the MCO who is responsible for on -going patient care. If a Title XIX eligible recipient e lects to disenroll from the MCO following a determination of SED, the disenrollment will commence the first day of the next admin istrative month and the services will then be reimbursed by FFS. Nevada Medicaid and Nevada Check Up recipients cannot opt ou t of managed care, where available, based on a determination of SMI. 3603.5 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTED COVERED SERVICES A. Out-of-Network Providers When it is necessary for enrollees to obtain services from out -of-network providers (e.g., the enroll ee needs to see a specialist for which the MCO has no such specialist in its network) the MCO must: 1. Coordinate with ou t-of-network providers with respect to payment; 2. Offer the opportunity to the out -of-network provider to become part of the network; and, MTL 03/22 DIVIS ION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 7 3. Negotiate a contract to determine the rate prior to services being rendered. B. Emergency Services The MCO must cover and pay for emergency services regardless of whether the provider who furnished the services has a contract with the MCO. The MCO must p ay the out -of- network provider for emergency services applying the \"prudent layperson\" definition according to the Emer gency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) of an emergency, rendered at a rate limited to the amount that would have been paid if the service had been provided under FFS, unless a lower amount is mutually agreed to between the MCO and the party(ies) re ndering service. Pursuant to 1932 (b)(2)(D) of the Act, a non - contracting provider of emergency services must accept as payment in full n o more than it would receive if the services were provided under FFS. This rule applies whether the non - contracting pro vider is within the State or outside of the State in which the managed care entity has a contract. No prior or post -authorization can b e required for emergency care provided by network or out-of-network providers. The MCO may not deny payment for treatment obtained when the enrollee has an emergency medical condition and seeks emergency services, applyi ng the \"prudent layperson\" definitio n of an emergency; this includes the prohibition against denying payment in those instances in which the absence of immediate medical attention would not have resulted in placing the health of the enrollee in serious jeo pardy, serious impairment to bodily function, or serious dysfunction of any bodily part or organ. The MCO may not deny payment for emergency services treatment when a representative of the MCO instructs the enrollee to seek emergency services care. Final determination of coverage and payment must be made taking into account the presenting symptoms rather than the final diagnosis. Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7438.114, the MCO may not limit what constitutes an emergency medical condition as defined in this se ction on the basis of lists of diagnoses or symptoms nor refuse to cover emergency services based on the emergency room provider, hospital, or fiscal agent not notifying the enrollee's PCP, MCO, or DHCFP of the enrollee's screening and treatment within ten calendar days of the presentation for emerg ency services. An enrollee who has an emergency medical condition may not be held liable for payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to diagnose the specific condition or stabilize the patient. The attending physician or the provider actually treating the enrollee is responsible for determining when the enrollee is sufficiently stabilized for transfer or discharge and that determination is binding on the MCO. C. Post-Stabilization Services The MCO is financially responsible for: MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 8 1. Post-stabiliz ation services obtained within or outside the network that are pre - approved by a network provider or the MCO representative; 2. Post-stabilization services obtained within or outside the network that are not pre - approved by a network provider or other organi zation representative, but administered to maintain the enrollee's stabilized condition within one hour of a request to the MCO for pre -approval of further post -stabilization care services; 3. Post-stabilization ca re services obtained within or outside the network that are not pre-approved by a network provider or other MCO representative but administered to maintain, improve, or resolve the enrollee's stabilized condition if the MCO does not respond to a request fo r pre -approval within one hour or the MCO c annot be contacted or the MCO and the treating physician cannot reach an agreement concerning the enrollee's care and a network provider or other organization representative is not available for consultation. In t his situation, the MCO must give the treati ng physician the opportunity to consult with a network physician and the treating physician may continue with care of the enrollee until a network physician is reached or one of the criteria in 42 CFR \u00a7422.113(c)(3) is met. Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7422.113(c)( 3), the MCO's financial responsibility for post - stabilization care it has not pre -approved ends when a network physician with privileges at the treating hospital assumes responsibility for the enrollee's care or a network physician assumes responsibility f or the enrollee's care through transfer or the MCO and the treating physician reach an agreement concerning the enrollee's care or the enrollee is discharged. D. Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinic (RHC) The MCO must pay for ser vices provided by a n FQHC or a n RHC. MCOs may enter into contracts with FQHCs or RHCs, provided that payments must be at least equal to the amount paid other providers for similar services and no lower than the FFS rates. If the MCO does not have a contrac t with an FQHC or RHC, the MCO must pay at a rate equivalent to that paid by DHCFP FFS reimbursement schedule , regardless of whether the FQH C or RHC is in or out of network . This does not apply to out -of- network providers of emergency services. See Sectio n 3603.5 (B). The MCO must make a good faith effort to negotiate a contract with these providers. The MCO must report to DHCFP payments and visits made to FQHCs and/or RHCs. FQHCs not contracted with a Contractor must follow the Contractor's Prior Authoriza tion Policy. E. Out-Of-State Providers When it is necessary for recipients to obtain services from an Out -Of-State (OOS) provider, the MCO must negotiate a contract to determine the rate prior to services being rendered. The MCO must inform the OOS provide r to accept the MCO's reimbursement as payment MTL 16/20 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY April 28, 2 020 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 9 in full. The only exception is for Third -Party Liability (TPL). The OOS provider must not bill, accept or retain payments from Medicaid or NCU recipients. OOS providers of emergency services must accept as pay ment in full no more t han it would receive if the services were provided under FFS, pursuant to \u00a71932(b)(2)(D) of the Act. F. Obstetrical/GYN Services 1. Care Coordination for Certain Pregnant Women The MCO is responsible for the identification and medical ma nagement of women identified as having a risk of preterm birth or poor pregnancy outcome. A pregnancy is defined as \"high risk\" when there is a likelihood of an adverse outcome to the woman and/or her baby that is greater than the incidence of that outcom e in the general p regnant population. It is the responsibility of the MCO to assess the risk status of all enrolled pregnant women. Subsequently, the MCO is responsible for providing medical case management to all enrolled women who have been identified as having a high -risk pregnancy. The MCO is also responsible for referring enrolled pregnant women identified with specified social needs to the DWSS. The DWSS staff is available to provide information regarding available community support programs to enr ollees identified as experiencing any of the specified high -risk social issues. DHCFP District Office staff is available to assist in limited care coordination. 2. Obstetrical Global Payment Length of time that the pregnant woman is enrolled in the health plan is not a determining factor in payment to the obstetrician. Payment to the delivering obstetrician for a normal routine pregnancy shall be based upon the services and number of visits provided by the obstetrician to the pregnant woman through the course of her pregnanc y. Payments are determined by Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT) codes submitted by the provider. The MCO must provide separate payment for covered medically necessary services required as a result of a non-routine pregnancy. A Global Payment will be paid to the delivering obstetrician, regardless of network affiliation, when the enrollee has been seen seven or more times. If the obstetrician has seen the enrollee less than seven times, the obstetrician will be paid according to the FF S reimbursement schedule. a. Network Providers MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 10 For all cases, the MCO must have policies and procedures in place for transitioning the Medicaid or NCU eligible pregnant recipient to a network provider. b. Non-network Providers The MCO may reimburse a non -network provider at a negotiated rate less than the FFS rates established for pregnancy -related CPT codes. c. New Enrollees within the Last Trimester of Pregnancy A pregnant woman who is enrolled with the MCO within the last trimester of pregnancy must be al lowed to remain in the care of a non -network provider, if she so chooses. The MCO must have policies and procedures for this allowance. d. Prior Authorization (PA) The MCO's PA policies and procedures must be consistent with the provision of prenatal care i n accordance with community standards of practice. DHCFP , at its discretion, may require removal of the prior authorization requirement f or various procedures based on reported approval data and any other relevant information. The MCO is required to provid e written notification to all affected network providers within 30 days of end of reported quarter regarding the elimination of the prior authorization requirement. Under no circumstance will visits not covered by Medicaid or NCU be applied toward the min imum number of visits required for a global payment. 3. Certified Nurse Midwife Services The MCO must make certified nurse midwife services available to enrollees, if such services are available in the MCO's service area. If the MCO does not have a contrac t for said services, the MCO must pay the certified nurse midwife provider according to DHCFP FFS reimbursement schedule for services rendered to the enrollee . 4. Maternity Kick Payment (aka Supplemental Omnibus Reconcil iation Act (SOBRA ) payment) The MCO w ill receive a maternity kick payment from DHCFP to cover the maternity costs of any birth, still born, or miscarriage occurring in the third trimester of pregnancy for which an obstetrical payment has been made and there is an accompanying provide r claim f or the delivery . The third trimester commences MTL 0 3/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 11 at 27 weeks of gestation. Maternity kick payments will be generated upon submission of encounter data confirming the delivery. Maternity Kick payment will be processed per delivery episode regardless of how ma ny babies are delivered. The maternity kick payment is intended to offset most of the costs to the health plans for costs associated specifically with the covered delivery of a child, including prenatal and postpartum care. Ante partum care is in cluded in the capitation rate paid for the mother. Costs of care for the newborn are included in the capitation rate. DHCFP will not pay a SOBRA payment in a situation where there is no accompanying provider claim for the delivery. 5. Family Planning Services Feder al regulations grant the right to any enrollee of child -bearing age to receive family planning services from any qualified provider, even if the provider is not part of the MCO's provider network. The MCO may not require family plan ning services to be prio r authorized. Family planning services are provided to enrollees who want to control family size or prevent unwanted pregnancies. Family planning services may include education, counseling, physical examinations, birth control devic es, supplies and Norplan t. Pursuant to the MSM Chapter 600, tubal ligations and vasectomies are a covered benefit for recipients 21 years of age or older. In accordance with federal regulations, the recipient must fill out a co nsent form at least 30 days prior to the procedure. The physician is required to send the consent form to the Fiscal Agent with the initial claim. Tubal ligations and vasectomies to permanently prevent conception are not covered for any recipient under the age of 21 or any recipient who is adjudged mentall y incompetent or is institutionalized. The MCO must, at a minimum, pay qualified out -of-network providers for family planning services rendered to its enrollees at the FFS rate paid by DHCFP . The MCO will be responsible for coordinating and documenting ou t-of-network family planning services provided to its recipients and the amounts paid for such services. 6. Coordination of Care Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7438.208(b)( 2, 3, and 4) the MCO is required to implement procedures to coordinate services it may provide to the enrollee with the services the enrollee may receive from any other vendor or entity, including dental, pharmacy, or through FFS. Upon request or notificat ion of need, the MCO is required to communicate with other vendors or entities serving the enro llee the results of its identification and assessment of that enrollee's needs to ensure services are not duplicated. The MCO must implement procedures to ensure that in MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 12 the process of coordinating care, each enrollee's privacy is protected consistent with the confidentiality requirements in 45 CFR \u00a7160 and \u00a7164 (HIPAA) . The MCO case managers will be responsible for coordinating services with appropriate non-Medic aid programs. This coordination includes referral of potentially eligible enrollees, including women with high -risk pregnancies, to appropriate community resources and social service programs. The MCO case managers will also be responsible for coordinating the transition of services for those enrollees transferring to or from FFS, another MCO, and/o r the State -designated Health Insurance Exchange (HIX). 7. Freestanding Obstetric/Birth Centers Section 2301 of the ACA requires coverage of services furnished at freestanding birth centers. The MCO is required to provide services at freestanding obstetric/ birth centers. A freestanding birth center is described as a health facility that is not a hospital or physician's office, where childbirth is planned to occur away from the pregnant woman's residence. The birth center must be in compliance with applicabl e state licensure and nationally recognized accreditation organization requirements for the provision of prenatal care, labor, delivery and postpartum care . \"Obstetric Center\", Nevada's legal term for birth center, complies with Section 2301 of the ACA bir th center requirements related to the health and safety of recipients provided services by licensed birth centers. DHCFP birth center coverage and reimbur sement is limited to medically necessary childbirth services which use natural childbirth procedures for labor, delivery, postpartum care and immediate newborn care. Birth center coverage and reimbursement are limited to women admitted to a birth center in accordance with adequate prenatal care, prospect for a normal uncomplicated birth defined by criteri a established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and by reasonable generally accepted clinical standards for maternal and fetal health. Prior authorization is not require d. Refer to the Maternity Care section of the MSM Chapter 60 0 - Physician Services, for comprehensive maternity care coverage provided by physicians and/or nurse midwives. Refer to Attachment A, Policy # 02-01, of the MSM Chapter 200 for comprehensive birth center covered services and provider requirements. G. Essenti al Community Providers (ECP) As defined by the ACA and Section 340(B)(a)(4) of the Public Health Service Act, ECPs are providers that have historically provided services to underserved populations and demonstrate a commitment to serve low income, underser ved populations who make up a significant portion of its patient population or, in the case of a sole community provider, MTL 16/20 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY April 28, 2020 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 13 serves underserved patients within its clinical capability; and (b) waives charges or charges for services on a modified sliding fee s cale based on income and does not restrict access or services because of a patient's financial limitations. The MCOs must make a good faith effort to negotiate a contract with the ECPs who are located in the plan's geographic service area, including but no t limited to those identified in the manage d care contract. The State has identified ECPs that may not meet the aforementioned requirements but are critical to ensuring access to Covered Services in the Contractor's Provider Network . The Health Resources a nd Services Administration (HRSA) provides a non -exclusive list of ECPs; however, DHCFP reserves the right to modify this list at any time. 3603.6 ADDITIONAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES The MCO is encouraged to offer additional preventive or cost -effective servi ces to enrolled recipients, if the services do not increase the cost to the State. 3603.7 DENTAL SERVICES Dental services are included in the benefit package for those mandatorily enrolled in a Managed Care geographic area . A contracted PAHP will be respo nsible for all covered medically necessary dental services pursuant to the MSM Chapter 1000 , the NCU State Plan and the State Plan, Section 3.1-A. 3603.8 PRIVATE DUTY NURSING Private duty nursing services (42 CFR \u00a7440.80) are included in the MCO packag e for recipients who require more individual and continuous care . These services are provided: A. By a Registered Nurse (RN) or a Licensed Practical nurse (LPN) ; B. Under the directions of the recipient's physician; and C. In the recipient 's home , or any settin g where normal life activities occur . For additional information, referen ce the MSM Chapter 900. 3603.9 PHARMACY SERVICES Pharmacy services are included in the MCO benefit package. The MCO may design its own pharmacy formulary based on clinical guideli nes. Medications not covered in the MCO's formulary must be available through a non -formulary request proce ss based on physician certification and justification of medical necessity. Pharmacy coverage benefits are based on the Medicaid/NCU State Plan. The MCO may use generic substitutions unless the physician/dentist justifies the medical necessity of the bran d name pharmaceutical. MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 14 The MCO must have a policy for transitioning a recipient's prescriptions from FFS, another MCO or the HIX, to the MCO , vendor or HIX. The MCO will not be allowed to terminate a current prescription without first conducting a medical examination of the recipient. The MCO then must document why a drug is not medically necessary, if a current prescription is terminated. DHCFP shall approve the MCO's formulary prior to implementation. The MSM Chapter 1200 stipulates the conditions with which a prescriber must comply to certify that a specific brand of medication is medically necessary for a particular patient. The physician sho uld d ocument in the patient's medical record the need for the brand name product in place of the generic form. The procedure of the certification must comply with the following: certification must be in the physician's own handwriting; and, certification m ust b e written directly on the prescription blank and a phrase indicating the need for a specific brand is required (an example would be \"Brand Medically Necessary\"). Substitution of generic drugs prescribed by brand name must also comply with NRS 639.2583 . The MCO will report all claims billed for drugs that were acquired through the 340B drug pricing program using standard identifiers as defined by DHCFP so they can be properly excluded from federal drug rebates. Entities that are identified on the HRSA web site as 340B providers must be excluded from rebate invoicing. The MCO must operate a drug utilization review program for covered outpatient drugs that includes prospective drug review, retrospective drug use review, application of standards and an educat ion program in compliance with the requirements described in Section 1927(g) of the Act and 42 CFR part 456, subpart K. Pursuant to Sec. 1004 of the Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT ACT) the MCOs are required to have a constructed or designed claims review, process, or program as outlined in the Managed Care contract. 3603.10 CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CENTERS (CCBHC) Services furnished in a CCBHC are availab le to eligible Managed Care enrollees. The MCO must pay CCBHCs no less than the approved rates in the Medicaid State Plan. The required Prospective Payment System (PPS) reimbursement for CCBHCs will be accounted for in the Capitation Payments. The quality incentive payment will be calculated by the State and distributed through the MCOs after the value of the incentive payment for each contract year is known. 3603.11. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER (RTC) The MCO is responsible for reimbursement of all RTC charges including admission, bed day rate and ancillary services. MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 15 3603. 12 CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS (CSHCN) AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ADULTS The MCO benefit package must include certain services for members with special health care needs, including CSHCN , Early Intervention, and mental health services for adults for which the MCO must reimburse certain types of providers with whom formal contracts may not be in place and coordinate these services with other services in the MCO benefit package. The MCO must implement mechanisms to assess each enrollee, identified to the MCO as an individual with special health care needs, in order to identify any ongoing special conditions of the enrollee that require a course of treatment or regular ca re monitoring. The assessment mechanisms must use appropriate health care professionals. The MCO must produce a treatment plan for enrollees with special health care needs who are determined through an assessment to need a course of treatment or regular c are monitoring. The treatment plan must be: A. Developed by the enrollee's PCP or Case Manager with enrollee participation, and in consultation with any specialists caring for the enrollee; B. Approved by the MCO , as part of the Utilization Management process, in a timely manner, if approval is required by the MCO; and, C. In accordance with any applicable State quality assurance and utilization review standards. For children with special health care needs who are determined through an assessment by appropriate health care professionals to need a course of treatment or regular care monitoring, the MCO must have a mechanism in place to allow these enrollees access to a specialist, through a standing referral or an approved number of visits, as appropriate for the enrollee's condition and identified needs. The MCO is required to adhere to the MSM Chapters 400 and 2500 for all SED and SMI referrals and determinations and must reimburse provide rs of these services pursuant to the referenced MSM Chapters. Medicaid eli gible recipients have the option of disenrolling from the MCO, if determined to be SED or SMI , with the exception of the Nevada Medicaid Newly Eligible childless adults ages 19 - 64 and the expanded parent and caretakers ages 19 - 64. Title XXI NCU recipie nts must remain enrolled with the MCO who is responsible for ongoing patient care. 3603. 13 TRANSPLANTATION OF ORGANS AND TISSUE, AND RELATED IMMUNO - SUPPRESSANT DRUGS These services are covered, with limitations, when medically necessary. Coverage limit ations for these services are defined in the Medicaid State Plan. DHCFP via its Medicaid State Plan Attachment 3.1.E covers corneal, kidney, liver and bone marrow transpl ants and associated fees for adults. For children up to age 21 any medically necessary transplant that is not experimental MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 16 will be covered. The MCO may claim transplant case reimbursement from DHCFP for in -patient medical expenses above the threshold of $ 500,000 in a one -year period (State Fiscal Year). 75% of the expenses above $ 500,000 are reimbursed to the health plan. At the discretion of DHCFP administration, an enrollee may be assigned to anot her MCO at any time and DHCFP may reimburse the MCO for claims and waive stop loss. DHCFP may also assign an otherwise FFS child to the MCO for care management. The MCO will be expected to administer these FFS payments with no added markup. 3603. 14 TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT (TCM) TCM has a specific meaning for Nevada Medicaid and NCU . TCM, as defined by the MSM Addendum , is carved out of the mana ged care contracts. Case management, which differs from TCM, is required from the contracted MCO. 3603.15 POPULATION HEALTH PROGRAM The MCO must establish a Population Health program that establishes population health goals and targeted annual improveme nts that are aligned with the State's Quality Strategy. The MCO's Population Health program must align the efforts and resources of the MCO's Care Management programs (i.e., disease management, Care Coordination, Case Management, and programs that address social determinants of health and racial and ethnic disparities in health care), Quality Management, and the Contractor's value based contract ing strategies to achieve population health improvements. 3603. 16 IMMUNIZATIONS The MCO shall require its networ k providers to enroll in the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) which is administered by the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) . Providers licensed by the state to prescribe vaccines may request to be enrolled in the DPBH 's VFC Program . The immunization program will review and approve provider enrollment requests. The MCO shall require VFC enrolled providers to cooperate wit h the DPBH for purposes of performing orientation and monitoring activities regarding the VFC Program requirements . Upon successful enrollment in the VFC Program, providers may request state supplied vaccine to be administered to enrollees through 18 years of age in accordance with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) schedule and/or recommendation and following the VFC program requirements as defined in the VFC Provider Enrollment Agreement. The MCOs shall require VFC enrolled network providers to participate in the DPBH 's Immunization Registry to ensure DHCFP 's goal to fully immuniz e children up to the age of two years. The MCO shall provide appropriate technical support in instances where the provider does not have the capability to meet these requirements. The MCO must work with the DPBH to interface directl y with the Immunization Registry. MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 17 3603. 17 EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT (EPSDT) The MCO is required to cover EPSDT screenings of its enrollees under the age of 21 years. The screening must meet the EPSDT requirements found in the MSM as well as Sections 1902(a)(43), 1905(a)(4)(B), and 1905(r) of the Act, and 42 CFR \u00a7441.50 through \u00a7441.62. The MCO must cover all interperiodic screening on behalf of eligible enrollees , as defined in the MSM. Medically necessary screening, diagnosti c and treatment services identified in an EPSDT periodic or interperiodic screening must be provided to eligible children under the age of 21 years if the service is listed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 d(a).

Eligibility and Disenrollment The eligibility and enrollment functions are the responsibility of DHCFP and the DWSS. The MCO shall accept each recipient who i s enrolled in or assigned to the MCO by DHCFP and/or its enrollment sections and/or for whom a capitation payment has been made or will be made by DHCFP to the MCO . The first date a Medicaid or NCU eligible recipient will be enrolled is not earlier than th e applicable date in the MCO's specified contract. The MCO must accept recipients eligible for enrollment in the order in which they apply without restriction, up to the limits set under the contract . The MCO acknowledges that enrollment is mandatory exce pt in the case of voluntary enrollment that meet the conditions set forth in 42 CFR \u00a7438.50(a). The MCO will not, on the basis of health status or need for health services, discriminate against recipi ents eligible to enroll. The MCO will not deny the enrol lment nor discriminate against any Medicaid or NCU recipients eligible to enroll on the basis of race, color or national origin and will not use any policy or practice that has the effect of discrimin ation on the basis of race, color or national origin. If the recipient was previously disenrolled from the MCO as the result of a grievance filed by the MCO, the recipient will not be re -enrolled with the MCO unless the recipient wins an appeal of the dise nrollment. The recipient may be enrolled with another MC O. The State reserves the right to recover pro -rated capitation whenever the MCO's responsibility to pay medical claims ends in mid -month. A situation where a mid -month capitation recovery may occur includes, but is not limited to: 1. Enrollee is in a nursi ng facility over 180 days; 2. Enrollee is in an acute hospital swing bed over 45 days; 3. Enrollee is placed in an out of home placement; 4. Medicaid enrollee is placed in a hospice; 5. Enrollees enters an ICF/ID; 6.

MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 19 The MCO is not financially responsible for any services rendered during a period of retroactive eligibility except in the specific situation(s) described in this Chapter . The MCO is responsible for services rendered during a per iod of retroactive enrollment in situations where errors committed by DHCFP or the DWSS, though corrected upon discovery, have caused an individual to not be properly and timely enrolled with the MCO . In such cases, the MCO shall only be obligated to pay f or such services that would have been authorized by the MCO had the individual been enrolled at the time of such services. For in -state providers in these circumstances, the MCO shall pay the providers for such services only in the amounts that would have been paid to a contracted provider in the applicable specialty. OOS providers in these circumstances will be paid according to a negotiated rate between the MCO and the OOS provider.

D. Auto Assignment Process For Medicaid recipients who do not select a n MCO, DHCFP will assign the recipient to an MCO based upon federally required enrollment default criteria that include: 1. The maintenance of existing provider individual relationships o r relationships with traditional Medicaid providers; and 2. Distributing the recipients among the contracted MCOs based upon an algorithm developed by DHCFP and outlined in the Medicaid State Plan when maintaining such relationships is not possible. E. Automatic Re -enrollment Enrollees disenrolled solely due to the loss of Medicaid or NCU eligibility will be auto assigned to their last kn own MCO upon re -entry within 60 days of disenrollment and if that MCO remains under contract. Should th e MCO no longer be under contract, enrollee (s) MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLI CY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 21 will make a selection during redetermination at DWSS or be assigned to an alternate MCO .

Most often, a capitation payment error is introduced due to an inaccuracy in eligibility or enrollment status. Some errors are corrected automatically by the MMIS, others by manual financial transaction. Depending upon the nature of the error in a particular instance, capitation may be paid or recovered from the MCO. Capitation is also reconc iled periodically, typically for a thre e-month period. A. Errors automatically corrected by the MMIS The MMIS automatically adjusts up to three months of capitation for newborns when updated DWSS eligibility data for the current month also includes previous ly unreported eligibility. In those instances where an eligibility agent has corrected an estimated date of birth forward in time, the MMIS automatically recovers the incorrectly paid capitation. Should an error extend beyond three months, the instance must be researched and corrected manually by financial transaction. B. Errors Corrected Manually by Financial Transaction The MCO, in order to recover unpaid capitation, is required to submit such instances on a periodic basis via the process described in the Contract ( MOVEit reporting repository ). The Supplemental Reimbursement unit reconciles and authorizes payment of these retro - capitat ion payment requests on a quarterly basis with sufficient lag time (typically three months) to allow automated MMIS cor rections to occur. The Supplemental Reimbursement unit also reconciles and authorizes capitation recovery in instances where it is disco vered that capitation has been incorrectly paid. This may occur on either a periodic or per -instance basis. C. Reconcilia tion of Capitation Payments The Supplemental Reimbursement unit determines the validity of retro -capitation requests or may use an appropriate sample for a large number of payment requests. 3603. 26 THIRD -PARTY LIABILITY (TPL) AND SUBROGATION For DHCFP 's contracts with the MCOs, TPL refers to any individual, entity (e.g., insurance company) or program (e.g., Medicare) including group health plans, as defined in Section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 USC and 1167 (1)) se rvice benefits plans and Section 6035 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State (Medicaid) Plan. TPL also MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Sectio n 3603 Page 36 includes the Coordination of Benefits (COB) cost avoidance and COB recovery. Under Secti on 1902(a)(25) of the Act, DHCFP is required to take all reasonable measures to identify legally liable third parties and treat verified TPL as a resource of the Medicaid and NCU recipient. For DHCFP 's contract s with MCOs, subrogation is the principle und er which an insurer that has paid a loss under an insurance policy is entitled to all the rights and remedies belonging to the insured against a third party with respect to any loss covered by the policy. The M CO shall act as the State's authorized agent for the limited purpose of TPL collection, within the limitation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC \u00a7 1692, of all TPL pursuant capitated p ayments include an offset in the rates for th ese collections. The MCO shall vigorously pursue billing prior resources and report their TPL and subrogation collection results to DHCFP quarterly, as these amounts are considered part of their capitation. MCOs are required to secure signed acknowledgements from enrollees or their authorized representative for any prior resources (Medicare, worker's compensation, private insurance, and similar resources ). The MCO must pursue TPL in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7433.139. The MCO must also determine if casualty claims are filed and recover costs through subrogation on behalf of both Medicaid and NCU enrollees . The MCO is responsible for not only pursuing third party resources that it identifies but also for pursuing th ird-party resources identified and communicated to the MCO by DHCFP . All information on the third party, including collections and collection attempts, are to be reported to DHCFP (including circumstance s under which the third -party refuses to pay) as inst ructed in the State's MOVEit reporting repository . monitor and evaluate the MCO's TPL and subrogation collection reports to validate collection activities and results . The MCO will then be expected to meet or exceed baseline target collections as determined by DHCFP and its actuaries. If the MCO does not meet or exceed baseline TPL and subrogation collections, DHCFP will conduct a review to determine if there is a legitimate reason. If th ere is no legitimate reason as determined by DHCFP , the difference between baseline and actual collections will be deducted from the MCO's costs before the data is used to set future rates. DHCFP will prospectively adjust capitation rates downward to accou nt for expected TPL collections. The MCO is required to o btain TPL information independently of DHCFP for the purpose of avoiding claim payments or recovering payments made from liable third parties. TPL recovery may be incorporated into the capitated rat e development by DHCFP and its actuary. The MCO has 365 da ys from claim paid date to recover the TPL payment; after 365 days, the MCO forfeits the right to recovery to the State unless the MCO can provide evidence that the recovery effort is active and/or in dispute.

Payments for items or services provided under the Medicaid/NCU State Plan s to financial institutions or entities such as provider bank accounts or business agents located outside of the U.S. are prohibited by this provision. F urther, this Section prohibits payments to telemedicine providers located outside of the U.S. Additionally ; payments to pharmacies located outside of the U.S. are not permitted. Any payments for items or services provided under the Medicaid/NCU State Plan or under a waiver to any financial institution or entity located outside of the U.S. may be recovered by the State from the MCO . For purposes of implementing this provision, Section 1101(a) (2) of t he Act defines the term \"United States\" when used in a geographical sense, to mean the \"States.\" Section 1101(a)(1) of the Act defines the term \"State\" to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands , and American Samoa, when used under Title XIX. The phrase, \"items or services provided under the Medicaid/NCU State Plan s or under a waiver\" refers to medical assistance for which the State claims Federal funding under Section 1903(a) of the Act. Tasks that support the administration of the Medicaid /NCU State Plan that may require payments to financial institutions or entities located outside of the U.S. are not prohibited under this statute. For example, payments for outsourcing information processing related to Plan administration or outsourcing call centers related to enrollment or claims adjudication are not prohibited under this statute. 3603. 28 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) A. The MCO shall operate the MIS capable of maintaining, providing, do cumenting, and retaining information sufficient to substantiate and report MCO's compliance with the contract requirements.

MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALT H CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3603 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3603 Page 39 3603. 29 REPORTING Adequate data reporting capabilities are critical to the ability of CMS and DHCFP to effectively evaluate DHCFP 's Managed Care Programs. The success of the Managed Care Program is based on the belief that recipients will have better access to care, including preventive services, and will experience improved health status, outcomes, and satisfaction with the health care delivery system. To measure the program's accomplishme nts in ea ch of these areas, the MCO must provide DHCFP and/or its contractors with uniform utilization, cost, quality assurance, and recipient satisfaction and grievance/appeal data on a regular basis. It must also cooperate with DHCFP in carrying out data validati on steps. The MCO is required to certify the data including, but not limited to, all documents specified by the State as required in the Reporting Guide of the current DHCFP Managed Care Contract, enrollment information, encounter data, and ot her informa tion contained in contract proposals, as provided in 42 CFR \u00a7438.606.

Should the MCO fail to provide such reports in a timely manner , DHCFP may require the MCO to submit a Plan of Correc tion (POC) to address contractual requirements regarding timely reporting submissions. E. Enrollee Satisfaction Reporting Each MCO must collect and submit to DHCFP a statistically valid uniform data set measuring enrollee satisfaction prior to the third quarter of each contract year, unless the requirement is waived by DHCFP due to an EQRO performed survey. This ma y be done in conjunction with the MCO's own satisfac tion survey. DHCFP may request a specific sample, and/or survey tool , such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey. Survey results must be disclosed to the State, an d, upon State's or enrollee's request, disclosed to enrollees. F.

MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3604 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: GRIEVANCES, APPEALS AND HEARINGS January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3604 Page 1 3604 GRIEVANCES, APPEALS AND HEARINGS The MCO shall establish a system for enrollees that include a grievance process, an appeal process, and access to the State Fair Hearing system. A. Enrollee Grievances and Appeals The MCO's grievance and appeal system must be in writing and submitted to DHCFP for review and approval at the time the MCO policie s and procedures are submitted. DHCFP will refer all enroll ee grievances and appeals to the MCO for resolution. The MCO must provide information about the grievance and appeal system to all providers and subcontractors at the time they enter into a contract. The MCO is required to provide access to state fair hear ings in the event an enrollee's MCO appeal is not resolved wholly in favor of the enrollee. An enrollee may file for an MCO appeal or grievance either orally or in writing. A p rovider, acting on behalf of the enrollee and with the enrollee's written consen t, may also file an appeal. 1. Action The MCO must provide standard authorization decisions as expeditiously as the enrollee's health requires and within the State's established timelines that may not exceed 14 calendar days following receipt of the request for service, with a possible extensi on of up to 14 additional calendar days if the enrollee or provider requests the extension; or, the MCO justifies (to DHCFP upon request) a need for additional information and how the extension is in the enrollee's interests. If the State grants the MCO 's request for an extension, the MCO must give the enrollee written notice of the reason for the delay within two calendar days and inform the enrollee of the right to file a Grievance if the Member disagrees with the decision. Prompt , oral notice must be pro vided in addition to the written notice for expedited Appeals. In the event of an extension, the MCO must resolve the Appeal as expeditious ly as possible, but no later than the date the extension expires. For cases in which a provider indicates or the MCO determines that following the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life or health or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum function, the MCO must make an expedited authorization decision and provide a Notice of Decision (NOD) as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition warrants and no later than three working days after receipt of the request for serv ice. The MCO may extend the three working days ' time period by up to 14 calendar days if the enrollee requests an extension or if the MCO justifies (to the State, upon request) a need for additional information and how the extension is in the enrollee's in terest. MTL 03/22 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 3604 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: GRIEVANCES, APPEALS AND HEARINGS January 29, 2022 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3604 Page 2 2. Notice of Decision (NOD) The MCO must provide a NOD to the requesting provider and the enrollee when the MCO takes adverse action or makes an adverse determination. Pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7438.404(b) and \u00a7438.210(c) the NOD must explain: a. The acti on the MCO or its contractor has taken or intends to take; for expedited appeal resolution requests, the MCO is required to make a good faith effort to provide an oral notice of the disposition in addition to the required written notice. The MCO is requir ed to maintain records of grievances and appeals, which the State will review as part of the State's quality strategy. 3. State Fair Hearings Process The State Fair Hearing process is described in the MSM Chapter 3100 . An enrollee, enrollee's authorized representative or the authorized representative of a deceased enrollee's estate has the right to request a State Fair Hearing when they have exhausted the MCO's appeal system without receiving a wholly favorable resolution decision. The request for a State Fair Hearing must be submitted in writing within 90 calendar days from the date of the MCO's final NOD. The MCO will participate as the State Contractor in the State fair hearing process requested by their enrollees. The MCO is bound by the decision of the Fair Hearing Officer or the court system if the hearing officer's decision is appealed . The Contractor must allow the Member, or Provider acting on behalf of the Member, to file a Grievance at any time. 4. Continuation of Benefits While the MCO and the St ate Fair Hearing are Pending The MCO must continue the enrollee's benefits if the enrollee or provide r files the appeal in a timely manner. Timely means filing the appeal on or before the later of the following: within ten days of the MCO mailing the NOD or not more than ten days after the date of action or intended effective date of the MCO's proposed action according to 42 CFR \u00a7431.231 . In addition, pursuant to 42 CFR \u00a7438.420, the MCO must continue benefits if the appeal involves the termination, suspen sion, or reduction of a previously authorized course of treatment; and if the services were ordered by an authorized provider; and if the original period covered by the original authorization ha s not expired; and, if the enrollee requests an extension of b enefits. If, at the enrollee's request, the MCO co ntinues the enrollee's benefits , the benefits must be continued until one of the following occurs: a. The enrollee withdraws the appeal; MTL 16/20 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FIN ANCING AND POLICY Section: 3604 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: GRIEVANCES, APPEALS AND HEARINGS April 28, 2020 MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION Section 3604 Page 3 b. Ten calendar days after the MCO mails the NOD , providing the resoluti on of the appeal against the enrollee, unless the enrollee, within the ten -day timeframe has requested a State Fair Hearing with continuation of benefits until a State Fair Hearing decision is reached; c. A State Fair Hearing Officer issues a hearing decisio n adverse to the enrollee; or d. The time period of service limits of a previously authorized service has been met.
