What's the main difference between Chinese medicine and Western medicine? And how effective is traditional Chinese medicine for women's health? We delve into this and more below. What is traditional Chinese medicine? Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an ancient system of treatment that combines philosophical and physical methods to treat disease and illness. Through a combination of physical and conceptual practices, traditional Chinese medicine incorporates the mind, body and spirit as a whole to achieve a physiological balance of yin and yang. How old is traditional Chinese medicine? As [one of the world's oldest medical systems](https://www.britannica.com/science/traditional-Chinese-medicine), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long and rich history of usage, and has changed little over the centuries. While some regard Chinese medicine to have first emerged in the shamanistic era of the Shang Dynasty Period (1600 to 1046 BC), there are others who claim to be able to trace its origins back as far as 5,000 years. Founded on the concept of holistically treating the body and appreciating the body's natural ability to return to its balanced state of health, the ancient Chinese practice is now widely used throughout Asia and increasingly throughout the rest of the world. How does traditional Chinese medicine work? TCM is based on the belief that one's \" [Qi](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/traditional-chinese-medicine/what-qi-and-other-concepts)\" (\"vital life force\") must flow freely and unobstructed through a network of invisible channels or \"meridians\" in order to maintain good health, both physically and mentally. Correspondingly, it is believed that any blockage or imbalance of Qi in the body could very well lead to illness. As such, maintaining a healthy balance of yin-yang and Qi is fundamental to TCM practice, and can be achieved via the incorporation of various self-care practices such as healthy eating, meditation and acupuncture. The principal goal of TCM is to restore balance in the body by treating the root cause, not just the symptoms. Though quite slow in action, TCM takes into account not just the ailment itself, but the body as a whole, from the physical to the emotional and psychological. TCM practitioners will also take into consideration lifestyle and environmental factors before administering proper treatment. What does traditional Chinese medicine treat? TCM treats a variety of issues ranging from chronic illnesses to acute problems. Some use cases for TCM include: - Pain (such as joint pain or migraines) - IBS - Asthma - Insomnia - Allergies - Arthritis - Stress, anxiety and depression As TCM takes a holistic approach to treatment, it recognises the body's self-repairing mechanism and uses [natural healing methods](https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/patient/treatments/alternative/6-traditional-chinese-medicine-techniques) to help encourage the body's intrinsic self-healing ability. What about traditional Chinese medicine for women's health? A woman's body experiences many different hormonal changes throughout her life, beginning at puberty and carrying on to old age. This ever-changing hormonal environment is sensitively associated with our emotions, nutrition and general lifestyle. TCM, along with an adequate diet and exercise routine, can restore hormonal and emotional balance during all of these stages by promoting the body's innate self-healing system. Some examples of traditional Chinese medicine for women's health include: - Pregnancy-related symptoms - Menstrual disorders - Endometriosis - Menopause-related symptoms - Infertility Read more: [What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine#1) What techniques are used in traditional Chinese medicine? Traditional Chinese Medicine incorporates several methods designed to rebalance the body and maintain health. Through these methods, TCM targets the body's acupuncture points to dispel illness. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting metallic needles into the surface of the skin that is manipulated through gentle movements. This method restores the balance between yin and yang, enabling the flow of \"Qi\" throughout the body. Acupuncture is commonly used to treat chronic pain, menstrual cramps and morning sickness. Tui na massage During a Tui Na massage, the practitioner will apply pressure techniques that vary in force and speed. Some techniques are more 'yin'; gentle, passive, and meditative. The 'yang' approach is more active, dynamic, and physical, creating a more intense sensation. A Tui Na massage can be used to treat arthritis, stress and digestive conditions. Moxibustion Moxibustion is performed by burning the Moxa plant close to the body, giving off a strong smell and smoke to facilitate healing. Practitioners use moxibustion treatment to expel dampness from the body, infertility and breech pregnancy. Cupping & scraping Cupping is a type of massage that involves placing glass \"cups\" on the body to create suction. Scraping or \"gua sha\" uses a massage tool to scrape along the skin to release toxins. Both methods result in redness and mild bruising around the treatment area and are used for blood disorders such as anaemia, skin problems like cystic acne and eczema as well as high blood pressure. Chinese herbal medicine Chinese herbs range from leaves, roots, stems, flowers and seeds to be administered in various ingestible forms such as a traditional tea or powder. People take Chinese herbs to combat everyday illnesses as well as long-term disease. These can range from the common cold and diarrhoea to diabetes, cancer treatment and menopause. Traditional Chinese medicine vs. Western medicine There's much interest on the topic of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Both approaches offer unique benefits and disadvantages, and integrating the two can be useful in treatment. But first... How effective is Chinese herbal medicine? Although there is still much to be understood about TCM, there is more evidence that proves the traditional methods are a safe and effective treatment method for a large number of conditions. Nearly 200 types of Western medicine have been developed as a result of the 7,300 species of plants and herbs used in Chinese medicine. A common example is Ephedrine, an alkaloid used to treat patients suffering from asthma that was originally derived from the Chinese Ma Huang plant. Today, scientists continue to source compounds and herbs traditionally used in Chinese medicine to enhance the development of new treatment in Western medicine. In fact, TCM has even been used as an adjunct treatment for Covid-19, and is reported to help to relieve symptoms and aid in recovery. Additionally, acupuncture (a key component of TCM) has long been recognised by the World Health Organisation and the NHS as an effective form of treatment for chronic pain, as well as milder conditions such as nausea and migraines. What is the difference between Chinese medicine and Western medicine? At the heart of Western medicine is pathology; the study of the causes and effects of diseases. This foundation allows us to understand the nature of diseases, but can cause us to become overly focused on the disease rather than the patient. To put it simply, in Western medicine, two patients who suffer from the same illness would - more often than not - be administered identical treatments, irrespective of their individual circumstances. From the TCM perspective, this is too simplistic. Unlike Western medicine's reactive \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to patient care, Chinese medicine believes in treating the mind, body and spirit as a whole, taking into consideration personal aspects like living conditions, emotional state, lifestyle habits, etc. To use the same example, two patients exhibiting the same symptoms would usually not receive the same course of treatment as they would be given a unique diagnosis. Additionally, TCM methods tend to be less invasive, contributing to the slower speed of treatment compared to Western medication which offers rapid recovery but is prone to negative side effects. Although both methods differ vastly from each other, the growing conversation between both sides means the sharing of methods and willingness to learn from one another. In turn, this improves the standard of treatment that we receive!

Traditional Chinese medicine and nutrition TCM practitioners view food as preventative medicine, with each individual food item falling into the category of either yin or yang. To put it simply, the food you eat has the power to either nourish or diminish your body, meaning that proper nutrition in TCM is key to living a healthy, balanced life. Using a traditional Chinese medicine food chart In Chinese nutrition, a balanced diet is one that is free from chemicals and preservatives, and one that includes all five tastes; sour, salty, bitter, spicy and sweet. There are no banned foods according to TCM practices, but following a traditional Chinese medicine food chart can help you easily identify what kinds of food are hot (yin) or cold (yang) and the impact they have on specific parts of the body.

In Chinese culture, confinement or (zuo yue zi) - translating literally to \"sitting the moon\" - refers to a period of time that a new mother will remain confined to the house with her baby so that she can rest and heal. Typically lasting a month, sometimes longer, the period involves the prohibition of certain ordinary tasks such as working out, bathing, intercourse, household chores, amongst others. The tradition is based off of the belief that, after giving birth, a woman's body will become more fragile and more susceptible to illness. If yin (cold) comes into contact with the new mum during this crucial period, she is unlikely to properly heal, hence rules like no cold water or foods. Confinement is a tradition deeply ingrained in Chinese society. The new mothers adopt a new routine different from day-to-day living for an entire month to aid recovery. As they're restricted from doing any sort of household chores, some will even hire a confinement nanny to make TCM approved soups and recipes, care for the baby and ensure that both are well-supported throughout the month. What is the purpose of confinement? - Full rest and recuperation for both mother and baby - Allow for the womens reproductive organs to recover - Special \"confinement foods\" are made to provide nourishment and facilitate the production of breast milk - To protect against common ailments associated with post-delivery Read more: [Chinese Confinement](https://whattocooktoday.com/chinese-confinement.html) How does TCM help mothers during Confinement?

These include the following: - Dang Gui - used to replenish blood supply - Chuan Xiong - improve blood circulation around the body - Dang Shen - increase bodily fluids and Qi - Huang Qi - support the body's immune system and strengthen the Spleen and Stomach for a stronger digestive system TO WRAP UP Through the use of acupuncture, lifestyle advice, and herbal formulas, Traditional Chinese Medicine can assist women through every stage of their life to ensure prolonged health and wellness.
