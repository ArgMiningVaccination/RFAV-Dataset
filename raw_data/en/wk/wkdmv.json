Lisanna Wallance grew up in New York, attending Barnard College of Columbia University before moving to Paris. She was born with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes dysfunction throughout the body. When her symptoms suddenly worsened, she delved deeper into her passion for cooking as a way to help heal herself. She spent years experimenting with her diet, using food, plant and mushroom medicine as a way to regain control over her life. Her first cookbook, The Natural Witch's Cookbook, has also been published in French (Editions Solar) and German (Riva Publishing). Her book is the culmination of the medicinal knowledge she acquired during her health journey and a sublimation of her suffering to help others. Lisanna lives in Paris with her long-time boyfriend and splits the rest of her time between Normandy, New York, and Martha's Vineyard. The story behind this cookbook is that the author discovered she had a chronic condition and because medical treatments failed her to some extent she turned to natural methods to alleviate her symptoms. Each recipe has a stated intention for how it will aid the body, from simple comfort to immunity to energy. I found this very helpful and informative. She details how certain ingredients stimulate the body and why they are included or combined with other ingredients. She also includes extra \"witch tips,\" many of them common sense but still not things I would have thought of. The recipes I've made so far have been delicious overall. Some need tweaks, but I find that to be true of any cookbook I use. Sometimes I do the steps in a different order, caramelize more, etc. The chicken with cream leek sauce and blue cheese stuffed mushrooms was awesome. Still tweaking the balsamic carrots. What I love about witchy stuff is that it deals more with nature and natural ingredients. This is a great cookbook for that purpose. When I can incorporate something fresh or something that I've grown myself those are the best kinds of recipes to me. I'm always excited to try recipes that have a positive effect on the body, and some of these looked really delicious! However, some of the recipes felt a little repetitive, or used similar ingredients over and over again. Would have liked to see a bit more variety. Every once in a while I read a cookbook that turns the world on it's ear, this is one of them. It's rare that we see such a inventive take on cooking that has so much brilliance behind it. This is a vegtable and fruit strong cookbook but it's not at all a vegetarian cookbook. Many of these recipes were written with Ehlers-Danlos in mind, but there is something for everyone here. Wallance is an engaging an thoughtful cookbook author, she did a great job here and I think that we shall see good things from her in the future. "}
