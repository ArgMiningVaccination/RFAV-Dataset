There is an enormous opportunity to prevent the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with this disorder through early diagnosis and effective management. In the UK there are believed to be more than 120,000 people with FH, but fewer than 12 per-cent of them are diagnosed. This suggests that there are more than 100,000 people in the UK living with FH at risk of premature mortality due to CHD. In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued guidance on the diagnosis and management of FH. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, significant steps were taken to implement the NICE recommendations by establishing national screening and cascade testing programmes, but a report from HEART UK in 2010 sadly demonstrated that England is lagging behind. This new Medway report discusses an approach by one Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to address the recommendations made in the NICE guidance and improve diagnosis of FH within primary care. It is a huge step forward and offers a model that could be implemented within other CCGs in England; to systematically identify people at risk of FH and offer them appropriate treatment. I am very grateful to all who have contributed to the work of this audit. It demonstrates how successful collaboration between commissioners (CCG) and a charity (HEART UK), together with industry support (Sanofi), can help improve patient care. There are, of course, lessons to be learnt and any model can be improved. To that end, this report provides a number of useful recommendations. I am delighted that HEART UK are planning to make the FH audit tool widely available to GPs and are seeking support to extend the FH Nurse Advisor Programme beyond the Medway region. Initiatives such as this demonstrate the way in which services can be improved to help reduce the future burden of coronary heart disease in this group of patients. FH need no longer be a 'silent killer'. 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a relatively common autosomal dominant lipid disorder that confers a lifelong risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) because of highly raised low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). FH is one of the most common inherited disorders. Worldwide, between 14 million and 34 million people are likely to have FH, with some 1.8-4.5 million in Europe and at least 120,000 in the Uk. The Uk 2010 National Audit of the Management of FH estimated that around 15,000 patients are diagnosed with FH in the Uk. Therefore, at least 100,000 cases of FH are undiagnosed, and this points to severe under-diagnosis and under-treatment of FH in the Uk. Cascade testing is a mechanism for identifying people at risk for a genetic condition, such as FH, by a process of systematic family tracing. For FH, cascade testing of close relatives who carry a 50% risk of the disorder is a recommended and cost-effective approach to diagnosing new patients. It is estimated that cascade testing may identify approximately 50% of people with FH (at least as estimated for the UK population); therefore, to further improve FH diagnosis, other strategies are required to identify new index cases. Despite the 2008 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline recommendation for genetic testing of index cases and cascade testing, and the publication of the NICE Quality Standard for the management of FH in August 2013, no systematic diagnostic testing programme has yet been introduced in England, although there are active programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Primary care provides an opportunity to systematically identify new index FH cases for diagnosis, testing and treatment via data already held within GP computer systems. The Medway FH audit was prompted in response to the failure of the 2008 NICE guidance to produce significant improvements in diagnosis of FH in England. The Medway FH Audit Tool enabled the identification of patients at risk of FH from data already available within the patients' electronic primary care clinical record. It was piloted in a single practice in September 2011 to test and optimise performance, and in October 2011 it was rolled out across the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) (then a Primary Care Trust). The audit first identified patients already diagnosed with FH or possible FH, thus providing a baseline prevalence. Next, all undiagnosed patients with elevated total cholesterol and/or LDL-C were identified and those previously assessed using the Simon Broome criteria were excluded. On-screen prompts highlighted these 'at risk and unscreened' patients to the GP for assessment and diagnosis using the Simon Broome criteria when the patient was next consulted. In addition, a list of patients in need of assessment could be generated at practice level. At a CCG level, patient numbers could be seen to monitor progress and target support. In October 2011, the baseline prevalence of FH within Medway CCG (population 260,000) was 0.13% (one in 750), and 0.59% of patients (around 1600) were 'at risk and unscreened'. In 2 years, the prevalence of patients diagnosed with FH within the Medway CCG increased by 0.09% to 0.22%, increasing from one in 750 patients to one in 450. However, the proportion of patients at risk and unscreened remained the same. In October 2013, an FH Nurse Advisor Programme was introduced into the CCG with the aim of further improving the rate of diagnosis of FH in Medway. From initiation of the FH Nurse Advisor Programme in October 2013 until programme end in July 2014 (9 months), the prevalence of patients diagnosed with FH within Medway CCG increased to 0.28% (one in 357). Following the programme, the proportion of patients at risk and unscreened reduced by three-quarters to 0.14%. HEART UK acknowledge all who have contributed to and supported the work of the audit, in particular the members of the Medway FH Audit Steering Committee, the GP practices within Medway CCG and Sanofi for their support of the project. HEART UK is encouraged by the success of this model and will advocate its rollout to CCGs across England. In the long term, such programmes will improve diagnosis with the inevitable benefit of better management and treatment and ultimately prevention of CHD in these patients.7 kEY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The Medway FH Audit Tool is incorporated into other CCGs and GP IT systems throughout England. 2. An FH Nurse Advisor Programme is supported and established within each participating CCG to further improve diagnosis and treatment. 3. The FH Nurse Advisor Programme is expanded and all patients 'at risk and unscreened' are invited to a clinic for assessment. 4. A Practice Nurse is assigned to the FH Nurse Advisor Programme and attends clinics to gain education and training, to enable them to continue testing and managing FH patients after completion of the programme, thus leaving a lasting legacy and providing continuity of care. 5. Patient participation in future programmes is improved by addressing the methods used to engage and encourage patients to attend FH Nurse Advisor clinics. To support these recommendations HEART U k will: 6. Continue to support GP practices within Medway and those in other CCGs adopting the model with provision of primary care guidance materials. 7. Support the integration of primary care FH diagnosis with secondary care referral for specialist management, including genetic testing, through its advocacy and projects of the FH Implementation Team. 8. Engage with secondary care facilities to support any potential increase in FH patient diagnosis within the CCG to ensure they are prepared for and are aware of the potential numbers of new diagnoses (based on the Medway practice, this could be a doubling of cases). 9. Continue to promote public awareness of the health risk of elevated cholesterol, the importance of knowing your family history and the importance of an FH diagnosis to yourself and family members. 10. Encourage patient participation and facilitate patient support groups through the HEART UK Ambassador programme.8 INTRODUCTION Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a relatively common autosomal dominant lipid disorder that confers a lifelong risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) because of highly raised low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). 1 FH is one of the most common inherited disorders, with an estimated prevalence of one in 500 (0.2%), but more recent estimates suggest that the prevalence may be much higher, approaching one in 200 (0.5%). 2,3 These prevalence estimates indicate that worldwide between 14 million and 34 million people are likely to have FH, with some 1.8-4.5 million in Europe and at least 120,000 in the UK. The European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) estimates that less than 1% of patients are diagnosed in most countries, although there are exceptions, for example Norway. 2 Untreated, the elevated LDL-C that characterises FH leads to a greater than 50% risk of CHD in men by the age of 50 years and at least 30% in women by the age of 60 years. 4 Effective treatments for FH include lifestyle modification, including dietary fat restriction, exercise and avoidance of smoking, and lipid-lowering treatments such as HMG CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl co-enzyme A) reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins). Statins are an effective therapy and clinical trials have shown CHD risk reductions of up to 80% compared with that of the general population, especially if treatment is initiated prior to the onset of CHD. 5,6 The early onset of atherosclerosis caused by FH emphasises the importance of early identification and effective therapeutic intervention. In patients with established CHD, the benefits of preventive measures are significantly attenuated. 7 FH is commonly caused by single gene mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and more rarely in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene, which encode for proteins critical for the normal removal of excess LDL-C from the bloodstream. 8 LDLR gene mutations are the most frequent cause of FH, with more than 1200 different mutations identified to date. 9 The majority of people with FH are heterozygotes and have inherited one disease-causing mutation. Heterozygous FH occurs in approximately one in 500 people, and up to one in 70 in certain ethnic groups with founder mutations. 1 Rarely, a person will inherit a genetic mutation from both parents to give them homozygous FH, which affects approximately one in 1 million people. 10 Clinically, the inheritance of two copies of a mutated FH gene results in extremely high LDL-C that requires aggressive lipid-lowering drug therapy and, if available, lipoprotein apheresis from a young age. 2 In populations in which no founder effect has occurred, such as the UK, approximately 40% of people with clinically suspected FH carry an identifiable mutation. 11 Recently, it has been suggested that FH in mutation-negative patients may be caused by an accumulation of common small-effect LDL-C-raising alleles\u2014so-called polygenic FH; 12 however, even when polygenic cases are combined with proven mutations, there remains a substantial proportion of phenotypic FH cases that do not have a genetic diagnosis. 12 The 2013 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Quality Standard for FH (QS41) now recommends that cascade testing resources should be focused on patients with a confirmed diagnosis of monogenic FH, which is the strategy adopted with great success in Holland and in Wales. 13 Although funding for genetic testing for FH is not yet widely available, it is likely that, overall, the use of such testing will improve the cost-effectiveness of the cascade process, since 50% of first-degree relatives will be affected in monogenic families. Under-diagnosis of FH - a major gap in coronary disease prevention It was previously accepted that the prevalence of heterozygous FH was about one in 500, based on calculations using the Hardy-Weinberg equation and the frequency of FH homozygotes; however, recent data suggest that this is an under-estimate. 2 The Copenhagen General Population Study used the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score to establish the clinical diagnosis of FH and determined that the prevalence in individuals classified as definite or probable FH approached one in 200. 2,3 Extrapolations from this range of one in 500 to one in 200 suggest that there are between 120,000 and 300,000 people with FH in the UK. The UK 2010 National Audit of the Management of FH estimated that around 15,000 patients are diagnosed with FH in the UK. 14 This estimate matches closely with a survey in 2008, which showed that approximately 15,000 adults and approximately 500 children with FH were being managed in UK lipid clinics. 14 Estimates vary, but fewer than 12% of cases of FH are diagnosed in the UK. 2 Therefore, at least 100,000 cases of FH are undiagnosed, and this points to severe under-diagnosis and under-treatment of FH in the UK. 14 Despite the 2008 NICE guidelines' recommendation for genetic testing of index cases and cascade testing 4 and the publication of the NICE Quality Standard for the management of FH in August 2013 (QS41), 13 no systematic diagnostic testing programme has yet been introduced in England, although there are active programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 119 Diagnosing FH in index cases The diagnosis of FH relies on five criteria: very high LDL-C on repeat measurements, family history, clinical history of premature CHD, physical examination for xanthomas and corneal arcus, and/or a causative mutation detected by molecular genetics. Secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia should be excluded by establishing that there is no hyperglycaemia or albuminuria and by determining normal levels of liver enzymes, renal function and thyroid hormones. Clinical diagnostic algorithms for FH are well defined, but there is no one internationally agreed algorithm. In the UK, the Simon Broome criteria 1,15 is recommended to evaluate patients with raised LDL-C, especially if there is a personal or family history of premature CHD. A diagnosis of 'definite FH' is made based on total cholesterol >6.7 mmol/L or LDL-C >4.0 mmol/L in a >7.5 mmol/L or LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L in an adult plus the presence of tendon xanthomas in the patient or a first-degree or second-degree relative, or the identification of an FH- Definite FH Possible FH Total cholesterol >6.7 mmol/L or LDL-C >4.0 mmol/L in a child >7.5 mmol/L mmol/L in cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L or LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L in an adult PLUS AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING Tendon xanthomas in the patient or a first-degree (parent, sibling or child) or second-degree relative (grandparent, uncle or aunt) ORDNA-based evidence of an LDLR mutation, familial defective APOB-100, PCSK9 mutationA family of myocardial infarction: <50 years of age in second-degree relative or <60 years of age in first-degree relative ORA family history of raised total cholesterol: >7.5 mmol/L in an adult first-degree or second-degree relative mmol/L in a child or sibling aged <16 yearsTable 1: The Simon Broome Register criteria (total cholesterol and LDL-C levels either pre-treatment or highest on treatment) 1, 15causing mutation. A diagnosis of 'possible FH' is made if there are no tendon xanthomas but a family history of myocardial infarction (aged <50 years in a second-degree relative or <60 years in a first-degree relative) or a family history of raised total cholesterol (>7.5 mmol/L in an adult first-degree or second-degree relative or >6.7 mmol/L in a child or sibling aged <16 years) (Table 1). In Europe, the DLCN criteria is widely used and calculates a numerical score to predict the probability of diagnosing FH. This scoring system is increasingly accepted as simple and comprehensive 16, categorising patients as having definite, probable or possible FH1 (Table 2).10 GROUP Score GROUP 1: FAMILY HISTORY First-degree relative with known premature coronary and/or vascular disease (men <55 years, women <60 years) OR First-degree relative with known LDL-C above the 95th percentile for arcus cornealis <18 years LDL-C above the 95th percentile for age and sex2 GROUP 2: CLINICAL HISTORY Patient with premature coronary artery disease (ages as above) 2 Patient with premature cerebral or peripheral vascular disease (as above) 1 GROUP 3: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Tendinous xanthomata 6 Arcus cornealis prior to age 45 years 4 GROUP 4: LDL-C (mmol/L) 8.5 8 6.5-8.4 5 5.0-6.4 3 4.0-4.9 1 GROUP 5: DNA ANALYSIS Functional mutation in the LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 gene 8 SCORE >8 Definite FH 6-8 Probable FH 3-5 Possible FH 0-2 Unlikely FHTable 2: DLCN score for FH1 In the US, the MEDPED system was developed to help improve FH diagnosis and treatment. This algorithm relies on plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C and strictly requires that cholesterol measurements are known in first-degree family members. 16 The Japanese criteria is comparable with the Simon Broome criteria but uses population-specific LDL-C measurements and includes radiographic diagnosis of Achilles tendon xanthomata. 16The presence of an FH-causing mutation provides a definitive diagnosis of the disorder, and in the UK approximately 40% of people with clinically suspected FH carry an identifiable mutation. 11 Based on the Simon Broome criteria, a UK study identified mutations in 73% of patients with 'definite FH' and 30% of patients with 'possible FH'. 17 Using the DLCN score, mutations were detected in 54% of patients with definite FH (>8), 39% with probable FH (6-8) and 28% with possible FH (3-5). 1711 Cascade testing Cascade testing is a mechanism for identifying people at risk for a genetic condition, such as FH, by a process of systematic family tracing. For FH, cascade testing of close relatives who carry a 50% risk of the disorder is a recommended and cost-effective approach to diagnosing new patients. 4 Cascade testing for FH can be performed using phenotypic (clinical features) or genotypic approaches, but cascade testing based on an identified pathogenic mutation is more accurate and cost effective. 18 In the Netherlands, systematic sassessment and family cascade testing was established in 1994 19 and has led to the diagnosis of more than 33,000 patients with FH to date. 2 Based on a population prevalence of one in 500, the programme has identified more than 70% of the expected number of cases of FH in the Netherlands. In the UK, cascade testing initiatives have been established in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but there is no systematic programme established in England. Identifying relatives allows for significant health-affecting interventions to be administered, which can extend life expectancy significantly, especially if administered before the onset of CHD. It is estimated that cascade testing may identify approximately 50% of people with FH (at least as estimated for the UK population) 4; therefore, to further improve FH diagnosis, other strategies are required to identify new index cases. Cascade testing from an index case - making a difference to a family's risk of CHD Hazel Gallagher was a fit, healthy, young mum of two who ate well, did not smoke and played competitive squash. No-one would have suspected that she had dangerously elevated cholesterol levels. Hazel was diagnosed with FH after visiting a Consultant to discuss an unrelated health issue. The Consultant noticed that Hazel had the visible signs of xanthoma on her knuckles and Achilles heel. A blood test revealed a total cholesterol level of 9.8 mmol/L, she was diagnosed with FH and immediately prescribed lipid-lowering therapy. Following Hazel's diagnosis, family cascade testing was initiated. Both of her children\u2014James aged 2 and Darren aged 8\u2014were diagnosed and treatment initiated, and her sister, niece and mother were all diagnosed. Hazel had a significant family history of CHD; her uncle had died of 'hardening of the arteries' in his 40s, leaving behind four sons who all developed heart disease in their 30s. Two years ago, Hazel's diagnosis was confirmed by mutation testing and two of her grandchildren were found to also carry the FH mutation. Her eldest grandchild (aged 5 years) is already receiving treatment. Hazel says \"DNA testing is so much less invasive for a small child, as it only requires a small sample of saliva rather than a blood sample.\" Cascade testing has now traced five generations of FH in Hazel's family, from her grandmother down to her 3-year-old granddaughter. Originally prescribed a bile acid sequestrant (Questran), Hazel has subsequently been treated with all the available cholesterol-lowering drugs. She took part in a clinical trial for a statin in 1985. Thirty years on, Hazel continues to be treated with statins and has tolerated them well. Hazel did not conform to the typical 'high cholesterol' stereotype and her opportunistic diagnosis may not have happened at such a young age but for the interest of her Consultant. Hazel became a pioneering patient advocate for raising awareness of FH and was one of the two founders of the 'Family Heart Association', now flourishing as 'HEART UK'. She is a passionate supporter of the Medway FH audit and the systematic approach to diagnosing new cases of FH within primary care. She is the HEART UK patient representative on the Medway Audit Steering Committee and said \"I really welcome this approach to help increase the identification of index FH cases. The audit supports GPs to make a diagnosis of FH and raises awareness within primary care of the hereditary aspect to high cholesterol that is distinct from acquired high cholesterol. Patients are not always old with a poor diet and an unhealthy lifestyle\". Having FH has not prevented Hazel from doing anything she wants to do. After being diagnosed, she went on to become a world-class master sprinter and continues to keep extremely fit through cycling and walking. \"People need to understand that diagnosis of FH can be simple and is easily treated and managed. It is the not knowing that could kill you.\" 12 NICE guidance In 2008, NICE published its evidence-based clinical guideline for the identification and management of FH [4]. The guidance recommends that: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) should consider the possibility of FH in adults with raised cholesterol (total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L), especially when there is a personal or family history of premature CHD; HCPs should exclude secondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia before a diagnosis; The Simon Broome criteria is used to establish a diagnosis and; All patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH be offered a DNA test to confirm their diagnosis and to aid diagnosis among relatives. The guidelines advocate cascade testing using the mutation identified in the index case for all first-degree, second-degree and, when possible, third-degree biological relatives. In the absence of a DNA-based diagnosis, cascade testing using LDL-C concentration measurements should be undertaken to identify people with FH. In this case, age-specific and gender-specific cut-offs for determining affected, non-affected or undecided status are recommended. 20 The NICE FH Quality Standard lists eight key priorities (Table 3). 13 In light of the finding that a significant proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH but with no identified mutation are likely to have a polygenic and not monogenic cause of their elevated LDL-C levels, 12 the Quality Standard now recommends that 'Relatives of people with a confirmed diagnosis of monogenic FH are offered DNA testing through a nationwide, systematic cascade process', 13 emphasising the importance of DNA testing to focus cascade testing on the families at greatest risk. QUALITY STATEMENT 1 Diagnosis Adults with a baseline total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L are assessed for a clinical diagnosis of FH 2 Specialist referral People with a clinical diagnosis of FH are referred for specialist assessment 3 DNA testing People with a clinical diagnosis of FH are offered DNA testing as part of a specialist assessment 4 Diagnosis in children under 10 yearsChildren at risk of FH are offered diagnostic tests by the age of 10 years 5 Cascade testing Relatives of people with a confirmed diagnosis of monogenic FH are offered DNA testing through a nationwide, systematic cascade process 6 Drug treatment in adults Adults with FH receive lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline 7 Drug treatment in childrenChildren with FH are assessed for lipid-modifying drug treatment by a specialist with expertise in FH in a child-focused setting by the age of 10 years 8 Annual review People with FH are offered a structured review at least annuallyTable 3: The NICE Quality Standard* for FH 13 *NICE Quality Standards are concise sets of prioritised statements designed to drive measurable quality improvements within a particular area of health or care. They are derived from the best available evidence such as NICE guidance and other evidence sources accredited by NICE. They are developed independently by NICE, in collaboration with health and social care professionals, their partners and service users.13 Saving lives: the benefits of identifying FH In 2012, HEART UK published Saving lives, saving families, which described the health, social and economic advantages of diagnosing and managing FH. 21 The health economic modelling, commissioned by the HEART UK Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Implementation Team, demonstrated the financial and health benefits of cascade testing and use of optimal statin treatment through quality-adjusted life-years gained and cardiovascular events avoided. The report estimates that appropriate management and treatment of every 1000 FH patients (between the ages of 35 and 85 years) would lead to 101 fewer cardiovascular deaths when compared with no treatment. Overall, the potential savings to the UK are almost \u00a3380 million from CHD events avoided if all relatives of FH index cases are identified and appropriately treated. More realistically, if 50% of patients with FH are diagnosed and treated, the NHS could save \u00a31.7 million per year on health treatment otherwise required for CHD, but not implementing cascade testing is costing the NHS \u00a31.4 million per year. 21 \"The greater the number of FH patients identified and treated, the greater the comparative and accrued health benefits and cost savings to the NHS.\"14 BOX 1: Medway CCG Cuxton & Halling There are 56 GP practicesChatham central 53 Participated in audit 280,000 patientsExpected FH cases 560 (one in 500) to 1400 (one in 200)Primary care provides an opportunity to systematically identify index FH cases for diagnosis and treatment via data held within GP IT systems. GP practices are essential in managing patients with elevated cholesterol and as points of referral to secondary care. 21 The Medway FH audit was prompted in response to the 2008 NICE guidance 4, which was failing to produce significant improvements in diagnosis of FH in England. The Medway Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) in Kent comprises 56 GP practices. Fifty-three practices took part in the audit (Appendix A), serving approximately 280,000 patients (data accurate at July 2014) (Box 1). Across the Medway CCG, the recorded prevalence of FH is significantly below the level predicted for the UK. Whilst the NHS Health Check programme will identify raised cholesterol in those who attend, those with undiagnosed FH would benefit from earlier diagnosis and treatment. Virtually all GP practices are now computerised, and surgeries have been recording patient data within their IT systems for more than 20 years. 22 These clinical IT systems contain information about cholesterol measurements, a personal history of early ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or a history of a relative with early IHD or raised cholesterol. Major diseases are coded, via the NHS-wide, alpha-numeric coding system of Read Codes. Read Codes are designed to record the MEDWAY FH AUDIT everyday care of a patient and enable computerised patient records to be electronically searched. In order to support the Medway audit, additional Read Codes were requested to allow a code for possible FH, probable FH, and DLCN scores, as well as additional modifications made to existing codes. Technology in the form of 'Audit +' (BMJ Informatica) 23 is in use in GP surgeries, helping practices deliver best practice care through prompts during consultations for a variety of diseases. Prompts built into GP systems can help them achieve improvements in patient care and can be applied to any area requiring improvement that can be audited/measured using Read Codes or numeric or demographic information. The use of prompts, as well as audit reports, acts as a performance-enhancing tool. In collaboration with BMJ Informatica, Dr Peter Green, Chief Clinical Officer of Medway CCG (see Box 2), has established a suite of audits utilising the Audit + software to support GP practices to deliver the CCG's first three strategic objectives: prevention, early diagnosis and better care. The Audit + software is compatible with multiple GP clinical platforms and is loaded remotely onto GP clinical systems, requiring no additional work for the practices or clinicians. At Medway, it was felt that the diagnosis of FH was amenable to the Audit + software and an audit was instigated to increase the diagnosis of FH within the CCG.15 Dr Peter Green is the Chief Clinical Officer of Medway CCG and a GP with more than 20 years of experience. Pete has a special interest in quality of care and the systems that can be developed to support this. His interest in medical audit systems led to him becoming Chair of the Medway Medical Audit Advisory Group and Co-Chair of the West Kent Medical Audit Advisory Group. He also works with the British Medical Journal's Health Analytics division to help identify areas where care for patients can be improved by the use of technology within a consultation and information collated at practice and CCG levels. In 2007, Pete was appointed Medical Director of NHS Medway Primary Care Trust (PCT) and remained a Co-Medical Director of the NHS Kent and Medway PCT Cluster until the formation of CCGs in April 2013. During his time as Medical Director, he has held roles as Director of Quality for all aspects of commissioned and provided care, Director of Commissioning for all acute, community and primary care services, and Director of Performance for all registered GPs, pharmacists, dentists and optometrists. He oversaw improvements in the quality of General Practice measured by the National Quality and Outcomes Framework to being above those of neighbouring PCTs. He works as a GP 1 day a week, which he sees as essential in helping him keep in touch with what's happening from a patient's perspective. Pete has always seen his involvement in the PCT, and now the CCG, as an extension of what he and many other GPs do on a daily basis when seeing patients: to lessen the risk of them becoming unwell and helping them to get better if they do.BOX 2: Dr Peter Green, Chief Clinical Officer, Medway CCG Medway FH Audit Tool The Medway FH Audit Tool, developed in accordance with the Royal College of GPs' standard criteria for audits, was prompted by the NICE clinical guidance for FH 4 and the National Quality and Outcomes Framework for measuring improvements in GP practices. 24 The aim of the FH Audit Tool was to enable the identification of patients who are at risk of FH from electronic databases in primary care. Patients were identified if they had elevated cholesterol levels, but had not yet been diagnosed or screened via the Simon Broome criteria ('at risk and unscreened'). On-screen prompts highlighted these patients to the GP for assessment, diagnosis and appropriate management. In addition, a list of patients in need of evaluation could be generated at practice level. At a CCG level, the numbers of patients (but not the names or any patient identifiable data) could be seen to monitor progress and target support.16 PHASE I - ESTABLISHING THE BASELINE AND IMPROVING FH DIAGNOSIS NICE guidance recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of 'definite FH' or 'possible FH' based on the Simon Broome criteria are managed in the same way. The NICE guidelines were initially difficult to implement as there was no NHS Read Code for 'possible FH'. The Read Code for possible FH was provided by the NHS in June 2010 and the audit was planned. The FH Audit Tool was piloted in a single practice in September 2011 to test and optimise performance. In October 2011, the Audit Tool was rolled out across the CCG (then a PCT). Practices across the Medway CCG were familiar with the Audit + software and the audit process and no additional training was required at initiation of the audit but practices were supplied with information on FH and the Simon Broome criteria. The audit first identified patients already diagnosed with FH or possible FH, thus providing a baseline prevalence. Next, all undiagnosed patients with elevated total cholesterol and/or LDL-C (Table 4) were identified and those previously assessed using the Simon Broome criteria were excluded. From this, the Audit Tool produced a list of patients 'at risk and unscreened' for each practice, and added prompts to these patients' notes, which appeared when the clinician saw the patient, recommending them to be assessed using the Simon Broome criteria. Those who met the criteria were diagnosed as having FH or possible FH. In addition, the audit contained a series of triggers that encouraged further management steps at the point of consultation, allowing systematic patient evaluation (see Table 5). Audits could be conducted within practices on a daily basis. At the CCG level, audits could be conducted weekly, but progress was monitored monthly. Formal re-audit and comparison with the baseline was performed at 2 years.

Triggers and prompts within the Medway FH Audit Tool17 Results: Establishing the baseline Baseline FH prevalence: The audit identified patients already diagnosed with FH or possible FH and established the baseline prevalence of FH within Medway CCG of 0.13% (one in 750) (Figure 1; Table 6). Baseline 'at risk and unscreened': The audit identified the baseline 'at risk and unscreened' prevalence of FH within Medway CCG of 0.59% (Figure 1; Table 6). Estimated diagnostic workload: In the context of a GP practice with a population of 10,000 patients, there would be approximately 60 'at risk and unscreened' patients. 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 0.0050.59 Possible FH% of patientsFigure 1: Medway FH Audit results at baseline (October 2011) NUMBER POPULATION PREVALENCE (%) FH* 331 262, 030 0.13 Possible FH* 12 262,030 0.005 Total FH 343 262,030 0.13 At risk and unscreened 1553 262,030 0.59 * FH diagnoses made by Simon Broome criteriaTable 6: Medway FH Audit Tool results at baseline (October 2011)FH diagnoses made by Simon Broome criteria; Patients were considered to be 'at risk and unscreened' if they had a total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/L and/or LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L and had not been assessed using the Simon Broome criteria.18 Re-audit at 2 years FH prevalence after 2 years: Re-audit showed a substantial increase in the prevalence of diagnosed FH, increasing to 0.22% (one in 450) (Figure 2; Table 7).

The decision to implement the programme was in response to feedback from participating GPs towards the end of Phase I of the audit that highlighted a need for additional resources to assess patients at risk and to diagnose FH. It was intended that the FH Nurse Advisor Programme would assist practitioners with the implementation of the 2008 NICE Clinical guidelines 4 and that patients would receive optimal management following a clinical assessment and possible secondary care referral. Overall, it was intended that this programme would support a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients through raised awareness, education and early identification of FH. At this point, a decision was made to revise the audit and incorporate the DLCN score to define the severity of FH and support clinical management. New Read Codes for DLCN score and probable FH were requested and issued. The six sections of the current Medway FH Audit Tool are shown in Box 3.The FH Nurse Advisor Programme was a collaboration between NHS Medway CCG and HEART UK, supported by Sanofi. Ashfield Healthcare provided the service and employed the Nurse Advisor. A single Nurse Advisor was appointed and visited all practices (Box 4).1. FH (definite, possible, probable) 2.

Family history of FH (*all FH = all definite, possible and probable cases)BOX 3: The six sections of the Medway FH Audit Tool Tanya Sanders was a Community Matron and is currently employed by Ashfield Healthcare Ltd as an FH Nurse Advisor. Tanya's nursing career spans over 20 years beginning at Basingstoke & Winchester School of Nursing, where she qualified as a Registered General Nurse in 1994. She spent several years broadening her nursing experience both in the UK and abroad and covered various fields including vascular surgery, oncology and nursing recruitment. In 2000 she began a career in accident and emergency (A&E) nursing at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, eventually becoming an Emergency Nurse Practitioner. In 2010, she left A&E to become a Community Matron, a particularly challenging role that involved the management of patients with multiple complex long-term conditions. Tanya has a BSc in Health and Social care and completed her FH training with HEART UK in 2013.BOX 4: Medway FH Nurse Advisor 21 Governance The FH Nurse Advisor was governed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council Code of Professional Conduct and was subject to pre-employment checks, which include references, qualification verification, competency assessment, Disclosure and Barring Service checks (enhanced disclosure) and pre-employment vaccination assessment. Ashfield Healthcare is registered with the Care Quality Commission (England and Wales and the equivalent bodies for Scotland and Northern Ireland) for the purposes of the delivery of healthcare services. The FH Nurse Advisor Programme adhered to The Ashfield Healthcare Clinical Governance and Risk Management Framework, The Health and Social Care Act 2008 updated 2012, Caldicott Guidelines, The Data Protection Act 1998, and the NICE guideline for identification and management of FH. Initial programme set-up The FH Nurse Advisor contacted each Practice Manager to arrange an initial meeting with key practice personnel, including an identified lead GP, Practice Nurse and Receptionist. The initial meeting was structured to cover: Programme objectives Service operating procedure Audit criteria The cascade letterDuring the initial meeting a contract was agreed and signed between the practice and the Nurse Advisor provider, which set out the conditions of the service the FH Nurse Advisor would provide to the practice and granted their legitimate access to patient data. The service provided by the FH Nurse Advisor consisted of three main components: Audit list validation FH Nurse patient clinics Administration visit Audit list validation Before any patients were invited to the clinic, the FH Nurse Advisor reviewed the audit list to identify if any clinical or non-clinical parameters were missing in individual patient records that would prevent the DLCN score being calculated. Any missing clinical parameters were sought from the relevant HCP and the DLCN score was calculated; for those patients for whom non-clinical parameters were missing, an invitation to the FH clinic was issued and subsequently the DLCN score calculated. The management pathway of each patient was based on the DLCN score as calculated by the FH Nurse Advisor (Table 8; Figure 4). DLCN SCORE RISk CATEGORY ACTION >8 Definite FH Referred to GP for further assessment and management followed by a review by the FH Nurse Advisor for education and discussion 6-8 Probable FH Referred to GP for further assessment and management followed by a review by the FH Nurse for education and discussion 3-5 Possible FH Patient referred to other HCPs if necessary and as appropriate (blood pressure check, lifestyle advice etc.)Table 8: DLCN scores used to determine patient management pathway for the FH Nurse Advisor Programme22 FH Nurse patient clinics All patients identified in the audit list validation process who met the inclusion criteria for an FH Nurse Advisor review and had been scored as having a high or probable risk of FH were invited to clinic in the form of a patient invitation letter (Appendix B1) issued by the GP practice staff. Appointments were made at approximately 30-minute intervals to allow adequate time to provide individualised patient education and lifestyle advice. At the clinic, each patient was provided with a copy of the Patient Service User Guide (Appendix B2) and a leaflet explaining FH 25 and the purpose of the clinic was explained. The FH Nurse answered any questions and obtained written consent (Appendix B3). During the appointment, clinical examination for xanthoma or corneal arcus was conducted, family history and cascade testing were discussed, and patients were provided with cascade letters to pass onto their first-degree relatives (Appendix B4). The role of lifestyle factors and family history were discussed with the patient and information and advice were provided, which were aimed at improving patient concordance to prescribed hypercholesterolaemia medication and increasing the patient's understanding of their disease using a HEART UK fact sheet. 26 The FH Nurse Advisors role was limited to discussing the disease severity and any identified management issues for each patient based on the clinical assessment and NICE guidelines.Patients attending the clinic were offered the opportunity to provide feedback on the quality of the services that they had received via a questionnaire (Appendix B5). In the event of a patient not attending their clinic appointment, the FH Nurse Advisor discussed the patient with the GP practice lead clinician for appropriate follow-up by the practice. Administration visit Following each patient clinic, the FH Nurse Advisor arranged a suitable date for an 'Administrative Clinic' with the practice lead to ensure all clinical findings were documented in the patient's electronic clinical record. If not already carried out, an individual DLCN score was calculated by the FH Nurse Advisor for each patient. Medical interventions were decided by the GP based on the findings and the individual score for each patient. Patients identified as having definite FH were recommended for referral to secondary care for specialist management. Patients with probable or possible FH were recommended for management in primary care, but were to be referred to secondary care if their cholesterol levels did not stabilise, if their relatives had required more intensive specialist management, or if they had a particularly prominent family history of vascular events.

The Nurse Advisor Programme conducted 116 audit reviews and reviewed 1505 patients, of which 210 patients were invited for clinic visits, and 109 (52%) attended. FH prevalence: From initiation of the FH Nurse Advisor Programme in October 2013 until programme end in July 2014 (9 months), the prevalence of patients diagnosed with FH within Medway CCG increased to 0.28% (one in 357) (Figure 5; Table 9). 'At risk and unscreened': Following the programme, this had reduced to 0.14% (Figure 5; Table 9).

All of the respondents felt that the approachability of the FH Nurse Advisor was either excellent (86%) or very good (14%) (Figure 6). This was mirrored in the patients' views of the level of service knowledge demonstrated by the FH Nurse Advisor, with 98% responding as either excellent or very good and the remaining 2% as good (Figure 6). 86% Excellent14% Very good 2% GoodApproachability of FH Nurse Advisor 82% Excellent16% Very good Level of service knowledge demonstrated by FH Nurse Advisor\"Ident ified patients with possible FH whom otherwise may have been missed\"\"An excellent service that is very beneficial to patients and supp ortive to GPs\" \"Very informative and explained much better than before\" \"Better data input is required by GP practices\"\"Has prompted me to re-evaluate my lifest yle and diet to see if I c an make further changes\"Figure 6: Patient feedback from FH Nurse Advisor Programme97% (62/64) of patients felt that the FH patient review service met their expectations and only 5% (3/64) felt that it could be improved in some way.25 Recommended improvements to FH Nurse Advisor Programme Increasing the number of patients invited to attend the clinic To aid accurate diagnosis, future programmes could consider clinic assessment for all patients identified as 'at risk and unscreened'. At the clinic, missing information could be obtained and secondary comorbidities identified to allow an accurate assessment and appropriate referral onto specialist treatment (e.g. lipid specialist or diabetes care). This would increase the workload of the FH Nurse Advisor; however, the proposal is not unmanageable, with an estimated 60 patients flagged for a clinic review in a practice of 10,000 patients (based on the proportion of patients unscreened at the beginning of the FH Nurse Advisor Programme), which would equate to 10 FH clinics with six patients seen per clinic. Improving communication, education and leaving a sustainable legacy Communication between the FH Nurse Advisor and the GP was often via the Practice Manager, with the potential for information to be misinterpreted. Direct contact between the GP and FH Nurse Advisor would be ideal, but this would add pressure to a GP's already busy schedule. To improve future programmes, a Practice Nurse could be assigned as the practice lead and primary contact for the FH Nurse Advisor. The Practice Nurse would attend the patient clinics, providing an opportunity for training and education, and would allow the Practice Nurse to continue assessing, diagnosing and appropriately managing FH within the practice after the FH Nurse Advisor Programme ended. Based on the audit data after the FH Nurse Advisor Programme, around 0.14% of patients would require evaluation and 0.28% would require management. In real terms these numbers are small: in a practice of 10,000 patients, 15 patients would be 'at risk and unscreened', with around 30 patients diagnosed with FH requiring management.Improving clinic attendance The number of patients attending the clinic was low (52%). Future programmes need to encourage greater patient participation, and this could be achieved by: Revising the current patient invitation letter to include a more detailed explanation of the programme and the familial aspect of high cholesterol; Providing contact details for either the FH Nurse Advisor or the practice lead to allow patients to ask questions prior to or after the clinic; Involving a local FH Patient Ambassador as a peer-to-peer voice to endorse the importance of the programme; Running evening clinics to make it easier for those patients who work to attend; Adding a prompt to the Audit Tool to flag to GPs patients who did not attend a clinic and allow an 'opportunistic' follow-up when the patient next visited the practice; Providing the option of completing a self-assessment template at home in paper format returnable via a stamped addressed envelope or accessible online via a webpage. Improving practice participation Identification of a GP and nurse lead within each practice was essential to ensure practice buy-in and assist with coordination of the programme. Practice participation was relatively high at 89%, and of the non-participating practices, most were small, with time and resource constraints. Improving practice participation in future programmes could be achieved by additional support from the CCG during the set-up of the programme; a key opinion leader within the CCG and/or a patient champion could advocate the importance of FH diagnosis and the CCG could also incentivise involvement for all practices.26 IMPROVING FH PREVALENCE, DECREASING THE NUMBERS AT RIS k AND UNSCREENED FH is a common disorder that remains under-diagnosed and untreated. 2 Recent NICE Quality Standard guidance13, EAS guidelines2 and guidance from the International FH Foundation16 has recognised this as a significant issue to be addressed. In addition, the recent Department of Health Cardiovascular Outcomes Strategy recognised improving identification of inherited cardiac conditions, and FH in particular, as a strategic priority and action. 27 Baseline Two years FH Nurse Advisor Programme0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.000.130.28 1/357Figure 7: Summary of the Medway FH audit results at baseline, after 2 years and after the introduction of the FH Nurse Advisor ProgrammeThe Medway Audit model provides a solution to the challenge of improving diagnosis of FH within primary care. The Audit + software and Medway FH Audit Tool and prompts running in the background on GP IT systems improved diagnosis of FH, but the number of patients 'at risk and unscreened' remained the same. The FH Nurse Advisor Programme not only increased the number of FH diagnoses, it also reduced the number of patients 'at risk and unscreened' by almost three-quarters (Figure 7). The Medway CCG model could be adopted by other CCGs within England to improve diagnosis, awareness and management of FH in primary care.27 EATING THE FH ELEPHANT Many GPs and CCGs consider reviewing their patient population to identify FH a mammoth and daunting task. The Medway FH Audit Tool utilises information contained within a GPs IT system and produces a list of patients 'at risk and unscreened' for each GP practice. The Medway FH audit data suggest that in a large practice of more than 10,000 patients, initially around 60 patients would be flagged for review by the GP practice, either at the patient's next visit or by systematic assessment such as that conducted in the FH Nurse Advisor Programme. Once diagnosed, based on the audit numbers, a large practice of 10,000 patients would be managing approximately 30 patients and smaller practices with fewer than 2000 patients would have around five patients to manage. Within the Medway CCG, the Medway FH Audit Tool reduced the numbers to screen from 280,000 (the number of patients within the Medway CCG) to approximately 1600 patients at risk and unscreened. The Audit Tool and prompts in conjunction with the FH Nurse Advisor Programme led to the diagnosis of 776 patients with FH (Figure 8). Medway CCG 280,000 patients Audit 1,600 unscreenedActive Review 398 unscreened776 diagnoses in CCG Figure 8: Reducing the FH \"elephant\" to a manageable taskImportantly, improving diagnosis and treatment of FH helps CCGs and other agencies fulfil their role in the delivery of quality healthcare in accordance with Government policy and clinical guidance. Relevant framework and guidelines include: The NHS Outcomes Framework (with impact on Domain 1 - preventing people dying prematurely; Domain 2 - enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions; and Domain 4 - ensuring people have a positive experience of care); 24 The NICE FH guidelines (CG71);4 The NICE Quality Standard on FH (QS41);13 The Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy (2003), with its aspiration to find and treat at least 50% of cases of FH in England. 2728 ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF DIAGNOSING FH In 2012, HEART Uk published Saving lives, saving families.21 The report includes economic modelling that demonstrates the health and cost savings that can be made through improved identification and treatment of FH using methodology recommended in NICE guidelines (CG71). 4 key findings of the research: High-intensity treatment, compared with low-intensity or no treatment, results in greater reductions in LDL-C and major cardiovascular events, which translates into more quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. High-intensity treatment will mean 101 cardiovascular deaths are avoided per 1000 FH patients (aged 30-85 years) when compared with no treatment. If 50% of patients with FH are diagnosed and treated optimally over a 55-year period, \u00a394.7 million (\u00a31.97 million per 1000 cases) can be saved by the NHS (through reduced cardiovascular events), or \u00a31.7 million per year. By not implementing cascade testing as recommended by NICE (identifying 50% of potential relatives cases), the NHS is losing \u00a31.4 million per year.A recent paper by Pears and colleagues 28 examined three alternative models of care for FH: specialist led, primary care led, and a dual care model in which primary care manages the majority of patients in the cascade testing pathway. The authors concluded that costs for all three models are now less than 50% of the cost of the original estimates undertaken by NICE. By using the latest statin costs, reducing the proportion of patients prescribed more expensive proprietary owned rosuvastatin and managing more patients with FH in primary care, providing an FH service is now much more affordable than predicted by NICE in 2008. Pears and colleagues assessed their models in a population of 1.95 million, estimating the dual care model to cost \u00a31.89 million over 10 years. If we extrapolate the figure for the Medway population (280,000), the dual care model will cost approximately \u00a3271,551 over 10 years. Such a programme would include the cost of medicines, management in primary care, referral for specialist attention and genetic testing, and assessment of family members. Ultimately, this would generate savings for the NHS, by reducing the number of cardiovascular events.29 NEXT STEPS AND SUSTAINABILITY Rolling out to other GP practices and CCGs The Medway FH audit programme provides a transferrable model that can be used to improve the detection of FH in primary care. The Audit + software and Medway tool and prompts can be readily integrated into other GP practices and implemented within other CCGs. The FH Nurse Advisor Programme provides a useful model to increase diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with FH within primary care. HEART UK is currently in discussions with BMJ Informatica and relevant agencies (eg, CCGs) to make the Audit Tool and prompts widely available to GPs. In addition, HEART UK is seeking support to extend the FH Nurse Advisor Programme beyond the Medway region. GP information packs To continue to support GP practices within the Medway CCG, GP practices have been provided with a primary care guidance pack from HEART UK (Appendix C). The packs contain information about FH, including links to the HEART UK FH toolkit, 29 HEART UK patient information leaflets26 and a series of publications sponsored by HEART UK and published in the Primary Care Cardiovascular Journal. 30 Referral to secondary care NICE guidance recommends that HCPs should offer all people with a diagnosis of FH referral to a specialist with expertise in FH for confirmation of clinical diagnosis with DNA testing and initiation of cascade testing of relatives in those patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis. 4, 13 There was concern at the outset that increasing the diagnosis of FH could stretch secondary care resources. Within the Medway FH Nurse Advisor Programme, referral to local lipid clinics was advised for all newly diagnosed cases of FH. However, in many cases, the patient had already been referred and managed in secondary care. Re-referral was advised if the patients' cholesterol levels were not optimised or if their cholesterol levels had risen after being transferred back to primary care. The Medway Audit Steering Committee are currently developing FH referral criteria based on the DLCN score, with consideration of the following: number of living relatives a patient has, whether any relatives with FH require specialist interventions, failure of response to primary care treatment, and willingness to accept more intensive treatment.Genetic testing NICE guidance recommends genetic testing of all index cases and cascade testing of family members as a cost-effective method for identifying new cases of FH. 4 Genetic testing for FH is not yet routine in England and was not included as part of this audit. However, with the new NHS commissioning structure and its commitment to increased investment into genetic sequencing resources, genetic testing of all FH cases is certainly feasible. 11, 31 When available, genetic testing will allow mutation carriers to be distinguished from those with polygenic FH and focus resources on cascade testing in the 40% of clinical FH patients with an identified single gene alteration. 1130 DIAGNOSING FH IN PRIMARY CARE Whilst implementation of cascade testing of current index cases may increase FH diagnosis by 50%21, a systematic strategy for detecting new index cases is essential to improve diagnosis of FH and prevent CHD. Importantly, each new index case is a trigger for cascade testing, whereby further cases can be efficiently discovered. Both methods need to be well integrated if all cases of FH are to be diagnosed. 16 The Medway FH Audit Tool and the FH Nurse Advisor Programme provide a systematic approach for identifying index cases from data already available within GP systems. This model has not only improved diagnosis of FH, it has raised awareness of FH to both GPs and patients within the CCG. The Audit + software is an inexpensive tool that is amenable to most GP IT systems and can be used to increase the diagnosis of FH. The provision of an FH Nurse Advisor can improve diagnosis even further. The FH audit and Nurse Advisor Programme have successfully doubled FH diagnosis in Medway CCG, but the increase in patient numbers is manageable. An important next step is the rollout of this system into other commissioning groups and to engage with secondary care practitioners to establish and support the implications of these programmes to their services. HEART UK is encouraged by the success of this model and will advocate its rollout to out CCGs. In the long term, such programmes will improve diagnosis with the inevitable benefit of better management and treatment and ultimately preventing CHD and alleviating unnecessary anxiety in these patients. An unexpected diagnosis of high cholesterol in a young mother katharine kear was unexpectedly diagnosed with high cholesterol aged 25. Although she had a known family history of CHD, it took several years before she was diagnosed with FH. Even after diagnosis, her four children remained untested and at risk. After reading about the implications of high cholesterol via a newspaper article about FH, katherine embarked on a mission to have her children tested. \"The Medway FH audit is a fantastic initiative; such programmes are essential to diagnose FH. Catching that initial patient does not just benefit them, their whole families can be tested and treated. My diagnosis and that of my children's was a long time coming; such a programme would have made a real difference to my family.\" Katharine's cholesterol was first measured after she visited her GP with white lumps on her eyelids, which were diagnosed as xanthoma. Despite being a slim, fit and healthy non-smoker, her total cholesterol level was 9.8 mmol/L. She was immediately prescribed a statin and advised to see a nutritionist. Katherine had a significant family history of CHD, her mother had CHD and heart by-pass surgery in her 50s and her grandfather died in his early 50s following a heart attack. Katherine's GP suggested that her high cholesterol could be hereditary, but did not suggest FH. Her cholesterol was not monitored any further. Although aware of a potential hereditary aspect to her high cholesterol, Katharine didn't consider the implications this could have for her children, until she read a newspaper article on FH. It was then that Katharine realised the impact that high cholesterol could have on the health of her and her family. Now registered with a different GP practice, she sought re-assessment of her cholesterol and was diagnosed with FH. Recognising the implications for the health of her immediate family, Katharine wanted to establish if she had passed FH on to her four young children; however, she was told that her children were too young to be tested. She was determined to pursue testing, and with the support of her local MP, Katharine and her children were eventually referred for specialist assessment by a lipidologist. Her eldest son did not have raised cholesterol, but for her younger son and daughter (aged 11 and 8 years), a diagnosis of FH was made and treatment was commenced with statins. Her youngest son was too young to be tested. NICE guidance suggests that children are not tested for FH before the age of 2 years. Katherine's diagnosis prompted cascade testing of other family members and several were diagnosed with elevated cholesterol. Initially, Katharine and her two children were reviewed annually by a specialist, but are now managed by their GP. Katharine has not yet had genetic testing for FH, but she is hoping that recent changes in funding will allow her FH mutation status to be confirmed, which will aid diagnosis of further family members. She is concerned about the long-term implications of FH on her children, particularly the risk to a grandchild, and the risk of homozygous FH if her children were to marry someone with FH. Katherine believes that educating GPs about FH is vital and says \"It is a relatively easy disease to treat and manage and diagnosing FH saves lives. The work conducted by the Medway FH is a real step forward.\" 31 REFERENCES 1. Marks D, Thorogood M, Neil HA, et al.

Medway Clinical Commissioning Group partnered with HEART UK and Sanofi to deliver its innovative FH primary care audit project. Following the development and widespread use of an audit prompt in general practice, a nurse was employed to help identify cases of FH, assess patients and provide support and advice for their care. GPs are encouraged to continue to use the FH audit prompt, review identified patients, and further assess first and second degree relatives registered at their practice. These resources aim to provide primary care clinicians with tools that can useful for healthcare professionals and patients alike. The interim project report, Systematically identifying familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care, shows promising results. The full report will be published in October 2014, but the interim report can be viewed at: http://heartuk.org.uk/files/uploads/HEART_UK_FH_Audit_project_interim_report_-_July_2014.pdf Audit information For detailed information on the audit, please see the separate PDF - Medway CCG FH audit. Guidelines and service information HEART UK FH toolkitComprehensive information for clinicians, commissioners and patients to help improve diagnosis and treatment of FH. http://heartuk.org.uk/FHToolkit/NICE Guideline - Identification and management of familial hypercholesterolaemia (CG71)http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG071 NICE FH Quality Standard (QS41) http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs41/chapter/about-this-quality-standard FH diagnostic criteria The diagnosis of FH relies of five criteria: family history, clinical history of premature CHD, physical examination for xanthomas and corneal arcus, very high LDL-C on repeat measurements, and/or a causative mutation detected by molecular genetics. Decisions about genetic testing for FH are largely made by secondary care specialists. Clinical diagnostic tools for FH are well defined, but there is no one internationally-agreed algorithm. In the UK, the Simon Broome criteria is recommended to evaluate patients with raised LDL-C, especially if there is a personal or family history of premature CHD. See Simon Broome criteria at Appendix 1. In Europe, the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Diagnostic Criteria (DLCNC) is widely used and calculates a numerical score predicting the probability of diagnosing FH (Table 1). This criteria is increasingly accepted as simple and comprehensive. 1 The DLCNDC categorises patients as definite, probable or possible FH. In Medway, the Dutch criteria is used to establish the patient's 'score' to indicate the likelihood of FH. 42 GROUP SCORE GROUP 1: FAMILY HISTORY First-degree relative with known premature coronary and/or vascular disease (men <55 years, women <60 years) OR First-degree relative with known LDL-cholesterol above the 95th percentile for with tendinous xanthomata and/or arcus cornealis OR Children aged less than 18 years with LDL-cholesterol above the 95th percentile for age and sex2 GROUP 2: CLINICAL HISTORY Patient with premature coronary artery disease (ages as above) 2 Patient with premature cerebral or peripheral vascular disease (as above) 1 GROUP 3: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Tendinous xanthomata 6 Arcus cornealis prior to age 45 years 4 GROUP 4: LDL-C (mmol/L) LDL-C 8.5 8 8 5.0-6.4 3 3 LDL-C 4.0-4.9 1 GROUP 5: DNA ANALYSIS Functional mutation in the LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 gene 8 SCORE >8 Definite FH 6-8 Probable FH 3-5 Possible FH 0-2 Unlikely FH 1 Watts GF, Gidding S, Wierzbicki AS.
