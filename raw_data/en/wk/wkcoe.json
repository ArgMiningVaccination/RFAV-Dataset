vaccine is a 2 -dose series and will take 1 to 2 weeks following the second dose to be considered fully vaccinated No vaccine is 100% effective Given the currently limited information on how well the vaccine works in the general population; how much it may reduce disease, severity, or transmission; and how long protection lasts, vaccinated persons should continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves and others, including: -Wearing a mask -Staying at least 6 feet away from others -Avoiding crowds -Washing hands often -Following CDC travel guidance -Following quarantine guidance after an exposure to someone with COVID -19 -Following any applicable workplace or school guidancePublic health recommendations for vaccinated persons 16 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/index.htmlAlgorithm for the triage of persons presenting for mRNA COVID -19 vaccine 17 MAY PROCEED WITH VACCINATION PRECAUTION TO VACCINATION CONTRAINDICATION TO VACCINATION ALLERGIES History of food, pet, insect, venom, environmental, latex, or other allergies not related to vaccines or injectable therapies History of allergy to oral medications (including the oral equivalent of an injectable medication) Non-serious allergy to vaccines or other injectables (e.g., no anaphylaxis) Family history of anaphylaxis Any other history of anaphylaxis that is not related to a vaccine or injectabl e therapy ACTIONS 30 minute observation period : Persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) due to any cause 15 minute observation period: Persons with allergic reaction, but not anaphylaxis CONDITIONS Immunocompromising conditions Pregnancy Lactation ACTIONS Additional information provided * 15 minute observation period ALLERGIES History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to another vaccine (not including Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine) History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to an injectable therapy ACTIONS: Risk assessment Potential deferral of vaccination 30 minute observation period if vaccinated CONDITIONS Moderate/severe acute illness ACTIONS Risk assessment Potential deferral of vaccination 15 minute observation period if vaccinated CONDITIONS None ACTIONS N/A ALLERGIES History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a ny component of the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine ACTIONS Do not vaccinate * See Special Populations section for information on patient counseling in these group s https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info -by-product/pfizer/clinical -considerations.htmlInformation for supplies -Management of anaphylaxis at the vaccination site -Recommendation for immediate activation of emergency medical services and transportation to higher level medical care -Patient counseling -Reporting of anaphylaxisInterim considerations: preparing for the potential management of at COVID -19 vaccination sites https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/vacc -specific/covid -19.html 18 Recommended medications and supplies for the management of anaphylaxis at COVID -19 vaccination sties *COVID -19 vaccination sites should have at least 5 doses of epinephrine on hand at any given time.
