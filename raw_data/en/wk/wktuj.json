Includes the Catholic Encyclopedia, Church Fathers, Summa, Bible and more these names show, the principle of life was often represented under the figure of a breath of air. The breath is the most obvious symptom of life, its cessation the invariable mark of death; invisible and impalpable, it stands for the unseen mysterious force behind the vital processes. Accordingly we find the word \"spirit\" used in several different but allied senses: (1) as signifying a living, intelligent, incorporeal being, such as the [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm); (2) as the fiery essence or breath (the [Stoic](../cathen/14299a.htm) pneuma) which was supposed to be the universal vital force; (3) as signifying some refined form of bodily substance, a fluid believed to act as a medium between mind and the grosser matter of the body. The hypothesis of \"spirits\" in this sense was familiar to the [Scholastic](../cathen/13548a.htm) age, in fact down to the end of the eighteenth century, \"animal spirits\", \"vital spirits\", \"natural spirits\" (cf. Vesalius, [Descartes](../cathen/04744b.htm), Harvey, [Erasmus](../cathen/05510b.htm), Darwin, etc.) \"Magnetic\" spirits were employed by Mesmer in his theory in very much the same way as modern Spiritists invoke the \"ether\" of the physicists. In [Psychology](../cathen/12545b.htm), \"spirit\" is used (with the adjective \"spiritual\") to denote all that belongs to our higher life of reason, art, morality, and religion as contrasted with the life of mere sense-perception and passion. The latter is intrinsically dependent on matter and conditioned by its [laws](../cathen/09053a.htm); the former is characterized by freedom or the power of self-determination; \"spirit\" in this sense is essentially personal. [Hegelianism](../cathen/07192a.htm), indeed, in its doctrines of Subjective, Objective, and Absolute Spirit, tries to maintain the categories of spiritual philosophy (freedom, self-consciousness and the like), in a [Monistic](../cathen/10483a.htm) framework. But such conceptions demand the recognition of individual [personality](../cathen/11727b.htm) as an ultimate fact. In Theology, the uses of the word are various. In the [New Testament](../cathen/14530a.htm), it signifies sometimes the [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm) of man (generally its highest part, e.g., \"the spirit is willing\"), sometimes the [supernatural](../cathen/14336b.htm) action of [God](../cathen/06608a.htm) in man, sometimes the Holy Ghost (\"the Spirit of Truth Whom the world cannot receive\"). The use of this term to signify the [supernatural](../cathen/14336b.htm) life of grace is the explanation of [St. Paul's](../cathen/11567b.htm) language about the spiritual and the carnal man and his enumeration of the three elements, spirit, [soul](../cathen/14153a.htm), and body, which gave occasion to the Trichotomists ( [1 Thessalonians 5:23](../bible/1th005.htm#vrs23), [Ephesians 4:23](../bible/eph004.htm#vrs23)). Matter has generally been conceived as in one sense or another the limitation of spirit. Hence, finite spirits were thought to require a body as a principle of individuation and limitation; only [God](../cathen/06608a.htm), the Infinite Spirit, was free from all admixture of matter. Thus, when we find the [angels](../cathen/01476d.htm) described as asomatoi or auloi, in the writings of the Fathers, this properly means only that the [angels](../cathen/01476d.htm) do not possess a gross, fleshly body; it does not at all imply a nature absolutely immaterial. Such Scripture expressions as \"bread of angels\", \"they shall shine as the [angels](../cathen/01476d.htm)\", as well as the apparitions of these heavenly beings, were adduced as [proofs](../cathen/12454c.htm) of their corporeality. So speak Sts. [Ambrose](../cathen/01383c.htm), [Chrysostom](../cathen/08452b.htm), [Jerome](../cathen/08341a.htm), Hilary, [Origen](../cathen/11306b.htm) and many other Fathers. Even in [Scholastic](../cathen/13548a.htm) times, the degree of immateriality that belongs to finite spirits was disputed. [St. Thomas](../cathen/14663b.htm) teaches the complete simplicity of all spiritual natures, but the [Scotists](../cathen/13610b.htm), by means of their famous materia primo prima, introduced a real composition, which they conceived to be [necessary](../cathen/10733a.htm) to a created nature. As regards the functions of spirits in the world, and their active relations to the visible order of things, see [GUARDIAN ANGELS](../cathen/07049c.htm) and [DEMONOLOGY](../cathen/04713a.htm). Scripture abounds in instances of their dealings with men, chiefly in the character of intermediaries between [God](../cathen/06608a.htm) and His servants. They are the heralds who announce his commands, and often too the [ministers](../cathen/10326a.htm) who execute His [justice](../cathen/08571c.htm). They take a benevolent interest in the spiritual good of men ( [Luke 15:10](../bible/luk015.htm#vrs10)). For these reasons, the [Church](../cathen/03744a.htm) permits and encourages devotion to the [angels](../cathen/01476d.htm). BERKELEY, Siris in Works, II. See also bibliographies, SPIRITUALISM; SOUL.
