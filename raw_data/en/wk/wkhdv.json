Here are some of the wonderful comments we have received. I am happy to share my experience at Arogyadham Ayurveda Treatment Centre in Rishikesh. I have been suffering from Insomnia for the past two years and have visited many doctors for this problem. But Dr Rakesh Agarwal is the best in diagnosing and the root cause of diseases. Now I am relieved of this disorder and living joyfully. I recommend this Ayurveda Centre to everyone who wants fit and healthy life naturally. Arogyadham is the best Ayurveda Treatment Centre in India, where you find absolute professionalism. I went there for a 60-day Panchkarma treatment for back pain and slip-disc, and I was guided clearly and realistically from the beginning to the end on what to expect and how much relief I'd get. Dr Amrit Raj prescribed me a complete plan for daily routine for good health. I am happy enough to give the place a 5-star rating and highly recommend it to everyone.
