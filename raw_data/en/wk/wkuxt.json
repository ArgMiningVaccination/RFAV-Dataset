There are two types of resources listed in this handbook: educational materials and information about support organizations. We know how important it is to understand your child\u00b7s diagnosis, procedures, and anything related to the treatment process. This handbook will direct you to useful sources of educational materials. There are many support organizations to help you in this journey. The handbook has identified many organizations that provide emotional support, aid with basic needs, and various programs such as camps and school reentry. Some of the organizations need an application or a referral in order to access their services.
