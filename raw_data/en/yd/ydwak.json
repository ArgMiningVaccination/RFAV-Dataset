Our Challenge Energy is more than electricity. Access to clean, affordable and reliable power is essential for human health, education and economic prosperity. Yet the world's energy system is currently a major driver of inequity, ecosystem degradation and climate change. More than [700 million people](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020) globally still lack access to electricity. Those who do have power often get it through polluting fossil fuels. Energy is already responsible for [73% of global emissions](https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/12/interactive-chart-top-emitters), while energy demand is slated to rise [nearly 10% by 2030.](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020) people worldwide lack access to electricity of global CO2 emissions come from buildings of global emissions come from energy consumption of world's energy supply must be powered by clean energy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 Our Approach WRI works to transform the world's energy system into one that benefits people, nature and climate. We collaborate with policymakers, cities, companies, utilities, regulators and development institutions to secure clean, affordable and reliable energy for all communities. We work closely with utilities and policymakers to develop climate-resilient infrastructure that supports variable renewables and electric transport. We partner with corporations, institutions and governments to increase demand for low-carbon energy, including renewables, electric vehicles and energy-efficient and zero-carbon buildings. Our tools, analyses and initiatives track communities most in need of electricity and identify places where clean energy is the most affordable and reliable solution. And we help city leaders around the world improve the efficiency of their buildings, a major source of emissions.
