It attempts to heal by natural methods and remedies that are prepared from natural elements or ingredients. Natural and traditional medicines respond directly to human need for psychosocial health and physical well-being. Traditional and Natural theories of health represent the sum total of measure, ingredients, customs and creative procedures of several forms such as material and spiritual. Holistic philosophy of healing encompasses the physical, emotional, mental, psychological, spiritual, intellectual, Intuitional and social dimensions of health. Holistic is an approach or philosophy that is applied to any healthcare healing tradition\u2014both the conventional (or allopathic) medical model taught in most Western medical schools and the complementary (or alternative) healing traditions, such as Ayurveda, acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage therapy, and naturopathy etc. Researches have shown that Holistic approach can enhance the results of any type of healing process. The modern Doctors are of the view that success ratio of 40% is enough but holism enhances the success ratio up to 90 percent. We have explored 30 therapies of Holistic Healing Science and have been able to get Instant and On the Spot Treatment through these Natural Means of Healing. I am attaching full version of definitions and efficacies about these therapies. Holistic diagnostic method analyses the capacity of the organs by frequency behavior and compares with the reflection levels to diagnose the present, future and past levels of the troubling disease. Through Nerve Reading it succeed in compiling the Vaat, Pit and Cough position, which are three main defects. It makes the non-contacting monitoring of living processes. Detects disturbances, if there is any, makes the correct diagnosis, and defines the dissociations in systems of organism at the shell, organ, Tatwas, Chakras and Energy Circulation root levels. HHCDM also predicts the future development after reflecting the History of the illness. It leads to the present available treatment in the Modern Medicine, CAM, Holistic and Indigenous Fields of Treatment. Using of Holistic computer diagnostic as a basic complex and as a noninvasive screening method enables to shorten the time spent on the examination and to miss the consultations of the narrowly focused specialists. This also saves the time of running to Hospital for any simple form of Emergency and Casual Conditions. This can be a revolutionary Machine for saving time of the Hospital and Clinic Staff in Diagnosing accurately the root causes as well symptomatic symptoms of the Disease. The device consist the Simple Computer Assembly, Scanning, Diagnostic Hardware and Specially Designed Program \"Holistic Diagnosing Software\" developed by the R&D Team of Holistic Healing Center, which can be installed in a 2X6 feet Space just like a ATM Machine. Installing HHDM at Each Point:- The Traditional diagnosis methods, such as looking/smelling/touching, have been successfully used for thousands of years. However, these methods are mainly relied on Doctor's experience and not quantified. HHDM shall be developed by using Medical Biometrics technology, Electro photonic Imaging (EPI), Hand & Feet Reflex Scanning Technology, Sensitive Imaging, GDV Diagnosing System, TCM Diagnosing Technology, Human Genome Technology, Future prediction of Disease Technology and Thermal Imaging Technology for solving the basic requirements of a Doctor and Medical System so that 100% satisfaction may be achieved in Treatment. At first level HHDM can be installed at major hospitals and after passing trials this can replace the weight machine installed at Bus Stand, Railway Station, Airport, Malls, Clinic, Village Panchayat Office, Post Office and even at Common Shops. One can get his full Health, Wellness and Future prediction by putting small amount of money and then directly lead to the Hospital where he wants to take treatment. On later stage with the Help of Telecom Department this project can be diverted in to a National Data Base where Health Department can have Village, Taluka, District and State wise data in single clipping. This will also save paper cost and money being spent on collecting Health Information. Every Hospital, Dispensary and Clinic can be contacted for treating a common man through a Mouse only. This can also lead to Mouse Care Treatment by a Patient through a Doctor who is sitting at the far front of the Universe or even through Software Installed in a Space Craft. 14. SAVING THE NATURE BY CHANGING PREPARATION METHODS The principle of complementarities in Ayurveda holds that the sequence of biological information as stored in plants and minerals corresponds to the sequence of biological information in the human physi-ology. Rasayana therapy utilizes this principle of complementary to eliminate distortions and restore integrity to the flow of biological information and intelligence. But unfortunately due to environmental factors and our excessive use of plants it has now become difficult for the human to use the Nature on the patterns of Ayurveda. Holistic patterns allows us to use the maximum on Tatwa theory and prepare the medicine on Homeopathy patterns to get Instant and Maximum results. This method can be able to save the Nature and using of plants after their life span will be more beneficial on Coal tar methods. Energy Medicine is the future of all Scientific Theories based on Newtonian Science. Now is the time to apply Quantum & Vedic Theory for the development of our futuristic medicines. Neno- Technology and harvesting the human energy is the best alternate to follow the safety of the environmental science and to save the life of the Humanity. Life Style Counseling, Creation of Own Energy, Taking care of Own Health, Following the Nature and Discipline of Life are the techniques to be learned and taught in the future schools of Health Sciences. The Modern medicine analyze the body as a machine, where as Energy medicine teach us to follow twenty components: development of higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use of primordial sounds, correction of the \"mistake of the intellect', strengthening of the emotions, vedic structuring of language, music therapy, enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psycho-physiological integration, neuromuscular integration, neuro-respiratory integration, purification (to remove 'impurities due to faulty diet or behavioral patterns'), dietary measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, nourishing the environment and promoting world health and peace. Most of these cost several hundred dollars but some cost thousands and require the service of an ayurvedic practitioner. Holistic Healing is the therapy of God, which acts like a bridge between humanity and Nature. It shows us the path of bliss, prosperity and wellness. There is the capacity in our body to talk to the trees, play with the nature, enjoy the natural bliss and be free from all the worries and curries of the life. We can fly in the air, we can walk on the water, but all depends on our total co-ordination with the nature. Here, we are limited to the field of Health, all the other things are the practical aspects, which can be experienced, realized but not explained. Nature has hence in its lap but blessed are those who are calm follower and regular practitioner. Now, it is up-to the people and leaders of our Society, 'like you', how you can use our skills for the benefit of the world community and even more for converting our future generation from \"man to human\" since humanity is above all. Once more, we would like to highlight that our basic aim is to provide service to mankind as best as we can. We have done tremendous research work for the last 25 years and have achieved a level of \"touch & heal\" which we would like to demonstrate before the world community. "}
