You can have low and high estrogen, low progesterone and high testosterone all in one cycle. Crazy right? I'll help you put the puzzle pictures together, get your hormones in check and heck, maybe even love your period again! Periods shouldn't rule your life Your period should come and go and not impact your life. Naturopathy can help you feel \"yourself\" four weeks of the month, not just every two weeks! Understand your body and hormones I'll help you intimately understand your hormones, how they work and the ins and outs of your cycle. Live without the burden of hormone fluctuations. Good moods, better memory and more... Getting your cycle in balance can improve your mood, memory, concentration, confidence, energy, skin, libido, sleep, and metabolism. Really! I love to help women achieve hormonal balance, vitality, and happiness The reality is that most negative period and hormone symptoms are not normal, you don't have to \"live with it\", and help is available. I am dedicated to helping teens and women to be in tune with their body. I help teens navigate their way through the hormone rollercoaster that happens through adolescence. And I help women understand changes in their period and hormones as they move through the stages of life. Don't let hormones and bad periods rule your life and don't let anyone tell you your period symptoms are normal! Your journey to hormonal balance starts at home Before we meet for the first time, I'll ask you to complete some preliminary health questionnaires and health assessment forms and gather results of any recent medical test results and investigations. I'll also ask you to record your menstrual cycle and period symptoms for at least one full cycle. This allows me to approach the initial consultation with an intimate awareness of your particular circumstances. The initial consultation In our first consultation I will thoroughly explore your whole health, hormone / reproductive health, gut health, nervous system, immune system, lifestyle, diet, medical history and genetics to identify the cause of your symptoms and areas of imbalance. We'll talk about how your possible hormone imbalance is impacting you with sufficient time to formulate a detailed plan for the best way to proceed. We work together to develop a plan that works for you and you'll go home with some nutritional and lifestyle recommendations to get started on right away. Hormone testing and treatment plan Depending on your circumstances, baseline hormone testing may be necessary and I may refer you to your GP for routine pathology if necessary. Now that you have a treatment plan, you can start implementing my recommendations. I generally allow 3 weeks for this stage, to allow adequate time to see some changes and identify any obstacles. During this time you might need to track your symptoms and menstrual cycle and record a food/lifestyle diary. Follow-up consultation Three weeks later we will meet for your first follow-up consultation. By now you will have implemented some of the diet and lifestyle changes and started on naturopathic supplements. We will have the results from any hormone testing and can discuss your progress and ongoing goals. We may need to adjust the prescription of supplements, set new goals for your treatment, and schedule future appointments. I will give you an idea of how long it will take to see results. Ongoing support As a minimum, I recommend at least two follow up appointments over three months. Three months is a realistic timeframe for working on hormone imbalances, but this varies from person to person as everybody responds to treatment differently.

Women need hormones (in the right amounts) to give us balanced moods, memory and concentration, confidence, energy, beautiful skin, healthy libido, refreshing sleep and a healthy metabolism - to name a few of the benefits! Your period should come and go and not impact your life. You can love your period! Hormones are beautiful when they are in balance but they can severely impact your life when they are not. A normal menstrual cycle IS: - Approximately 21-35 days in length - 2-7 day bleed - Sensation of heaviness or slight discomfort in lower pelvic area for day or two - Fewer than 16 filled tampons or pads or less than 80ml blood loss - Feeling a little bit tired A normal menstrual cycle IS NOT: - Pain - throbbing, burning, searing or stabbing pain that stops you from doing things that lasts many days - Heavy bleeding - more than 80ml each period or soaking at least one pad or tampon an hour for more than two hours - Sore breasts - PMS - depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, food cravings - Extreme fatigue Your period is a reflection of your health Symptoms may be early warning signs of hormone imbalance, nutritional deficiency or excess, stress, inflammation or other issues that may lead to chronic health conditions including infertility. They can also be signs of underlying hormone conditions so it's important to be in tune with your period and hormones and don't dismiss your symptoms as \"normal\". If you decide to work with me, I'll play detective and try to find the drivers of your hormone imbalance by taking a thorough review of your health and using functional testing. I will help to regulate your hormones by treating the underlying cause because getting to the root cause is essential for long term, sustainable results. Symptoms of hormone imbalance that I often treat: - Pain - period pain, ovulation pain, breast pain, headaches and migraines - Irregular or absent periods - Heavy periods - Low libido - Insomnia - Food cravings - Extreme fatigue - Mood fluctuations Treatment for hormone imbalances My approach to treatment o hormone imbalances is focused on treating the underlying cause - such as stress, thyroid issues, gut health, genetic predisposition, inflammation, diet (nutritional deficiency or excess), blood glucose dysregulation etc. I use evidence-based herbal and nutritional medicine and dietary and lifestyle strategies shown to normalise menstrual cycle irregularities, support hormone metabolism, resolve symptoms and reduce the risk of women's health issues. Contraception support and education Looking to support your body while on the pill or Mirena? Or maybe you're trying to come off the pill or Mirena? I can help to support your body while on the pill or Mirena, or I can help with post-pill or mirena support. If your goal is to start ovulating regularly again and help hormones that have been suppressed (or replaced with synthetic hormones) and get back in balance so you have healthy periods, then there is a lot you can do to support your body to help the transition.
