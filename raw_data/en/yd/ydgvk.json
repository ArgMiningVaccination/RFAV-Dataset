Chicago: National School of Chiropractic, 1916 ____________________________________________ CHRONOLOGY 1870: William Schulze 1936a&b) 1873 (Jan AB Cochrane , ACA , is born in Arcanum OH ( 1929 [Oct]; 6[5]:1) (Sept William Farnham, England (Gatterman, 1982) 1897 (Schulze graduates from Rush Medical College, [which is NOT the Medical Department of the University of Chicago; Rush will not affiliate with the University of Chicago until 1898] ; had previously attended William Jewell College in Liberty MO; is soon licensed in IL, MN and WI (Beideman, 1995) 1900 William C. Schulze - Taylor points out the importance of massage, mechanotherapy, bone setting, etc., and the practice of osteopathy. He thinks the profession has become too critical in regard to drugs, and the public has followed its example, and takes up the more readily with charlatans, who claim to cure without them. Moreover, there are comparatively few of the medical profession who have familiarized themselves with massage and mechanotherapy generally. Our schools of massage are entirely superficial in their training. The European masseur finds our physicians unable to appreciate his skill, hence his attempt to get into independent practice, and the prejudice and rivalry aroused against him. Taylor claims that the field of mechanotherapy is boundless, and it is the duty of the educated physician to learn more of it. He thinks if the medical profession would read half a score of small books thoroughly (after revising their knowledge of the nervous mechanisms) and make practical use of the light thus gained, they would feel little hesitation in going forward to acquire skill in so practical and valuable a branch of therapeutics. The physician can not devote the time required by some of the more laborious and continuous, or routine procedures, but he should supervise the scientific part. He could and should make use of the more delicate manipulations, which are of the greatest value. To illustrate the teachings of the osteopathic schools, he mentions two graduates of Scandinavian massage institutions who came to this country and hearing of osteopathy took a course at Kirksville. Both assured the author that they learned no facts of importance not already known to them. The sphere of manual therapy lies in the ability of medical practitioners to influence centers of organic activity by mechanical stimulation through the vasomotor nerves. They should not abandon well-tried and proven remedies, but in manual therapy, when applied by the physician, there is a prompt and exact method far in advance of all others in the treatment of a wide variety of derangements, not only of the coarser mechanisms, but also of the vital organs. c1905: WC Schulze MD is operating the unincorporated American Mechano-Therapy (Beideman, 1995) 1905: Langworthy opens ASC (Gielow, 1981, p. 100) 1905 (early): Charles Ray Parker graduates from Palmer (Gielow, 1981, p. 100) 1905: Oakley Smith founds Chicago College of Naprapathy (Zarbuck, 1987) 1905 (Jan): DD publishes Vol. 1, No. 2 of The Chiropractor , basis for later conviction in Scott County court (Gielow, 1981, p. 106) 1905 (Feb 15): Willard Carver, LLB recommends DD include suggestive therapeutics in curriculum (Zarbuck, 1988d) 1905 (late): John F. enter's Palmer School's nine month course (Zarbuck, 1989) PHOTOGRAPHChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 2 Oakley G.

Howard mentions prior experience with various drugless methods, influence of A.P. Davis and S.M. Langworthy (p. 23): From my earli est recollection I have been opposed to the use of drugs as a means of restoring health. I first courted the fresh air, exercise and the diet theory. I next took up electricity and massage. One day I found myself by accident in charge of the treatment rooms of a sanitarium employing those methods in connection with hydrotherapy. I soon came to the conclusion that there must still be some method to handle the cases that could not be cured by the means we were employing. I had corresponded with A.P. Davis and the American School of Chiropractic and had considered their claims, and finally received the school announcement of The P.S.C. I meditated between the American School and The P.S.C. and finally gave preference to the latter, concluding that if it could send out Davises and Langworthies [sic] it could satisfy me. So according I associated myself with this school, and I now know I acted wisely, as I believe that it is the only equipped school to teach the science of Chiropractic.

I cannot let your letter go until I tell you of the M.D.'s meeting yesterday. They have a county society which meets once each month. I attended. Did not do so at home (Davenport). A paper was read; each member discussed its merits. I asked to have a say. They reluctantly voted me 5 minutes. When the 5 minutes were up several said, \"Go on.\" So they voted me another 5 minutes. By that time all the rules were forgotten and I occupied most of the afternoon....Dr. Martin said that he had a headache. I offered to cure it by one touch. He accepted. I seated him in front of the audience. He showed his surprise and admitted that the headache was gone. Several questions were asked for me to answer. Chiropractic captured the meeting....

Chicago: American Medical Association, 1912? includes a section concerning Chicago-based American College of Mechano-Therapy (pp. 480-6), of which M.D. is dean; taught include (pp. 481-2): ...Anatomy, Physiology, Diagnosis, Hygiene, Dietetics, Hydrotherapy, Manual Manipulation, Swedish Movements, Vibration, Oscillation, Mechanics (curative), Suggestive Therapeutics...Ethics, Establishment, Promotion and Business Methods. In addition to these numerous subjects, \"Osteopathy\" is thrown in for good measure; and all this is taught by correspondence! Apparently there is no limit to human credulity when cupidity beckons. In referring to the time required to complete the \"course\" and thus receive the diploma, which is \"handsomely executed on art parchment,\" we are told: \"In six months you can begin practicing mechano-therapy.\" Of course the acquirement of the tactus eruditus is all-essential, \"but it is no more difficult than learning to ride a bicycle.\" And incidentally that suggests the commercial possibilities of teaching bicycle riding or even equestrianism by mail! -reproduction of ad for American College of Mechano-Therapy (ACM-T) lists address as 120-122 Randolph Street, Chicago (p. 483) -ACM-T offers a correspondence program run by F.S. Tinthoff and S.J. Tinthoff -notes Schulze's reply to regulation of practitioners of mechano-therapy (pp. 483-4): Dear Friend: There are no laws on the statute books regarding Mechano-Therapy. In Illinois for instance, there is the so-called \"Drugless Healing Act\" applying to all such methods as Mechano-Therapy, Osteopathy, etc. Some of our graduates have qualified under this law by examination, while others carry on their work under the advice and consent of a friendly M.D. We recommend the latter method until such time as Mechano-Therapy is regulated by legislative enactment in the various states. Yours truly, American College of Mechano-Therapy W.C. Schulze, M.D. -reproduces application blank for correspondence program in ACM- T (p. 484): ...While $100 is the price supposed to be charged for a \"course,\" the amount actually taken varies. The \"easier\" the dupe, the more he pays; the longer he defers throwing away good money, the less he is asked to pay for the \"course.\" METHOD OF INTERESTING \"STUDENTS\" The individual who writes to this college for information receives a three-page letter and a \"prospectus.\" The latter is entitled, \"How to Become a Mechano-Therapist,\" and the first page is taken up with a full-page picture of the \"home of the American College of Mechano- Therapy.\" This \"home\" is pictured as a nine-story building, across the top of which appears in large letters, the legend: \"American College of Mechano-Therapy.\" The natural inference to one not conversant with the facts would be that the \"college\" occupied the entire building. In reality, however, it occupies some rooms on the sixth floor of the building in which it is located, and the building carries no such legend as is shown in the picture. -reproduces diploma in \"Suggestive MD still listed as president of ACM-T in corporate records, but gone by 1920s (Beideman, 1995) 1913: A.B.

Moderation in all things is a motto that must not be forgotten. Sanitation, cleanliness, order, decency, soap, pure water, fresh air - these are the things that the chiropractor appreciates and which he constantly, insistently, gently, but surely prescribes. Also, he used them himself. A good chiropractor in his own life illustrates the beauty of the science he represents. Especially have I noticed that in the National School of Chiropractic in Chicago, common sense prevails . Dogmatic medicine is o better than dogmatic theology. Both lead to tyranny and persecution...There is a constant danger for new converts to focus on one thing and imagine that when they get this, they have arrived . All the rest goes into the rag-bag. Doctor Howard, however, I have noticed, constantly instills into his students the necessity of a good equipment of plain, old-fashioned sense. Digital skill comes from accurate thinking. Accurate thinking is the result of right living. Doctor J.F.A. Howard shows his students how to become not only physicians , but teachers. Doctor Howard himself is a teacher of teachers. I have never heard Dr. Howard berate the old schools (allopathic), although he might smile at some of their prescriptions... These are the things that Doctor Howard teaches in addition to anatomy and the right adjustment of the spinal column . Carry the crown of your head high and your chin in. Think well of yourself and well of everybody, including doctors, for most of them are doing the best they can...Dr. Howard and his assistants know perfectly well that all we have in the world is what we give away. 1914 (Dec 28): Loban dismisses suit against BJ (Gielow, 1981, p. 127) 1915: Hugh B.

So first of all I think you will be interested to know what I'm doing. I have charge of the whole G.U. Wards, that is to say, of course, as far as the authority of a Ward Master goes, I am in absolute authority. I am the only Ward Master at the Base who has charge of more than one ward and at present I am Ward Master over four wards and yesterday was made a first-class Private and am to take an examination next week for Sergeant. Incidentally, I might tell you that I have applied for a transfer to the third officers' training camp and my application, I understand, hasChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 6 been approved by Major Sheep. Should I be successful, I will be transferred to Plattsburgh for a three months' training and on passing an exam, there, will be commissioned a Second Lieutenant, with the chance of promotion right along the line. Well, I believe I was telling you of my work. As you may understand, nealy all of the G.U. work in the army is confined to venereals. My morning report to the Adjutant this A.M. was a follows: Urethritis, gonorrhoeal, acute 23 cases Syphilis, second stage 3 cases Symphilis and gonorrhoea both 11 cases Para-phimosis and gonorrhoea both 3 cases Phimosis and gonorrhoea both 5 cases Epididymitis, gonorrhoeal 9 cases Buboes suppurating 17 cases Venereal warts 2 cases Cystitis 3 cases Chancroids 18 cases Varicocele 3 cases Circumcisions 7 cases Rheumatism, gonorrhoeal 3 cases The last named cases have been given up by my Lieutenants, the Ward Surgeons, who are in absolute charge and have been given over to me to handle; not that they have any faith in Chiro, as you may well understand, but just to give me something to fall down on, or rather I believe their hopes to be centered in that. I have two of the finest Lieutenants one could possibly wish to meet. Dr. Ross, who is the ranking officer and who is the REAL BOSS, not bigoted, is a perfect gentleman.... (p. 23; bound volume p. 296) 1918 (Mar 15): letter from WC Schulze MD, DC to GM Otto DC, president of the Universal Chiropractic College, reprinted in the Fountain Head News [1918 [A.C. 23] (May 11); 7(35): 6): Dr. Otto President, Universal Chiropractic College, Davenport, Iowa My Dear Doctor: Upon request over the long distance telephone of Dr. B.J. Palmer, I beg to inform you of the experience of the National School in connection with the inspection of that school by the Ohio State Board. Our school hours are from 8 o'clock in the morning until 5:30 in the afternoon. One evening at 5:45 these gentlemen dropped in at the School, and as it so happened one or two of the clerks in the office were still there but getting ready to go home. There was no representative of the school; no member of the Faculty; no classes going on; but these gentlemen insisted that they wanted to inspect the school. Of course, these girls did not know what to do under the circumstances so they just stayed around, answered what questions were asked, took them over the school, showed them what they wanted to see, and that was all there was to it. Now, these are the plain facts. We presume that if these gentlemen had come two minutes later and had found the school doors locked, they would have had to report that there was a building but there was no school going. Very naturally, a similar conditon would have to be reported about any school in the country after closing hours, because although our school hours are longer than those of any school of healing in the city of Chicago, we do close up every night and begin again the next morning. I will leave it to you whether it was fai r, under the circumstances, for these gentlemen of the Ohio board to come uninvited and unannounced after schools hours and make their report on the premises of what a couple of office girls could tell them. I promised Dr. Palmer over the telephone that I would give you the facts as they are. I believe that a tour of inspection, if it is to be of any value or any fairness, should be made in an unprejudiced manner . You can draw your own conclusions concerning this inspection. If you have any questions wh ich you desire to ask other than what I have written you, I shall be very glad to answer. Yours very fraternally, W.C. SCHULZE.1918 (Apr 27): B.J. Palmer visits the FHN [1918 [A.C. 23] (May 11); 7(35): 10]: A DAY IN CHICAGO Chicago is one of those villages - a suburb to Davenport - which one always stands a few jabs in the solar plexus, a few knock-out blows under the left jaw, a la CHIROPRACTIC. Chicago has been gradually replacing their hold on things co- operative hence we, one day, got an inspiration to hold a one-day, all day, CHIROPRACTIC jubilee. Chicago is too near to Davenport to give them an all week affair; and then, too many of them come to Davenport to warrant this. The date was set, and then came an invitation to address the National School of CHIROPRACTIC, from the President, Dr. Schultze. It was accepted with the greatest of pleasure. At 9 a.m. Saturday, April 27th, we were met by Dr. Schultze at the Hotel LaSalle and take to the school. Here, at 11 a.m. we met the classes in assembly. We were given carte blanche to say what we pleased in any way we wanted as long as our wind lasted. I got started discussing general conditions and how the war was affecting schools, including the CHIROPRACTIC ones (for, wasn't this on my mind most?) and talked for just one long hour. I brot to this student body the request for closer co-operation between their school and themselves; themselves and their school; a little higher appreciation of their Faculty and its each member, etc., etc. After this was over, Mable was called upon for a \"few words\" (Dr. Schultze ought to know women better) and she's invited the gang down to the lectures for the morrow. We were escorted thru and shown all over the National School, as it was our first time to ever visit and talk to this institution . Altho Dr. Schultze has been here frequently, befor our student body, this was our first before him... In the evening we gave AFTER TOMORROW - WHAT? at the Auditorium of THE Y.M.C.A. The introduction was formally made by Dr. Cochrane in introducing Dr. Schultze as Dean of The National School of CHIROPRACTIC who, in turn, very candidly and frankly chose his words in introducing the speaker of the evening. I appreciated this courtesy upon Dr. Schultze's part very much. It but again proves the big heartedness and broad-mindedness of the man . The hall is a large one and was crowded... 1918 (Apr): National (School) Journal of Chiropractic notes: -\"Manipulative the Army\" (pp. 21-3; bound volume pp. 343-5): Fifteen thousand physicians have volunteered their services to care for our soldiers and have been commissioned in the army of the United States. That they will do wonderful work goes without saying. They will restore to usefulness many a man who, without the expert care they will receive, would probably be doomed to a life of helplessness or even lose his life. Proper surgical measures will meet many of the indications presented by different cases, but they will not meet them all. In England a man has demonstrated that manipulative measures are accomplishing wonderful results in cases which can be reached in no other way. In this country we know that adjustments and other measures commonly coming under the head of physical therapy would be of inestimable value in the care of many of our stricken soldier boys. Both the osteopaths and the chiorpractors have tried in vain to receive permission to employ their skill in this direction but without avail. We know absolutely that we could do a world of good in many cases that medical and surgical procedures will not benefit in the slightest degree. We are willing to be tyested int his regard and show what we can do, and there are millions of people in this land of ours that would like nothing better than to see us given an opportunity to demonstrate our worth. But our most earnest efforts to get some kind of a hearing have been unavailing, and as a result there are going to be a number of men, perhaps thousands of them, after this war, who will be left helpless just because they were deliberately denied the privilege of using a form of treatment which those men whom we have placed in a position of authority refuse to recognize. Is this fair to our soldiers who are fighting our battles for us? Should not everything which has the slightest claim to recognition be thoroughly investigated to determineChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 7 whether or not it might be of some benefit to our soldiers? When a mother's child is sick she will try everything in her frantic efforts to save its life and she will overlook nothing that offers the slightest hope. We are confornted witht he same precise problem. Various forms of disease and injury will be suffered by our soldiers and there shold be in a position of authority some one whose business it is to investighate everything which is proposed as a remedial agent in the care of such conditions. The man who has this work in charge should have no strings tied to him; he should be open-minded and open to conviction and unprejudiced; he should be conversant with the principles of medicine, surgery, osteopathy, chiropractic, and every other therapeutic measure which has ever been employed in the treatment of disease. In only that way will our soldiers receive the kind of attention to which they are so preeminently entitled. Mr. Barker has demonstrated to the satisfaction of every intelligent person in Great Britain that his methods are indicated and should be employed in many cases, but the War Office refuses to avail itself of his services because he is not a medical man. The same reason has prevented the osteopaths and chiropractors from giving their services to our soldiers here. This should not be. If there is anything which will help any appreciable percentage of our boys they should get that help. And we can prove to the entire satisfaciton of anyone that chiropractic adjustments will restore to healtha nd a useful life soldiers who will otherwise be doomed to an existence which will handicap them for the balance of their life. Why not give us a chance? Let on responsible man who is a chiropractor and also has a knowledge of other measures spend one week in a camp in this country or on the front in France and show what can be done. He can work under the direct supervision of the Commanding Officer so that ther need be nothing irregular in the procedure. Then let them make a combined report and let that be the basis for more extensive work along these lines. The press in both this country and England has said much in support of manipulative measures. Many medical men have expressed themselves publicly as being convinced that osteopathic and chiropractic methods would be beneficial in many cases. Here is an extract from an editorial in \"The Truth,\" an English newspaper, which cites just one case showing what can be done by manipulative measures: \"The evidence which Mr. Barker marshals against Sir Watson Cheyne relates principally to injuries to the semi-lunar cartilage, in the treatment of which he has particularly distinguished himself, and on which Sir Watson Cheyne imprudently challenged him. But when injuries to soldiers are in question, nothing that Mr. Barker has ever accomplished seems more conclusive of the whole matter than the case of the man in the Sherwood Forresters which was described in TRUTH last year, at the beginning of the whole controversy. This man had sustained a complicated injhury to the knee-joint which completely disabled him, and the overwhelming effect of the case lies in the fact that he had been under treatment for fourteen months in several different hospitals, as the result of which all the eminent surgeons who tried their hands on him could do nothing for him, and eventually recommended his discharge from the army, which was carried out with a pension at the expense of the British taxpayer. \"This man entered Mr. Barker's consultating-room wearing a cumbrous iron instrument to support his leg at the knee - the last word of orthodox surgery upon his case. He walked out restored whole, leaving the precious instrument behind him. What all the surgical skill at the disposal of the War Office could not do in fourteen months, Mr. Barker had done in about that number of minutes. \"In the face of such a demonstration as this, what is the use of eminent surgeon, or fifty eminent surgeons, getting up and telling laymen who know the facts that Mr. Barker may \"do very good work,\" but that Faculty know all about his methods and employ them whenever they think it is desirable? How can intelligent and educated men like Sir Watson Cheyne make such a lamentable exhibition of themselves and their craft? I suppose they content themselves with the reflection that the opinion of the laity is of no consequence, even on a mere matter of evidence. But it is not the laity. Mr. Barker can produce dozens of lawfully qualified medical witnesses, and among them surgeons whom even Sir Watson Cheyne is not entitled to sneezeat. That is the best assurance of the ultimate issue of this controversy.\" (pp. 21-23; bound volume pp. 343-5) -letter from Private Walter C.

We are leaving this morning for parts unknown, unless the orders are changed. I have had an almost unborken line of success in curing headaches and am getting a little reputation started. The funny thing about it is the surprise my patients profess after an adjustment. Last week I ran across a man who had suffered with Neuralgia of the face and head for five days. In fact, he was bedridden. I was eager to get a crack at him, so asked permission to try. He was feeling pretty crabbed but said \"Anything is better than this.\" He was full of dope and Aspirin. I got him down, cracked his nck, gave him a massage and then let him up. \"Boys,\" he shouted, \"You may call me a d___ liar, but I haven't a pain.\" Two more treatments were necessary to reduce the swelling; and he is cured. The bet compliment I have pulled down so far was from our Company Commander. He recommended a sick headache patient to me, rather than to send him to the infirmary. He said \"There is a fellow down the line who cures headaches by cracking their necks - better see him.\" Very few ever heard of Chiro. but are more or less familiar with Osteopathy. I expect a Sergeant to drop in at any moment for an adjustment. Will close and pack my knapsack for our move, and only hope that this time it is \"A Go Of It,\" as we have twice before received counter orders, after we were all ready. Your truly,... P.S.

I work from 8 o'clock A.M. to 5 o'clock P.M. It is very interesting work, but is is also very dangerous, owing to having to test out the different gases. They force this gas into a room and everyone has his turn at going into this gas room, with a gas mask on and stay as long as he can stand it. I was in for twenty-six minutes last Friday and have been on the sick list ever since. It came very near getting me but I am much better now, except for pains over my chest. I have about thirty soldiers that I practice on and I get great results. One of the medical men here says that after the war he is going to take it up. If anything is wrong with him, he sends for me.

The keynote of the meeting was \"Chiropractic for our soldiers.\" The enthusiasm was temendous and therefore the constructive business carried through was great in quantity and far reaching in its effects upon the future of Chiropractic. The constitution and by-laws declares every Chirorpactor in the land a member and an active one. No dues or assessments. All funds to be collected through voluntary contributions. The board ordered the organization of a nation-wide drive for at least $50,000 to be known as the \"Chiropractic for Our Soldiers Fund.\" Each state of the Union will be organized down to the smallest community.. All will be asked to contribute money and time. Be ready to respond to the call. No slackers will be tolderated. The fund raised will be used to promote governmental recognition of Chiropractors in the army and nave and to establish Chiropractic hospitals and relamation camps that will also demonstrate to the Government the value and merits of Chiropractic. This is distinctly your fight and the responsibility for success of this movement rests entirely upon you and us. A beautiful insignia has been adopted and will be given to every contributing Chiropractor. At once upon reading this letter, write to N.C. Ross, D.C., M.C., chairman of finance, 227 West Jefferson Street, Ft. Wayne, Ind. Tell him whether you will volunteer as a worker in the drive for funds to give Chiropractic to our soldiers. Let us hope the response will be immediate and universal. The hour has struck when Chiropractic must become the great factor in army health supervision that it deserves to be.

Forster , M.D., D.C. concerning the feud between Willard Carver and BJ Palmer (pp. 7- 9/bound volume Palmer WC Schulze Carver (p. 8): July 15, 1919 W.D. Schulze, D.C. National School of Chiropractic 421 South Ashland Blvd., Chicago, Ill. Dear Doctor: In getting your Lyceum Program, ten days ago, I noticed Willard Carver on, he being on the same afternoon as I. I will not be on your program as scheduled. Had I known that Willard Carver was on your program at all, I should never have accepted your invitation. My two reasons are: Willard Carver has been, is and will continue deliberately misrepresenting me, in ways now so apparent to the Chiropractic profession that he has lost their friendship, confidence and business. Willard Carver intentionally preaches \"Chiropractic\" and deliberately reaches Orificial Surgery, and has in many ways, knowingly, diverted his ideas from the fundamental principles of Chiropractic laid down by my father in 1895. Both of these are injurious to the present or future welfare of Chiropractic; that being true I cannot have my name connected, or affiliated with any meeting which might give credence, or value to him or his ideas, which would tend to destroy real Chiropractic. It is for these same reasons Willard Carver has been refused time and again, even upon his personal solicitation, a place on any of our Lyceum Programs. We have no difficulty in getting good, constructive, clean Chiropractic professional material without him . We don't elevate Chiropractic by letting such as he get on our programs. I want the Chiropractic profession to know that no numbers go on OUR programs as fillers. If it isn't Chiropractic it can't be found on OUR programs, no matter who or what. Feeling this, as I do, it is time for me to ease MY conscience and withdraw from being placed on any program with him, when I wouldn't invite such as he to be on OUR program. If, in my opinion, his presence here would be destructive to Chirorpactic, then my opinion of him and his work does not change when you shift the location to Chicago. I would not sit on a program with him here; why should I do so in Chicago? \"To thine own self be true.\" I can get away from everybody but myself. I can keep MY heart clean and MY conscience clear. To invite Carver here would be to publicly acknowledge him and his ideas of me, and his ideas of Orificial Surgery. My presence on your program, to a more limited extent, would also acknowledge what he HAS said is true, and what he IS TO SAY is Chiropractic, bot of which are UNTRUE. I cannot acknowledge such -for the sake of Chiropractic. If you can afford to assume such a risk, then that is your judgment. The confidence of the Chiropractic profession is EVERYTHING to me. I can't afford by thot, act or deed, to do anything to lose it. I don't belive you can either. Having Willard Carver on our program would not strengthen it; having him would tend to weaken the confidence of the Chiropractic profession, in our judgment and sense of honesty, to Chiropractic. I have waited ten days, since receiving your printed program, trying in spite of these things, to justify myself in going. I can't do ti. My presence would countenance Orificial Surgery as \"Chiropractic,\" which I can't countenance. I could wait until the last hour, telegraf you some diplomatic excuse about \"business detaining me,\" but that is not myway of doing business. You have a right to my reasons, therefore, I give them honestly. I wanted to let you know as soon as I had settled the matter with myself, that you might fill your program with somebody else. I shall also print this letter in the F.H.N., so that no one will misunderstand my reason for NOT being present, and so they will know exactly WHY I AM NOT. I wish your Lyceum every success in the world . I hope the numbers are great and the attendance large. I hope the Chiropractic end is strong enuf to overcome the insidious Orificial Surgery mixing theory which you have permitted to lie close to your bosom. You deserve success and I hope you get it. Chiropractically yours, BJ Palmer DC, PhC P.S. - Watch out for prospective students hanging around. Willard is a past master at trying to steal business. We won't have any barnacles hanging around here, by invitation , we can't trust. 1919 (Aug 23): meeting of representatives of chiro BCEs meets in Davenport IA to endorse the recommendations of the Federation of Chiropractic Schools & Colleges ; and issues ( or recommends? ) \"standard of education\" involving \"3 years of 6 months each\" to all states having chiro licensing laws; Dr. Ashworth , Dr. Lee W Edwards , and Anna Foy DC of Kansas are co-signatories (Ashworth papers, Cleveland/KC): Whereas, it appears that the educational requirements in the various states having laws governing the practice of Chiropractic are so widely at variance; Whereas, some state laws require a three years course of six months each, or more or its equivalent, others require a three year course of nine months each, while others have intermediate requirements; Whereas, the non-uniformity of laws governing the pratice of Chiropractic tends to create confusion between the various Schools and Colleges of Chiropractic to establish a uniform course of education to meet the requirements of different state Chiro Laws. Whereas, There is a Federation of Chiropractic Schools and colleges who have adopted a standard course of study of three years of six months each and Whereas, This Federation of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges maintain and consider that the course of three years of six months each of sufficient length of time to produce capable and competent Chiropractors, due to the fact that the course of Chiropractic study is devoted primarily to the study of subjects that bear directly on the Science of Chiropractic and does not include the extended study of Materia Medica, surgery and kindred subjects, Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved by the undersigned representatives of the following state boards of Chiropractic Examiners, assembled in conference at Davenport, Iowa, on the 23rd day in August, 1919, that it is the agreed consensus of opinion that a uniform course of study of three years of six months each is of sufficient length, and should be adopted as the standard of education to be required by all states now having laws governing the practice of Chiropractic, and be it further resolved that a standard educational requirement of a course of study of three years of six months each should hereby be adopted as a standard for future Chiropractic legislation. 1919 (Nov 29): letter to BJ Palmer from Arthur L. Forster MD, DC (reprinted in FHN 1920 [A.C. 25] (Jan 17); 9(18): 5): We have received copies of Dr. Greggerson's articles and both Dr. Schulze and I think that they are splendid. We certainly feel that this thing should have the unstinted support of every chiropractor in the country.

With kindest personal regards, I remain, Yours very cordially, Dr. A.L. Forster, Sec'y The National School of ChiropracticChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 10 1919 (Dec 1): National School of Chiropractic moves from 421-427 South Ashland Boulevard to 16-32 North Ashland Boulevard, which is a former seminary erected in 1889 (Beideman, 1995); but see Winterstein's (1993) interview with William Lane Schulze, who say move to 20 North Ashland Boulevard took place in 1928 1919 (Dec): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic: -\"What constitutes a good chiropractic education? By J.M. TCC folder]: *Address delivered on August 9, 1919 at the National School of Chiropractic Homecoming It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be present at this Goodfellowship meeting of Chiropractors. I enjoyed every moment of yesterday's program, and we owe a great deal to the national for the treat they have provided for us. I feel somewhat timid of accepting this place on the program, as I well realize, without any affectation of modesty, that I am most incapable of interpreting the big subject which has been assigned me. However, for the agony of the hour you will have to place the blame personally upon the shoulders of Dr. Forster, as both the subject and speaker are of his choosing. \"What Constitutes a Good Chiropractic Education\" is the title of the subject which I have been assigned. It is a big subject and cannot be treated arbitrarily by any man, and as good is a word expressing but the comparative, it resolves itself down to \"What my opinion of good chiropractic education.\" We are here as representatives of the most wonderful healing science yet discovered. Nothing in the annals of history has come anywhere near measuring up to the merits of the science we represent. This is not braggadocio, but facts which may be substantiated by any honest investigator. Therefore as representatives of the most valuable healing science known we have big responsibilities as well as wonderful opportunities, and it behooves us to be educated men and women. We owe it to the profession we represent and we owe it to the public who employ our services. Like the poet we should say: \"Let the dead past bury its dead.\" But we have a responsibilities in the present and future, and one of the greatest is to raise the science we represent to the high pinnacle where it rightfully belongs. That can never be accomplished by a profession of uneducated men and women. It is true that many men and women of inferior literary education and questionable chiropractic training have gone into the field and have been wonderfully successful; yet how much more successful would these people have been had they had the broader opportunity of better training. I heard an old Chiropractor the other day tell a patient that he had never attended a grammar school in his life and that he was within the gates of a chiropractic school for only three months, and that he believed he was better qualified to treat all forms of disease than any five-year medical man. Now, he may have been right in his contention, but he certainly made a very unfavorable impression upon the prospective patient to whom he made the statement. 2. This Chiropractor belongs to the class within our ranks who are a real menace to the advancement of the profession. They haven't sufficient education to give them that broader vision of life's problems which smoothes out many of the wrinkles of prejudice. The span of life is so short and the need for harmonious action so great that it I illy befitting to men and women who claim to represent the really big healing science to spend time making idle boasts or in destructive criticism of the other schools. It is not always the most ignorant man who does this, but I am sure that the better educated are in the minority of this class. Most of us represented here feel that our individual alma mater offers really the best education. And I am sure that there is more to this feeling than just loyalty, for nearly all reputable chiropractic schools are offering good courses. And most of the schools are raising the standard of their work from year to year, sacrificing profits in order that their students may get an education which will efficiently equip them for the highest success. Yes, I am positively convinced that nearly all chiropractic schools of standing are honestly putting forth every effort toturn out the best qualified men and women, and there are few schools which are in the business for profits. With this spirit predominant it is not hard to guess that the future of chiropractic will be more romantic when written into history than even the past has been. It has been a subject of contention between some chiropractic educators whether the student entering a chiropractic school should be equipped with a high school education. It is true that this would have been one of the greatest obstacles to the success of chiropractic colleges in the past. But I believe the day has now arrived when there will be plenty of available material for chiropractic doctors found with a high school education. And I am sure that every person in my presence, whether they have a high school education or not, would have found it a very valuable foundation upon which to build their chiropractic education. So, I think that in the future those entering upon the study of chiropractic hold a high school diploma or its equivalent. As to the length of course necessary to thoroughly equip a chiropractor, this also cannot be arbitrarily set by any one man. The consensus of the opinion of most chiropractors in the field that two years of six months each gives them a very comprehensive understanding of the science, is well founded and I am sure that if the man and woman of average intelligence will honestly apply themselves during these two years that they will be pretty well equipped to be successful practitioners. However, it may be that we have narrowed our course down to such an extant that it does not embrace all that would be beneficial to the progress of the science. Some schools do not provide a course in dissection of the human body. It seems to me that one cannot acquire the fullest knowledge of anatomy without the intimate, practical knowledge gained by dissection. It will not be long before such advantages will be provided by every chiropractic school. The laboratory provides the opportunity for many interesting and instructive investigations which broadens the general knowledge of the student and gives him an intimate understanding of pathological changes and chemical alterations in the human body. It may not be considered as absolutely germain to the making of a chiropractor, but I believe that the good school will not overlook any factor which will be of value to the better education of its students. The time is coming, in fact it is now here, when we should be equiped with knowledge to care for our patients all the way from the cradle to the grave. Until we are so equipped we can never hope to have the fullest recognition by the public and the confidence our science should merit. To be thus equipped we should have an extensive course in surgery so as to be capable of taking care of necessary surgical work, and it is folly for any of us to state that surgery should never be necessary for the best interest of our patient, because there are cases where instant surgery must be resorted to. Some may state that surgery is a specialist's work and that we need not know it. Yet we come face to face with emergencies quite frequently and it is most humiliating to have to tell our patients that we are not qualified to care for them and that they must seek another. A doctor for the ills of the human body should be able to take care of it under all conditions and with the additional training as above outlined, we as chiorpractors would be ideally equipped to efficiently care for our patients under every circumstance. I note that the National school has accepted this attitude and arranged for the attendance of its students upon surgical clinics. This is a good beginning and will be made more practical as time advances. Chiropractic has proved so efficacious in all acute diseases, especially during the \" flu\" epidemic last year, that we must soon include handling of such cases in our school training. To make such possible it will be necessary for the student to take training in a hospital or the school must provide an outside list of patients whereby he may get a comprehensive experience in both diagnosing and adjusting, as well as the sanitary and hygeinic laws which govern the care of such patients. We have numbers of families who claim us as their family doctors, and we cannot deny them our services when Willie catches scarlet fever any more than when Annie had stomach trouble. And although most of us would prefer to go to bed and stuff the phone bell, yet in the fulfillment of our duty and as representatives of our profession we cannot afford to withhold our services whenever they are required of the sick.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 11 The X-Ray is valuable to the chiropractor in many instances. It is true that some chiropractors are using it for commercial profit to an extent of absolute dishonesty. However, the conscientious chiropractor will not do so, and he will find it a wonderful aid in many cases to make a better analysis. Most schools recognize the value of the X-Ray and are teaching their students its use. It is not likely that any great number of chiropractors will install a machine, as it would be an expensive investment, when the work could be sent to some central office that would possibly make a specialty of getting pictures. Yet it becomes necessary for each chiropractor to understand the X-Ray and to be able to read the plates intelligently. I am coming to a point now which has been the bone of contention among chiropractors and chiropractic schools since the baby days of the science, that is what is termed \"mixing\" by some of the profession. After several years' experience with a large practice and by close observation, I am convinced that it is impossible to get the best results in all cases by the application of spinal adjustments exclusively. One of the most important reasons for this is the fact that subluxations are often caused reflexly. Therefore all irritating causes which would produce subluxations reflexly should be removed. One of the greatest factors in assisting in the relief of digestive disorders is diet, and you folk who are not making use of it are missing a valuable aid in your work. If you think you can get a patient well suffering from a gastric ulcer as quickly when he is eating corn beef and cabbage as when put upon a proper liquid diet, just try both plans. If you think you can restore normal function to the bowels by letting your patient feast upon constipating foods which create gases by fermentation, as quickly as when you give him a selected diet, you will be disappointed. If the kidneys are not functioning as they should and until they have been restored to normal, it certainly cannot injure our patients to assist them by eliminating through the skin, which can be done by the application hydro-therapy and thermo-therapy. Spinal adjustments are all that is indicated in most cases, yet it is very well to understand the application of adjunctive measures, for, like the Texan with his gun, he may not need it often but when he does he needs it \"powerful bad.\" So I believe that the student should be given instruction in the application of such measure as diet, hydro-therapy, mechano-therapy, etc. The use of the numbers of electrical machines I have found from experience, serves nothing more than exerting a certain psychological effect upon our patient, and oftimes this is adverse to what we desire, as it places spinal adjustment as the secondary measure in the opinion of the patient and puts the machine foremost, doing, in this way, our science an injustice. There is a machine on the market, with headquarters in San Antonio, known as the Dr. Bergman Magneto-Vitalizer, which is claiming the attention of the medical fraternity, and two of our oldest chiropractors have gone into the organization and have almost given over their practices. Through curiosity I investigated the machine and found it to possess wonderful stimulating qualities. But it is not a natural stimulation, can never take the place of natural nerve-energy and the results obtained are but of temporary duration, and how a man understanding the theory of chiropractic could accept the theory of this machine, goes to make up some of the seven day wonders in my life. No, there is nothing can supersede natural nerve energy. We chiropractors know this, and so we never permit anything which some term \"mixing,\" to take any more importance in the care of our case than merely as a harmless assistant to the weakened organ or tissue until it is strong enough to function normally. When we get our sheepskin and leave the hard seats of the school room behind, we are fooling ourselves badly if we think our education is complete. It is really just beginning. We have the foundation built, but the structure proper hasn't even been designed. And any man or woman who is satisfied that he has learned all about Chiropractic when he leaves school will never have a good chiropractic education. Just the moment when we feel there is nothing more to be learned, that moment of our usefullness has ended and we begin to retrograde. So I would say the most important part of our education is secured after we leave school. This meeting which we are now attending is a most valuable item in our education, in fact, I consider it the most valuable opportunity that we chiropractors have of securing real practical knowledge. I have never attended a meeting of chiropractors eitherlocal, state or national with out taking home with me a fund of information that has been or real value to me and to my patients. The fellow who has the one beaten path between his office and home and home and office, gets into a pitiful rut and before long will rust out completely. It will pay us, even if we had to borrow the money, to get out at least once a year and rub elbows with the other fellow; we go back to our office with new vigor, a larger perspective and a more fervent endeavor to improve ourselves and to become really big chiropractors. A GOOD CHIROPRACTIC EDUCATION is one which fits us to render the maximum of intelligent application of our science for the alleviation of the ills and infirmities of the human race. Anything short of this cannot be good, there is nothing better. And if we will approach the subject with such ideals, it will break down much of the narrow prejudice of schools and leaven the differences with in our ranks which have been eating insidiously into our vitals. The broadest vision of the chiorpractic future will be too narrow when we reach each succcesive milepost. I thank you, ladi es and gentlemen, for your patient attention. I trust that out of this meeting we may each get the bigger and broader vision so badly needed for the best interests of our profession. I thank you. 1920 (July 31): FHN [(A.C. 25); 9(46): 6-8] reprints article from the July, 1920 issue of the National (School) Journal of Chiropractic and debates Arthur L.

Norvall writes from Ottawa, Canada to BJ Palmer for coursework: Dear B.J. Palmer: I have enjoyed this tou r of Canada's four great Eastern cities: Toronto, Montreal, Quebec and Ottawa. I find that chiropractors are doing well. Dr. Galbraith adjusted me, and showed me many courtesies. He says that Canada wants more chiropractors. I enjoyed some of my course at the National in Chicago. The material presented by Dr. Forster was about what one might expect from him. I he weren't an M.D. he couldn't get by with his stuff, as it is he doesn't get by with any one who knows Chiropractic at all. I had to see him deliver his art instruction, or I would never on earth have believed that any one taught students to adjust in such a manner. Sometime I will have more time and will then explain what he teachers; it is absurd beyond belief. His lectures were not Chiropractic, they were medical and electrical. When asked what was best to do in a case of Infantile Paralysis, he replied, \"Use the vibrator.\" I scowled and shook my head. He then said, \"Oh, of course I'd adjust also.\" Several times I couldn't help but protest, and I was always balled out by teachers and most students. Because I had been studying at THE PSC I was heartily suspicioned. The National School is not a Chiropractic school; its methods are primarily - osteopathic, electric and medical. Students pull, stretch, concuss, massage, and adjust (sometimes a dozen vertebrae). It requires more than a quarter of an hour to give a \"treatment.\" I do, however, believe that the opportunity to visit hospitals and witness post mortems is of value to National students of anatomy. I had few exceptions to take in Dr. Schulze's lectures. He teaches chiropractic. He is kindly and painstaking, and seems to be very much liked by the entire student body. I never heard him advocate the use of adjuncts. I doubt if he knows the sort of stuff that Forster advances.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 12 Concerning the matter about which I spoke to you in Chicago, I found later that it was the work of old alumni - who celebrated their home-coming by converting the dormitory into a rough-house for two nights. Dr. Schulze got their names and soundly lectured them. They should have had their diplomas revoked. The supervisor in the dormitory is not strict enough; it must be tightened if they are to succeed. I wrote them a very formal protest, and told them what my experience there had been. Forster was indifferent, but Dr. Schulze and others took the right attitude. They will grow as they have experience in dormitories. It is a difficult problem in all public institutions. I shall visit our Eastern Chiro practic institutions. I hope I'll find them teaching Chiropractic. I am sending Miss Jessie Willyard, 121 Slater St., Ontario to THE PSC.

The board was not impressed with this so-called high school and decided to conduct a thorough investigation. A citation was served on P. Purviance , and subpoenas were issued for a number of graduates of the school. At the hearing, it developed that there had been no regular classes in high school subjects... Purviance defended his action in the conduct of his high school on the ground that all the students in the high school were also students in his Berkeley Chiropractic College , so he gave them the high school credits for subjects pursued int he regular chiropractic course. In regard to such credits, Will C. Wood, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, said: \"It would seem to me that not more than three units could honestly be countes as high school work. So many rumors of alleged irregularities in the conduct of the Berkeley Chiropractic College came to the attention of the board, that it was decided that this institution should also be investigated. The hearing was scheduled to begin October 1st. Purviance , who had made such a miserable showing with his high school, undertook to put a stop to the board's program. He was successful in getting a court order restraining the board from proceedin with the case, but before the papers wereserved the board secured a modification order and the hearing was called as per schedule. On October 3rd, adjournment was taken and all remaining witnesses were instructed to return on December 4th, when the hearing would resume. The case of the Berkeley Chiropractic College et al., vs. James Compton et al. is still pending in the courts. On June 1st, 1923, according to the records of the board, Percy Purviance made application for chiropractic licensure. In his personal affidavit he attested to the fact that he had matriculated in the Howard College of Chiropractic in Chicago, on the first day of June, 1918, and graduated on the 17th day of August, 1921, after having pursued a residence course of 2225 hours in this institution. In the school or college certificate, J.F. Allen Howard signed a statement giving Purviance credit for 2225 hours in the various subjects required in the Chiropractic Act. Purviance wrote the examination under Section 8, and on May 11th, 1925, was issued license Number 1318. Percy Purviance was cited to appear before the board at Sacramento on November 5th, and show cause why his license should not be revoked. The charge is fraud or deception in apply for licensure. The records of the Department of Educaiton of the State of California show that P. Purviance was a teacher in California high schools in the years 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921. W.E. Purviance of Los Angeles, now enters the ring with the bluff and bluster characteristic of his kind. The first move of W.E. was to employ the Burns Detective Agency to send a detective to Sacramento and get copies of the applications for license of six chiropractors, two of whom were board members. We suppose he employed a detective to do this merely to impress the secretary of the board with the seriousness of the matter. He was so sure that these applications would reveal the discrepancies for which he was looking that he did not wait until he got the copies into his hands before he started to 'show up the board members.' He went to several members of the board and demanded that his brother by 'whitewashed.' He insisted that unless the charges against Percy Purviance were dismissed he would 'pull the lid off,' disgrace the board, put one or two of its members in jail and 'give chiropractic a black eye in California that would take ten years to live down.' If W.E. had waited until he received the copies of the applications for which he was paying the Burns Detective Agency to get for him, he would probably not have made such wild threats. The applications in question showed that Purviance was in error and his charges were without foundation. 1922 (Feb 10): letter from Eleanor A.

SAUCHELLI GIVES FIRST HEALTH TALK BY WIRELESS ; Addresses Huge Radio Audience from Bedloe's Island\" (p. 19): Dr. Francesco X. Sauchelli this week made the first health talk that has been broadcasted by radio. Dr. Sauchelli's address was delivered at the Bedloe's Island radio station, and he spoke for forty-three minutes - one of the longest talks yet made in this manner. Dr. Sauchelli drew an analogy between the human body, with its nerve waves of different lengths, and the radio system, pointing out that everybody is really a radio station of high potentiality. So well received and so instructive was Dr. Sauchelli's address that he has been requested to give a series of health talks for radio distribution, and has agreed to do so. The radio message sent through the ether by Dr. Sauchelli follows in full. -paper entitled 19-21) 1922 (Sept): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic reprints article by Francesco X. Sauchelli DC from The Chiropractic News (pp. 24-5): THE NEED OF SCIENTIFIC CHIROPRACTIC \"The future of our civilization depends upon the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind.\" These are the words of Professor John Dewey, one of the great thinkers of our day. With equal force and pertinence we could apply this dictum verbatim to the future of chiropractic and chirpractors. The most urgent need at the present time in our science is its greater development and expansion along firmly established laws and principles. \" Scientific chiropractic \" must become our watchword and slogan; and scientific in the truest sense of the word: scientific in spirit, attitude and method. You and I and every one of us practitioners already in the field and the numerous school faculties throughout the country must maintain and insist upon the scientific method and habit of mind in the development of our profession. This will go far towards eliminating the many really trivial yet so far obstructive factors which have militated against a strong, powerful, united national organization of all chiropractors. Our fundamental aims and purposes should be one and the same. In fact, they are. Yet we cannot seem to come together as one body because of a wrong emphasis somewhere. Probably too much commercialism and self-interest, rather than a disinterested, fearless search for the truth and the whole truth of the facts and principles which musg guide our science. The writer has all along felt the need of more intensive, real, scientific research in the chiropractic profession, and has at various times discussed it with the more liberal-minded leaders. The publication of an article in the July number of the Atlantic Monthly prompts me to make these remarks on scientific research. The author of the article in the Atlantic discusses osteopathy and chiropractic. The following passages are selected: \"In support of this theory, after all these years since its development, no satisfactory experimental or other proof can be found in the osteopathic literature or elsewhere. The osteopaths have established research laboratories in California and Chicago, - the isolated facts reported in their publications can hardly be construed as experimental support for their theory of disease.\" He dismisses osteopathy as an \"unproved theory.\" Referring to chiropractic, we find these passages: \"In support of this theory, no experimental or other satisfactory proof is available. The chiropractors apparently have not as yet attempted tostimulate experimental work in research to the same extent that the osteopaths have.\" \"It is also apparent that no comparative studies in groups of cases of well-recognized diseases have been made in an attempt to show the value of this method of treatment.\" These extracts from the article in question are reproduced for the sake of emphasizing my point. I do not here and now make any comments on the article itself. The fact is only too apparent that real constructive research, pursued by competent men trained in the scientific method, has not yet been undertaken on any scale worthy the growh of our science. We must look to our school and to the establishment of well- equipped chiropractic sanitaria for the carrying out of this necessary phase of our science. The writer of this article is preparing a talk to be delivered publicly some time in August, bearing on some present-day needs in our profession. The point regarding the need of scientific research and its relation to the future growth and stability of our science will be fully considered. In brief, it will be suggested that the new National Organization [ACA?] that is to be shall make provision for a Research Committee composed of the various school heads or other fully qualified chiropractors. This committee will encourage the formation of research societies such as the Chiropractic Research Society of Chicago and collaborate broad-mindedly with all efforts to promote the scientific development of our method of healing. These societies may be inter-school affairs or parts of the various State societies. The results obtained will be passed upon by the Central Research Committee of the National Organization. The different \"systems\" or schools ought to be given a fair hearing and the Central Committee will serve as a clearing house of all information that has been thoroughly tried and tested. There should be but one designation, namely chiropractic, and only one practitioner, a chiropractor. \"Straight\" chiropractic or \"mixers\" as designations would be excluded. With the establishment of uniformity in practice, because based on well-proved, scientific facts and principles , there couold be but one chiropractic. We would then have uniformity in laws and licensing measures; and all having but one interest at heart, that of promoting the serviceability of our science, and eliminating rancors, personalities, bitternesses and all such things emanating from petty jealousies and misunderstandings. The chiropractic profession could combine into a solid, strong, national body, with a highly enhanced power in the community, based on strict ethical understanding. Things do move, and there is hope, because we have the enthusiasm of greater things to be accomplished. PHOTOGRAPH Arthur L. Forster, M.D., D.C. 1922 (Dec): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic [11(5)] publishes: -Arthur L. Forster, M.D., brain\" (pp. 3-4) -W.J. McCartney DC authors \"Housecleaning from another angle\" describes himself as a technically \"straight\" chiropractor, but (pp. 4-7): ...To my mind, and I am sure to a great many others, there is no such thing as an absolutely \"straight\" and finally settled philosophy. That is to say, our philosophy is as yet so young - and is in that process of development where as yet it is not possible to judge a man entirely as to his \"orthodoxy\" by what we now know, except on a few points that are demonstrable facts upon which all are most certainly agreed, regardlessChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 14 of school training. I hold no brief for Dr. Palmer nor for any one opposed to him, and I am writing this in a strictly impartial spirit as my honest opinion with respect to a very grave matter; so grave, in fact, as to deserve more than a passing thought, or perhaps a lot of senseless, silly enthusiasm.... Dr. Palmer seems to think that no one is to blame for our present condition as he describes it but the mixer. I concede that the mixer is without doubt greatly responsible, but not entirely the cause... ...I do not think that the public at large is concerned in the least whether a man is straight or a mixer. If anything, and I am ashamed to acknowledge the fact, for, like Dr. Palmer, personally I have absolutely no use for the mixer, the general public, strange to say, seems to be decidedly in favor of the mixer, and considers the straight man from whatever school as more or less of a rabid fool. And I do not know but what the public, in very many ways, is right, for many so-called straight chiropractors seem to be absolutely devoid of ordinary reason and good common-sense about which they talk so much, but never practice....I have known the heads of certain schools who actually go so far as to say that they prefer as students the blank, unlettered, unlearned and untrained minds, as they usually make the best chiropractors, knowing full well the impossibility of getting trained minds to follow their foolish philosophies. This is not fiction, but a fact. Could anything be more disgusting or preposterous! In the name of all that is good, when will we forsake such nonsense? That is what is killing us, this seeming encouragement of ignorance. The public, as it expresses itself through the magazines as it has done of late and will continue to do until we have some sort of respectable unity within our ranks, is concerned for the most part over the vain babblings of those who say tht there is no need of chemistry, physics, physical diagnosis, pathology or anything of the sort; that there is no need of quarantine or health laws; that there is no need of license or regulation; that there is no need of other doctors; that there is no need of observing any kind of rule or regulation, divine or otherwise, with regard to health, so long as you take adjustments; that there is no need of having a diseased appendix operated; that it is not necessary to get plenty of good food, rest, fresh air and sunshine and the like in connection with adjustments in order to get well; tht adjustments will cure everything from corns to lice; that this is no good; that that is no good, ad infinitum, ad nauseam, and then some, that makes us the laughting stock of scientific men and the public at large. It is the taking of cases by both straights and mixers that cannot possibly be helped by adjustments, and deceiving the helpless in just such instances, that the public is becoming disgusted with and rightly. Make no mistake about it. It is foolish philosophy of some of us and our money-grabbing propensities that the public cannot and will not swallow; so that it becomes not so much a question with them of straight or mixing, but of lying chiropractors.... ...A lot of that to which many now hold is nothing more than plain nonsense - and I challenge any one to prove the contrary. Get as mad as you please; the fact remains that outside of the basic proven facts upon which there is general agreement, much is speculation and yet this very thing is at the bottom of much of the misery and bad feeling within our ranks. We must agree among ourselves before we can command the respect of the world, and we can never agree among ourselves as long as so much of the silly piffle that is put forth by this school or by that school as chiropractic philosophy is believed in as gospel truth by so many. About all the advance that we have made in the last few years is the continual harping on this and that school about what they have done for the advancement of the science, whereas they have done practiaclly nothing to give new names to a lot of old things. It does seem that whatever real progress has been made in all scientific and professional lines has been made by the members of the profession themselves. We will never be what we ought to be until we learn to think for ourselves and not follow the ready-made opinions of others. God speed that day when the qualifications for becoming a chiorpractor will be such that only those that know how to think and think right will be desired in the profession, and when there shall be an end to the idea that the most ignorant make the best chiropractors, and that only a minimum of preliminary education should be required of those who intend to study our science. Unless we go up, we must go down. A profession that thrives on ignorance cannot long survive....-\"Ross-Myers DeBate on The Universal Chiropractors' Association vs. A New National Organization, Held at the National College of Chiropractic on August 11, 1922\" (pp. 7-15); presumably this was a discussion of the imminent formation of the ACA 1923 (Feb): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic [11(6)]: -Stanley Hayes DC authors \"Valedictory,\" which was his presentation at graduation exercises at National College of Chiropractic (pp. 5-8) -Lucinda Pearl Boggs subluxations\" (pp. 8-9, 18) -Arthur MD, standards\" (pp. 10-18); criticizes BJ Palmer's attitudes towards education; notes National College has set a maximum enrollment of 500 students (p. 18); also: It must be apparent to the most casual observer that Chiropractic has made very little progress during the past year - as compared with previous years. Some of the schools matriculated only about 60 per cent of the number of students in 1922 that they did in 1921. The field reports business much less active in 1922 compared with 1921. What is the reason? The well-known B.J. says that it is because the mixer is bringing discredit on chiropractic. Loban of the Universal College says it is because of the financial depression that has swept the world. Kightlinger of the Eastern College says it is because the market has been cleaned up - fewer persons left to take up the study of Chiropractic. Ross of the Ross College says it is because so many new schools have been started during the last couple years. I don't know what Duval thinks, but most likely it is what B.J. thinks. -Frank R.

Forster MD, DC childhood\" (pp. 2-3) -Barratt O'Hara, Chiropractic Association , organized September 22, 1922, continues to meet with the same misrepresentation and ridicule that characterized the opposition to its formation, and from the same source. I believe there is no reason to anticipate that it will ever grow less during the reign of autocracy in chiropractic, and we therefore expect that a certain preparedness on our part to deny false reports will always be more or less necessary. An attempt to create the impression that the A.C.A. is not in reality an independent organization of chiropractors is especially mischievous. The strongest refutation of this statement is the simple fact that at least two so-called leaders connected with certain schools have already been estranged from us because their own wishes did not prevail in the organization. We have the active support of the leading schools of chiropractic in the world, but none of them are dictating our policies nor in any way controlling our organization. One of the old gags that has been sprung on chiropractors from time immemorial to injure competitors is also being tried on us. It is so old that it will be promptly discredited among all chiropractors who have watched it long enought to realize (1) the general unreliability of its source and (2) the motive back of such misinformation. To answer theChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 15 challenge more specifically: The A.C.A. is very much alive and stronger than ever. We have chose to go slow and not make claims and promises that we could not live up to just in order that we might win the confidence of all chiropractors and thus realize a larger success eventually. The sophistry about \"mixing\" is also getting to be pretty well understood and in danger of becoming threadbare. But for the sake of those who are not clear on it, a few words will clear it up. The American Chiropractic Association is a chiropractic organization and is interested in nothing else. Its purpose is single indeed as compared with such an organization as works for the interest of a man or a school while professing to be devoted to chiropractic. We no doubt have people in our membership who do other things than \"adjust the spine,\" but so does every other chiropractic organization that I know of. The distinction is just here: The A.C.A. realizes and acknowledges that it cannot entirely control the action of its members while engaged in the seclusion of their inner offices, while certain other organizations pretend that they can. All of us, of course, know better. But we do not intend to devote all our energies to denying false reports. Indeed we intend to continue to do so much else that it will soon be known that damaging reports from a certain interested source are untrue until it will no longer be necessary for us to deny them. One achivement alone will justify the existence of the organization in the minds of those who are not blinded to their own interest and the interest of their profession by their devotion to one man. I refer to our arrangement for the protection of our members. An early false step in this feature of our activities has now been corrected and we are now furnishing to our members the strongest protection ever offered to chiropractors. This includes legal defense and indemnity under Lloyd's of London. It is unnecessary to enlarge on the ability or stability of this concern. \"Lloyd's\" is a household word the world around. Doing something like thirty million dollars' worth of business annually in the United States alone, they have successfully protected almost every conceivable character of property and business and profession. They retain the best legal talent available and win their cases . The same business and brains and capital that have made them successful wherever they have gone will now be put behind the profession of chiropractic and the defense of A.C.A. members. Indemnit y is also guaranteed. In case of fines being imposed, members are indemnified in any amount up to five thousand dollars on any one suit or action, and not to exceed a total of fifteen thousand dollars in any one year. In cases of judgment being secured for actual or alleged injury to a patient, such judgments under \"malpratice\" are also indemnified in any amount up to five thousand dollars on any single action, and not to exceed a total of fifteen thousand dollars in any one year. This service and protec tion and indemnity, together with all the privileges and benefits of membership in the American Chiropractic Association , are furnished for an annual fee of only sixty dollars - no assessments. We have now reached a point where our success is assured, and we expect to be of immense service to the chiropractic profession. If you desire to belong to an organization of chiroprators, national in scope, that has proven its independence of school influences, dominated by the desire to be of service to chiropractic as it is known in field practice, able to protect you in the practice of your profession, and in the control of men who are exclusively practitioners of chiropractic, join the American Chiropractic Association - there is none other that can measure up to these specifications.

Margetts LLB, DC at Wichita KS on 5/4/23 (page?): First - It is essential that th profession ma y protect itself from the innumberable so-called chiropractic schools, which have sprung up like mushrooms over night, and from their product, many of them a great discredit to the profession.... Second - It is essential so that the profession may protect itself from leaders and schools who wish to dictate to it as to its legislation, practice, advertising, and in every other particular where freedom should prevail. There is no good reason why schools should have a right to dictate to the practitioners in the field. It is time the profession was telling the schools what it wishes, instead of the schools coercing the profession. At present there is no organiztion through which the profession can protect itself against the unjust encroachments of schools, schools which have national organizations of able politicians and national periodicals, spreading their propaganda throughout the whole profession. Third - It is essential that the profesion may protect itself against the nation-wide medical enemy, the A.M.A. Fourth - It is essential that the profession may protect itself by insurance against unjust malpractice suits. Fifth - In order to carry on research work. Sixth - To bring about reciprocity and fraternity among the chiropractors of different schools. Seventh - To carry on nation-wide publicity for chiropractic. Eighth - When called upon to aid in the passage of chiropractic legislation The A.C.A. Supplies the Need and Is Fundamentally Democratic First - It is not an \"anti\" organiztion. Every rep utable chiropractor is welcome to its ranks. The liberty of the bona fide chiorpractor is not to be limited. Second - Its membership will be representative of all schools. No one school will have dominance. Third - ITs annual meetings, at which its officers will be elected and changes in its organic law decided upon, will not be held in a distinctively chiropractic school town, nor in connection with the annual hurrah of any chiropractic school. Fourth - No chiropractic leader is to have any dictatorsh ip in its affairs. Fifth - Its officers will not be permitted to be connected with any chiropractic school or its faculty. Sixth - Provision is made for the Initiative, Referendum and Recall, and for calling Special Meetings, so its membership may at all times control its affairs. Seventh - It affords protection, provides for publicity, research work , legislative aid, and professional co-operation. Eighth - Every chiropractor who is 21 years of age, of good moral charactter and of recognized standing in the profession, is eligible for membership. There are three classes of membership: Class A, for those in non-licensing States, costing $60 per year, and joining fee of $10, affording legal protection, and indemnity to extent of $5,000, terms $30 down, $20 in two months, and $20 in four months; Class B, for license States, costing $45, and joining fee of $10, affording malpractice protection, with indemnity to $5,000, terms $25 down, $15 in two months, and $15 in four months, Class C, all rights and privileges, excepting malpractice protection, costing $20 per year, and joining fee of $10, terms $10 down, $10 in two months, and $10 in four months. But the legal protection feature of this organization is not its main purpose. The main purpose is that the chiropractors may have an organization of their own, national in scope, for the other, and higher, purposes heretofore referred to. It is yet in its infancey. Some may say, I'll wait until I see if it grows to manhood before I join. Ignoble thought.

The progress of Chiropractic is being blocked, by the discord, covetousness, bigotry and confusion in our ranks, and all because we have not had a national organization of the Chiropractors themselves, applying itself to constructive work, rather than destructive; sowing the seeds of fraternalism, instead of hatred; creating confidence in one another, rther than suspicion; making Chiropractors friends, instead of foes; making for peace, instead of strife, understanding rther than misunderstanding; emphasizing fundamental agreements, rther than petty differences. We who live in this day of our profession, are to be envied our privilege to invest ourselves in this splendid movement, that will make for peace, good will, prosperity, and, above all the most valuable, the spread of Chiropractic to the multitudes. 1923 (June); Chirogram [2(2)] reports: -Editorial by G.A. Fisk DC (p. 2): One of the finest articles it has been our pleasure to read for many a day was contained in the N.C.C. Journal recently, the author Dr.. A.L. Forster. The subject was the necessity of raising the standards of chiropractic education, particularly the pre-chiropractic educational requirements. Some oppose this step. We shall try to believe that their motives are sincere. That the early pioneers in Chiropractic did not possess a high-school education or its equivalent is no argument to be applied to the present situation. As Dr Forster aptly states, in those days it was chiropractic that was subjected to a test. Because of its inherent merit, that method has won the public confidence to an extent that assures it a place in the healing art for all time. Now, however, it is not chiropractic but chiropractors who are under examination by the public. The fact that Chiropractic has won recognition in many states of the Union, instead of assuring it a protected future, as so many seem to assume, is, in fact, the greatest menace to its perpetuation. Herein Dr. BJ Palmer concurs, for he has consistently displayed in his utterances and writings a note of doubt as to the ultimate value of legal recognition to chiropractic. However, we believe his reason for believing so is incorrect. He is against raising the pre-chiropractic educational requirements because he evidently fears it will cut down the output of chiropractors, thereby permitting the opposition to maintain an eternal numerical supremacy. We believe there are enough chiropractors in the country to safeguard the privileges so far won. A sufficient number of people are believers in chiropractic to help defend those rights. 1923 (Oct): National (College) Journal of Chiropractic [11(2)} prints: -J. from the Chirogram; see National (College) Journal of Chiropractic for June, 1923; (p. 25-?): One of the finest articles it has ever been our pleasure to read for many a day was contained in the N.C.C.

The field split on the question. A few saw its value and began to take it up at once. Some of THE FIELD held off and waited \"to see.\" Today - some 13 years later - it is an accepted form of technique by the entire field. Few chiropractors but what are for it. The schools split. On one side - THE PSC. On the other side - ALL OTHER schools. Loban became bitterly opposed, and wrote much against this 'form of mixing.' Forster wrote much and said much more against its use. Other schools took much the same attitude, all trying to stem the tide of the new movement, not because the movement was wrong, BUT BECAUSE ONE B.J. PALMER ADVOCATED IT. Today - some 13 years later - Loban writes forSpinography, teaches it, uses it, advocates it. Today - some 13 years later - Forster puts it first in value to detect subluxations. Now comes the Neurocalometer idea. Loban is neither for nor forninst, he is riding both waves, ready to jump either way that proves to be the most popular.

Inasmuch as the writer is the head of the Department of Technique in this college, he believes it imperative tht he become familiar with all systems, and notionsof adjusting. So in accordance with that thought, we learned this method from Dr. Babcock, who is featured with Dr. Spears in the illustrations in the little book accompanying the course. The course usually takes two to four hours, but as the Doctor was visiting relatives in the city, he came out three different days that we might discuss the system pro and con. Inasmuch as our methods were highly satisfactory and include everything of any value that the Spears System includes, we will teach the same system of adjusting that we have been teaching. Our present system of adjusting includes the Palmer Method , which the writer learned in the P.S.C., moves and methods of lesser merit from Palmer's \"Exposition of Old Moves,\" Dr.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 20 Loban's, Dr. Carver's, Dr. Gregory's, Dr. Riley's and Dr. Forster's works, together with a few points that writer has discovered in his ten years of experience. 1926 (Oct 29-30): \"Dr Durham...mentioned how all Chiropractors in general through out the different states have the desire to get togeter, also the progress that has been made in the way of uniting the UCA and the ACA into one great organization....Dr. Margetts of the ACA made a very interesting talk, speaking on the unity of all National Organizations and showing the necessity of such an Organization...Report of National meeting held at Milwaulkee WI of July Archives); 7/14/27) 1926 (Dec 29): NCC absorbs College Janse DDT, DC, ND (1947) writes: ...1926 marked another milestone of progress for the National College . Under the direction of the late Henry Lindlahr the entire student body and the better part of the faculty of the Lindlahr College of Naturopathy were transferred to the National College . This represented the introduction of new and broader concepts and as a result augmented the course of instruction and clinical practice. Concurrently, the year 1926 also represented the appointment of Dr. W.A. Budden as Dean of the National College . Dr. Budden, well-known throughout the profession for his academic integrity and scientific acuity, as well as his forceful determination to maintain chiropractic as a broad and liberal concept and system of therapy, which must come to embody all non-medical methods, was indeed a great asset to the college. He evolved a standard of education and teaching that has made the National College the leader in many respects in properly qualifying its students for licensure and practice. His staunch and insistent stand in defense of adjunctive therapy as part of chiropractic has done much to liberalize and elevate the general range of chiropractic practice. 1927: Schedule for Colorado Chiropractic University, 1927 Post Graduate Course; school located at 14th Street and Cleveland Place, Denver; faculty include (from Cleveland papers, CCC/KC; in my Beatty/UNHA folder): *Dr. F.I.

He was received, however, with the utmost kindness. He manifested an interest in the course of study, sat in one of the classes, visited the clinics, and was examined and treated as one of the patients. So far as he could determine, there was no effort to conceal anything from him or to make false impressions as to existing conditions. He found conditions as follows: 1. Buildings. - The school is located at 20 North Ashland Boulevard, Chicago, in a brick building with a frontage of one third of the block, formerly used for a theological school. While in a fair state of preservation, it is by no means fitted for its present use; ventilation and lighting are poor, and the arrangement for clinical and laboratory work is abominable. There are five floors and a basement. The upper three floors and most of the second are used as a dormitory for the students. The second floor contains two lecture rooms; the basement contains the chemistry laboratory and the dissecting room; with the exception of these four rooms, the school activities and all clinical work are confined to the first floor. 2. Institutions. - This one floor and the four other rooms accommodate several institutions of learning. These are: (1) The National College of Chiropractic, giving an eighteen months' course, tuition $600; (2) The National Academy, giving a six months' preparatory (high school) course, tuition $45; (3) The Hygieia College of Sanitary Science, giving a three months' course in personal and public hygiene, tuition $100; (4) The Lindlahr College of Natural Therapeutics, recently purchased, giving a three months' course in physiotherapy, tuition $100; (5) The National School of Obstetrics, giving a six months' course of lectures with privilege of observing a few deliveries (but not assisting) at the West End Hospital, tuition $150; and (6) a six months' Night School quiz course in preparation for the Illinois examination, tuition $200. There are also a three-month postgraduate course, tuition $150, with privilege of continuing indefinitely at $30 for each additional month; a two-week intensive review course offered twice a year, tuition j$100; a six-month professional course tuition $250; a roentgen-ray course; a dissection course; a first-aid course, and a variety of combinations of courses at fancy prices. All these courses, with anything else available, are thrown together into a cum laude course running through thirty-two months and \"lumped off\" to the student for the round sum of $1,000. These various colleges and courses, with all their associated clinics, are conducted on this one floor and in the four additional rooms mentioned. 3. Finances. - The building is owned by the school. There is no endowment, but expenses are paid out of the income from tuitions, laboratory fees, graduation fees, and fees from examinations and semiprivate clinic treatments. 4. Faculty. - The faculty is composed of eighteen \"doctors.\" Of these, eight are doctors or philosophers of chiropractic only; one holds the degree of D.S.C. (meaning unknown); three have bachelors' degrees from some source not specified; two are osteopaths; four are doctors of medicine. Of these four doctors of medicine, two are graduates of schools now extinct, one of the schools having been rated in class B and the other in class C. The third man is a graduate of a class C school still operating but refused recognition by the medical boards of forty-six states; he has been repeatedly under arrest for practicing medicine without a license, and has doubtless been driven for protection to the shelter of this cult school. The fourth man, formerly dean of an obscure school of mechanotherapy and now president of this college of chiropractic, obtained his M.D. degree before the medical schools ofAmerica were classified; because of his practicing chiropractic without a license he was at one time named with several other illicit practitioners in an injunction procedure; whether he has since secured a license or not is unknown. So far as is known, only one of these four men ever secured admittance to any medical society; this one was soon suspended. In brief, while these four men have been able to secure medical degrees from some source, not one of them has any standing in the organized medical profession of America. 5. Students. - This school claimed \"approximately 350 students\" in 1926. It now reports about 200, and this number doubtless includes post-graduates. These students lack enthusiasm. A large percentage of the school's recent graduates failed to pass the state board examinations. The students seen in laboratory, classroom and clinics move slowly, as if neither busy nor deeply interested; one of them, when asked, \"How do you like it her?\" replied, \"Pretty well,\" but with an indifference that reflected doubt on even that mild statement. 6. Lecture Rooms. - There is one large room on the first floor equipped with about 125 opera seats. Each of the two second-floor lecture rooms will seat about fifty. There are about thirty seats in the roentgen-ray room. Two or three charts hand on the walls of each of these rooms. The lighting and ventilation are fairly good. \"7. Laboratories. - A small chemical laboratory on the first floor is used by interns only (that is, for work on clinic patients by graduate students). In this laboratory were seen the usual paraphernalia, including a microscope and a four-tube centrifuge. In the basement, in a large but poorly lighted room, were desks capable of accommodating about fifty students in chemistry. This laboratory was clean and in good order, with a profusion of reagent bottles and a number of Bunsen burners arranged on the desks. The equipment seen, however, was all for elementary work. No microscopes, distillation flasks, Kjeldahl apparatus, kymographs, nor anthing else indicating even the occasional doing of advanced work in chemistry or physiology was seen either here or anywhere else in the guilding, though there was an evident desire to impress the visitor favorably. In cases near the entrance to this laboratory were a number of jars containing well mounted and well preserved pathologic specimens. 8. Dissection Room. - This room, also in the basement, was small, poorly lighted and poorly ventilated. It contained six tables, each holding a cadaver or the remains of one, and covered with a white cloth. Permission was given to examine this material. All of it had been allowed to deteriorate quite markedly from dehydration. None of it presented any carefully dissected structures. The bodies had been skinned and an attempt made to work out a few muscles, but no blood vessels had been followed and no nerves traced. On one of the bodies the structures lying on both sides of the vertebral column had been worked on (a specific task at which a chiropractor should be proficient), but the quality of the work suggested that it might have been done with a currycomb. In all the six bodies, each of which had been worked on by four or five students, there was no evidence that any one of the workers had been able to appreciate and take advantage of his opportunities. For this course, six bodies are bought from an undertaker and used through a period of three months; these particular bodies had now probably been used for about eight or ten weeks; such use is a waste of good material. 9. Roentgen-Ray Room. - In this room was roentgen-ray equipment of the most modern type, such as any high-grade technician might be justly proud of. The visitor was told that \"it cost thousands of dollars and was hard to get because the medical men had a corner on it, but the school was able to get it for the students.\" 10. Clinics. - (a) The great majority of patients go to the physiotherapy clinic. A dozen or more patients were seen in this clinic or waiting to be admitted. Most of them were women interested in the gynecology section; nearly all if not all the others were being treated by diathermy or by therapeutic light. The gynecology section was not visited. In the other sections were foru diathermy machines, four ordinary therapeutic lamps, and one Alpine Sun Lamp. Of the last named, the visitor was told: \"This is the violet ray, thirty times brighter than the sun. It brings eczema out of a hand like water out of a sponge.\" One booth contained a machine for doing mechanical massage. There were no bath rooms nor cabinets - not even a booth forChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 22 giving the much discussed \"blood washing\" marathon bath; indeed, there was no other equipment except a few chiropractic adjustment tables. (b) The chiropractic clinics - one for men and one for women - are hard to find without a guide. Each contained between fifteen and twenty modern adjustment tables, while in the men's clinic was one osteopath's table. Although it was in the clinic period that these clinics were visited, not one of these thirty or forty tables was occupied. Two men gave evidence that they had just been adjusted (they were readjusting their wearing apparl), but in the women's room there was not even a \"doctor\" to be seen. These are the public clinic rooms; there is one other room, divided into small booths, each of which contains a table for \"semiprivate\" adjustments; less than half a dozen of these booths were occupied. 11. Library. - When it was intimated that the tour of inspection was finished, the visitor requested that he be shown the library. The school catalogue contains a picture of this room, with the subscription, \"The only one of its kind in the country, this library contains over 1,000 volumes.\" But his request elicited the astounding reply: \"There ain't no library.\" Half doubting this statement, he inquired of a graduate student later, and was told the library was in the private office of one of the faculty members; no willingness to show it was manifested, and the visitor considered it unwise to insist. 12. Matriculation Requirements. - The visitor was now conducted into the business office. Here he was told that high school graduation or its equivalent was required of all students, but that one who had had no high school work whatever could easily gain the equivalent certificate by attending a quiz course two evenings weekly during the first six months of his chiropractic study and then passing an examination. \"It isn't hard,\" said the registrar. \"Nobody fails, and you don't need to worry about that at all.\" 13. Course. - The course is eighteen months long, and is so aranged that one may begin any day. \"No matter what day you begin,\" said the registrar, \"you will come round to that same point again at the end of eighteen months.\" 14. Results. - To help determine the efficiency of the product of this system, the visitor now became a patient. After registration, he was taken into a small, poorly lighted booth, where his history was taken by a student. This history consisted of his name, address, age, sex, marital state, occupation, and nationality; cause of death of parents; his previous illnesses and operations; his present complaint and a four line story of how it came about. No other questions were askedand no other facts recorded. The patient had a cold and a cough that no observing physician could overlook; he made a definite effort to get these into the record without mentioning them directly, but in vain. The patient was now taken, with the history, into the examining room. Here a member of the faculty read the history, took and recorded the blood pressure and pulse rate, listened to the heart sounds and to the breath sounds just below the clavicles, and ran his hand up and down the patient's nude back. He also tried the knee and elbow reflexes and did a Romberg test. Diathermy was then prescribed, and a graduate was called to take charge of the patient. As the graduate led the patient into the booth containing the needed electrical apparatus, he called another graduate to him and, pointing to the machine, asked, \"How do you work this thing?\" Conclusions. - The conclusions are self-evident. 1. This school receives students who have no eductional foundation. 2. It gives a course of training (a) under instructors not qualified to teach, (b) with equipment hopelessly inadequate, (c) with an all too meager supply of clinical material, and (d) reaching over a period entirely too short to qualify the most brilliant mind or the most skilful hand for the work of a physician. 3. It charges an exorbitant price for the service it claims to render. 4. Its graduates are not and cannot be healers of the sick, though they are taught to pose as such and so become a menace to the public health. 5. Such an institution is a disgrace, and it can best serve the public interest by quietly going out of existence. 1928 (Jan): Bulletin of the ACA [5(1)] \"A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY\"; announces there will no longer be a charge for FR Margetts ' lectures (p. 1)-Craig M. Kightlinger DC, PhC, President of New York-Eastern Chiropractic Institute (recently amalgamated), authors \"Natural Law\": Chiropractic was discovered by one man and developed by an other, and we must give full credit to him who discovered it and still greater credit to him who has developed it. We cannot forget the many trying times that the developer of our science went through to keep it alive and to bring it to a point where it could stand on its feet. To him we owe more than we can ever repay and to him is due the fact that the Science of Chiropractic is where it is today. He took us through the Dark Ages of the development, but now the time has come when once again the Natural Law must be taken into account and the leader of old must either sit at the council table and consult with the minds of the many or take his place on the side lines and let the march of Progress pass. We need him but we need as much and more the ideas that result from the clear thinking of the interested members of our profession. We must have the cool logic of the best minds and the greatest brains of the entire profession. The dictates of the one, no matter how sincere and honest they may be, can serve no more. No one mind can see and appreciate the wants and needs of the Chiropractic profession. We may need a general to guide and direct us but we need a staff to do the planning. Nature is not a pleasing master and Natural Law is many times cruel, but it is the result of truth and it will prevail. It is not the nicest spectacle to see the old leader of the herd beaten and his leadership taken by a younger and stronger opponent and it is not the most pleasant thought to know that, sooner or later, the old leader must place his mantle on the shoulders of the best minds of the many. It is a fact and facts must be faced.... There is nothing the matter with Chiropractic. There is a great deal the matter with Chiropractors. They have never been used to thinking for themselves. The time has arrived when they must think for themselves and must lead themselves, or they will go the way of all who oppose the progress of Natural Law and be forced into oblivion....

We feel that we have our hands full in teaching Chiropractic. As we have repeatedly stated, we feel that the use of adjuncts by the Chiropractor is a personal matter which he should be permitted to decide in his own practice without being subject to ridicule or condemnation.... 1928 (Sept 3-5): International Chiropractic Congress (ICC) is organized at meeting in Chicago; the ICC \"is represented in 34 states\" (Turner, 1931, pp. 169-70, 288); ICC \"organized, to consist of the presidents of such colleges, the State Examining Board representatives, and also representatives of State Associations\" (Metz, 1965, pp. 54-5) 1928 (Dec): National [14(5)] (W.A. Budden DC is Editor): -John N. Monroe, A.M., D.C. has article reprinted from the Bulletin of the West Virginia Chiropactors' Society , entitled \"Empiric versus rational chiropractic\" (pp. 5-6); he suggests that contrary to BJ's notions, much of chiropractic is empirically rather than rationally derived; disparages the personification of Innate; suggests that absurdities of claims based on empiric chiropractic: ...has dealt rational chiroparctic a severe blow in that it seriously hampers our efforts to obtain scientific recognition...Empiric chiropractic cannot justify itself by saying that it gets results. Empiric medicine also gets results to a certain extent. Both succeed because of the powerful natural healing pwers inherent in the body itself and not by virtue of the method. If empiric medicine is fast losing its hold on the people, the chiropractor who practices by rule of thumb will not fall heir to that practice. ....The scientific chiropractor refuses to become a slave to any theory. He is ready change when knowledge of fundamental facts warrants change... The chiropractic profession is under heavy obligation to the scientists of the past and present. It is to their untiring efforts in the field of research that we owe our knowledge of the fundamental principles upon which our method of healing is based. Expecially are we indebted to them for our knowledge of the vegetative nervous system, since it is through this system that we obtain a large percentage of our results... In conclusion, I submit that the greatest liability our profession has today is the empiric practitioner. He is the one who is responsible for the defeat of legislation in the interest of chiropractic; he is the one who elects to go to jail for violating the law; it is at him that the finger of scorn is pointed by the medical doctors; he is the reason why more college graduates do not adopt chiropractic as a career, and just so long as he dominates the profession, will our colleges have difficulty in matriculating college bred men and women. On the other hand, the greatest asset of the profesison is the rational chiropractor. Our hope for the future rests in keeping of those earnest,sincere believers in the scientific basis of chiropractic. I plead for rational chiropractic. I plead for scientific education and the whole hearted support of those chiropractic colleges teaching a rational doctrine. I believe in chiropractic.

I still believe in a united profession. But I am not an advocate of amalgamation without regard for the price that is to be paid. The desired goal sought to be attained by amalgamation is being reached by the continuing growth of the ACA. There is one status that is worse than the state of being single, and that is being linked in an unhappy marriage. There is a worse condition for the profession than the existence of competitive organizations, and that is, an amalgamated organization, with amalgamation effected at the price of the loss of the splendid democracy and program of service that has characterized the ACA in the past.

He graduated from Ross Chiropractic College , Detroit, Mich., in 1913; was licensed to practice in Illinois in 1914 and has successfully practiced in Chicago ever since. Dr. Cochrane , in addition to his ACA activities, took part in organizing the first Chiropractic association in the State of Illinois - the Chicago Chiropractors Association, formed in 1916. He served as president for three terms. Charter member of the Illinois State Association and served three terms as member of Legislative committee.

Schulze , M.D., D.C. from Ed M. Gibson, D.C. The Health System 6327 So. Ashland Ave., Chicago Ill Dear Doctor Schulze: The following paragraphs will give a record of my schooling: I was born in Blackhawk Co., Waterloo, Iowa, May 2nd, 1898. Received my early schoolwork in the state of Alabama finishing the eighth grade at the Waterloo Public Schools; and entered West Waterloo High School in the year 1914, completing the Freshmen and Sophmore years, after which I took a course at the Waterloo Business College graduating in the Spring of 1918. This training led to a clerical position with the Iowa Bell Telephone Company, where I worked for one and one half years; or until I became interested in drugless healing and went to Weigert School of Mechano Therapy , Cedar Falls, Iowa, receiving a diploma from that school on the 8th day of September, 1920. In 1921 I entered the Palmer School of Chiroprac tic, Davenport, Ia; graduated in June 1923; took the Iowa State Board for Chiropractic in the Fall of the same year and passed with a grade of 92% average. In the Spring of 1925 I came to Chicago and took a position at the Evanston Hospital, Evanston, Illinois. This was like more schooling as it was a responsible position where the entire hospital, including the Staff doctors, heads of all floors and departments took orders from the admitting office. One little error at this office might mean a serious disturbance in the operating room, xray department, delivery room or any of the floors. In 1928 I opened an office at 63rd and Ashland Avenue, Chicago, where I am still practising. At two different times during the years 1928-31 I substituted teaching at the Kellberg Institute, 14 N.

Dear Doctor Schulze; Thanks for answering my letter so quickly. I note what you say about showing that one or more of my classmates have been licensed but that will only satisfy the four year requirement. Doctor Schulze can't you give me a certificate covering physiotherapy owing to the fact that my degree was a double one. The diploma you sent me conferred the straight degree of Doctor of Chiropractic from the National College, the original the full degree of Doctor of Chiropractic and Physiological Therapeutics . I will be glad to reimburse you for any expense connected with it. I am depending on you for help or I will never be able to put this thing over. Are you going to be in Detroit this summer. As soon as school is out here I expect to have three or four more prospects. I am taking care of a High School football team and there are several who have spoken to me but I can't place them just at present. Please send a new Bulletin. Fraternally yours Walter H. Wilson 1932 (Apr 20): W.C. Schulze , M.D., D.C. responds to letter of 4/16/32) from Walter H. Wilson (National College Library Archives): Dr. Walter H. Wilson, 1207 Seneca Street Buffalo, New York Dear Doctor Wilson: Being one of our own people, of course we want to help you all we can. I know and you know that you have had the training in Chiropractic and Physiological Therapeutics and that work was covered in your original diploma. I cannot for the life of me see why a separate and distinct diploma should be necessary for Physio-Therapy for those of you who have the old diploma. This old diploma was accepted in Indiana and our people were able to get registration there in both Chiropractic and Physiological Therapeutics . But of course every State makes its own rules and regulations and one has to abide by them whatever they are. We do now and have for some time issued a separate certificate in Physio-Therapy. This certificate is from the NATIONAL COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC but covers Physio-Therapy only. I think a numberof our people in New York have been able to procure their license on that diploma. With the work you have had we think you are entitled to the diploma. Ordinarily we require the doctor return to school here for our six weeks' P.G. course in Physio-Therapy for which the tuition fee is $75.00. In your case we shall waive the attendance here, giving you credit for the work you have done, and allow you the N.C.C. Physio- Therapy diploma for the $75.00. It will be dated June 28, 1918 when you completed your work here. If this is satisfactory to you, send us your order for the certificate, advising us how you would like your name to be engraved upon it, and accompanied by your remittance. Our Registrar will see to it at once that the certificate is ordered and you can have it within a week or ten days' time. Glad to know, by the way, that you have a number of propsective students in mind for us. Remember that the NATIONAL will pay you a $50.00 Courtesy Fee for each student you send to us who takes the regular eighteen months' course or any of the longer courses. Name slips are enclosed. Whenever you think the time is ripe for the prospective student to receive our literature, send us his or her name and address on one of those name slips and we will be glad to co-operate and help all we can to get the interested people here. Very truly yours, THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC, PRESIDENT P.S. I cannot say at the moment whether I will be in Detroit for the Convention, but I will certainly make an attempt to be there. 1932 (May 5): letter from B.F. Wells, D.O. to W.C. Schulze, M.D., D.C. (National College Archives) DR. B.F. WELLS Osteopathic Physician 4831 North Spaulding Avenue CHICAGO Dr. Schulze, Dean 20 N. Ashland Ave. Chicago Dear Doctor: Thru some error in address, a letter intended for you was sent to the College at 1632 Madison St. About two weeks ago I called on your business manager regarding your faculty. As you were not in the city, he suggested that I write you. My practice at this time is requiring but a small part of my time and since I have spent many years in the teaching work, I am inquiring whether you contemplate any change in your teaching staff in the near future. I spent several years in the public schools including the common and high school teaching and after beginning my work in drugless therapy did considerable teaching in the Chicago College of Osteopathy. While I did work in nearly every department except that of Technique, my preferences were Physiology, Embryology, Pedicatrics and Practice. Should there be any probability of an opportunity to join your faculty, I would be pleased to call on you, give you my experience in detail and I can give you as long a list of references as you may desire. My preference would be daytime work, but could arrange for almost any time you might need my services. Awaiting your reply, I remain, Sincerely, B.F. Wells 1932 (July 2): letter from W.C. Schulze, M.D., D.C. to B.F. Wells, D.O. (National College Archives): Dr. B.F. Wells 4831 North Spaulding Avenue Chicago, Illinois Dear Doctor Wells, On May the 5th you wrote us a letter which we answered on May the 7th stating that at the first opportunity we had, we would communicate with you.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 28 This opportunity has come now. One of our teachers has accepted a residence job in a hospital in Pennsylvania. The classes which he has had are as follows: Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8:30 to 10:00 A.M. - Pediatrics. Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 to 11:30 A.M. - a Review of Anatomy. Thus far, from the beginning of this month, he has covered osteology, is now on neurology, and the idea is to finish myology. All this is review. He has also had an hour Monday evenings from 6:30 to 7:30 and his subject there has been Hygiene and Sanitation. Of course the summertime is very slow, but here is an opening. It would mean $17.00 a week for you, we paying $3.00 a period of an hour and a half, and $2.00 for one hour. If you are interested, please communicate with me at the first opportunity.

Cleveland Troost Avenue Kansas City, Mo. Dear Doctor: Herein, you will find copies of: Catalogue of the New York School of Chiropractic; A letter addressed and mailed to the International Chiropractic Congress; A brief of the most important communications between the New York School of Chiropractic and the International Chiropractic Congress from March 15, 1927, to date. Because of the fact that there is an apparent neglect in answering mail, as well as possible discrimination for some unknown reason, on the part of the official office of the Congress, I am requesting you, as an official of that organization, to present this matter before the convention next month at Kansas City, and to insist that it is acted upon and notification of result sent us. I am sorry to be forced to appeal to you in this matter, but there seems no other way to elicit a definite answer or recognition from the official office of the Congress. Thanking you in advance for your action, I am Most sincerely yours, Thurce C. Peterson Executive Secretary NEW YORK SCHOOL OF CHIROPRACTIC 1932 (Oct 3): letter from Thure C. Peterson, D.C. Executive Secretary of the New York School of Chiropractic (founded 1912), at 55 W 42nd St., NYC, to H.A. Gallaher, D.C., Sec'y of the ICC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): International Chiropractic Congress Dr. H.A. Gallaher, Secretary P.O. Box 463, Guthrie, Oklahoma. Gentlemen: The New York School of Chiropractic feels entitled to the recognition accorded other schools of lower requirements and standards, and requests immediate action and recognition by you, or a definite reason why it is not forthcoming. Our files show that we have been in communication with you since March 15, 1927, and that there has been laxity on your part both in answering our letters and in stating the reason for the delay of recognition. In fact, this delay seems to denote discrimination on your part, and it is with this idea in mind that we are attaching hereto a brief of the more important communications in our files. We are enclosing herein a copy of our school catalogue, which is self-explanatory. This catalogue was issued after the completion of the first calendar year of the course as outlined therein. This course wasdesigned and instituted more than a year ago when Dr. H. Lewis Trubenbach and I, formerly of Carver Chiropractic Institute, and lately of the Institute of the Science and Art of Chiropractic, entered the organization of the New York School of Chiropractic and blended those two schools with it. Although improved from time to time, the New York School of Chiropractic has continued an uninterrupted teaching program since its inception in 1912. Your Dr. Ralph John has inspected this school, and apparently approved it. We are now occupying the premises constructed for the Institute of the Science and Art of Chiropractic, which is on your list as pending recognition. We are teaching what is manifestly the longest and most complete chiropractic course in the world. Therefore, on behalf of the New York School of Chiropractic, I am requesting that you take immediate action in this matter at your convention in Kansas City next month, that you notify us as to your action, and that you list our school in the next issue of your Journal. In the meantime, any information desired by you which is not included in the enclosed catalogue will be promptly forthcoming upon request. Very truly yours, Thurce C.

I would advise you to write to him direct in the future, at Webster City, Iowa. By all means send a representative to this Kansas City Congress Convention. I will be glad to bring it up for consideration. If your representative was on hand, it would expedite matters and give the Congress an opportunity to know your institution better and gain any and all information they desire.

So far, chiropractors, you have been specialists, spine spec ialists, just another kind of a specialist among so many others. Some of you are earnestly trying to limit yourself to just such a specialty. You don't fill the most crying need of the patient! He will come to you when he thinks his spine needs cracking, but he will pas you by when he needs a doctor! A doctor is something apart from a specialist, whatever his specialty may be. The need for a doctor, confidant, wise man, is an instinct bred into mankind; the need for spcialism is something specialists are trying to 'sell people,' and it goes against the grain. It is expensive, complicated, unsatisfactory and contrary to the lay mind.Therefore, let me suggest that chiropractors walk into this neglected field, that they prepare themselves to be family Doctors , that they strive to fulfill this urgent need in the hearts of the people. Drugless healing has all that is necessary for this field, common sense, dietetics, suntherapy, water cure, and constructive psychology - what more is needed? -LACC claims: \"We own our own buildings, clear of all incumbrances, an investment of over $110,000\"; new term will start 9/5/33; degrees conferred: DC, PhC, ND (p. 20) 1933 College Journal of Chiropractic (16[3]) reports: -Dr. Schulze 's participation in the Denver convention of the NCA, reprints Schulze 's mention in the Denver Post on August 17, 1933, entitled \"Supple Spine hailed as more vital to woman's health than cosmetics\" (p. 7) -\"NRA Code for Chiropractors\"; suggests that Franklin Roosevelt and Vice-President Garners are strong supports of \"drugless methods and friends of chiropractors (pp. 10-4) 1933 (Sept KAC votes for , Ohlson Durham re-elected to KAC Legislative Committee; William C.

Only an optimist, however, and one quite unfamiliar with the economics of chiropractic schools and colleges would suggest that, by advancing scholastic requirements, more money could be made. The facts being quite the contrary, as we have intimated, the \"school men\" as a group hesitated. Some suggested that while the idea was a good one, the time was not yet. Nevertheless, Dr. E.J. Smith , young graduate of the National College and of Western Reserve University in 1921, gave the first real impetus toward what is now so far developed by establishing a four- year school in Cleveland, Ohio. The Metropolitan College of Chiropractic opened its doors to the first four-year students and the new era had begun. Shortly after this pioneer effort, the National College proclaimed that it would issue certificates of graduation \"cum laude\" to those who successfully negotiated its thirty-two months course. The writer of this article initiated this action and signed as \"Dean\" the first diplomas. It should be stated here, and with no sense of derogation of those who took a leading part in this advance, in the case of the N.C.C. certainly, the fact that a medical board of examiners held sway over chiropractic activities in Illinois, and to some extent in Ohio, tended powerfully to fertilize the soil in which the actual four-year course took root. Almost simultaneously with these events, the new idea appeared in Colorado. The late Homer Beatty , head of the college in Denver and author of the well-known text, \"Anatomical Adjustive Technique,\" now began to raise his voice calling for thirty-six months training. A vigorous advocate of any cause he espoused, the impact of his personality and propaganda soon began to make itself felt. Dr. Beatty, however, was not alone. Associated with him in this crusade were several of the teachers of the school, notably Dr. Niel Bishop, as well as a number of men \"in the field.\" Behind them all, however, and adding powerfully to the growth of the movement, loomed the figure of Professor Jones, dean emeritus of Northwestern University, School of Psychology, and doctor of chiropractic of National College . Now another voice from the far west was added to the growing debate. The pages of the National Journal began to reflect the views of C.O. Watkins of Montana. Logical, incisive persistent \" C.O.\" hammered away at the bulwarks of the short-course school of thought.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 31 There can be no doubt that his rapid rise to a leading place in the councils of the NCA brought powerful aid and comfort to the four-year idea. It was, however, to Dr. R.D. Ketchum , of Bend, Oregon, that credit must go for giving final impulse toward definite action by the NCA. The doctor was at that time state delegate for Oregon, and was generally admitted to be one of the most influential and respected members of the then House of Counselors . It was as such that he issued his call to arms. Said he at the close of a short but powerful exhortation, \"We have talked a lot about the four-year course, let us get busy and do something about it.\" Some time previous to this event, however, a committee appointed by the NCA had been at work attempting to evaluate the status of the schools. The outline of an accreditation system already had emerged. The groundwork was being laid for what was to come. The challenge from the West then was caught up and echoed by this committee and the wheels began to turn. At this point there strode into the forefront of the picture a stalwart figure. Already a leading member of the committee, he now took a commanding position. From that moment on, the incisive logic, the mordant sarcasm, the merciless dialectic, coupled with a calm, rock-like resistance to criticism and opposition that is J.J. Nugent, served as a rallying point in the conflict wich suged and eddied around the four-year idea. Powerful aid now also came from members of the Executive Committee. The secretary, Dr. L.M. Rogers , as an executive, long a silent sympthizer, became effectively articulate ont he affirmative side. Drs. Gordon M. Goodfellow , of California, Downs, of Montana, Harriman, of North Dakota; men from Iowa, from Illinois, from Minnesota, from Wisconsin, stood up to be counted for the new day in education. Thus ended phase one. 1934 (Jan): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [3(1)] publishes: -W.C. Schulze's article \"The new year may mean much to every one of us!\" (pp. 8-9), in which he recalls a visit to the Egyptian pyramids, and: This study of \"The Great Doctors\" teaches me ever so much, provided, of course, I read it with instinctive urge \"to find out\", with \"the deep and cultivated look\" of the true doctor, rather than with the bigoted mind of that practitioner of the healing art, whether he be chiropractor, surgeon, medicine man or naturopath, who takes authority for truth rather than truth for authority. Listen, my gentle reader , to a verbatum quotation following the recital of the legend of Aesculapius being slain by Pluto because of his supposed or expressed claim that he could bring the dead back to life . This legend gives fine expression to the view tht the healing art is essentially presumptuous, that \"the physician errs by interfering with the course of nature.\" ....Why not bring the presumptuousness of the larger group in the healing art down to this year of our Lord 1933, when a doctor of Chiropractic was hauled into a court of justice in Milwaukee. Why? Because he had been incompetent or injured his patients? No! Exactly the contrary was true and the \"presumptive\" votaries knew it. So they prayed the court to \"put this chiropractor in irons\" because \"he calls himself a doctor\", notwithstanding that he has a state license. Happily, the world moves, slowly to be sure, but steadily. Justi ce, not presumption, ruled in that Milwaukee court and Dr. Masch was honored by the failure of the iniquitous attempt of one set of doctors against a numerically smaller but more meritorious group.... And so, from time immemorial, the apostles of might vs. right, and of authority vs. truth have oppressed mankind. But, as in the Milwaukee case above cited, the broad, well-founded principles of Chiropractic have gradually become recognized by courts and people as a worth-while addition, not a cure-all, to the healing arts. Why? Because we practice the recoil, the condyle-occipital, the Lincoln, the Spear's, the Johnson Twins, the toggle, the National, the Hole-in-One, the Logan, the Hurley or any other technique? No! These and others to come are incidental to technical development, to be sure, but they are not heaven born and final. There'll be others in a year or two. Have patience! But do they make or mar us in the eyes of the people? Think a moment. Give yourself the benefit of a good cerebral adjustment and you'll say, certainly not! Neither populace,press, judiciary, in fact not a mother's son or daughter outside our own bigoted, subsidized, fighting-mad groups gives or cares a continental about any of our technical details. No! The thing that IS makin us is that press and populace are finding, through daily contact with us, as patients or neighbors, that we are worth-while, sensible, normal, rational and cultured doctors of Chiropractic, and not foolish, abnormal, ignorant and uncouth fanatics as they may have formerly supposed us to be.... And then there used to be school fights. How puerile! As if old Father Time were not on the job. Trust him. He'll attend to schools which should be closed or should never have opened. He doesn't shout about it, it's true, but oh! how relentlessly he works! Well, let us forgive and forget! Let us from now on follow the splendid principles of CHriorpctic under its most generous definition. I urge the following new standard for 1934: In things certain, unity; in things doubtful, open-mindedness. And with it let us keep smiling and thinking . The world is full of folks who need your help and mine. They prefer all their healing in the most painless, pleasant, bloodless way. You and I have it in our power, with painless, knifeless, drugless, natural methods to cure, improve or help them. Is there any finer calling? All you and I need, for abundant professional and financial success, is to strive more and more toward improving ourselves. Let us look like, talk like, act like, and altogether be like good DOCTORS of Chiropractic! (pp. 8-9) 1934 (Feb): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [3(2)] notes: -letter to the editor from Leo J. Steinbach, Dean, UCC, 121 Meyran Ave, Pittsburgh PA: (p. 34) Dear Dr. Rogers: Let me congratulate you on the new Journal which I find an improvement in many ways.

Hickman, Registrar. Replying to your favor of the 24th instant, beg to reply that Dr. Logan was for several years a practising chiropractor in this state, having come here from the state of Kansas. He is of a rather impetuous and aggressive nature and has made both enemies and friends in California. He did Aquarian Age teaching in association with Dr. Hurley for a while and then took up this work on his own responsibility, teaching as I understand it, what he himself developed. Dr. Logan is energetic and always active and seems to be the center usually of some turmoil in connection with his activities. He did some very splendid work in C alifornia for which the chiropractors in this state should be grateful. If he has done anything to injure chiropractic, it appears that it could only be due to inadvertance. His California license was revoked by a former board which in my opinion was purely an act of reprisal against him because they could not suppress him, which they wrongfully attempted to do. The fact of his losing his license in California should cast no reflection upon him. I know so little of his work that I am not in position to comment on its scientific merits. Concerning the use of the information given herein, will say that I have no desire to be drawn into any unpleasant controversy or in any way to offend Dr. Logan, for whom I hold no personal brief, one way or the other, except as based upon my observation of his activities in the state of California. 1934 (Oct): The Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [3(10)] includes:Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 32 -photo (l to r): W.C.

Schulze MD, DC, President of National College of Chiropractic , to Stanley Hayes DC at 853 Mercer St., Princton WV (Hayes collection): Dear Doctor Hayes: The National College Journal of Chiropractic has been growing rapidly in popularity. Most of the articles appearing in the Journal are written by members of the N.C.C. faculty. But now we are thinking that it would be a good thing to have some of our friends and graduates write articles for publication in the Journal every now and again. A survey revealed the fact that the articl es which appeal the most are technical ones. So I am wondering if you might not want to sit down when you have a little leisure, and write an article for publication in the Journal published by yhour Alma Mater? There is no material compensation for your work because we publish the Journal quarterly at a tremendous loss. But there is the satisfaction of doing something for a worthwhile magazine, of putting your thoughts and experiences on paper and having them published so they can be of benefit to others in your profession. Perhaps you have something in mind on which you know you would like to write. If not, I might suggest something seasonal; or treatment of some chronic condition in which you have had particular success. I will let the selection of a subject to you. It is much easier to write about something that appeals to us rather than a subject given to us. The article should be about 1200 words long. I am wondering if you could write such an article for us and submit it to us within the next ten days? We would appreciate it very much. I hope you had a nice Christmas and that your practice is coming along well. The NATIONAL COLLEGE is forging ahead at a rapid pace and you can be prouder than ever of your Alma Mater today. With every good wish to your for a HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR, I am, Cordially and fraternally yours, Dr. W.C. Schulze President, THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC 1935 (Jan 15): Stanley Hayes DC replies to W.C. Schulze MD, DC's letter of 12/29/34 (Hayes collection): The National College of Chiropractic 20 N. Ashland Blvd., Chicago, Ill. Gentlemen: In reply to your letter of December 29th, requesting an article for the Journal, I am sorry to say that I have been too busy to get at it. There are some Chiropractic subjects upon which I might conceivably say something of interest to somebody, but I should not care to attemptanything of that kind unless I had at least a chance to do more than merely \"write something for publication\". There is too much of that kind of writing already -- not only in our professional journals but in supposedly high class lay publications as well. If the spirit moves me some day to write a little that might help someone, I will send it along. Sincerely yours,... 1935: students at NCC publish the first annual yearbook, prepared by the 1935 Graduating Class of the National College of Chiropractic. The Mirror, First Issue - June, 1935. [Chicago: the Class, 1935], including message from William Charles Schulze , M.D., D.C. (p. 15): The President's Message to the Graduating Class Ladies and gentlemen of the 1935 graduating class of The National College of Chiropractic: This is an important moment in your lives. The years of preparation for your profession are drawing to a close. The gates of life are about to open to you and as I contemplate your departure from your Alma Mater, I wish to congratulate you, first of all, upon the choice of your life's work. Nature has decreed that all of us should work in order that we may exist. Happily, the profession which you are entering offers you more than a mere existence. It offers you a life of service and with that service an inner satisfaction transcending all material rewards. On this momentous occasion, as I take your hand and look in to your eyes, I would gladly give you a brief mathematical formula for success. However, success depends upon so many factors that a prescription for the same is impractical if not impossible. When you entered the halls of The National College of Chiropractic, the first ingredients of that which will make you successful in the years to come were offered you in the class rooms studying Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry and the principles of the art and science of Chiropractic. To these underlying branches were added, as the months and years passed, spinal, physical and general diagnosis and still later your received the necessary training the practical work of drugless healing. The above branches, only briefly mentioned here, did furnish you the first and most necessary ingredients for achievement in your chosen life's work. They constituted the fundamental steps in the formula for professional success. The fact that you have passed your examinations in these branches and that your work was satisfactory to the faculty and to the President of The National College of Chiropractic, proves that you, yourselves, have been well started on the road to accomplishment. Upon entering now the highway of professional endeavor, may I not urge upon you a militant conception of the principles of Chiropractic around which your education has been built here within these halls of your Alma Mater. These principles not only furnish you a basis for your future work in healing the sick, but they give you one of the most important ingredients in the formula of success in life. I refer to adjustment - adjustment in its widest meaning, vertebral, structural, mental and environmental. In this conception of all around adjustment, ladies and gentlemen of the graduating class, you have a super-structure which, based upon the fundamental teachings you received within these college halls, will carry you far upon the road of achievement. And finally, in giving you a last word of farewell, with my paternal wish for happiness, I cannot do better than to repeat to you a classical expression upon which those of us who started this institution nigh three decades ago based our work through all these years, namely: Esse quam videre - to be rather than to seem. -THE PRESIDENT 1935 (July): The Scientific Chiropractor (Vol. 1, No. 2) published by National-Affiliated Chiropractors of California (NACC) at 1102 Foreman Bldg, LA-\"Official Program...40th Anniversary Convention, 1895-1935\" of the National Chiropractic Association (NCA), July 28-Aug 4, 1935 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood (pp. 8-12); speakers will include : -Ruland W.

The final draft by mutual consent to be approved by a joint Committee of State Examining Boards and School heads. The joint committee is composed as follows: Drs. HG Beatty, A. Budden and Jas. Drain for the Schools and Drs. WF Crider of Maryland, CO Hunt of California and FO Logic of Michigan for the State Boards. The recommendations as to inclusions, rejections and modifications were incorporated. Visits were made to Chicago and Indianapolis, following the convention, consulting Drs. Schulze, Bader and Golden of the National, and Drs. Vedder, Firth and associates of the Lincoln, thus ironing out more of the scales' faults, and obtaining the general reaction after these groups had time to study copies of the scale. It has not been heretofore mentioned that similar tactics were practiced on the journey to the meeting. Universal of Pittsburgh and Metropolitan of Cleveland were given copies and they forwarded their approval, in principle, of the proposal. Dr. BJ Palmer was also contacted with similar intent. However, the astute qualities usually ascribed to him were evidently lacking upon this occasion as he was unwilling to even listen 'to anything that smacked of NCA' - in spite of repeated declarations that the Council of State Examining Boards on the contrary was separate and distinct from any and all other organizations.... The revised draft was completed and forwarded to members of the joint committee. Other incorporations and modifications were listed. However, it was not possible to incorporate all suggestions. It is interesting to note that the schools' opinions were still sharply defined and divergent - while the State Boards were unanimously in favor of higher standards. A synopsis of the Joint Committee's findings is as follows: 1. - It will be necessary to rate schools teaching the orthodox methods and those teaching the more liberal methods in separate categories as regards list of class hours and equipment . 2. - All authorities agree, two thousand sixty-minute hours is the maximum that can be taught in three years of six months. This basis, although somewhat less intent, is used in compiling the scale and setting it as regards to curriculum. 3. - It must be comparable with other professions' standards. 4. - The Schools being commercial in character (with very few exceptions) it is necessary to give due consideration to financial stability of the Institutions. 5. - In accordance with the tendency of all state laws, wherever amended, the trend being upward from the three years of six months level, it became obvious the scale minimum for grade A probationary rating must be twenty-four months for the fundamental course and four years of eight months for the liberal course. 6. - In order that all schools may have an opportunity to meet the final requirements of fundamental (three years of nine months) and the liberal (four years of nine), one calendar year - until Jan 1, 1937, is given for probationary ratings of all Chiropractic Schools and colleges. 7. - The scale must be so constructed as to include from the minimum of set requirements to the maximum as taught by an Chiropractic school of today. The Council of State Boards will not enter into a discussion of the definition of chiropractic. Suffice it to say that each type of thought is recognized and given opportunities to develop. We, therefore, have divided the schools into two groups - the Basic or Fundamental Schools (teaching only Chiropractic) and the Liberal or Physical Therapy Schools (teaching Chiropractic and Physical Therapy)... 1935 (Dec): Chiro J (NCA) [4(12)] notes:Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 34 -advertisement for \"The Affiliated Universities of Natural Healing,\" which include WSCC, Metropolitan Chiropractic College in Cleveland OH, University of the Healing Arts in Hartford CT and University of Natural Healing Arts in Denver (p. 41): We wish to encourage the profes sion in efforts toward reasonable, higher and broader standards; and wish to help blaze the way to greater progress and development in conformity witht he great merits of Chiropractic.

(p. 3) In Memoriam Dr. William Charles Schulze, President of the National College of Chiropractic, Chicago, Illinois, died Saturday, September 26, 1936, from cerebral hemorrhage. He was 66 years old. Surviving are his widow, the former Mathilde Jermundson, whom he married in 1900 at Duluth, Minnesota, and two children, William L. Schulze and Mrs.Phyllis Main. William L. Schulze is Secretary of the National College of Chiropractic . Dr. Schulze was born in Germany, where he received his early education, and came to this country at the age of 17. He was graduated from William Jewell College, Liberty, Missouri, and later taught school in Marion County, Kansas. In 1897, he received his M.D. degree from Rush Medical College, medical department of the University of Chicago. He practiced medicine for three years at Lomira, Wisconsin. For five years, he was medical director of the Chicago Zander Institute . He became associated with the National College of Chiropractic in 1910. Shortly afterwards, he discontinued medical practice to devote his full time to Chiropractic education. Throughout his quarter century in Chiropractic, Dr. Schulze worked unceasingly for its advancement. He contributed time and money freely toward the passage of good laws, traveling to any state where his testimony was needed. He was a loyal supporter of the National Chiropractic Association . More than all, he worked for higher educational standards in Chiropractic. Today, the entire profession favors higher standards of education. Dr. Schulze will be remembered as a leader who brought Physiotherapy to Chiropractic. He included Physiotherapy in the National College curriculum as early as 1912. At that time, it was called Physiological Therapeutics. Early diplomas of the National College read, \"Doctor of Chiropractic and Physiological Therapeutics .\" Although he favored a broad course in drugless healing. Dr. Schulze, nevertheless, placed great emphasis on spinal adjustment. He believed spinal adjustment to be the basis of healing work. \"The spine is the line shaft of the body,\" was a favorite expression. Another was, \"People get old not so much in the face as in the back.\" He was afraid students might be attracted too much by the glamor of treating devices and be drawn away from spinal adjustment. He cautioned student classes, therefore, and saw to it that students were trained thoroughly in Chiropractic principles and technique. Dr. Schulze's life was a fine example of sacrificing self for an ideal. He never hesitated to give up comfort or personal pleasure to further his work. Although, because of failing health, he was inactive in school work in late years, he attended many Chiropractic conventions. It brought him the affection and loyal support of thousands of chiropractors. They recognized him as a true chiropractor at heart and a willing and able worker for the profession. At the funeral services, Dr. Horace Bridges, who presided, spoke of Dr. Schulze's death, not as the end of life, but as the completion of a job. Dr. Schulze had visioned what was lacking in Chiropractic and set about to supply the need. He worked to build a Chiropractic school, teaching a broad Chiropractic discipline - not only in basic training but also in drugless therapeutics. The National College of Chiropractic and its present course in Chiropractic and Drugless Therapy is evidence that he succeeded. The institution he built is a fitting memorial to a full, useful and noble life. As Chiropractic grew after the death of D.D. Palmer, so the broad concept of Chiropractic and Drugless Therapy, advanced by Dr. Schulze, will find increasing favor and acceptance as time goes on. The National College of Chiropractic is pledged to continue faithfully his ideals and to uphold the sound and progressive policies that have gained an enviable reputation for that institution under his able leadership. Thousands of chiropractors who were his students will carry throughout their lives the inspiration and instruction imparted by this brilliant teacher. The entire profession bows its head at the inestimable loss of this great and good man and courageous professional leader. 1936 (Nov): The Scientific Chiropractor [2(15)] reports: -notice of meeting of the Los Angeles County Division of the \"National-Affiliated Chiropractors\" includes: (p. 32) \"8:30 to 9:30 P.M.\" DR.

I had a long talk with Lorne Wheaton at our recent convention. Sorry you couldn't have been at the convention. We had an attendance of 411, ten states were represented and members of five State Boards were there. It was purely an educational program and we have had nothing but real sincere complimentary comments on the program. As a result several states have asked us to bring the faculty and repeat it at their conventions. Our conventions are larger in number than any State convention in the East, and I believe carries a great amount of influence.In regard to the school situation I realize that there are a lot of people in the field trying to correct our schools. They have a lot of remedies to benefit the profession through the schools, but I am wondering what the profession would think if the schools would turn around and try to regulate the profession, and there are many things in the profession that I know should be regulated. For instance, in the Lamon case the injunction would not have been granted if Lamon would have stuck to Chiropractic. His action damages this school more than any other action I know of, and we teach nothing but Chiropractic, no adjuncts. This school teaches a three year course of ten months each. Most of professors are graduates from college , not all and yet some individual located in some State that doesn't even understand the situation in New York State wants to regulate us. At the last meeting of the National Association when I arrived there this school was about fifth on the list and the schools that had adjuncts and taught physiotherapy were in the lead, way up front. Three of my graduates went to one of these schools in the middle West and came back after three weeks disgusted. The curriculum was chucked full of medical subjects, physiotherapy and what not. The last thing that was ever given was a Chiropractic adjustment and yet this school was rated ahead of ours. This can be easily verified by any member of the National Association . Why was this rating given? Why are schools that are working to preserve Chiropractic in States that are not legalized, that are fighting a battle of bare existence, being placed in an uncomplimentary position. I found this proposition and the whole thing was ditched, which shows the trend of thought. Lets take it from another angle. This school as well as many other schools live only by tuition. We have never received a nickel of donation. At one time in order to keep going and maintain ourselves we had to borrow a number of thousand dollars from the field. It was loaned to us but every individual got their money back with interest and they all wanted it back. We have never had a donation except from two people and they were for $50.00 a piece; but, we have donated in the State of New York alone in the past ten years over $6000.00, In addition to donating in New Jersey and other States. I am for higher education but I want it along Chiropractic lines, not along the lines of adjuncts and I resent the attitude of some individuals who are in practice and perhaps never even had a high school education, trying to regulate my school and others, for the sake of the profession, when they do very little if anything to help the schools along. You know in the National Association there are about 3,000 members. Outside the National Association there are about 15,000 members and it looks kind of silly to me for a few individuals attempting to run the whole profession. I received a letter from Dr. Wayne F. Crider today and I am sending him a copy of this letter, in which he wants to know how many students we have and the length of the course. Every student in this Institute takes a three year course of ten months each, except in two instances. We have two students from Europe, one from Switzerland and one from Sweden. There are three other schools that would have taken these students for eighteen month courses and as they are going to Europe and do not have to pass any Board we have taken them in here. We have copies of letters to verify the offers given to them from these other schools. We also have a longer course for the State of Connecticut and we make them put in that time and every minute of that time, but it is put in on actual subjects pertaining to Chiropractic. If you had heard the lectures of our facutly at our convention you would know just how much we know about Chiropractic and how damn little we know or care about adjuncts. I am a college man myself and have two degrees and some of the thickest and dumbest came out of college in the class I was in. If the profession would get beind Chiropractic schools and not ask us to lecture for nothing, pay our own expenses and when they send us a student ask for a rebate on that student, we would get somewhere. I am going to the National Convention with this spirit and with these ideas because it doesn't make any difference to me whether I run a school or not; I have a good practice and am getting tired of running a school.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 36 I am enclosing an article I wrote for our school magazine and I am mailing you a copy of this magazine to show you we can cooperate. I hope you will take this letter in the spirit in which it is meant, but we are going to fight the same as anybody else. If they are going to demand higher education and qualifications for us I don't see no reason why the schools don't demand regulations for the profession. How about a reexamination of the practitioner every five years to see if he or she is capable? How about a code of ethics so that the practitioner who has taken up one type of course, either Hole-In-One or Basic or something else, doesn't look down and spit on the other fellow who doesn't take that particular course. There are a lot of things we have got to do in this profession but the whole idea is to hop on the schools whenever they haven't anything else to do. With my best wishes, I will be at the New York State convention and I intend to be at the Toronto Convention and I am going to say what I think. Again, with my best wishes to you, there is nothing personal in this. You wrote me a lette,r you asked me for my opinion and I am giving it to you. Sincerely, CRAIG M. KIGHTLINGER, President EASTERN CHIRORPACTIC INSTITUTE CMK:ES P.S. In the last issue of the Fountain Head News is a copy of a decision from the Supreme Court of Mississippi in a case where the Chiropractor removed tonsils and his statement was that he was taught this in the school that he attended, which I believe is the National School of Chiropractic in Chicago, and the Court censured him very much for this. This school was rated ahead of our school in the listing to be given to the public at the last National Convention, until objections were made to it. Think that one over. 1938 (May 20): letter to K.C. Robinson DC at S.E. 41st St., NYC from CM Kightlinger DC, MA (CCE Archives 35-12-1938): My dear Dr. Robinson: Your received and thank you for your lengthy discussion. I do want you to know that there is nothing personal in the matter but I have managed a school for twenty years and I believe I know something about it. I am a college graduate. I have a degree of Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts . Before entering into Chiropractic my association was with scientific people and educators and I understand exactly how the public feels. There is no coubt in my mind that when we prolong our course, making it four separate calendar years that we will surely get recognition from the public but before that can be done we have to secure legal recognition in the States. If the State of New York could get legal recognition for this school I would raise the course immediately and I would have five hundred students in two years. It is all well enough for the profession to tell us what to do but the medical profession didn't increase their school hours or length of course until they themselves had prepared a substantial foundation for schools to exist on. Privately owned schools are not the thing for any science but until the Chiropractic profession can donate money or secure endowments so that a school can be run by such donations and endowments they must be run privately and as such must be managed by private interests to their benefit . For your information I was invited to Florida to speak. I gave up two days of my practice, spent carfare and hotel bill and to today I have not received one cent from the All Southern States Convention, simply because I don't believe they have the money and we have never received a student from Florida. If we spend money this way where are we going to get it from if we don't get students? Again, I notice that no fight is being made on the practice of asking for $26.00 or $50.00 on sending a student to a Chiropractic Institution and the school that was rated above the Eastern, the National School of Chiropractic , has gone out boldly without any subterfuge and offered $25.00 for every student sent in . This is one of the most unethical practices that any profession can tolerate and yet not one damn thing is said about it, but the schools are given hell because they don't lengthen the course. I am going to Toronto and I am fully primed to say what I think. As far as this Institution is concerned the National Association hasn't helped us onesingle bit . They have never sent us a student and whenever we get a speaker from them we pay their expenses. We have helped the National Association by putting members in it and by being in it ourselves. We believe it is a good thing but when somebody [ Watkins? ] who lives in a State in which the entire population of that State could be placed on the Corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, and we wouldn't even know that any additional people were there, tries to run the rest of the United States I am going to kick. I have an investment and I have fought for that investment and the only help that has been given me or my colleagues is that the loyal chiropractors have sent us prospective students. We know all the problems. We know some of the answers but the profession doesn't. With my very best wishes, awaiting the pleasure of seei ng you at the National Convention, I am, Sincerely,... 1938 (Aug 12): National College of Drugless Physicians awards a certificate to \" Joshua N.

He was Dean of the National College from 1936 until his death. In his capacity as instructor at the National College, and later as Dean, Dr. Bader was called upon many times to lecture at state and national Chiropractic conventions. His loyalty to Chiropractic and his cooperative and progressive spirit in all things seeking the advancement of the profession will be sorely missed.

I wrote it. I wrote it on my own little typewriter. Why? Because there had been a terrific scandal in the eclectic profession and a man had been killed on an operating table and the whole state of Conn. was in furor, and nineteen ?prefectors? in the State demanded some sort of qualifications for all practitioners, and Liberty magazine and Colliers were writing articles about Conn. and when I saw the powers that be they said, \"Now look Doctor, we're supposed to be political leaders in this state but we can't stem this tide.

The bitter fight which has raged within Chiropractic circles, concerning the Naturopathic question, has been one serious rift which has threatened to completely divide the Chiropractic profession. The International Association has resolutely refused to recognize an accrediting agency which was based on schools issuing dual healing arts degrees. That accrediting agency still recognizes certain schools which issue such degrees, but it is now reported that the National College has changed its policy in conformance with those laid down by the International Association. Communications were forwarded to the National College, directly to Dr. Joseph Janse, President of the College, stating: \"There is a rumor prevalent here... this rumor states as follows: 'That, due to unsavory practices in the Naturopathic field, National College will no longer offer a course in Naturopathy, but will confine its teachings entirely to those of Chiropractic.' \"will you please give me any information available concerning this rumor, and any information you feel free to release pertinent to National's stand relative to Naturopathy.\" To this request for information, Dr. Janse replied recently: \"May I thank you for your communication of the 15th? In answer to your inquiry, permit me to say that beginning June 1st of this year we shall no longer matriculate Naturopathic applicants . Those having entered college before that time shall, of course, be continued and graduated with the degree. \"The reason that you state is, however, not the basis of this decision. We in no way lend ourselves to the evaluation of the attitudes and practices of the Naturopathic field in general. We sit in judgment over no one. \"THE REASON THAT HAS PROMPTED THIS DECISION RESIDES IN THE FACT THAT THE COMPETITIVE TENSION BETWEEN THE CHIROPRACTIC AND NATUROPATHIC PROFESSIONS IS SO SEVERE THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED IT WISE AND PRUDENT TO RELINQUISH THE NATUROPATHIC SCHOOL. (Emphasis ours.) \"Basically, we have always been a College of Chiropractic. There was a time when it seemed that the two professions would parallel and compliment each other. Such is now no longer the case.\" School accrediting officials of the International Association have announced their intentions to carefully study the new program at the National College, and to accord proper recognition to that institution when the facts are established beyond any doubt. 1951 (Feb): Journal of the NCA (21[2]) includes: -photo caption reads \"Rep.

The center spread is, of course, the most desirable in the entire Journal, and we have always used it for our own purposes in promoting Healthways and other important projects. Since the accredited colleges have, as I understand it, come to the conclusion that they wish to eliminate their competitive advertising in the Journal, we have set up what we believe to be the ideal way to present the accredited colleges to the profession from month to month through the Journal of the National Chiropractic Assocaition, and at a minimum of cost to the colleges - the total cost for the use of the center spread for the entire year - 12 issues - is $2,880.00. If the 14 fully accredited, provisionally approved, and associated colleges each will go along with the project, as I was informed, the cost to each of them will be only $205.00 per year. Further, we will grant a 5% discount for payment in advance, which will make the cost to each college only $195.00 total for the 12 issues. Should the 8 fully accredited colleges decide they wish to use this space by themselves, the cost would be $360.00 each per year. We will grant a 5% discount for payment in advance which would make the total cost to each college only $342.00. I trust the fully accredited colleges, as well as the provisionally approved and associated colleges, will go along witht he first proposal, since it will make a much more imposing picture to present to the profession each month. I am depending upon you to write each of the colleges, as you agreed to, at the very earliest convenience, since we must have the contracts in on or before December 1, as otherwise we will have to make other plans for the use of this space. Is it your understanding that the colleges will not use any space in the Journal other than this, for example in advertising their homecomings, or post graduate courses at specified times during the year if they desire to do so? I would appreciate clarification on this point and the date you plan to contact the colleges listed. I am sending you sufficient copies of the proof of the advertisement under separate cover so that they may know exactly how their ad will look in the proposed new set-up. I think it is important that you contact them at once since I, too, as editor of the Journal, will plan to write tm on the same subject at an early date.

His radius of professional privileges has been increased to a most satisfactory degree. His services are recognized and sought by insurance companies, workman compensation boards and other agencies of health insurance. All this as well as other ever increasing advantages places chiropractic among the select professions. A profession that contains exceptional promise for our sons and daughters as well as the young men and women of our respective communities. Certainly our pride in chiropractic should prompt us to acquaint our young people of the opportunities that may be theirs. With forethought and its traditional effort toward professional progress, the National College has sought to meet the challenge of this new \"era\" with increased educational facilities. As you know many thousands of dollars have been spent on new laboratories in chemistry, bacteriology, pathology, x-ray and clinical diagnosis, as well as the renovating of classrooms and acquiring all types of teaching aids and equipment.

The spring school terms mark the last enrollment opportunity under the Korean GI Bill for thousands of post-Korea veterans, the Veterans Administration said today. The reason, VA explained, is that the law's cut-off date of August 20, 1954, applies to Korean veterans separated from service before August 20, 1952. If they want GI training, they must begin by the 1954 deadline in order to continue afterwards. The deadline, however, comes before next fall's school term gets under way. Therefore, except for the summer session, the school term starting early in 1954 will offer many veterans their last opportunity to get started under the Korean GI Bill. Veterans who left service after August 20, 1952, need not concern themselves with the forthcoming 1954 cut-off date, VA said. Instead, they have two years from the date of their separation in which to begin GI training. Under the law, a veteran actual ly must \"enrolle in and begin\" training before his deadline, if he wants to go on with it afterwards.The mere filing of an application beforehand, with the intention of starting afterwards, is not enough, VA pointed out. Generally, the veteran will be expected to be in the classroom or at the training bench on his deadline date. Bus so long as he started in time, he may be permitted to interrupt his course because of the summer vacation, or for other reasons beyond his control, or for any circumstances that VA deems to be excusable. VA emphasized that these cut-off date rules apply only to veterans training under the Korean GI Bill. They do not pertain to those enrolled under the original World War Two GI Bill. _____________________ *Note: The Summer Term at the National College of Chiropractic which begins on May 10, 1954, will enable the veteran to take advantage of his Korean Bill GI benefits. EDUCATION & TRAINING BENEFITS FOR KOREAN VETERANS Eligibility -- To be eligible, a veteran must be out of active service and must meet all these requirements: (1) he must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable; (2) he must have had active military duty some time between June 27, 1950, and the end of the current emergency (a date not yet set), and (3) he must have had at least 90 days total service, unless discharged sooner for an actual service- incurred disability. He may have served any place in the world -- in the United States or abroad -- and not necessarily in Korea. Length of Training -- Entitlement is limited to one and one-half days of education or training for each day spent in service on and after June 27, 1950, and prior to the end of the emergency period. The maximum is 36 months. Selection of a Program -- The purpose of the new GI Bill is to help a veteran obtain education or training to reach a definite, identified goal. The goal may be purely educational, such as obtaining a college degree, professional, such as becoming a lawyer, or vocational, such as training to be a steamfitter. Changing a Program -- It is most important for a veteran to give careful consideration to his choice of a training program under the new GI Bill, for under the law he may make only one change of program -- only one change and no more. Dates and Deadlines -- Although the new GI Bill is now in effect, no VA payments may be made for any period prior to August 20, 1952. A veteran now out of service has until August 20, 1954, to start training. Others, still in service, will have two years after discharge in which to begin. Education and Training Allowances -- A veteran in training may receive an education and training allowance each month from the Government, to cover part of his training expenses and living costs. Tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment expenses will all have to come out of the monthly allowances; the Government will not pay for them separately. Rates for veterans in full-time training in schools and colleges are $110 a month, if they have no dependents; $135 if they have one dependent, and $160 if they have more than one dependent. Those in training less than full-time will receive lower monthly rates. How Allowances are Paid -- A veteran will get his monthly allowance sometime after the end of each month of training completed.

SELECTIVE SERVICE REGULATIONS Requirements for Student Classification -- \"When considering the classifications of a registrant as a student the local board will just determine if he qualifies for a deferment under any of the various provisions of Section 1622-25 of the Selective Service Regulations.\" The provisions of Section 1622-25 that apply to students of the healing arts are found under sub-section (b)-(2) and (b)-(4). The provisions of sub-section (b)-(2) read, \"The registrant was (1) accepted on or before July 1, 1951 for admission by a professional school of medicine, dentristry, veterinary medicine, osteopathy, optometry, pharmacy, chiropractic or chiropody to the class nextChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 41 commencing, and, if such class has commenced, has entered such school, or (2) is a student in any such professional school to which he was admitted on or before July 1, 1951, and (3) the school at which he is in attendance has certified that he is satisfactorily pursuing a full- time course of instruction leading to his graduation.\" Students meeting any of the requirements of Se ction 1622-25 will be considered for deferment in Class II-S.

(pp. 4-5) 1959 (July 15): letter from GE Hariman to Joseph Janse DC, ND, president of the NCC (Hariman file): Dr. Joseph Janse, President National Chiropractic College 20 North Ashland Blvd., Chicago, Illinois Dear Doctor Janse: While sitting in the Council of Past Executives as well as in the Corporation of CRF (now FACE) meeting (and we are very much the same personnel) and while discussing the matter of raising the dues $20.00 for Educational purposes, I raised the question of distriution and purposes as we all wanted to know the answer to this question, therefore I am transmitting to you the information and verdicts we have arrived at in this session. First: Any Instructor may at the request of his College extend his academic studies to higher degrees for whatever length of time required and the NCA will pay for his tuition and books for the duration of the studies. They cannot compel anyone to continue until a degree isChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 43 obtained, but it shall be up to the student to continue his academic accomplishment. Second: The Student Loan Fund will continue to assist the Schools by supplying the Junior Colleges and High Schools with Vocational guidance material and other means to enhance public minds toward Chiropractic study. Third: After the first year when money will be in the treasury - perhaps $100,000. - the Schools will make a request stating their need for equipment, laboratory facilities, student procurement Director - or whatever their special need may be. This rrequest will be given to the investigating committee -- and they will recommend the grant to the corporation Trustees who will approve and allow the grant to the school. Fourth: At the present time there is $45,200.00 available from the money transferred from the profits of the Insurance Company. It was felt that other schools beside the Los Angeles college should have the privilege of school student procurement advantages. This will be given to others upon request. Dr. Higgins stressed that unless something of an emergency nature is done there will be one less school to assist in the future. You of course know what he meant by this statement. I believe the Board will extend to the school of whom he spoke the same aid Los Angeles college received. I am stating these things to you to show how the inner circle operated and may I urge that you to avail yourself of all these plans. The opportunity is there to improve the academic standing of your school staff. The assistance to student procurement is now available....and additional equipment will be available in the near future. If there is anything in your mind that I can clarify - or assist you in any way at all - you have but to ask or call upon me. One other thing I speak of with hesitation - I walked up on the the second floor of the school - I wish some money could be spent to tile the floors and paint the walls. The school will be used another year at least as such, - it is not worthy of you and your great efforts inits present state. I hope you will forgive me in this statement but your progress is dear to my heart. The school's standing must be maintained in its present location until the new school is ready. Belive me it was wonderful to be with you and draw upon your enthusiasm and love for the profession which you so freely give to all of us. Our love and appreciation of every kindness and courtesy. Believe me. Sincerely, George George E. Hariman, D.C. 1959 (July 17): letter to GE Hariman DC from Joseph Janse DC, ND, president of the NCC (Hariman file): Dr. George E. Hariman 2002 University Avenue Grand Forks, North Dakota Dear Dr. Hariman: Your confidential communication of the 15th was read with a deep sense of appreciation and awareness. W are more than sncerely grateful. It enables us to interpret the disposition of the administrative body of F.A.C.E. as well as the executive family. We want nothing but the best and the most h onorable for everyone concerned. We sincerely feel that the great confidence exhibited by the House of Delegates and the membership of the N.C.A. in setting up a program whereby the accredited colleges will be subsidized must be surrounded by integrity and understanding on the part of each and everyone of us. I know, as you know, that there are differences of opinion as to who should administer the monies and I believe that only by virtue of great wisdom will it be possible to set up mechanisms of administration and distribution that will be fair and equitable to everyone. Our position as a college has been just a little difficult because it is belived by some that inasmuch as we are better off than others we should not necessarily expect as much consideration or assistance.May I hope that you will treat this letter as personal and confidential. All I want you to know is that we shall always seek to do the honest and the honorable thing. It is helpful to know how you good people feel and I want to assure you personally that this trust that you have extended us will not be abused. Thank you for all that you have done for us; for your participation during the ground-breaking affairs. Please convey my affectionate greetings to your lady and with every happy good wish, I seek to remain with sincere gratitude, Very truly yours, J.

Most sincerely yours,... 1964 (Nov): ACA Journal of Chiropractic [1(11): 22] reports: Popular Educator Dies of Heart Attack Floyd H. Blackmore, D.O., D.C., nationally noted authority on physiotherapy and important figure at the National College of Chiropractic, succumbed to a heart attack on Friday morning, October 2, 1964, at his Chicago residence. Dr. Blackmore was associated with the National College for thirty-five years as a teacher, clinician, and lecturer in the field. In 1956 he was appointed chief of staff at the Chicago General Health Service public clinic of the National College of Chiropractic, where he had served as a diagnostician since its inception. Dr. Blackmore pioneered in the area of physiologic therapeutics (physiotherapy) in the tradition of Kellogg, Lindlahr, Brockman, Sampson, Kovacs, and others. He lived his sixty-eight years of life to the full. His association with his colleagues brought him the utmost gratification, and students and professional associates honored and revered him. He was always liberal with his enormous fund of knowledge. In this regard, he constantly added to his information by spending much of his free time in searching literature apropos his professional interest. Dr. Blackmore is survived by his widow, two sons, and two daughters. His body was laid to rest in his home community of Grovehill, Ohio. On Tues day morning, October 6, a memorial service was held for Dr. Blackmore at the National College. Dr. R.P. Beideman conducted the service, in which Dr. Janse participated as well as Rev. Fred Cox, Mr. Jacquisue Rushing, Mr. Donald Springer, and Mr. Thurmond Gay, students at National. The passing of this genial, affable, and capable personality leaves an irreplaceable void in our ranks.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 44 1966 (Feb 3): Letter from Clarence Weiant DC, PhD to Stanley Hayes DC (Hayes collection): Dear Dr. Hayes,- I have sadly neg lected you for the reason that, like yourself, I have been swamped with work of one kind or another. The brochure on The Medical Reaction to Chiropractic has gone through what I hope was its final revision and is now in ACA hands. We await their decision as to how it will be distributed, and in what manner they intend to compensate us for our labors. Minor changes which they have suggested in the manuscript of the vocational guidance manual have been submitted to them for final approval. When I get the OK on these, I will then have to retype certain pages. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, some kind of hassle is going on, I believe, between the publishers and the ICA on the thing. I have rewritten the first chapter and the last chapter of Medicine and Chiropractic . The first chapter will deal more tactfully with the \"metaphysical\" issue. Without any sacrifice of principle, I have striven to say the same things in language less offensive to the friends of Innate. The new final chapter will be less conciliatory to the M.D.'s, and it will take the form of an over-all view of the issues as a social science problem. There will be new citations from the Germans and others, especially an exciting surprise in a long list of titles from recent Soviet medical publications. Those birds certainly recognize the spinal factor (especially the cervical region) in autonomic disturbances, intracranial and visceral. So, the 4th edition will be real improvement on the original. Within two weeks it should be ready for the printer. I was able to get hold of the Russian material through the Canadian chiropractor in Montevideo, who happens to have patients among the personnel of the Soviet Embassy in that city. The Soviet-Uruguayan Cultural Center had the title translated into Spanish. It is my job to translate the Spanish into English. (Don't get the notion that this chiropractor has any sympathy for the Latin-American communists, by the way.) Now that the ACA Journal has seen fit to let Janse tell the full story of his recent travels , I think I should get busy on an article regaling my South American exploits. I will be talking to the Alumni and showing our slides of the trip on the 13th. Sincerely,... 1968: CINY dissolves into National College of Chiropractic 1968 (Oct): ACA Journal of Chiropractic [5[10]] includes: -announcement from Earl G. Liss, DC, Chairman, Board of Trustees of National College and Thure C. Peterson DC, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of CINY (p. 8) C.I.N.Y. and N.C.C. Affiliation Program After extended forthright deliberations between appointed representatives of the ACA Board of Governors, the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research, the Chiropractic Institute of New York and its alumni, and the National College of Chiropractic and its alumni, the C.I.N.Y. requested approval to discontinue its undergraduate school and asked to affiliate its facilities, its alumni and reposit its vital records with the National College. This decision embraces the consolidating of the traditions and historical emphasis of two college families that have constantly through the years stood in support of the educational and professional programs initiated and sponsored by first the NCA and later the ACA, and which have come to mean so much to all of us and to represent the progressive future of the chiropractic profession. This bringing together of the two alumni groups represents a great promise for future support of our profession's educational program. By discontinuing the undergraduate program of the C.I.N.Y. and the consolidating of alumni effort, nothing has been lost and much has been gained. Thus we take pride in making this joint announcement and express the conviction that it augers well for the future. The accommodation effected through the affiliation of the C.I.N.Y. with the National College is the consummation of delibertions conducted in honest, open counsel by representatives of all partiesconcerned. Representation on the N.C.C. college and alumni boards is being considered and structured. We therefore encourage unqualified recognition and support of this historical conclusion as a forward step of significance in our profession. We are mutually aware that this decision engenders great responsibilities. We acknowledge our appreciation to the ACA Board of Governors and the Trustees of FCER for their council [sic] and assistance in formulating the consolidating program that is now under negotiation. The college families we represent are committed to the programs and policies of the ACA and the relating Council on Education and Accrediting Agency. -college accreditation listing: (p. 24) 1968 (Mar 27): letter from Leonard W. Rutherford DC to Dr. Ted McCarrel, President, Cottey College, Nevada MO 64772 (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Ted: In talking with Dr. Carl Cleveland the other day, he expressed the fear that subjects such as physio-therapy, physical therapy and minor surgery, etc., might be and undoubtedly would be strongly suggested by Janse as proper for a curriculum or electives on standards for the colleges, when you have the next meeting. Enclosed copy for your information as an example of this little mixing college in Oregon. These underlined are of course medical subjects and would defeat the purpose of chiropractic accreditation as they are already recognized by the proper agency in the Office of Education. With proper accreditation we can straighten out th is Oregon law and others similar. For your information also, Ted, only seven states allow by statue language the practice of physio-physical therapy by chiropractors: Florida Oregon Nevada Alaska North Dakota Kansas Maryland Physical therapy, physio-therapy, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, minor surgery, dietetics, eye, ear, nose and throat practice, diagnosis, etc., are practices other than chiropractic and must not be included ineither standard courses or electives for accreditation .

Hidde, DC, LLB, chairman of the CCE Commission on Accreditation, announcing federal recognition of CCE (in my History of Chiropractic Education folder: Dear Dr. Hidde: The Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility, at its meeting on May 22-24, examinded the petition of the Accrediting JCommission of The Council on Chiropractic Education for inclusion on the Commissioner of Education's list of Nationally Recognized accrediting Agencies and Associations within the meaning of Chapter 33, Title 38, U.S. Code and subsequent legislation. On the basis of evidence submitted in conformity with the Criteria published in the Federal Register of January 16, 1969, the Committee has recommended that the Accrediting Commission of The Council on Chiropractic Education be recognized for a period of one year. In making its recommendation, the Committee determined that the instructions for self-study provided by the Accrediting Commission could be improved by requiring more faculty-student participation in the self-study process and by providing for a more substantive institutional self-analysis, using the information required by the self-study questionnaire. In addition, the Educational Standards for Chiropractic Colleges of the CCE Accrediting Commission appears to the Committee to be too permissive for the rather considerable accreditation job now faced by the chiropractic profession. It was the Committee's judgment that the liberal use of the word \"should,\" rather than the word \"shall,\" in the various statements of standards does not provide the outside observer with a reliable guide to actual Commission enforcement of policy. Similarly, the criteria utilized for \"Recognized Candidate for Accreditation\" were judged by the Committee to lack clarity regarding the level of compliance with standards which would indicate reasonable assurance that the institution could achieve accredited status within the prescribed three year period. I concur with the recommendation of the Committee and am pleased to inform you that the Accrediting Commission of The Council on Chiropractic Education hereby is added to the Commissioner's list of Nationally Recognized Accrediting Agencies and Associations for a period of one year.

Weiant, D.C., Ph.D. 809 Terrace Place, Peekskill, New York 10566 December 10, 1975 Dear Mr. Gibbons: I believe something is stirring. I hope you have heard from Al Werner. After I had written to him he called me and gave me some very interesting information. The late Dr. Clarence Flick set up a foundation called the Foundation for Health Research. For 22 months the Foundation had the services of a lawyer, Cyrus Lerner, who at one time was in the service of the late Joseph Kennedy, then our Ambassador to Britain. As an employee of the Foundation he received a salary of $1,000 per month, in those days no small figure. Lerner did a very thorough job. He had access to just about everything in the archives of the Palmer School (as it was then called).Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 46 He relied upon the local Davenport public library for old writings of D.D. Palmer and made photocopies. He examined court records. He collected old newspapers dating back to the 1850's, with accounts of a running feud between D.D. Palmer and Andrew Still. He located as many people as possible who had had personal dealings with D.D. Palmer and conducted taped interviews with them. A number of these people were in Oklahoma; others were on the West Coast. Most of them are now dead. Let's hope the tapes have not deteriorated. He correlated developments in chiropractic with contemporaneous goings on in American medicine, politics, and popular thought. Albert Werner, son of the older Werner who headed the American Bureau of Chiropractic, Dr. Lyndon Lee (now in his 80's and still practicing in Mt. Vernon, N.Y.), and a third man whose last name is Thomas (a Long Island resident who had been the real framer and manager of the American Bureau) were chosen to be the trustees of the Foundation. For a long time the trustees did nothing. They felt that the next phase should be directed by a chiropractic college. They did not trust the Palmer School to bring out an uncensored history of chiropractic. Meanwhile the New York State law licensing chiropractors came into existence (1963), but the New York State Board of Regents was not prepared to approve any school of chiropractic in the state. Eventually the National College was approved, but the trustees did not want to surrender their obligations to people that far away. So what they did was to resign their trusteeships and turn everything over to Columbia Institute, after the Chiropractic Institute of New York had merged with National College. As I understand it, however, the bulk of the material accumulated is in the physical custody of Mr. Thomas, awaiting further developments. The financial resources of the Foundation have shrunk to the mere pittance of about $150. I am urging that Columbia Institute begin as soon as possible to embark on the utilization and proper presentation of the data accumulated. Werner said he would talk to Dr. Napolitano and would tell him that I would be willing to serve as an occasional consultant. Of course I shall insist that you, if satisfactory terms can be reached, be named as director of the project (or any other appropriate title). I have al so suggested that FCER be solicited for funds to go ahead. Given some such provocative title as THE LONG SUPPRESSED STORY OF CHIROPRACTIC ORIGINS, the resulting book should really be at least a good (if not best) seller.

Hildebrandt, D.C., a Palmer graduate, the founding editor PHOTOGRAPH Roy W. Hildebrandt, D.C., circa 19701978 (Aug 24): memo from Joseph Janse to National College faculty (National College Special Collections): TO ALL STAFF MEMBERS TO INCLUDE ADMINISTRATION, FACULTY AND CLINIC STAFF: There is a marked and ever-increasing need within the chiropractic profession to present subjects of critical study, innovative investigation and research in the form of well-prepared papers that will appear in major publications within the profession, as well as clinical and scientific journals outside the profession. The entire scientific and clinical community is seeking information from the chiropractic profession relevant to the major concepts, hypothesis and conjectors [sic] that comprise the thinking of our people. We are being challenged at every level, not necessarily in a mitigating or derogatory manner. People are interested in us and they want to know how we think and ideate and what we have done on an investigatory basis. For these reasons, may I submit to you the most sincere request that if at all possible you commit yourselves to the preparation annually of two scientific papers and submit them to the Chairman of the Department of Editorial Review and Publication, namely, Dr. Roy W. Hildebrandt . As you well know, we here at the College have embarked upon a great adventure that has already become a commanding challenge and has already provoked commendable comments and observations. I refer to the quarterly published by the College, namely, THE JOURNAL OF MANIPULATIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL THERAPEUTICS. Then there are the scientific and clinical sections of the JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHIROPRACTIC ASSOCIATION, the JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHIROPRACTORS ASSOCIATION, the SWISS ANNALS OF CHIORPRACTIC and the DIGEST OF CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS. On several occasions I have received requests from Journals outside of the profession and of significant stature for articles and papers. So, indeed, your literary talents are very much needed and it is my hope that you will see fit to respond with a sense of happy involvement.

Campbell DC; David Special Collection): After Thirty-Five Years I began my teaching at the National College the summer of 1938. So actually, it has been my fortune to be associated with the College for an actual forty-two years. Having graduated that spring of '38, I was assigned to take over the gross anatomy in human dissection during the day and chiropractic principles and technic during the evening. As is well known, in those days the College conducted a day and evening school. It was a commanding, vigorous beginning, but an enjoyable, challenging one. Indeed, there were endless hours of preparation. The need to know, to comprehend and to understand has always been provocative, intellectual affectivities in my life. Hence the command of study, reading, spending long and late hours in the dissection laboratory in readying myself for the next day was neither offending nor alienating. These initial experiences and responsibilities were elegant conditioning and training factors that enabled me to progressively develop an overview of the human body, its function and conduct in health and disease that has been of inestimable help and motivation. My assignments in the chiropractic department enabled me to progressively apply my developing knowledge in applied and clinical anatomy, especially of the nervous system to the basic concepts and procedures of chiropractic. These initial years were most beneficial and rewarding and comprised a basis upon which subsequent activities and involvements found a strong indices of conviction and direction. As is known, the National College of Chiropractic was founded in 1906 in Davenport, Iowa by J. Allen Howard, who had been a student of D.D. Palmer in the Davenport School of Chiropractic . Seeking more extended urban opportunities for his new school and its few students, Howard moved the College to Chicago in 1908 settling in the neighborhood of Cook County Hospital and obtained for his students access to the open forum gross anatomy and autopsy seminars held weekly at the hospital.In 1912, Dr. Howard took into the College as his associate and proprietary partner, William Charles Schulze, M.D., graduate of the Rush Medical College and who for several years had been conducting a school of mechano-therapy in conjunction with Bernard McFadden. This affiliation brought into progressive augment the courses and laboratory exercises in the basic and diagnostic sciences, as well as basic courses in variations of physiological therapeutics. Furthermore, he defined the audicity of bringing into campus teaching and clinic faculty consisting of doctors of chiropractic, doctors of osteopathy, doctors of medicine, as well as personnel with graduate degrees. In some respects it was a presumption and certainly it provoked, in certain quarters of the profession, especially among our alumni of former years, can deny the significant input of such names as Forster, Jewel, Pickard, Sprecker, Perlman, LaFluer, Wells, Piontkowski, Bader, Golden, Tobinson, Blackmore and yes indeed, George T. Parker. The year of 1924 marked another primary significance. A young Bohemian by the name of Otto J. Turek came on the scene, first, as the operator of the rooming facilities at the 20 N. Ashland building, then eventually as the over-all business manager and such relieved the College of serious indebtedness and progressively engineered the accumulation of a reputable reserve. It was daring foresight that he, in 1928, spearheaded the establishment and development of the Chicago General Health Service Clinic as an adjunct to the College and as a center for effective internship. Yes, indeed, the CGHS for some 52 years has rendered mutli-faceted chiropractic care to hundreds of thousands of Chicagoland citizens, to include some of its most prominent citizens, such as Merrill C. Meigs, Executive Vice-President of the Hearst Publications; Edward S. Scheffler, Chief of Municipal Judges and former May Edward Kelly, and today, the CGHS continues to function with eminent success and has become an elite center of health care for Chicago's ever-expanding Black and Latino communities. Recently, the facilities of this inner city clinic have been expanded. A visit to the same would be an encounter of exciting patient care. Dr. Schulze passed away in 1936 and the near-total burden and responsibility fell on Mr. Turek's shoulders. With characteristic determination, O.J., as he was affectionately referred to, proceded to discharge his expanded responsibilities. No, he did not assume any official title other than the one he possessed, namely, Business Manager. Dr. Omer C. Bader was appointed Acting Dean and that was as far as any official designation went. The developmental history of National would be incomplete without the mention of two exceptional and totally loyal women, namely, Minnette DeVoto, Registrar, and Sylvia Cohn, the \"good gal Friday\" in the front office. In so many ways, DeVoto could have been designated \"First Assistant\" to the management without portfolio. Intelligent, disciplined and feisty, she was on top of most everything. Our gal Friday, Sylvia, with almost dogged persistence, handled the mail, book sales and ordering of office materials. Both have passed away, both enscribed an affectivity of loyalty and stewardship concern that stands monumental. It was Mr. Turek who employed me in the summer of '38. Gloria, my recent bride, and I began our married life in the 20 No. Ashland dormitory in Apt. 201 - no private bathroom or toilet facilities; no running water, but we made it and we developed close and lasting friendships with the then students, also living in the dormitory. It was a family type of togetherness that has left many endearing and sentimental memories. The memory and nostalgia of those days neither one of us have been able to fully abdicate. Probably herein lies the reason for the feeling of awkwardness in today's atmosphere of social and so-called academic sophistication. In 1943, O.J. apponted me Dean of the College. Dr. Bader had resigned; he, Mr. Turek, was scraping the barrel, Gloria and I were living in the dormitory and most available to students and staff and, most likely, this represented the rationale for this appointment. As all of this was eventuating, two significant circumstances intruded upon the scene. The Schulze family, wife, son and daughter of Dr. Schulze, desired to liquidate their holdings in the College and concurrently the National Chiropractic Association ( NCA) had organized the Committee on Chiropractic Education with an aggressive, unrelenting Irishman byChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 48 the name of Dr. John J. Nugent as its Director. One of the first demands of Dr. Nugent was the conversion of NCA-affiliated colleges from status of private ownership into not-for-profit, eleemosynary corporate status. It was these two factors that provoked the progressive transition of NCC fromproprietary status to its present corporate status. The almost endless involvements and responsibility was astutely and very effectively handled by the College's counsel, Edward J. Metzdorf and who, to date, has served with such exceptional deliberate concern and interest. The College, the profession shall ever be indebted to this ever- conscientious, loyal, able and diligent person. In the process of these commanding transitions, Mr. Turek called me in his office and characteristically, with unannounced forthrightness, said, \"Joe, I am appointing you President of the College; now let's get busy and pay off our indebtedness to the Schulze family.\" Mr. Metzdorf will verify the fact that IRS officials licensed the issuance of some seven hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars worth of notes against the newly established corporation, one houndred thousand of which was held by O.J. and the rest by the Schulze family. Within four years the indebtedness to the Schulze family was amortized. Mr. Turek, up to his demise in 1977, never sought payment on the notes he held and in the latter days of his life turned them over to be cancelled. Yes, O.J. Turek was an elegant human being and defined a singular chapter in the history of the profession although a layman who never finished high school. In 1948, Mr. Charles Miller was brought on campus and appointed as Vice-President in charge of business affairs. Increment in enrollment, coupled with incomes from the CGHS and the dormitory enabled the College to accumulate a reputable reserve of around $600,000. This motivated the purchase of a 20-acre farm plot here in Lombard for the future development of a suburban campus. Annexation of the property to the Village was severely withstood by the DuPage County Medical Society, but was eventually fully realized. Construction of the main college building was begun the latter part of 1960. Naivety in financing and dabbling in over-reach resulted in the serious circumstance of running out of construction money. Only after a short term loan of $400,000 was negotiated with the Illinois Continental Bank and Trust Company, the President of the bank at that time being David M. Kennedy who later became Secretary of the Treasury and a personal friend of mine, and a matching amoung raised in outright donations from alumni and constituents and the sale of debentures did the College manage to keep its head above water. It was at this time that Dr. Earl G. Liss became Chairman of the Board of Trustees, a position that he has filled with eminent integrity. Those were the \"dog days\" of great financial exigency and need. I shall always be grateful to such valiants as Drs. Herbert W. Ortman, Samuel A. Conway, L.J. Darr, Ralph Reimer, Eugene Hoffman and others. In the spring of '63 the Lombard facilities were dedicated and occupied. Subsequently, three married student housing facilities, a second-story Learning Resource Center facility, a Student Center with the Liss Auditorium and now the developing construction of the Patient and Research Center. In total, these facilities, their equipment and furnishings comprise an investment of well around twenty-five million dollars. Could it be that all of this might be defined as a reputable profile in stewardship? Over the many years the National College, from a clinical standpoint, has always sought to maintain a broad wholistic approach in the teaching and practice of non-allopathic health care procedures. As early as the 1910's progressively the various aspects of physiological therapeutics were introduced, such as diet, nutrition, therapeutic fasting, hydro and electrotherapy, as well as massage and exercise. Those were added to the curriculum not to mitigate the significance of the specific spinal adjustment, but to enhance its affectivity in an adjunctive supportive manner. Certainly, events within the profession and on campus of other leading chiropractic colleges signify the fact that this pioneering initiative of College was more than correct. So often I have referred to the definition of chiropractic of the Illinois Practice Act to describe the College's position: \"the treatment of human ailments without the use of drugs, medicines or operative surgery.\"The National College has, over the many years, sought to align itself with progressive innovative and purpose fulfilling aspects of chiropractic. Permit me to mention but some of the major ones: 1. One of the first of our profession's colleges that introduced the four year professional course. 2. One of the first of the chiropractic colleges to introduce pre- professioinal college requirements. 3. One of the first of the profession's colleges that modeled not-for- profit eleemosynary corporate status. 4. Contributed significantly to the development, the growth, the status acquisition of the Council on Chiropractic Education. Who can deny the inestimable and all-significant efforts of our Dr. L.E. Fay, Executive Vice-President of the College and former President and Secretary-Treasurer of the Council. I take significant pride in the fact that I am the only remaining charter member of the CCE. 5. It was former students of NCC who defined the courage to cope with the Basic Science Board nemesis. As is well documented, Basic Science legislation was introduced by organized medicine to throttle the growth of chiropractic. As the years went on, because of the need to staff new medical schools in basic science states, medicine got caught in its own trap, the basic science history in New Mexico being a glaring example . 6. Who is there that would refute the strong input that NCC has made to the development of the Federation of State Chiropractic Examining Boards, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners and various of the ACA specialty councils? -------------------- Page 6 missing -------------------- 13. Probably the major excitement that brings us here is the expanding construction of the Patient and Research Center. For certain it is a daring venture. Indeed, it is a command of concern. Yes, I am running scared, not only because of the relating financial concerns, but also because of the imperatives of proper staffing and functionalizing. To date, it has not been easy; so much of the immediate planning and supervision has been under the auspices of the Executive Vice- President, Dr. Fay, and for certain he has rendered a most commendable service. It is hoped that the Center will be ready for occupancy a year from now. No, it is not to be a hospital; it has been designed to render out-patient, in-patient and rehabilitative services on a wholistic chiropractic basis and to conduct reputable, acceptable investigatory and research studies that are relevant. Indeed, we seek the support, the input and counsel of each and every one of you. Yes, the Center is for the profession, not just for National College. We so honestly and sincerely believe that it is a dramatic venture into a Decade of New Horizons. Now, let's conclude by simply remitting for your study and deliberation a number of observations that seem to present themselves as a profile of the future. 1. The chiropractic professi on must remain as an independent primary contact health care profession, not only here in the United States and Canada, but throughout the world. No longer can chiropractic be dubbed a North American profession. In order to accomplish this, it is going to take a lot of doing by every segment of the profession - and National has a totally undeniable and unavoidable role to play that is exploding in dimension. 2. The chiropractic profession must augment its interdisciplinary relations with the other major health care professions. No longer can we avoid contact with others. No longer can we retain our identity and survive unless we enter into the world of professional and clinical intercourse and by means of initiative and innovative input define our function as a primary component of the health care team. 3. The chiropractic profession must design and conjugate atmospheres of more effective interprofessional cohesion and understanding. No longer can we afford the luxury, yes, the nonsense of tribal idological differences, otherwise self-destruction is inevitable. 4. The chiropractic profession must come to more effectively define and index its intents, designs and programs of critical study, innovative investigation and research, both in laboratory and clinical atmospheres. Imitation, plagarism and wasting wherewith on projects that are not relevant cannot be indulged in.Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 49 5. The chiropractic profession must insist that all of its educational institutions properly and effectively qualify for status with the Accrediting Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Education. The profession cannot afford the mitigations of \"shoestring\" institutions. Astute efforts must be designed and exercised. 6. Chiropractic colleges, although astutely defining quality in both the basic and clinical sciences, must never overlook the primary purpose, that of educating and graduating well qualified Doctors of Chiropractic. We dare not succumb to the university complex of checkerboarding the curriculum into departmental \"ivory towers\" and specialty monstrasities. 7. The chiropractic profession must become more astutely involved at every level in all aspects of health care planning. Within the portfolio of the profession there must be indexed formulae and plans for peer inclusions within all Federal and State Health Care Programs and we must be ever-ready to properly submit them to agencies in question. 8. The chiropractic profession must become more proficient in its public relations effort. Too often our efforts at PR have been struts of claim, \"tarzanic\" chest-thumping exercises and over-reach in assertions. People want to be persuaded and prevailed upon, not cajoled by sales duress. 9. The chiropractic profession has got to evolve more sophisticated and learned publications, both in the form of periodicals and textbooks. There is a marked paucity of good scientific, clinical and instructional literature in the profession. Resultantly, a resort to the texts of other health care professions dilutes the interests that should encompass the singular concepts and principles of our clinical dimensions. 10. The chiropractic profession needs to become more mindful and cognizant of the importance of the clinical significance that resides in the basic premise of chiropractic, namely, that in man (homo-sapiens) there is an intimate relationship between spinal and pelvic biomechanics and the neurological element and hence represents a primary in the phenomenon of somatic homeostasis. This biological has become the most commanding interest among clinical biologists. Now, may I become philosophical and simply set for the principles that have motivated my life as a profoessional... ----------------------- later pages missing ----------------------- Keating's chapter 4 (\"The Age of Wonderment: Chiropractic in the early 20th Century\") in Peterson D & Wiese MA (Eds): Chiropractic: An Illustrated HistoryChiropractic: An Illustrated History notes of J.F. Howard , D.C., A.L. Forster, M.D., D.C. and W.C. D.C.: Another prominent broad-scope influence in chiropra ctic was John F. Howard, D.C. Howard had commenced his studies under D.D. Palmer in Davenport in 1905, but by the time he completed the nine month curriculum in 1906 Old Dad Chiro had departed for Oklahoma following his conviction and jailing for unlicensed practice and son BJ's refusal to allow him to return to the Palmer School. Some friction developed between BJ and a number of students who felt that the younger Palmer's administration of the school did not provide sufficient scientific emphasis to the chiropractic art. With DD's blessing, Howard and the dissident Palmer students organized the National School of Chiropractic in 1906, and thus began the tradition of \"rational chiropractic.\" However, D.D. Palmer would later criticize his development of the \" Howard System\" of chiropractic, which combined elements of naturopathy and manipulative methods. In later years Howard would recall the events that led to the formation of the National School: Students who had entered school to receive their instruc tion from the father (D.D. Palmer) became very much discontented, and the son with all his cleverness was unable to stem the tide of discontent....finally a delegation (of students) called upon me and implored me to organize a school and teach chiropractic as it should be taught. (see Table 6) The first home of this new institution was in the same building where D.D. Palmer had practiced as a magnetic 10 years before. However, Dr. Howard's desire to teach anatomy by dissection washindered by restrictive laws with directed all human cadavers to the University of Iowa's medical school. Accordingly, in 1908 Howard relocated the National School to Chicago in order \"to secure the clinical, laboratory, dissection, hospital and other facilities that were lacking in a small town.\" The school was also incorporated that year as a proprietary institution, which was the norm for chiropractic colleges in those days. The move to Chicago brought Howard in contact with eclectic, naturopathic and other alternative healing arts which flourished in the windy city. Most significant among his new contacts were William Charles Schulze , M.D. a graduate of the University of Chicago's prestigious Rush Medical College, and Arthur L. Forster , M.D., a graduate of the medical department of the University of Illinois. Schulze was born in Germany in 1870 and came to the United States in 1887. He earned his doctorate in 1897 and practiced for several years in Wisconsin before taking a position as medical director of the Zander Institute . Schulze was operating the Institute of Physiological Therapeutics in Chicago when Howard hired him as a faculty member at National. Drs. Schulze and Forster pioneered physiological therapeutics within the chiropractic profession, including light, heat, cold, electricity, water, nutritional interventions and exercise regimens. The National School offered coursework in the electrical modalities and naturopathic methods as early as 1912, considerably before the formation of the physical therapy profession. Schulze purchased the National School from Howard circa 1916, and continued as its president until his death in 1936. Under Schulze's leadership and that of Arthur Forster, M.D., D.C., the National School (renamed National College of Chiropractic in 1921) became one of the leading forces for improvement in chiropractic and basic science instruction in the discipline. As an MD/DC he was both respected and reviled by various elements in the profession. Schulze probably never met D.D. Palmer, but he was well known to BJ, the leader of straight chiropractic. Forster is recalled as dean of the National College under Schulze, an instructor in anatomy, as the editor of the journal published by the school in the early years, and as the author of several texts, including Principles & Practice of Spinal Adjustment (1915, Forster's System of Non-Medicinal Therapy (1919) and The White ____________________________________________ Rehm's (1980) Necrology notes (p. 284) Schulze, William C., M.D. (b. in Germany, 1870, d. Chicago, Ill., Sept. 26, 1936) Becoming associated with the National School of Chiropractic in 1910, William Charles Schulze was one of the early physicians who became identified with chiropractic. He brought about educational reforms that contributed favorably to the impact of chiropractic on legislation. William C. Schulze came to the United States at the age of 17. He was graduated from William Jewell College, Liberty, Mo., and received his M.D. degree from the Rush Medical College , Chicago, in 1897. He practiced general medicine in Lomira, Wis., for three years, then returned to Chicago, where he was medical director of the Zander Institute . Later specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, he authored A Text Book of the Diseases of Women. He also established the Institute of Physiological Therapeutics , a venture that brought Schulze into chiropractic education. Initially, his involvement with the National School consisted of a series of clinical lectures, but he soon discontinued medical practice to devote his full time to chiropractic education. Dr. Schulze was responsible for introducing physio-therapy and other drugless methods to the chiropractic curricula as early as 1912. Early diplomas issued by the National School read, \"Doctor of Chiropractic and Physiological Therapeutics.\" He also inaugurated the first laboratory courses in chiropractic education. Dr. Schulze became president of the school in 1914, when he purchased ownership from Dr. Charles [John] A. Howard, its founder. Although he introduced a broad course in drugless healing, Dr. Schulze placed great emphasis on spinal adjustment. In his classes, lectures and writings, he insisted that students be trained thoroughly in chiropractic principles and technique. ____________________________________________Chronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 50 Dr. James F. Winterstein, President, The National College of Chiropractic, met with Mr. William Lane Schulze on December 5, 1993, at the Mayflower Retirement Center, Winter Park, Florida. Mr. Lane's address is: Mayflower Retirement Community, Health Center - Room Court, Winter Park FL 32792 (Mayflower Office: 407-672-1620). The following is a transcript of that meeting: I was in Florida this weekend to attend a Peat Marwick seminar at the Breakers Hotel in West Palm Beach, Florida. Dr. Richard Gilmore, Vice President for Educational Affairs, joined me in West Palm Beach, and Mr. Jack Groves, Vice President for Administration and Finance will join me this evening. We are all here to take part in this seminar. Last evening, Dr. Gilmore and I drove to Fort Lauderdale where we held a reception for National College graduates who are attending the Florida Chiropractic Association Convention this weekend. We had an excellent turnout, and I had the opportunity to meet a number of our younger graduates, including Dr. Willy Turner, Dr. Todd DiLeo and others who are all doing well. I met a number of the older graduates, of course, and we had a fine reception. This morning, at 7:00 A.M., I drove to Wi nter Park, and there, at the Mayflower Retirement Center, I met with Mr. William Lane (Bud) Schulze and his wife, Lyn. Mr. Schulae is the sone of Dr. William Charles Schulze, who was President of The National College of Chiropractic in the earlier part of the history of the school and who passed away in about 1938. Mr. William Lane Schulze, the son, is a graduate of Yale and had his bachelor's degree in philosophy with the principal emphasis, however, in economics. When he graduated from Yale in 1928, he was married and had a child, and he said that about that time companies that were looking for Yale graduates such as he was were paying about $35 per week. His father, at that time, owned a school called the Chicago School of Nursing which was located on Michigan Boulevard, as he called it. His father offered him a job at $65 per week working in the business end of the school, and, so, he took the job. That school was on Michigan Avenue at the time. During that time, also, Dr. Schulze was at The National College of Chiropractic (that is, his father). He had come over from Germany in 1884 at the age of fifteen. In order to pay for his passage from Germany, he worked for a German farmer, a blind man, for two years, and that paid for the cost of his trip from Germany. Apparently, this farmer would hire young boys from Germany, and they would come and work for him for two years, and then, of course, he would look for someone else. William Charles Schulze then went to college (I think he said in Wisconsin), and then, subsequently, to the Rush School of Medicine. He then went to practice in Wisconsin in a rural practice. He later moved to Duluth, Minnesota and became acquainted with the Mayo brothers. He subsequently moved to Chicago where he practiced with another doctor on Michigan Avenue. It was during that time that, in order to supplement his income, he took a teaching job at The National College of Chiropractic with John Fitz Alan Howard. Mr. William Lane Schulze relates that the College was owned by a number of individuals who had stock int he college and his father, William Charles Schulze, began to receive stock, apparently in compensation for the teaching he was doing, and thus, became the principal stockholder. In 1928, The National College of Chiropractic was located at 412 South Ashland, and, sometime in that time frame, jDr. Schulze bought the 20 North Ashland building which was the Union Theological Seminary. He was not sure what the denomination of that seminary was. He then moved the chiropractic college to 20 North Ashland, and, subsequently, moved the Chicago School of Nursing to the 412 South Ashland site. William Lane Schulze continued to work in the business of training nurses and began to run into opposition by the American Association of Practical Nurses who had begun to lobby for requirements on the educational aspects of nursing so that the graduates would have to spend time in a hospital. William Lane Schulze related to me that it was his perspective that the practical nurses, which, at that time, numbered about 200,000, were actually best suited for home care, which is what they did principally. They especially took care of the elderly at home. He said many of them were women who had married, had children, and then had subsequently decided to take up a course in nursing. Apparently, a lot of themlearned it by apprenticeship, but Bud Schulze had worked with his father, and they owned this school. Later Bud bought the Chitauqua School of Nursing in New York, and he merged the Chicago and the Chitauqua schools. He said there were three way sin which the nurses could become certified. One was through a correspondence or home study course folowed by testing and then some practical experience working in the home. Another was to actually go on campus and study, and then, apparently, there was a third method that involved hospital experience. These g4raduates had certificates which indicated how they had learned their profession. He, however, was convinced that the best pratical nurses were the ones that were taught through his courses and actually were required to gain their experience working in the home. He eventually left the field of nursing education because he said he was constantly struggling with the nursing association with which he did not agree because they simply wanted to grandfather everybody who claimed to be a practical nurse. He said many of those people were just house workers who had perhaps worked a little bit with a family doctor who came in. In any event, he did leave the nursing business and then concentrated principally in career training, somewhat along the lines of our proprietary institutions today. He had a school in which he trained real estate people, and he developed and sold various kinds of correspondence courses, and, also, encyclopedic materials. He eventually sold his publishing company when he retired. Bud Schulze was a close personal friend with Otto Turek who originally was the individual who leased the business of running the dormitories at 20 North Ashland. He related that Mr. Otto Turek was largely an uneducated man, haveing recieved only a couple of years of grade school following which he had to go to work, and so he was a self- educated individual who made his living buying and selling businesses. He was a business broker, and he bought all kinds of businesses; in one case, he owned and operated a company that published Catholic church publications. He said that Mr. Turek also bought and operated rooming houses and then sometimes sold them. Apparently, he first became acquainted with William Charles Schulze when he was involved in operating the rooming house at 412 South Ashland for the nurses and probably also for some chiropractic students who might still have been living there. There was a fire at 412 South Ashland, and I think it was perhaps at that time that they decided to move the college, but he was not real clear on that. His father, William Charles Schulze, had rheumatic fever as a child and was left with a damaged heart, although, apparently, he was not aware of that earlier on, but did become aware of it in later years and was very interested in nutrition and exercise. So, he took up the game of golfing and used to walk in the summertime. Three times a week he would golf, and he would walk the entire eighteen holes. In the wintertime, he walked Chicago streets, usually two miles a day, and, apparently, made it a habit to do that everyday. Nevertheless, when he was sixty-six years old, he succumbed to his heart condition, very likely congestive heart failure. At that time, as the President, of course, had just passed away, the school was left in the hands of Otto Turek and William Lane Schulze. They then made Bud Schulze the President, as he put it, by default, simply because someone had to be President of the corporation. This must have been about 1938, right after his father died. (Check the date with Dr. Beideman) He indicated to me that he did not feel qualified to be the President, but he was by default, and it was during that interval of time while he was President that he and Otto Turek traveled to Indianapolis to talk to the administration of Lincoln College to determine whether there was a way that National and Lincoln could be amalgamated. That apparently did not come to any potential fruition because, of course, as we know, it did not happen. Another thing that he indicated to me was that while he was working for his father, the National College Bulletin was used to argue rather extensively and, by name, against B.J. Palmer and Palmer's philosophy. He convinced Bud Schulze, who was responsible for its publication, that he wanted to change the editorial policies of the Bulletin, and he did accomplish that to the effect that the Bulletin would cease any reference, in the negative sense at least, to the Palmer College. He said that Palmer and National were always, as he put it, lambasting each other. He said that, in the process of changing that policy, the result was that people within the profession seemed to think that was a good idea, at least they responded thereafter much moreChronology of the National College of Chiropractic Keating 51 dramatically to the National College summer sessions, which they apparently provided for any chiorpractor who wanted to come and study. He said tht their numbers during the summer sessions rose considerably after the editorial policy had changed. Mr. William Lane Schulze is a very articulate man who has a good command of the English language and is clearly a learned individual, although he tends to be somewhat self-effacing. He then remained the President in a business sense only, he said. He did not go to the college to work everyday because he had his own business which involved nursing education, but he did function as the corporate President, and he and Otto began to look for someone who could, as he put it, become a legitimate college president, and, of course, Dr. Janse was on campus at that time teaching. He was made dean and then later on he became the President. Bud Schulze related to me that it was his idea that the college should become a nonprofit corporation, and he worked with Otto to develop that status for The National College of Chiropractic. He did inherit his father's nominal salaries, as he termed them, as President of the chiorpractic as well as the nursing schools. He did not relate to me any of the business transactions between the family and Otto Turek nor between the family and the college. William Lane Schulze has not ever seen The National College campus in Lombard and, of course, I invited him to come at any time that he might wish and to be our guests. He is now eighty-eight years old, having been born in 1905, and I believe his wife is eighty- four. He has some macular degeneraton in one or both eyes and a cataract in one eye, but he still is able to drive and does so. He estimates that he had driven more than a million miles and has only one accident which occurred on Lake Shore Drive in 1939. Mr. Schulze indicated that he and his wife have traveled broadly, having returned to a vacation spot in Portugal on many occasions and having driven widely in Europe, including Germany, France, Austria and other countries in that area. He said that they had done a tour of the orient and, of course, traveled to many places in the United States. He indicated to me that he had done reasonably well in his business and had made a reasonable sum of money in real estate, both speculative as well as in relationship to his own homes. He had lived in Barrington Hills for a number of years, until about 1966, and prior to that had lived up near Evanston. When he retired, they eventually moved to Highland Beach, Florida, which is about eighteen miles south of West Palm Beach, where they owned a condominium and had lived there for quite a number of years until just recently, in fact, about July of this year when they chose to move to Winter Park where his mother, at one time, had owned would be called a summer home. In Winter Park they live in a double apartment kind of arrangement in a large complex which is correctly called a retirement center. Bud Schulze indicated to me that he has always had a strong interest in nutrition and has practiced the use of therapeutic nutrition both from the standpoint of his dietary concepts as well as supplementation of his diet. He is a very young looking eighty- eight years and is very alert, although he admits that his memory of the specific issues surrounding The National College of Chiorpractic have been dimmed by the many other interests that he has had through the years. He and his wife, Lyn, are a charming couple who have a well- developed sense of humor and were very gracious to me, although I have the distinct feeling that they have put the era of The National College of Chiropractic far into the background. I asked him how his father became interested in chiropractic inasmuch as he was a medical physician, and he indicated to me that his interest was strengthened considerably by his relationship with the school. Another bit of information that was interesting to me was that Bud Schulze said that when his father died he became the President of the Nationa College as well as President of the Chicago General Health Service, which apparently must ahve been incorporated as a separate entity at that time. Mr. and Mrs. Schulze have one son who lives in Florida and a grandson who lives in Barrington Hills, Illinois. I spent about two and a half hours with them, and they took me to lunch. I have the feeling we will be able to maintain a relationship, and, hopefully, will be able to get them to the College at some point in the near future. ____________________________________________SOURCES Cochrane AB (Rehm, 1980, pp. 288-9) Geneva E.

Keating: Hello Joe, So nice to hear from you after all this time. I really don't know how I can help you with your article. Joe, Janse was way ahead of his time. He would have shown [sic] in today's academic environment.The JCC was too too advanced for the simple minded Dcs who were supposed to subscribe to it. It's true, ACA's lack of interest in the JCC forced Janse to create the JMPT...but, you know, Joe, the JMPT, even at this point, does not boast of a great big circulation. The Dcs out there are still the same as they were 20, 30, 40 years ago. \"Make A Buck\"! I see it all around me. It's discouraging, Joe. I guess you see it too, and not being a DC, you can be objective. I don't like what's happening. Forget about Managed Care. It's the profession's general attitude that as I see it, from here, is really pulling us downward. Sorry, but those are my feelings. I wish I could be more optomistic, but, Joe, I have lived long enough to get it right, to know that I have reached my potential, and that I have made a difference in the world. That's a satisfying feeling that I can live with for the rest of my life. I am a happy individual. I don't persue [sic] happiness, I create it. I am as happy as I want to be. Sounds pollyanna? Sure! It works for me, after all these years. I know, I may be out of chiropractic, but you can't take chiropractic out of me. I still feel sympathy and empathy for the profession, to which I have devoted my life. And, what return do I get? Will send you some \"slow mail.\" Keep plugging, ED ____________________________________________ References: Beideman RP.
