BMC is continuing to track data around COVID-19, including our staff and patient COVID positivity rates, wastewater data, and the community's total new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. We are using this data to determine safe and appropriate times to modify current restrictions. In-person meetings are now allowed at BMC. However, everyone in the room must wear their mask, maintain three feet of distance from others, and refrain from eating. BMC is actively reviewing a number of policies, including those related to work travel, volunteers, visitors, and indoor masking, and will provide updates as changes are made. REMINDER: COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Workplace Requirement Boston Medical Center is following CDC guidance and requiring all employees and LIPs receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This requirement is based on clinical evidence and our collective responsibility to keep our patients and colleagues safe. In order to meet the compliance requirement and maintain employment at BMC, you must receive the COVID-19 booster or an approved exemption by March 28, 2022. Full compliance includes ensuring that your booster vaccination status is recorded in the [Employee Health Portal](https://sts.bmc.org/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx?loginToRp=https://webchartnow.com/bmcprod/webchart.cgi). You can find detailed information about recording your booster status on the [COVID-19 Vaccination Compliance page on the Hub](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dprzYb3o?url=https://hub.bmc.org/employee-center/working-well-clinic/covid-19-vaccination-compliance). NEW: At-Home COVID-19 Testing Kits Now Available at BMC COVID-19 antigen at-home test kits are now available in BMC pharmacies. BMC pharmacy staff will submit your test kit request directly to your insurance, saving you from submitting a claim form for reimbursement. Requests are limited to four kits (eight tests) per person. Please allow three to five days for processing. The ordering form for COVID-19 test kits can be found on [the Hub](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dpz6rBGx?url=https://hub.bmc.org/covid-19-test-kit-request-form). REMINDER: COVID-19 Treatments are Available at BMC As a reminder, all providers are able to prescribe ambulatory treatments for COVID-19 for eligible patients. Full prescribing guidance can be found in the [Ambulatory Treatment for COVID-19](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dprzWWtJ?url=https://hub.bmc.org/doc/covid-antibody-treatment) document on the [COVID-19 clinical resources](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dprzXbHL?url=https://hub.bmc.org/covid-19-information-employees) page of the Hub. Please continue to refer to the links to these documents on the Hub for the latest version of these guidelines. [Talking points](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dprzXqTS?url=https://hub.bmc.org/doc/how-talk-patients-about-covid-treatment) to use when informing patients about the availability of therapeutics can also be found on the Hub on the [COVID-19 clinical resources](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dprzXwsV?url=https://hub.bmc.org/covid-19-information-employees) page. NEW: \"Let's Talk Long COVID\" Events for Patients Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, BMC has been caring for patients with symptoms of \"long COVID,\" which refers to COVID-19 symptoms that last more than four weeks after the initial infection. Now, the ReCOVer Long COVID Clinic provides comprehensive care to these patients. You can refer patients directly through Epic, or have patients call the Infectious Diseases Department at 617-414-4290. As part of our care for patients with long COVID, BMC is hosting a series of events where patients and community members are able to ask questions and learn about available support. Events are live-streamed and may also be open for in-person attendance. For more information about these events, please contact Sophie Wilson at "}
