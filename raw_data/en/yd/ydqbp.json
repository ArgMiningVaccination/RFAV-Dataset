After introducing us to an animal that fashions and uses tools, exploits forest medicines, transmits learned cultural behaviors, and exhibits human-like emotions, Peterson and Goodall present an illuminating, frequently startling study of the current threats to wild chimpanzees' habitats and the many abuses that chimps have endured and continue to face at the hands of humans. They address conservation issues and ethical questions concerning keeping chimpanzees in captivity, whether as pets or for entertainment or research, and offer firsthand evidence of the drastically declining numbers of chimpanzees in the wild.Through their in-depth exploration of our relationship with chimpanzees, Peterson and Goodall demonstrate our close ties to these animals and also reveal how distant humans have become from their own place in nature. Both an informative, entertaining collection of stories about the authors' research experiences with chimps and a poignant call for a change in our perceptions and treatment of them, Visions of Caliban is a moving and important work. \"A well-argued case for greater care and conservation [of chimpanzees].\"--New Yorker \"Visions of Caliban is beautifully written, easily read, and ethically challenging\u2014it just might become primatology's Silent Spring.\"--Nature A powerful indictment of human cruelty; a convincing plea for animal rights\u2014and altogether superior to the run-of-the-mill nature books crowding the market.\"--Kirkus Reviews \"Riveting and illuminating, this is an important book.\"--Booklist Heartrending . . . a gripping account of an extremely important subject.\"--Library Journal \"After reading this book, even a person who laughs at chimpanzees in costume, or believes that chimps should be used to test vaccines for AIDS, must acknowledge that there is something very wrong here.\"--New York Newsday \"A study of the relationship between humans and chimps [that] asks, which is most brutish'?\"--New York Times Book Review \"[Visions of Caliban is] compelling, important. . . . in this book science and grace intersect.\"--Washington Post "}
