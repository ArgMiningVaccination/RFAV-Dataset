STEVE SISOLAK & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MICHAEL BROWN Dear Nevada Legislators and GOED Board Members, IT IS OUR PLEASURE TO PRESENT THIS ANNUAL REPORT from the past year that was dominated by bold action to protect Nevada's economy while we faced the worst health crisis in more than a century. When 2020 began, the Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED) was working on finishing a five-year economic development plan for the first time in nearly a decade. When March hit, GOED pivoted into developing an 18-24-month recovery and resilience plan. Our historic major industries have served our state well and will continue to thrive as our economy recovers. We cannot brush aside the 287,000 Nevadans who had lost their jobs at the height of the health crisis. As we enter the 2021 Legislature, there are roughly 150,000 of our fellow Nevadans who are out of work. These are unprecedented numbers. Included in this report is Nevada's Plan for Recovery and Resilience that was coordinated by GOED, researched, and written by SRI International with significant contributions from RCG Economics and Brookings Mountain West. Before we pivot back to a long-term economic plan, we must first provide immediate assistance to the small businesses who have faced immense challenges throughout this pandemic. That's why the Governor's recommended budget includes $50 million to continue $10,000 emergency grant funding for small businesses. We understand that to get our economy back on its feet we need to get people back to work, that's why the Governor's recommended budget and policy agenda laid out in his recent State of the State includes: Nevada's New Energy Economy: A commitment to increased transmission, storage, and distribution of all forms of clean energy. Focus on New Industries: The creation of Innovation Zones in Nevada and investment in local research and development that will lead to economic opportunities. including $5 million for the Knowledge Fund to encourage creation and support for new business, business innovation, and to leverage federal funds. Preparing the Workforce for New Nevada Economy: The creation of the Nevada Job Force and exploring new remote work opportunities. Creating Jobs through Infrastructure: $75 million for future capital improvement projects that will be used to launch the State Infrastructure Bank. Thank you for your partnership as stewards of Nevada's economic future. We look forward to working together to get to the other side of this health crisis and getting Nevadans back to work. GOVERNOR STEVE SISOLAK DIRECTOR MICHAEL BROWNNevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 2 Summary GOED PLAYED KEY RECOVERY ROLE IN NEVADA'S EFFORTS TO MITIGATE COVID-19 ECONOMY IN 2020, THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY worked closely with the State Treasurer's Office and the Department of Business and Industry to implement a number of statewide economic assistance programs funded through CARES Act funding to address the COVID-19 Pandemic. They included: Commercial Rental Assistance Grant Program (CRAG) which doled out $7.1 million to 770 small businesses for lease assistance. Pandemic Emergency Technical Support Grant Program (PETS) has been allocated $51 million so far to help small businesses to cover expenses. $6,048,981 in Coronavirus Relief Funds (CRF) was allocated for 11 research and development projects at the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). $2,732,843 in CRF was allocated for 26 workforce development projects at the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), Great Basin College (GBC), Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC), Western Nevada College (WNC), Nevada State College (NSC) and UNLV. GOED also played a major role in helping the Small Business Administration roll-out the Paycheck Protection Program and Nevada was one of the first states to qualify for the Economic Injury Disaster Loans in March. GOED was dispatched by the Governor to focus on pressing needs during the pandemic. From February through July GOED provided direct back-up support on the Pandemic Response, including Director Brown's participation on Nevada's Local Empowerment Advisory Council. Communications Director Greg Bortolin provided Public Information Support to the Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction. Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Director James Humm provided support to the Health Response Unit. Deputy Director Kris Sanchez provided support on Personal Protective Equipment and Deputy Director Bob Potts provided economic analysis. From July through December, GOED designed, together with State Treasurer Zach Conine, a variety of Economic Relief Programs focused on small business, workforce and public health resiliency while commencing the planning for Recovery by redeploying SRI to the development of a Recovery and Resiliency plan. Since November, GOED again pivoted towards economic recovery and the building of new resiliency in the economy. Several of those short- term proposals were included in the State of the State and others will be considered in due course. As business is now beginning to come back alive, we are reengaged in the traditional work of economic diversification, while continuing to support Relief programs and preparing for Biden Administration initiatives in the areas of infrastructure and small business assistance.GOED also played a major role in helping the Small Business Administration roll-out the Paycheck Protection Program...Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 3 To strategically deal with the health crisis, Director Brown reorganized GOED structurally into four parts: Agency Continuity was assigned to Kris Sanchez, Melanie Sheldon (business development, Pawel Pietrasienski (international), Eric Preiss (film), Joan Rueben (PTAC), and Diossa (administration and staff). Pandemic Response/Relief support for Governor's Office and the National Guard was assigned to Director Brown, Sonia Joya (minority and business support), Vance Farrow (healthcare), Jeanette Holguin (business development), Patty Herzog (rural and community development, and Tatjana Vukovic (business development). Forward Planning was assigned to Bob Potts, Karsten Heise (strategic programs), Stacey Bostwick (workforce development), and Chelsea Walburg (research). Communications was assigned to Greg Bortolin (public information), James Humm (compliance and regulatory affairs) and Carli Smith (social media). GOED's two deputy directors took on additional roles during the pandemic. When COVID-19 hit, Bob Potts, GOED's Deputy Director, was charged with facilitating weekly calls with the state's economists to ensure the Governor's Office had the latest data on the toll the pandemic was taking on the state's economy. State health officials were always on the call to help inform the process. Potts also convened a regular call of the Regional Development Authorities to engage the RDAs in the latest economic conditions as well as getting their help with the roll out of the CRAG and PETS programs. The RDAs were especially helpful with the Labor Certification Study, the EMSI SkillsMatch platform and the millions of dollars in grant funding applications being coordinated the State of Nevada. Kristopher Sanchez, GOED Deputy Director, is partnering with the Nevada Department of Transportation, the Governor's Office of Science Innovation and Technology, NSHE, regional and local governments, and the Nevada Treasurer's office to develop a Nevada Infrastructure Roadmap. The research team assembled for the project is reviewing the copious number of documents produced by state agencies, think tanks, and the regional development authorities seeking to identify projects that will spur economic development and job growth. For the purposes of the road map, infrastructure is defined broadly to include broadband, 5G telecommunications technology, computing power (data capture, storage, and processing), entrepreneur support, and more traditionally referenced factors such as roads and intermodal facilities.

Business incentives widely vary between each state and can comprise, but are not limited to, tax credits, tax abatements, grants, upfront cash payments, deal-closing funds, and real property subsidies or gifts. Most states offer a mix of statutory and discretionary incentive programs.The GOED Business Development Team works to attract and foster quality job creation, enterprise growth and new investments in the state.Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 5 Nevada is relatively unique in that it offers an entirely statutory Tax Abatement program. These tax abatements are finite and performance-based. The abatement program does not include any up- front cash funds or allocations from the state budget. In FY 2020, eight companies were approved for the state's abatement program. These companies will create an anticipated 403 jobs, in the first two years of operation, and make an estimated $164,540,895 in capital equipment investment in the state. Abatement Applications were heard at the June, September, and December GOED Board Meetings. As of December 2020, 21 companies have been incentivized and will create and anticipated 1,109 new jobs, in the first two years of operation, and make and estimated $918,207,783 in capital equipment investment in the state. INCENTIVES - TAX ABATEMENTS State and local governments across the United States use several types of tax incentives to encourage private sector firms to create jobs, invest in communities, and strengthen local industries. The Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED) offers various tax abatements to help qualifying companies decide to do business in the state. WHAT ARE TAX ABATEMENTS?Tax abatements are a reduction of taxes granted by a government entity to a company for a specific period to encourage economic development. No money is given to a company; it receives a discount on its tax obligation that sunsets on a specific date. A company receiving a tax abatement enters into an agreement (a contract) with the state. Each contract allows a company to receive a predetermined reduction in its tax obligations (reduced tax payments) for a certain period. In return, the company receiving the abatement is obligated to invest a significant amount of capital into the economy, invest in people and training by creating new jobs and paying wages and benefits to those workers. Companies that receive abatements are regularly audited by the Department of Taxation to ensure they meet the abatement requirements. When the abatement period is over, businesses are obligated to continue paying the full amount of taxes.Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 6 Important is to Know: Tax abatements are almost always granted to companies that would not otherwise relocate to Nevada. Tax abatements are granted to companies to promote growth by prioritizing firms in advanced industries that drive the competitive advantage, innovation, productivity, and wage gains. Tax abatements are discounts, not a pass for paying taxes. Businesses that receive tax abatements still pay taxes but at a discounted rate.

Workforce Development System Response Coordination (LWDBs, DETR, OWINN, B&I, GOED, DWSS, Labor Commissioner) 2. WINN Fund Fast Track Funding process 3. Economic Development Agency CARES NOFO Coordination and Technical Assistance 4. Labor Supply Certification Study (separate narrative) 5. SkillsMatch platform (separate narrative) 6. NSHE Workforce Training System Supports (detailed below) Goal: GOED sought Coronavirus Relief Funds to facilitate necessary adjustments that post-secondary workforce training programs were faced with to meet COVID-19 guidelines or adjusted needs of area employers. Programs that supply workforce critical to the public health emergency response were prioritized including supply chain logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing. Process: GOED worked closely with the Nevada System of Higher Education to identify workforce training programs in need of assistance and obtained approval for allocation requests representing twenty-six (26) projects and $2,732,843 in program investments.

Measured: The State, through Workforce Innovation for a New Nevada (WINN) funds, addresses resource gaps in industry driven partnerships with education providers to enable: 1. Accelerated execution of new, revised or expanded training program 2. Delivery of skilled workers into high-wage and high-skill employment opportunities new to Nevada 3. Infrastructure to support a program platform to deliver current and future technological skills 4. Sustainability of program design to continue to foster pipeline of skilled workers Ho w: New or expanding business needs in GOED's priority economic development strategies drive creation, customization or expansion of training programs to fill projected openings. Educational providers can request funds to support the costs associated with delivering the program. WINN was funded at $6 million in the current biennium ending 6/30/2021. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 22In Action: WINN has supported the development and launch of five new training programs and systems this year: 1. Advanced Manufacturing Expansion at College of Southern Nevada 2. Mobile Mech Tech Lab at Western Nevada College 3. Internet of Things Specialty at Nevada Technology Academy 4. Cybersecurity Training at Nevada Technology Academy 5. Northern Nevada Advanced Manufacturing Initiative at Truckee Meadows Community College Highlight: With funding from GOED's WINN fund, College of Southern Nevada is responding to the growing manufacturing sector needs in southern Nevada in partnership Haas Automation, Inc. and other southern Nevada manufacturing partners. CSN will transform the Sahara West Training Center to allow for the development of new manufacturing and industrial skills training programs heretofore unavailable in Clark County. The new program will utilize existing open entry-open exit competency models in the state and is projected to train over 200 Nevadans per year after it is launched. With over 1,100 manufacturing employers in Clark County, and lower than expected labor supply in these skilled occupation opportunities, GOED's support will be instrumental in meeting the demands of the current sector and afford an ability to grow in this critical industry. Highlight: With funding from GOED's WINN fund, Western Nevada College is addressing the need to expand access to skilled training in higher education \"deserts\" but where quality jobs in skilled occupations exist. WNC has developed a mobile training lab that will prepare future employees of in-demand industries in advanced manufacturing, automated systems, and mining in partnership with Nevada Copper and Comstock Mining. Students complete rigorous technical online coursework prior to the lab experience, starting with the fundamentals and building into complex topics to prepare for industry certification. The mobile lab will then offer the students the hands-on skill development and confidence needed to be successful in technical field environments. The project also leverages support from the William N. Pennington Foundation and will be able to offer previously inaccessible training to 50 rural Nevadans per semester when launched. LABOR CERTIFICATION STUDY Need: Nevada's workforce has been one of the hardest hit in the nation and job displacement impacts are not expected to level off in the near future. It is paramount that workforce and economic development systems align to expedite the return to work through strategic response systems based on the needs of business and the workforce pipeline. Response systems and decision-makers need accurate and real time data to develop and execute plans. Goal: The overarching goal of the requested study was to gain a better understanding of the availability of workers, their skills and occupational goals to enable data-driven decision making around workforce and economic development in Nevada. By deploying a survey tool, the study will garner accurate and real-time statewide and localized information not currently available in any database, State or Federal. With this data, GOED will coordinate with Nevada's Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the Governor's Office of Workforce Innovation, the Office of Science and Technology, the Department of Education, and local/regional partners to provide immediate response systems and develop mid- to long-range response plans that address the needs shed by the data.Workforce Development CONTINUEDNevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 23 Process: GOED requested Coronavirus Relief Funds to engage a consultant to perform this work and received approval from the Interim Finance Committee on October 22, 2020. GOED then retained the Growth Services Group, LLC., (GSG) a national workforce intelligence consultant, to administer the Labor Supply Certification study. The survey was developed in partnership with several state and regional stakeholders and was deployed at the end of October for approximately six (6) weeks. The survey designed by Growth Services Group (GSG) was conducted by use of social media targeted marketing with local partner outreach support. GOED has received the initial report following the survey. In Action: With receipt of the initial report, GOED will be taking several steps to put the survey data into action: 1. Engage 600+ Nevadans with a need to train to regain employment or advance their career 2. Develop Executive Summary and Recommendations 3. Convene Town Hall(s) with workforce and economic development stakeholders to highlight key findings 4. Provide Survey Report(s) to Legislative Counsel Bureau 5. Reconvene Workforce and Economic Development Subcabinet to distribute report and develop actionable policy and/programming plan WORKFORCE SKILLS MATCHING PLATFORM Need: Nevada is striving to recover from the devastation of COVID-19, and support the many dislocated workers displaced in the fallout of the public health emergency. Software platforms that offer those dislocated workers an easy and effective foundation to articulate their skills and how they transfer or align with available jobs are an effective and accessible tool for all impacted statewide. For those Nevadans whose occupation may never recover, a skills identification platform also provides insights into retraining opportunities in industries that are foreign to them. The likelihood that jobs lost following the public health emergency may never rematerialize means that Nevadan workers across gender and racial groups, communities and industries require a proportional response of accessible support mechanisms. Goal: GOED sought out a software solution that would guide job seekers through the process of inventorying their skills and then matching them to both local jobs and upskilling/reskilling opportunities. This will allow displaced workers and adult learners to understand their backgrounds from a skills lens and make career/education decisions based on their experience. GOED's goal was to deploy a statewide resource that can expedite the reemployment of displaced workers and increase the visibility of workforce training programs that can propel workforce reentry. Process: GOED requested Coronavirus Relief Funds to engage a vendor to perform this work and received approval from the Interim Finance Committee on October 22, 2020. GOED then retained EMSI, a national labor market data company, to develop a custom Nevada SkillsMatch platform. GOED partnered with the Office of Workforce Innovation and Nevada System of Higher Education institutions to launch this project. Underemployment Available Skills Desired Wages Labor Supply Certification State of Nevada Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 24 In Action: The site went live in November and GOED initiated a communication plan in December 2020. Additional milestones include: 1. Three (3) workforce development stakeholder training sessions will be conducted in January 2020 to share the resource with those providing workforce services 2. Over 1700 Training programs from seventeen (17) providers have been imported in the first two months 3. Custom training video for Nevada scheduled to be live in February 2021Workforce Development CONTINUED A better way to find a job or discover training Skills are what you have, and what employers need. And now there is an easy and better way to match them and match you with the job you want. The Nevada SkillsMatch platform quickly inventories your past experience and training along with your career goals. With this information, it identifies the career areas your interests and skills match to training needed to fill any gaps, and personalized training opportunities to get you on your desired career path. Best of all, it also produces live and local job postings based on the skills you have or plan to get, so you can start pursuing the job you want. Tell Nevada SkillsMatch your goals, education, and skills. And it will show you training to get you to the job you want. Or job postings that match your current skills.Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 25 Innovation Based Economic Development INNOVATION BASED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT KNOWLEDGE FUND The Knowledge Fund was enacted during the 2011 legislative session (NRS 231.1591 to 231.1597) but was not funded until the fiscal year 2014. The Knowledge Fund is the most critical program to foster Nevada's innovation economy, turning scientific research into market opportunities at Nevada's three research institutions, University of Nevada, Reno; University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Desert Research Institute, in areas the state has targeted for economic growth. An innovation economy transforms scientific research into new jobs and businesses, fosters entrepreneurship, increases access to critical resources, and ensures economic prosperity and opportunity for all people, both today and for future generations. When the people and institutions in a region are creating new scientific knowledge and technology, innovators and entrepreneurs are creating startups and high-growth small businesses, and the local workforce is educated and trained in the necessary skills to utilize the latest advances. All Nevadans will benefit from increases in growth and prosperity. These integrated forces drive an economy that creates new businesses and well-paying jobs while developing solutions for serious problems. In short, an innovation economy raises the overall quality of life for the people in that region. Importantly, because this economy is built on a foundation of identifying and transforming new knowledge, the system continues to produce these benefits well into the future - beyond the boom-and-bust lifecycle of any one industry or business.The Knowledge Fund is the most critical program to foster Nevada's innovation economy... Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 26GOED followed a strategic approach and rationale to allocate funding under this program. The cause has been based on an approach termed Innovation Based Economic Development (IBED), sometimes also known as technology-based economic development. This approach puts a university research infrastructure at the center of a regional innovation system (RIS) comprised of two interacting ecosystems: The startup economy ecosystem powered by startup firms; and an innovation economy ecosystem driven by existing innovative growth companies. A robust dynamic regional innovation system requires efforts and initiatives to enhance both ecosystems substantially. Over the past four funding cycles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), GOED has been selecting projects with the objective to strengthen the innovation economy ecosystem. To do this, GOED developed a vision of implementing Applied Research Centers at each of Nevada's universities and Desert Research Institute (DRI). These centers would conduct applied research and create intellectual property that will be used to develop new, relevant technologies to help companies grow their research and development (R&D) base and enhance their growth through innovation. Applied Research Centers will assist companies to turn advanced technologies into production processes and commercial products by working collaboratively with such firms. These centers can be regarded as 'outsourced R&D departments' providing 'innovation on demand' services. The origins of this model are based on the 'Fraunhofer Institutes' in Germany and the 'Catapult' centers in the United Kingdom. Thus, entrepreneurial startup culture has, over time, been spilling over to the universities and spur a 'change of culture,' including an increased rate of development of marketable university IP. Hence, for the second phase, a reformed Knowledge Fund will be broadening its approach and continue supporting Applied Research Centers in their focus on the regional growth economy ecosystem. It will also increase directing efforts at the startup economy ecosystem focusing on small, highly scalable businesses and support structures for fostering their formation and growth. The reformed Knowledge Fund ( 'Nevada Innovation Fund' - NIF ) will increasingly support the startup economy ecosystem while continuing to strengthen the growth economy ecosystem. The NIF would ensure that the current momentum in the form of an increased number of university spinout companies being formed, startup companies locating on university campuses to facilitate scale-up and growth, increased industry-university collaboration on R&D will be maintained. The NIF will retain Innovation Based Economic Development as the underlying rationale, as well as ensuring alignment with the new GOED State Plan by focusing on the following four target areas: Innovation Capacity Building - grant funding for applied R&D infrastructure and projects at Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) with emphasis for allocation to industry-university partnerships; Innovation Transfer - grant funding for technology transfer projects at NSHE and private small, scalable businesses, Small Business Innovation research (SBIR), and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR); Innovation Acceleration - grant funding to accelerate innovation for private early-stage Nevada tech companies to help them scale and create acceleration & venture building programs ; and Innovation Ventures - seeking the creation of Independent Commercialization Entity to offer NSHE path to effective formation of spin-out companies . KNOWLEDGE FUND - HIGHLIGHTS 2020 DRI has successfully spun out its first company focused on innovative solutions in agriculture. Tu Biomics Inc., inspired by DRI's expertise in microbial ecology, is an agricultural biotechnology company that targets industrial-scale farming's soil health challenges. In conjunction with DRI's plant and molecular biology scientists, Tu Biomics is developing a platform of organically derived biocontrol agents (BCAs) as a sustainable, effective alternative to currently available synthetic chemistry options. After GOED funded a $350,000 Knowledge Fund project at DRI, Tu Biomics subsequently received nearly $1 million in seed financing from venture investors and industry partners.Innovation Based Economic Development CONTINUED Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 27 Afte r investments totaling $4.3 million through the Knowledge Fund, the WaterStart program spun out of the DRI into a successful company that has already addressed $30 million in water technology challenges based in Nevada. With a growing membership, proven model, and diversified funding, WaterStart is ready to write its next chapter and operate independently. WaterStart was founded as a non-profit in 2013 in response to the impacts of the Great Recession and 20 years of continuous drought in Nevada. The public-private partnership was housed within DRI and funded by the Knowledge Fund. Dedicated to deploying new water technologies and making Nevada a hub for water innovation, WaterStart membership and sponsors are made up of the State's largest water agencies, consumers, and philanthropies, including the Southern Nevada Water Authority, Truckee Meadows Water Authority, MGM Resorts, NV Gold, the Wells Fargo Foundation and OneDrop. Since 2015, GOED has ma de a $6.2 million investment in the University of Nevada, Reno's (UNR) Nevada Center for Applied Research (NCAR). The investment has produced more than $75 million in capital and 300 jobs created by NCAR-affiliated companies; over 150 companies and agencies engaged with UNR through memberships or agreements; over 20 companies with currently working on campus; and more than $25 million in grants, contracts, and gifts to support NCAR-related initiatives. After a period of booming business incubation, three technology companies incubated in NCAR have emerged as viable companies and have outgrown their operation at NCAR. The companies that have chosen to locate laboratory R&D operations at UNR are, Bioelectronica, NexTech Batteries and LactaLogics. Each conducted its business-startup operations in on-campus laboratory space managed by NCAR. They have relocated all or partial operations to private, commercial areas; two of them, Bioelectronica and NexTech Batteries, remain in northern Nevada and continue to do work with NCAR through a fee-for-service agreement. Velodyne Lidar, Inc. announced a partnership with UNR to advance transportation infrastructure research. NCAR is using Velodyne's lidar sensors in its Intelligent Mobility initiative to collect data aimed at making transportation more efficient, sustainable and safe. The Knowledge Fund investment in the CoLab Esports Innovation Lab Project between Rainmaking and the International Gaming Institute's (IGI) Hospitality and Esports Labs is the first of its kind and a major step in funding development in the hospitality and gaming industries in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. The project leverages the explosive demand for online entertainment and esports with the pressing need for real world revenue and economic recovery for Nevada's most significant industry. The CoLab ensures that this industry, in which Nevada has enjoyed a global competitive advantage for decades, will stay ahead and continue to thrive. Rainmaking is an outstanding innovation and development firm with a strong history of commercialization of intellectual property to specific vertical industries. Rainmaking's unique approach is to work directly with industry representatives to understand the types of problems that, when solved through entrepreneurial and innovative thinking, result in immediate economic development activity. The collaboration, funded by the Knowledge Fund, will enable not only entrepreneurial activity precisely targeted at helping Nevada's largest industry in a post-pandemic recovery scenario, but will also produce revenue through commercialization of these highly targeted innovative projects developed in the CoLab. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 28 The Knowledge Fund enab led a statewide expansion of a program to help technology entrepreneurs earn federal grant funding to support their businesses' early-stage development or innovations. Initially funded through the Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST) at UNR in 2019, the Sierra Accelerator for Growth and Entrepreneurship (SAGE) program is being expanded to southern Nevada at UNLV with GOED Knowledge Fund support. This support and expansion come at a critical moment for small technology-based businesses in Nevada. SAGE is designed to put Nevada's small technology-based businesses on the path to earn grant funding through the competitive SBIR and STTR programs. Known as \"America's Seed Fund,\" the SBIR and STTR programs offer Phase 1 grants of up to $225,000 and Phase 2 grants of up to $750,000. KNOWLEDGE FUND RETURN ON INVESTMENT DRI The Knowledge Fund allowed DRI to launch the Healthy Nevada Project, a population health study examining genetic and environmental risks for certain diseases among Nevadans. With more than 50,000 Nevadans already enrolled, the Healthy Nevada Project is the country's most extensive population health study. The funding was critical to DRI developing a partnership with Renown Healthcare to launch the Renown Institute for Health Innovation, which has garnered $35 million in funding since its inception and allowed DRI to launch a new Cancer Biology Lab. WaterStart, a 501(c)(3) and operating in a region of proven first adopters, sitting at the nexus of technology, research and economic development. WaterStart provides channels for innovation for various stakeholders and water resource managers, including technology companies, management agencies and policymakers, and has addressed $30 million in water technology challenges based in Nevada. Creation of startup and subsequent spinout of company TuBiomics, which is working to solve an agricultural problem of white rot with Nevada and California's largest garlic growers through the development of organic antifungal chemicals. UNLV The Knowledge Funds has been fostering innovation in Nevada's leading industry, gaming, with the launch of the Center for Gaming Innovation. The Center for Gaming Innovation is diversifying the state's core economic strength in gaming. The Center is a true academic incubator, creating innovative and commercially viable casino games, and training students and working professionals for leadership roles in hospitality, gaming, and technology companies. The Center for Gaming Innovation has resulted in 18 patents, four student tech startups, and eight games that have been licensed for play. Creation of the Nevada Institute of Personalized Medicine (NIPM), which is working to improve Nevada's individual and community health through research and technology commercialization, education, and workforce training. NIPM is advancing Nevada to tomorrow's data-driven decision-making by decoding genomes to predict disease susceptibility, sift through treatment options, and fine-tune drug dosages to minimize adverse effects and help Nevadans lead longer, healthier lives. NIPM has secured more than $16 million in federal funding, with a return of investment of more than $4 for every dollar invested. Most recently, NIPM's spinout company Heligenics closed its first seed funding round. UNR GOED, in collaboration with UNR, applied the Applied Research Center model, resulting in the creation of the NCAR, which has been supported by the Knowledge Fund since 2015. NCAR provides entrepreneurs and industry access to the equipment, facilities and expertise of the university; resources needed for ideas and companies to take off and that would be cost-prohibitive for startups on their own. Through subgrants, the Knowledge Fund supports the Biosciences Entrepreneurial Lab, which makes affordable \"wet\" laboratory space available on-campus. This provides a safe and cost-advantage environment for small bioscience businesses while supporting their entrepreneurial R&D, as well as the Autonomous Robots Lab that participates in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge and is partnering with Nevada Gold/Barrick to develop subterranean robotics and autonomous vehicles for exploration and mining safety. Additionally, Innovation Based Economic Development CONTINUEDNevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 29 the Knowledge Fund investment has facilitated large, multidisciplinary research initiatives involving coalitions of public and private stakeholders, including the Intelligent Mobility initiative and, through it, the development of real-world, transportation \"Living Labs\" across Nevada. The funding helps drive private-sector entrepreneurialism through the operation of the University's Innevation Center, the downtown Reno co-working environment and makerspace. SSBCI AND BATTLE BORN VENTURE The Battle Born Venture Program (\"Battle Born\") is a state venture capital program overseen by GOED, under the auspices of the US Treasury's State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Battle Born makes equity and equity-like investments in early-stage, high-growth Nevadan enterprises in the following industries: aerospace & defense, agriculture, energy, healthcare, IT, logistics & operations, manufacturing, mining, tourism & gaming, water. It seeks an economic return on investment, and any proceeds from investments are reinvested into the program to benefit the citizens of the State of Nevada. The program invests alongside other private investors, such as angel groups, seed and venture capital funds. Battle Born accepts applications through the Gust platform, and all applications are evaluated by an independent Investment Advisory Committee. Battle Born's investments are held by Nevada Battle Born Growth Escalator, Inc, a corporation for public benefit and 501(c)(3). A recent survey reconfirmed that minority entrepreneurs continue to receive only a tiny portion of venture capital dollars. By contrast, in 2019, about half of Battle Born Growth portfolio companies, 42 percent by assets allocated, have at least one minority leadership team member at the time of investment. While Battle Born's mandate is not to create a culturally diverse portfolio, it is instead a consequence of Battle Born's investment process, specifically: open to all; avoid homophily ; investment advisory committee and investment manager are diverse . BATTLE BORN GROWTH ESCALATOR - INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS 2020 CircleIn - Participation in a second investment round Las Vegas-based CircleIn has developed a student-to-student tutoring app that allows students to study with one another and tutor one another, winning rewards in the process. Its advisory board includes the Education Director at Microsoft, and the former CTO of Merrill Lynch, AOL, and News Corp. Grrrl - New investment Grrrl is a Las Vegas-based athleisure company that focuses on size-free clothing and targets niche women's sports such as MMA and Highland Games. Its philosophy is centered around women's empowerment, with an emphasis on fitness at any size. Grrrl was co-founded by a husband-and-wife team who relocated to Las Vegas in 2019. Outlaw Soaps - New investment Outlaw Soaps is a Sparks, Nevada based personal care product company that is capitalizing on a resurgence in the male grooming market, and on consumers' demand for clean beauty. The company was founded by a husband-and-wife team with experience in building startups and digital brands at Oprah.com. The team relocated from California to Northern Nevada in early 2020. TuBiomics - Providing seed funding for DRI Knowledge Fund spinout Reno-based Tu Biomics is focused on developing organic crop protection products for the global agriculture industry. The first applications were solving an agricultural problem of white rot with Nevada and California's largest garlic growers through the development of organic antifungal chemicals. Battle Born's investment is from second-generation funds (proceeds from exits from prior portfolio investments) and dedicated to providing seed investment for promising Knowledge Fund spinout companies.Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 30Heligenics - Providing seed funding for UNLV Knowledge Fund spinout Las Vegas-based Heligenics, incorporated in 2019, is an industry disrupter on the leading-edge of drug development and diagnostic testing by defining the function of genetic variation with its proprietary GigaAssay technology. It can take years to identify a single genetic marker. Heligenics measures the impact of all mutations within a gene in months. Battle Born's investment is from second-generation funds (proceeds from exits from prior portfolio investments) and dedicated to providing seed investment for promising Knowledge Fund spinout companies. Community Entrepreneurship Project at City of North Las Vegas in Collaboration with Innovation CollectiveWhile not constituting an equity investment, the State Venture Program is utilizing second-generation funds (proceeds from exits from prior portfolio investments) in support of a unique economic development initiative in collaboration with Innovation Collective. This initiative helps diversify the City of North Las Vegas' economy by unlocking the creativity within its residents, business owners, and entrepreneurs. It is unleashing it in a way that creates shared value for all, which includes working with them to rediscover their creativity, learn new technical and soft skills, build new companies, expand current companies and matchmake startups to larger brands. The initiative aims to connect with community members of all ages to help them begin to take first steps in unlocking their full potential. SSBCI COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) was created by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to enhance local capital infrastructures. The initiative is managed by the U.S. Treasury, which requires that each State undergo thorough due diligence of the form and management of each component of the program before the funds allocated to each state are released. The Nevada SSBCI program began in 2011, and currently consists of two components, Collateral Support Program, managed by GOED, which pledges cash collateral shortfall to lending institutions to enhance the collateral coverage of individual loans taken by qualified Nevadan companies, and the State Venture Capital Program, \"Battle Born Growth Escalator\". The intent of the Nevada Collateral Support Program is to supply cash collateral accounts to Nevada financial institutions to enhance the collateral coverage of borrowers. These accounts will cover all, or a portion of a calculated collateral shortfall as determined by the lending institution. Borrowers with a collateral shortfall will apply for coverage through their financial institution that will then coordinate directly with GOED. Companies using this program will be otherwise strong with typically good historical cash flow coverage and strong indicators of future business and/or sales activity. They will also tend to have strong management teams in place, which the lender believes will perform well going forwards. REIMAGINE WORKFORCE PREPARATION In late September, Nevada was awarded $13.8 million Reimagine Workforce Preparation (RWP) grant out of the CARES Act's Education Stabilization Fund. Nevada was one of only eight states which received this three-year grant for its Project SANDI (\"Supporting and Advancing Nevada's Dislocated Individuals\"). GOED had been a lead architect in a proposal submitted by the Office of Workforce Innovation (OWINN) to the U.S. Department of Education for this grant. The program's goals are to build a modern workforce system that maps skills to competencies and credentials, expands remote access to short-term training, and educational opportunities by utilizing digital platforms and technologies. Innovation Based Economic Development CONTINUEDNevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 31 Through this project, Nevada will: Help displaced workers return to gainful employment and transition underemployed workers to new fields by building and piloting a new system (\"Skills Decoder\") that can translate work experience and skills into competencies, which are then converted into badges and credentials and later, flexibly bundled into certifications and degree programs. This approach responds to developments accelerated by COVID-19 pertaining to decentralized learning (e.g., non-classroom, hybrid classes, on-site training, open- entry/open-exit models), in conjunction with a geographically dispersed workforce, and geographically dispersed learning. Help new workers enter jobs within in-demand sectors and transition underemployed workers to new fields by implementing and expanding new accelerated degree programs, expanding remote access to in-demand occupations through distance education and the innovative use of digital platforms (virtual reality), and directing job seekers to an enhanced Nevada CareerExplorer that integrates career navigation with case management and online training links. Assist small business owners gain the skills needed to create new businesses or grow current businesses and become more resilient by creating a credit-based, online, self-paced entrepreneurship Nevada, enhancing the online presence of NV Grow, a small business development center located at the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), offering incentives to business startups, and launching a student venture accelerator cohort model. Ultimately, this grant funds the collaboration between the key stakeholders (employers, OWINN, GOED, NSHE, DETR, Nevada State Library) as an effort to modernize the current workforce system by developing a coordinated digital platform that allows dislocated, underemployed, and new job seekers easy access to accelerated training and education for in-demand, living-wage occupations and entrepreneurial pursuits. The Nevada State Library already has a service platform that leverages industry-leading solutions to manage information needs in a modern, mobile-friendly online environment. This grant will enhance the unified resource solutions that are already in place to simplify further and expand the information discovery experience of the job seeker, facilitate streamlined career exploration and training access, and increase cooperation between educators, librarians, career navigators, and individuals seeking to engage more fully in the workforce. NEVADA STATE LIBRARY GOED, as a member of the State Council on Libraries and Literacy (SCLL), has been providing thought leadership and guidance for highly innovative and nationally recognized workforce development projects piloted at Nevada's libraries. Examples include: \"Nevada's Working Capital\" project (2015) , the first of its kind in the nation, that leveraged library technology and special programs to provide \"maker-spaces\" for STEM learning, access to specialized engineering software (SolidWorks) for employers/employees seeking to advance in manufacturing careers, and formalized training opportunities to earn a recognized industry credential, Manufacturing Technician 1 (MT1). Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 32 Nevada Career Explorer deployment (2018), a comprehensive Nevada-first career information platform that connected the numerous occupational, education, training, and job search sources for easy navigation and search. This allowed every Nevadan with a library card to access the database, helping students, parents and job seekers make sense of the increasingly complex career environment and the job market. \"Workforce Recovery Partnership Project\" (2019) , a partnership between the Nevada State Library and CSN to pilot a 3D and virtual reality (VR) career exploration system mapped to an accelerated 12-week training program for Kidney Dialysis Technicians, an in-demand occupation that pays a living wage. The fully online program, previously only offered in the Las Vegas Metropolitan area, expanded access to this much-needed training across the state leveraging VR-technologies, thus providing alternative instruction modes to in-person laboratory classes. A 360 immersive video completely captured CSN's Dialysis Patient Care Technician (DPCT) program into a 3D virtual environment so that a potential student can take a field trip of a dialysis lab, shadow a dialysis tech, and, upon enrollment in the program, dive into figures within their textbook guided by their instructor, as well as work through their homework with a librarian, all in an XR environment. In these modules, students visualize reactions and processes while solving problems. The modules combine real-world context (dialysis), critical thinking, and some mathematics to develop quantitative reasoning. Curated for diagnostic healthcare, the 3D content helps cognitively anchor difficult science concepts, creating meaningful understanding of the job. The project drew nationwide attention, exemplified by the 2020 virtual visit of the American Library Association president as part of his nationwide tour. It has been this groundbreaking work which helped built the technological base and enabled Nevada to win the RWP-grant with its proposal of 'Project SANDI.' Under GOED and the Nevada State Library, leadership for major components of 'Project SANDI' will be able to reach vulnerable parts of Nevada's communities that have been adversely affected by the economic consequences of the pandemic. The Nevada State Library connects to 87 public libraries across the state, many operating in Nevada's most economically challenged communities. This grant leverages the wide geographical and demographic reach of Nevada's public library system, as well as the Nevada State Library's federal mandate to participate in workforce development. LEAP As the standard template for career pathway development in Nevada, LEAP integrates education, government and industry in a standardized process to ensure that workers have the skills they need to succeed in both the short - and long-term in the state. LEAP is designed to be a dynamic and responsive framework that consists of fully integrated, highly flexible pathways in which credit transfers seamlessly from high school to community college, and ultimately to a university. Each stage within the framework represents \"on and off ramps,\" thereby enabling a student to enter the workforce while offering opportunities to re-enter the pathway at a later date to take further advanced qualifications and degrees. As part of the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) grant, 'Project SANDI,' will contain the inclusion of interactive LEAP-frameworks on the Nevada Career Explorer, to help steer learners through career progression on manufacturing, Life Sciences and Advanced Information Communication Technologies (ICT) Pathways. Innovation Based Economic Development CONTINUED Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 33 PTAC THE NEVADA PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PTAC) helps for-profit Nevada businesses, especially the small businesses with goods and/or services to sell, pursue public sector or local, state, and federal government-related contracts (or prime contracts) and subcontracts in Nevada and across the United States. The PTAC team provides one-on-one counseling sessions to assist its clients. Counseling, in part, includes helping clients with solicitation document review and understanding, draft proposal review within a reasonable timeframe, and contract administration guidance. The PTAC also provides no-charge outreach events such as webinars whether led by the PTAC or by small business resource partners in Nevada. Since March 2020, the PTAC switched to a 100% virtual service model when counseling clients, conducting outreach events, and collaborating with resource partners. A subset of total PTAC clients has competed for and been awarded public sector contracts, which is vitally important during the recession the pandemic has caused. As relayed to the PTAC by a number of clients, and if it were not for public sector business, PTAC clients do not know how they would have survived and/or thrived during the Great Recession. The same holds true, even more so given the recession caused by the ongoing pandemic, and more businesses expanding their portfolios to sell to the public sector.The PTAC team provides one-on-one counseling sessions to assist its clients. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 34 Additionally, the Nevada PTAC team won the Outstanding Project Award in March 2020 from the Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (APTAC). Out of all award nominees, the team won the award for its ten-page checklist to help Nevada businesses mitigate contract risk when selling professional services on a fixed-price basis within the public sector. The award recognizes an accomplishment that stands out from the usual activities that all PTACs in every U.S. state and in some territories organize and undertake. The award is given for a project that benefits all APTAC members and/or serves as a model for other PTACs to emulate. The Nevada PTAC's proactive and innovative project to create a valuable resource that can be used by all, represents such an initiative, as officially stated by APTAC in a widely-distributed press release. The Nevada PTAC program has experienced year-over-year growth: For the program year ending July 31, 2020 (8/1/19-7/31/20): About 1,350 total clients A total of 51 outreach events either led by the PTAC or a small business resource partner A subset of the total clients was awarded a total of 1,572 prime contracts valued at a total of $272,615,252 A subset of the total clients was awarded a total of 94 subcontracts valued at a total of $40,087,039 For the program year ending July 31, 2019 (8/1/18-7/31/19): About 1,290 total clients A total of 54 outreach events either led by the PTAC or a small business resource partner A subset of the total clients was awarded a total of 1,111 prime contracts valued at a total of $135,146,747 A subset of the total clients was awarded a total of 40 subcontracts valued at a total of $9,715,110PTAC CONTINUED Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 35 Nevada Film Office Overview ESTABLISHED IN 1982, the Nevada Film Office attracts and facilitates the creation of content to gain attention to Nevada generating economic growth in our communities.

Authorized as part of the Housing and Community Development Act in 1974, the CDBG program allocates funding to the State of Nevada: the funds are allocated to cities with populations under 50,000 and counties under 200,000. This program is called the State and Small Cities Program - or the Non-Entitlement Program. Larger cities and counties, cities over 50,000 and counties over 200,000, receive funding directly from HUD through the CDBG Entitlement Program. The Governor's Office of Economic Development (GOED): Division of Rural Community & Economic Development administers the CDBG Non-Entitlement Program. Funds are allocated to small cities and counties to help develop communities by providing Nevadans with (1) suitable living environments, (2) decent housing and (3) economic opportunity for low- to moderate income individuals and households. All projects must meet one of three national program objectives: (1) benefit low-moderate income persons, (2) prevent or eliminate slum and blight or (3) meet current urgent community development needs. Annually, approximately $3.2 million is made available annually to 27 Non-Entitlement Eligible Entities. Each July 1st, a new grant year begins with submission of proposals for eligibility. Approved projects are developed into full proposals/applications, which are due mid-February. Applications in this competitive grant process are reviewed by external reviewers, when appropriate, and by the CDBG Advisory Committee. The CDBG Advisory Committee recommends funding for projects. Recommendations are sent to the Governor for final approval. Over the past five years, CDBG investments of $14,993,664 have contributed to the funding of 83 projects in rural ten cities and ten counties.

Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 46 Rural Economic & Community Development CONTINUED NEVADA OPPORTUNITY FUND In order to assist small businesses in obtaining the funds they need for growth and expansion, the state created the Nevada Opportunity Fund, administered by Bank of Nevada. In partnership with GOED, Bank of Nevada provides startups with business plans access to borrow up to $25,000. Existing small businesses can borrow up to $50,000 unsecured or $100,000 secured. In response to the pandemic, loans in the portfolio were given deferments on payments to November 2020 and interest rates were reduced. The program stopped funding new loans in June 2020 due to state budget shortfall.

The program provides collateral support to strengthens loans for Nevada businesses (makes a good loan better). There have been 28 CSP deals since the program's inception in 2012 for a total of $12 million. 27 deals have been in Las Vegas and 1 deal was in Elko.LOANDEMOGRAPHICS Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 47 Of the $12 million disbursed, $2.8 million remains outstanding with $9.3 million returned to date to support future CSP deals. The funds disbursed to the participating lending institution are placed into a bank account separate from the loan itself and the CSP funds are not used by the bank. The funds remain in the account and funds are returned to the State as the loan is paid off. In addition to the Federal funds awarded by the U.S. Treasury, this program generates revenue as follows: Filing Fees: GOED negotiates with each lending institution and charges a filing fee between 1% to 3% of the collateral amount that is paid when the loan is funded by the bank. Since the program's inception this funding source has generated $285,000 in revenue. Treasurer's Interest Distribution: The SSBCI budget account is an interest-bearing account that has earned $446,000 in interest since the program began. Bank Interest Earned: The collateral support funds placed in each deal's bank account earns a small percentage of the balance of the account. Since the program's inception this funding source has generated $46,000 in revenue. These funds are paid to the State when the loan is paid in full and the CSP bank account is closed. ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM FOR RURAL NEVADA With the goal of expanding the entrepreneurial ecosystem that has developed in Reno-Tahoe area, GOED led an effort to begin developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem in rural Nevada. This effort included supporting entrepreneurs with mentorship, access to capital, and networking opportunity. Through partnerships with existing business resources such as: Northern Nevada Development Authority, Great Basin College, StartUpNV, the Nevada Small Business Development Center, and Nevada Cooperative Extension; entrepreneurs were provided support in order to create a complete ecosystem of entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors resulting in successful business development across Nevada. The partnership started to bridge the Urban-Rural divide connecting a statewide business incubator program, StartUpNV, with entrepreneurs in rural Nevada to tap into the developing startup community in Reno-Tahoe. Over the past few years, the Reno area has seen a boom in entrepreneurship. Many large technology companies have moved to the Tahoe Reno Industrial Park and with it a spirit of entrepreneurship has increased in Nevada. The University of Nevada, Reno has supported this development through the Sontag Entrepreneurship Competition, The Innevation Center, and organizations such Entrepreneurs Assembly. The Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) hosted a Venture Conference in 2019 providing Angel investing training, and raised capital to launch the Reno Seed Fund. This fund invests in companies in early-stage, revenue generating, and some earlier and later-stage companies with significant operations in Northern Nevada.

Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 50International Trade Division STATE TRADE EXPANSION PROGRAM (STEP) The Competitive State Trade Expansion Program (STEP) is a federal trade and export initiative to make matching-fund awards to states to assist their small businesses with entering and succeeding in the international marketplace. The program is funded in part through a grant with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and administered by GOED International Trade Division (ID) on behalf of the state. GOED is proud of the relationship it has developed over the course of the last decade with the SBA, which has led to results that have made a remarkable impact on Nevada small businesses. GOED has won another $149,500 in grant funding in September 2020 for the implementation of a STEP 9 program to support Nevada companies in exporting their products and services internationally. Cumulatively during 2020, GOED was managing $557,414 under STEP 7, STEP 8, and STEP 9 grant awards. Since the inception of the program a decade ago, the amount of $1.7 million has been awarded to Nevada to help small businesses leverage global sales growth. On September 28, 2020 GOED ID joined the SBA in recognizing ten years of helping small businesses find global success with the assistance of STEP program. STEP is gaining momentum in Nevada and in 2020 GOED organized several marketing campaigns in partnership with the Department of Commerce, SBA Nevada District Office, Small Business Development Center, Nevada Industry Excellence, regional development authorities, chambers of commerce, and local authorities. Three rounds of application and evaluation procedures were conducted in collaboration with the Nevada Department of Business & Industry and U.S. Export Assistance Center, resulting in awarding 95 Nevada small businesses with a STEP grant. Our nation's small businesses have faced an unprecedented economic disruption due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The state took steps to reopen the economy and assist small, export ready businesses to overcome obstacles to exporting by providing grants to cover the costs associated with international trade. In order to facilitate global market success for exporting companies, grant rules have been adapted during these challenging times to include additional allowable activities and virtual service offerings. The program supports international marketing of products and campaigns, E-commerce activities, website design and development with international focus, export research tools, compliance testing of existing product for entry into an export market, shipping sample products, search engine optimization, participation in virtual foreign trade missions, virtual trade shows, virtual matchmaking services, export training workshops, and subscriptions to services provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Since the inception of the program a decade ago, the amount of $1.7 million has been awarded to Nevada to help small businesses leverage global sales growth.Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 51 A key to expanding any business is finding more customers and 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of the U.S. In 2019, Nevada exported almost $9 billion of Made-in-America goods to the world and by October 2020 the Silver State exported another $9 billion of goods worldwide. Annually, exports create over 50,000 jobs. In 2020, GOED successfully closed the STEP seven grant. This marked the first time ever since 2011 that we were able to expend federal funds with 100% rate, assisting 21 businesses, creating and retaining 268 jobs throughout the state. The grant supported market expansion of 12 companies and assisted nine new-to-export companies' entry into the global market. Out of this number, seven businesses self-certified as disadvantaged small business communities. Nevada small businesses generated $7.8 million in export sales, significantly exceeding projected sales and return on investment (ROI). We have seen the highest ROI to date, $51.80 in export sales was the result for every $1 that grant funding provided. Another grant under implementation - STEP 8 federal FY 19 is expected to create over $11 million in export sales and yield a 50-to-1 return on investment. This grant currently assists 49 Nevada companies, doubling the number of supported small businesses compared to the previous grant year. Predominant industry sectors among Nevada STEP clients are oriented around manufacturing, information technology, professional, scientific, and technical services, agriculture, and wholesale trade. STEP companies are focused on the European market (United Kingdom, Switzerland, Poland, Slovenia, Germany, Scandinavia), Canada, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Vietnam, China, Hong Kong, Argentina, Peru, and South Africa. GOED ID finalized conversations on extended collaboration with the SBA Office of International Trade in D.C. and agreed on a Referral Protocol that would sustain effective coordination and cooperation between GOED and the SBA in promoting and facilitating Nevada small business entry and/or expansion into global markets amidst and beyond pandemic with the goal to increase the value of small business exports by effectively connecting Nevada small businesses to appropriate resources to support increased competitiveness, global sales growth, and job creation. Nevada STEP program continues to succeed in providing the resources our small businesses need to increase their competitiveness and navigate selling of their goods and services to customers overseas. We look forward to supporting an even higher number of the Nevada entrepreneurs in reaching their global potential.

Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 78Nevada Climate Initiative AT THE END OF 2020 , the Nevada Climate Initiative, spearheaded by The Department of Conservation & Natural Resources and the Governor's Office of Energy, released its State Climate Strategy. https://climateaction.nv.gov/news/nevada-climate-initiative-releases-state-climate-strategy/ \"The Governor's Office of Economic Development has identified climate change as one of the most significant threats, and opportunities, facing the state's economy,\" said Michael Brown, Executive Director, Governor's Office of Economic Development. \"By employing strategic and targeted approaches to climate-resilient economic development, innovation, and workforce training, climate change action can generate more and better jobs, optimize educational and workforce pipelines, and improve the state's economic resilience.\" STATE CLIMATE STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS More than 75 percent of climate survey respondents in Nevada indicated they are 'very concerned' about climate change, with drought, wildfire, air quality, and extreme heat among the topics of greatest concern. The State Climate Strategy applies a robust framework for evaluating 17 climate mitigation policies against four key metrics: GHG emissions-reduction potential, climate justice, economic implications, and implementation feasibility. Low-income communities, people of color, and indigenous populations have disproportionately borne the burden of the impacts of climate change. Reconciling and addressing environmental justice concerns is a common thread throughout the State Climate Strategy. Climate action and economic development activities in Nevada are intrinsically linked and can be strategically integrated to achieve their respective goals. Nevada's 2019 greenhouse gas emissions inventory shows that, without climate action, the state will fall 4 percent short of the 2025 goal and 19 percent short of the 2030 emissions reductions goal. By meeting the state's emission reduction targets, Nevada would prevent between $172 and $786 million in economic damages by 2030 and up to $4 billion by 2050.More than 75 percent of climate survey respondents in Nevada indicated they are 'very concerned' about climate changeNevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 79 Given the complexities of climate change, multiple issues must be considered together to develop a catalog of climate-related policies, programs, and plans that are harmonized within and across different levels of governance and economic sectors. Establishing a robust climate governance structure with clear processes and related authorities to reduce emissions and manage the cascading impacts of climate change will position Nevada to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead. The Strategy was developed using the best available science, combined with robust input from thousands of Nevadans through a series of listening sessions on a range of climate topics, a statewide climate survey, discussions with local government leaders, and more. The Strategy is just the beginning of future climate action in Nevada. As a living document, the Strategy will be adapted and updated as the impacts of climate change Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 80Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience SRI International\u00ae The Future Beyond the Pandemic Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience Prepared by SRI International, in collaboration with RCG Economics and Brookings Mountain West NEVADA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT December 2020 Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 81 Authors This report was researched and written by Roland Stephen and J.R.

The plan is designed to address this challenge directly by providing a high-level agenda that will coordinate the acti ons of a broad set of partners, public and private. Over the last 10 years, Nevada has made significant strides in recovering from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, exceeding expectations and growing new industries that provide opportunities for all N evadans. This is in no small part due to the statewide economic development strategic plan released in 2011, Moving Nevada Forward: A Plan for Excellence in Economic Development , and the supporting 2011 assessment by Brookings Institution and SR I International entitled Unify . Regionalize. Diversify: An Economic Development Agenda for Nevada , both of which aimed to modernize the state's approach to economic development and lift it out of the Great Recession. Under the direction of this plan and the leadership of the Governor's Office of Economic Development ( GOED ), Nevada has made significant pro gress in diversifying its economy. However, the COVID- 19 pandemic has put a n extraordinary strain on public health and economic systems, in Neva da and around the world, and brought about another r ecession. Once again, Nevada is uniquely exposed. The state's economy is historically procyclical, and the impact of the pandemic on travel and hospitality worsens this exposure. While recommendations for social distancing and stay-at -home orders have bee n highly effective at limiting the spread of the virus and saving lives, the impact on consumer spending has been severe. In particular, the leisure and hospitality industries have experienced unprecedented contraction, with most resorts and venues closed for many weeks, and workers facing prolonged uncertainty. The reality is that some of Nevada's workers will not return to the same job that they had before the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014either because of business closure, lack of customers, or drop in demand for certain industries. S mall- and medium-siz ed businesses have been especially hard hit, and their losses will delay a strong recovery. On the other hand, other industry sectors will see growth as Nevada and the nation recover from the economic impact. Econom ic activity over the next 18 to 24 months will require close collaboration between the state' s employers and state and local government to ensure that the gradual lifting of pandemic restrictions does not lead to an uncontrolled increase in COVID- 19 cases. In addition, state and local leaders must understand the challenges the state will face in the medium term. As with the Great Recession, consumer confidence \u2014which sustains travel, hospitality, and entertainment \u2014will be slow to return no matter what political leaders say. Fostering this confidence will require a visible change in business practice s. In order to support this reopening, GOED will work with stakeholders, elected officials, business organizations, workers, and employers to target immediate reco very and long -term resilience. As Nevada 's leaders begin to reopen the state's economy, GOED' s actions should serve the immediate needs of business in order to accelerate the reopening in line with the public health response. At the same time, GOED will start to map key changes for the future for which business will need to be prepared. Nevada needs an economic Dunkirk: Economic d evelopment initiatives and workforce programs must rescue businesses and workers immediately by mobilizing all available state and private sector resources. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 101 SRI International\u00ae 3 In short, GOED will target iimmmmeeddiiaattee rreeccoovveerryy and lloonngg--tteerrmm rreessiilliieennccee. This plan, along with immediate and long -term efforts to recover and reimagine Nevada's economy, wil l be completed through collaborative efforts between state and local leaders, stakeholders from the business community, higher education, and workers. Importantly, with an ongoing pandemic, there can be no \"return to normal\" or economic recovery without a public health recovery. Immediate Recovery The reopening will be driven by the reasonable urgency of businesses trying to get back on their feet. A variety of coordination, information, and leadership challenges are be ing addressed to make it as fast and smooth as possible, and GOED has a critical role to play in meeting these challenges. Long -Term Resilience Once reopening has occurred, the \"new normal\" will be different. State and local government has a special responsibility to support business under these changed conditions, as well as a responsibility to design and pursue policies that set Nevada apart for the medium term. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 102Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 4 Economic Forecast The plan that follows is grounded in a high-level 12- to 24-month economic and fiscal analysis and projection for the state of Nevada and its two metropolitan statistical areas (M SAs) based on three economic/fiscal scenarios and projections: B est, Most Likely, and Worst C ase. (Tables depicting these projections not included below are made available in Appendix D ). Several datasets were utilized to generate the model's results, incl uding: Total employment Initial unemployment claims Visitor volume Taxable retail sales U-3 (headline) unemployment rate and workforce participation rate Sales and use tax collections Aggregation of other relevant tax revenues Results In this section, RCG Economics presents and discusses its forecast results for th is study's selected indicators.

The indicators discussed in this section relate to: Gross domestic product (GDP) Employment Unemployment Visitor volume Taxable sales Property tax Gaming tax Room tax Sales & use tax Consolidated tax Modified business tax Marijuana excise taxes RCG has developed three forecast scenarios for each indicator. They are listed below, based on RCG's research. Additionally, the study discusses and compares the forec ast results against a no - pandemic scenario \u2014a hypothetical forecast that assumes that the COVID-19 pandemic did not occur: No Pandemic Worst Case Most Likely C ase Best Case GDP Total drop is not surprising considering that Nevada has been hit hard by the pandemic compared to most other states because of its largely tourism -driven economy,1 especially the Las Vegas MSA. The s tatewide economic lockdo wn in the early months of the pandemic especially affected the tourism industry (about 23 % of the state's economy2). Seasonally adjusted jobs in the industry dropped by 43% , or by 152,800 jobs from 356,400 to 203,600, between April 2019 and April 2020 as result of the lockdown that began on March 17. By June, the industry had regained 90,200 of the jobs lost in April.

The dotted dark blue line provides the results o f the authors' no -pandemic scenario, a forecast that assumes that the pandemic had never occurred. The dotted light blue line provides the results from the study's M ost Likely case scenario, the most likely outcome based on the authors' research. The dotte d green line represents the Best -Case scenario. In this case, the factors included in the model generally see relatively optimistic outcomes. The dotted red line shows the Worst -Case scenario, in which the model's factors were given relatively poor outcome s. Data in parentheses represent the forecasted change in GDP from the expected GDP under the no -pandemic scenario in Q4 2021. Forecasted GDP change by sector can be found the Worst C ase, it is project ed that Nevada GDP could fall t o as low as $162.0 billion, similar to the state's GDP in Q 2 2017. This represents a 13.2 % loss in GDP compared to the no-pandemic scenario. Such a drop in GDP would significantly impact the state's economy. It would potentially take years, possibly a deca de3 or more, for the economy to return to its pre-pandemic growth path. On the other hand, the Best-Case scenario projects that the pandemic does not ravage the state's economy. In this scenario, state GDP in Q4 2021 is projected to be $185.0 billion, or only 0.9% below the no-pandemic scenario. In this case, Nevada's economy would be able to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in a relatively short period of time. For the Best-Case scenario to actually occur, Nevada (like other states) would require the fe deral government to provide an additional tranche of virus-related financial relief, including continued and substantive unemployment benefits to workers, direct aid to states and local governments, ActualMost Likely (-4.83%)Best Case 2020 2021Nevada GDP (in billions)Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 105 7 additional paycheck protection program dollars to small b usinesses and, at some point, large- scale infrastructure investments.4 This would require the federal government to add several trillion dollars to the national debt but would likely protect the U.S. economy from a continued free-fall5 and accelerate its recovery6 from possibly decades to a few years. Such a scenario would also require the severity of COVID -19 in Fall and Winter 2020 to remain constant relative to the summer months. This will allow governments to continue to reopen the economy more fully an d safely and lessen consumer fears and uncertainty about leaving their homes and self-quarantining. However, based on the experiences of New England in early-2020 and southern Brazil in mid-2020, this is not a given. The Worst-C ase scenario for the state a ssumes a series of negative events to happen. First, COVID- 19 hospitalizations and deaths in the state would increase, such that the Las Vegas metropolitan area would potentially look like New York City in March 2020: almost overwhelmed by infections. This would likely trigger a second lockdown. It is suspected that this would also heighten fears relative to COVID-19 and lead to higher levels of sheltering in place, compounding the effects of a potential lockdown. The Worst-C ase scenario also assumes a cont inued deadlock on Capitol Hill and no further enhanced federal unemployment insurance benefits to workers. The continued absence of these benefits would represent a significant loss of personal income and, therefore, potential G DP.7 On the positive side, a potential political stalemate of this order would be unlikely \u2014even in an election year \u2014should COVID -19 deaths spike nationwide. Other factors, such as the Paycheck Protection Program, were included in the scenario assumptions and are described in greater detail in the Methodology section. In the M ost Likely scenario, it is assumed that Q4 2020 will experience a minor surge in COVID- 19 deaths. In this case, Nevada will probably return to Governor Sisolak's Phase 1 guidelines for three months but not experience a full lockdown, also referred to as Phase 0. It is assume d that the preference by a large share of Nevada residents to shelter in place will remain relatively unchanged compared to Summer 2020 levels and will again decline further in Spring 2021. This also assumes that the COVID -19 vaccine will be widely manufactured and distributed at an affordable price by the middle of 2021. Should the M ost Likely scenario evolve , the economic forecast for Nevada will look a lot more like the B est-Case scenario than the Worst-C ase scenario. Forecasts for the M SAs have not been included in this analysis because the Nevada sub-state data for the most recent year appear to have problems. The Reno-Sparks MSA shows negative growth, which does not appear accurate. Accordin g to GOED, the issue stemmed from certain accounts being recorded as located in the Las Vegas MSA, while the activity actually took place in the Reno-Sparks MSA. 8 Sector GDP In terms of GDP by sector, a range of various outcomes w as found that can be seen in the following tables . Accommodation and Food Services shows the widest possible range of outcomes at the end of 2021, from 3.2% less than the No-Pandemic scenario in the Best Case to 37.3% less in the Worst Case. The Most Likely scenario shows a 1 5.7% change. Table 1 provides the forecasted change for selected sectors of Nevada's economy based upon the expected growth under the No -Pandemic scenario. As can be seen, though Accommodation and Food Services experiences the largest variation in possible outcomes, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, which represents a significant portion of Nevada's economy, also demonstrates high levels of variation between the best and worst cases.

Statewide, the Worst-Case forecast shows a dro p in taxable sales of about 18% , worse than the drop in Washoe County (3.6%) but not as severe as the drop in Clark County (25.4%). In the Most Likely scenario, however, the drops are much less severe for Nevada (6.6%), Clark County ( 10.1% ), and Washoe County (1.4%), though still notable, particularly for Clark County. In the Best Case, neither Nevada, Clark County, nor Washoe County experience a drop in taxable sales greater than 2.1%.

In this case, the Las V egas MSA would fare worse than the Reno-Sparks MSA in each case. In the Worst -Case scenario, the state would experience a 14.7% decline relative to the No-Pandemic case. The Las Vegas MSA would see an 18.0% drop and the Reno -Sparks MSA an 11.6% drop . In th e Most Likely scenario , the regions ranged from a drop of 4.4% to 7.0%.

However, the results still provide a reasonable look at the relative effects of the possible outcomes. While the No- Pandemic and Best -Case scenarios show extremely low unemployment rates of around 3.5% for Nevada , the Most Likely case shows that unemployment is expected to be about one to one and a half points higher (Figure 2). The Worst-Case unemployment rates range between 6.0% for the Reno - Sparks MSA to 15.1% for the Las Vegas MSA.

The Most Likely scenario sees a drop of 32.7%, while the Worst Case suggests a 71.5% drop. This is plausible considering that visitation dropped 99.0 % year -over -year in April during lockdown. Methodology In this section, medical and economic background information about COVID-19 is discussed. Certain biological traits of this virus directly affect the inputs of the e conomic analysis herein and are, therefore, important to be discussed in some detail. Novel Coronavirus and Economic Shutdown On December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown or igin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. 9 In March 2020, the WHO concluded that the rapidity and breadth of the spread of this disease constituted a global pandemic. 10 This disease is named CO VID-19 based on established naming conventions. It is caused by Severe Acut e Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus.11 As of July 2020, it appears that a newer, more virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 has replaced the original viru s and become the dominant strain circulating around the world.12 Following th e WHO's declaration of the pandemic, as well as the closure of several school districts across the country in the preceding days,13 the economic dominos immediately started falling. The result was an economic downturn without precedent in modern times.14 In the United States, the private sector initiated a series of events that quickly escalated into state-level shutdown orders. States all over the country began shutting down non-essential businesses. 15 On March 19, California became the first to issue a state wide shutdown order.16 In Nevada, on March 10 \u2014a day before the WHO's declaration\u2014 MGM Resorts International (MGM) announced that it would be shutting down their Strip buffets within days.17 A few days later, on March 15, MGM also announced that it would be shutting down all of its Las Vegas properties on Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 109 11 March 17.18 On March 17, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak announced the closure of all non- essential businesses, includi ng hotel -casino resorts.19 The Governor extended these closures and issued a stay -at-home orde r on April 1.20 A timeline of major governmental declarations relevant to Nevada COVID-19 policy, according to the Nevada Independent21 and Nevada Health Response22 as well as other sources where noted, is provided in the appendix. Information on SARS -CoV-2 There is building evidence that COVID-19 may be a vascular disease with respiratory symptoms rather than a respiratory disease.23 This helps explain why the disease can cause widespread blood clotting as well as damage in other parts of the body.24 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus is mainly spread via the exchange of contaminated respiratory droplets in close quar ters.25 Furthermore, the WHO has stated that the virus appears to be airborne, meaning that it can linger in small droplets over long periods and still infect people. 26 Additionally, Dr Roger Shapiro of the CDC and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said that the virus is easier to spread indoors than outdoors.27 Infections appear to be driven by p eople showing mild,28 unnoticed symptoms,29 which include the majority of those infected.30 Additionally, they may be contagious prior to showing symptoms.31 One major means of virus spread appears to be through \" super -spreader events.\" According to Scientific American, \"between 10 and 20% of infected people are responsible for 80% of the corona virus's spread.\"32 Mortality rates published thus far compare deaths to confirmed cases, but this does not produce precise measurements of real mortality rates because it is unknown how many people have actually been infected, as most cases are mild and do not require medical attention. However, it is clear that older people are at a vastly higher risk of death than younger people. The CDC reported that 8 out of 10 deaths related to COVID-19 occur in people aged 65 years and older. Additionally, the CDC has also found that the rate of hospitalizations of those aged 85+ is more than 150 times greater than for the least hospitalized age group, 5- to 17-year -olds . It is possi ble that recovery from COVID -19 only confers partial immunity or no immunity at all, meaning that someone can be re-infected with the disease after some period. 33,34 Additionally, there may be life-long complications from secondary effect s of COVID -19.35 Thes e possibilities have helped stoke fears regarding the virus, even given the apparent relatively low mortality rate.36 Despite, the low fatality risks, it is important to note that the coronavirus is still dangerous, especially to older people, in part because we know so little about it. What we do know, however, is that the COVID-19 pandemic is already the fourth deadliest event in U.S. history compared to wars and previous pandemics. These fears at an individual level can be understood by a well-known branch of economic theory. \"Cumulative prospect theory,\" predicts that people tend to overweight probabilities associated with unlikely negative outcomes. As a result , many people who face a small risk of death from COVID-19 assign a greater subjective assessment of their health risk. The same theory is applicable to financial risks as well, which helps to explain some of the backlash to the state-level shutdown orders. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 110Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 12 Mitigating the Outbreak Government Strategies The main goal of government policies thus far appears to be reducing or eliminating the spread of COVID-19 through public policy interventions until the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.37 However, whether the state can attain this goal is ques tionable. For example, contact tracing is a form of surveillance likely to face resistance in adoption. There are several methods of accomplishing this, but technology-based methods require residents to install an application on their phones. The app tracks all those who have c ome near another person with the app installed. When someone tests positive for a disease, the contact tracing app notifies any individual that came into proximity to that person. Ideally, persons notified will practice heightened social distancing for som e time and get teste d for the disease. However, contact tracing must be adopted by about 60% of a population to be effective. As of mid-April, the most -used contact tracing app is in Iceland and even they had only achieved a 40% adoption rate. 38 Additiona lly, the success of such a program relies on quick and accurate viral testing, which is not yet available.39 Policies of this kind will not be widely enacted before widespread vaccination becomes available. For this reason, RCG will assume that mitigation policies will have a v ery limited impact. Individual Actions Despite the difficulties in mitigating the effects of the virus on the economy, reducing the spread of the virus may be enabled by the widespread use of masks. Recent stud ies suggest that there is likely a connection between widespread use of masks and lower levels of virus spread.40 41 YouGov polling has found that countries with high rates of mask adoption generally are correlated with lower levels of spread. 42 In Asia, China, India, and Singapore all have mask adoption rates of over 80%, as do France, Italy, and Spain in Europe. Germany is slightly behind at over 60%. Unfortunately, wearing masks has become politicized in the United States.43 Nevertheless, the re may be change coming, President-elect Biden will encourage the wearing of masks for 100 days following his inauguration. Current State of the Pandemic The major determinants regarding the future economic situation in the United States and Nevada in the wake of the pandemic are COVID- 19 case load and deaths. Comparing the most recent data on infections and deaths across nations, states , and over time within the U nited States and Nevada Exaggerated fears of the risk to an individual's health, especiall y if generally shared across the country, will weigh heavily on the economy until widespread, effective vaccinations have occurred. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 111 13 better informs the assumptions within the model. This report offers used in the model that describe the Best-Case, Most Likely , and Worst-C ase outcomes relative to the Nevada economy. COVID -19 Statistics In this section, various statistics concerning COVID-19 are analyzed , comparing the United States to other nations as w ell as comparing Nevada to other states. A timeline of pandemic-related interventions and milestones can be found in Appendix B. A discussion of the pandemic's implications for Nevada's state and local economies within the model can be found in Appendix F. Among all countries, the United States is ranked eighth in cases per 100,000 as of August 31 . This is made worse when considering that five out of the top 10 nations are essentially high- dens ity city- states, such as Qatar, Bahrain , and San Marino. Since then, the virus has spread quickly and largely unimpeded. The U nited S tates also leads the world in total deaths. In terms of deaths per 100,000 persons, the United States was 11th globally. At the end of August, among high-population countries, the United States had the fourth highest death toll per 100,000 in the world, 56 deaths per 100,000. This rate compared poorly relative to countries like Germany (11 deaths per 100,000 persons), Japan (1.0) and South Korea (0.6), one of the fi rst countries hit by COVID -19. By any measure, the United States has done a poor job responding to the pandemic compared to other nations, and it has negatively affected the economy, according to officials at the Federal Reserve. 44 At the state -level, rela tive to case load, Nevada appear s to be middle- of-the-pack. However, as a state w ith a moderately -sized population, that does not convey much information. The states are better compared per 100,000 persons. In this case, caseloads in Nevada appear to be am ong the fastest growing, and Nevada is one of the worst -performing states overall as well . As of August , Nevada sits at ninth out of 52, including Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Regarding COVID -19-related deaths, at the end of August Nevada was 21st out of 52 states and territories in terms of deaths per 100,000, just in the upper ha lf of the rankings . The country's hardest hit region has been the Northeast. New Jersey and New York are the hardest hit states with Massachusetts and Connecticut ranking third and fourth . The first state outside of this region , Louisiana, was fifth . Gener ally, the data relative to the United States and Nevada indicate that as of August, the United States is doing a poor job of containing the pandemic compared to other countries, while at the state -level, Nevada is doing a mediocre job of containing the vir us compared to other states. However, luckily, despite the high rate of spread of the disease, Nevada has been thus far spared from a relatively high death toll. Additionally, there has been some evidence that people have been heeding mitigation advice. On e study showed that infection rates fell dramatically after an initial surge in regions all over the world. 45Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 112Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 14 Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience Priority Areas for Intervention The Future Beyond the Intervention The COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on Nevada's economy has required swift action by GOED and supporting organizations and agencies. At a high level, GOED has focused its interventions within five broad priority areas, which can be found below. Importantl y, GOED's response to the pandemic does not occur within a vacuum. Other state agencies, such as the Department of Business and Industry and local government organizations, provide support within these functional areas and, in some instances, lead their own interventions where relevant. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 113 15 Resources for People and Businesses Modernize Nevada's financ ial, technological, and administrative capabilities. Immediate recovery: GOED must actively support any Nevada agency that is part of the flow down of federal f unds. It will be necessary for all businesses, especially s mall- and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) , to receive guidance and advocacy assistance to secure the funding they need to keep employees on the roster. Capacity has been increased at the state's ca reer centers to help process individuals' unemployment claims. Gig workers and other independen t contractors (a significant population in Southern Nevada ) who can participate in programs that can be confusing. Direct support for SMEs through federal loan programs is also critical\u2014 an important lever for reducing the unequal economic impact of the crisis. Longer -term resilience: 31% of Nevadans are unbanked or underbanked, according to a 2017 FDIC report. Without a bank account, it is difficult for individuals to receive stimulus checks and other government assistance. In the medium term, there is a r ole for public action to build an appropriate financial infrastructure for workers that will help shelter them from future shocks. This could take a variet y of forms, including a one -stop public assistance program with digital accounts and mobile payments (TANF, WIC, unemployment payments, and other benefits could be integrated into one system). Success in this area is contingent on success with initiatives targeting connectivity and the digital divide, addressed below. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 114Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 16 Specific areas of interest for GOED and supporting organizations could include: 11 Update and integrate all state administrative and financial systems, including payment systems to residents such as UI, TANF, WIC, Medicaid, etc. (see below for longer-term initiatives in this policy area ). 22 Build a community banking network. Community banks were essential to the success of the PPP program. Community banks with $10 billion or less in assets made about 40 percent of the overall number and value of PPP loans. 33 Employ a \"Buy Nevada\" tactic i n which local purchases are steered toward local firms when possible. Business Support and Expansion Increase support for entrepreneurship and micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and investment in new technology applications. Review of target sectors, onshoring , foreign investment attraction, and export opportunities. Immediate recovery: While large corporate enterprises can develop protocols for operating within the context of the new normal, main street businesses (MSMEs) will need guidance on the protocols and practices required to operate under these new conditions. They will need guid ance on how to use open spaces, enforce social distancing, and expand onsite sanitary capabilities. This guidance will be accompanied by onsite training of incumbent workers. Longer -term resilience: GOED should take deliberate steps to attract greater lev els of foreign direct investment to Nevada, while supporting the emergence of export-oriented industries throughout the state. International trade and foreign direct investments drive Nevada's competitiveness, contribute to productivity growth, create jobs and exports, support R&D activities, and fuel innovation. International companies broaden the state's economy and make it more resilient, adding prosperity to workers and communities and investing in workforce training solutions across the state. Specific areas of interest for GOED and supporting organizations could include: 11 Open business recovery centers within the network of Nevada's Small Business Development Centers. (See the next section regarding new institutional arrangements in support of small business .) 22 Increase funding for technology -based entrepreneurship and provide targeted sup port for technology -based firms in automation and digital technologies. 33 Develop an ecosyste m that enables more entrepreneurship, commercialization, and new business creation , with renewed focus on digital arts and outdoor recreation. 44 Promote internat ional trade and export assistance programs to increase the number of exporters, new market exports, and global supply penetration , especially among rural and women -, veteran -, and minority -owned MSMEs. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 115 17 55 Identify gaps in support for minority - and woman -owned small businesses and opportunities to increase their establishment and growth. 66 Increase efforts to attract U.S. and foreign businesses to Nevada, particularly those in high-growth and technology -intensive industries. 77 Stream line and centralize th e oversight of Nevada's small businesses, with clear direction for ancillary support organizations in preserving, establishing, and expanding Nevada's businesses. Workforce for the New Normal and Beyond Full implementation and expansion of existing workforce initiatives. Immediate recovery: GOED should play a leadership role in the transformation of occupational licensing constraints in critical areas, including the recognition of qualifications from other sta tes. Based on real -time labor market data , GOED will support state colleges in recruiting and graduating students in areas of need. In spite of the general downturn, there will be sectors experiencing high demand that will need newly trained workers (incl uding sectors beyond health services). Longer -term resilience: In order to accelerate workforce adjustment and preparation in critical areas , GOED should support the design of compressed health services curricula and other curricula for skills in short supply. The entire workforce pipeline should be r eworked so that workers from hospitality can be fed into public health and other needed fields, with an emphasis on competencies and skills rather than formal credentials. Specific areas of interest for GOED and supporting organizations could include: 11 Radically expand health services programs at all levels. 22 Integrate workforce programs with business needs. 33 Allow community colleges to develop accelerated training pro grams for employers continuing or resuming operations. 44 Broaden training providers to reach disadvantaged populations and apply new technologies through the Nevada State Library by leveraging Nevada's Education Stabilization Fund -Reimagine Workforce Prep aration (ESF -RWP) grant. 55 Protect funding streams for in -demand and growing occupa tions' academic programs at Nevada's four -year institutions. 66 Accelerate the use of \"badges,\" competence bundling, and credit aggregation in building workforce skills. 77 Provide incentives to U.S. citizens who work remotely to relocate to Nevada, as wel l as for startup founders doing all o r most of their business online. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 116Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 18 New Technology Businesses Review and redesign Nevada's approach to retention and business development that provides wrap- around support to technology adoption by MSMEs. Immediate recovery: The state will identify the most appropriate technologies and formulate plans for deployment at an extraordinary scale by state and local government . It will provide guidance to Nevada businesses looking for reliable information on useful technologies. Longer -term resilience: If Nevada succeeds in mobilizing technologies at scale, it will have laid the groundwork for repositioning the state in the national and world marketplace. Consumers may be reluctant to travel at present, but the desire for recreation will endure. Nevada can be the recreational haven of the future, fortified by best-in -class measures in public health. Nevada's regional economic development authorities will continue to recruit companies to Nevada to strengthen the healthcare system. Specific areas of interest for GOED and supporting organizations could include: 11 Support the development of websites and e -commerce capabilities for MSMEs to expand opportunities for business-to -business and business-to -consumer e-commerce transaction s. 22 Aggregate and share vendor information for contactless and online payment systems. 33 Support the increased use of sensors and other technologies for security and safety. 44 Introduce and promote new digital instruments to enable exporting by Nevada' s MSMEs. 55 Foster connections and collaboration with local and international stakeholders to prioritize balanced long -term growth and sustainable economic development. Data and Integrated Planning for Decision-Making Nevada must complete the transition to smart government at the state and local level. Immediate recovery: Any decisions made on reopening Nevada's economy must be based on all available data and as part of integrated state -wide plans. Coordination, collection, and sharing data is a critical role for GOED. In particular, GOED will be responsible for integrating public health data with economic data and p roposed infrastructure initiatives with in a single state framework . This will enable GOED to provide reliable advice to Nevada's businesses an d workforce institutions . Longer -term resilience: Confidence in Nevada 's future economy will depend more than ever on complete, transparent information that integrates public health, economic , and workforce data. GOED will own this responsibility and become the one-stop data hub for the state with an emphasis on the credible communication of information regarding the health of the state's economy and society. In addition, GOED will give the Regional Development Authorities (RDA ) access to data from EMSI (see the bullet below). Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 117 19 Specific areas of interest for GOED and supporting organizations could include: 11 Integrate regional infrastructure initiatives within over all state financial and planning framework . 22 Provide access to real-time labor market Informa tion using EMSI data via Nevada's regional development authorities. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 118Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 20 Nevada at the Crossroads As the immediate actions contained in the recovery and resilience plan are implemented, state leaders must turn their attention to strategi c initiatives that ensure Nevada's economic and social resilience into the future. Whatever the timeline for recovery , both in public health and in the economy, Nevada must immediately begin pursu it of these strategies . Only in this way can the state ensur e a complete recov ery and shape its fut ure growth toward a more resilient and high-value future. Once again, the state is at a crossroads, especially Southern Nevada . After the Great Recession, new industries grew more quickly in the North and the South than the legacy sectors.

Source: EMSI and GOED. But diversification takes time. The two sidebars below discussing the changing economies of urban and rural Nevada demonstrate the progress that has been made in Northern, Southern, and rural Nevada . While Northern and rural Neva da are beginning to show signs of well-diversified regional economies, Southern Nevada began from a small base, and the present crisis came too soon for the benefits of any nascent diversification to be properly felt. These changes are not negated by the crisis but rather accelerated by it. As Figure 4 below indicates, advanced manufacturing, logistics, health services, clean tech, and information technology proved to be resilient when the downturn came and will be the foundation for the future. The strategies outlined below will underpin growth in these areas. This section is followed by a section on the imperative for building and modernizing the institutions and capabilities that will be necessary to secure the future of the state for the long run. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 120Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 22 Statewide Job Loss Remains Concentr ated in Nevada's Service Industries Figure 4: Nevada Job Change, by Industry, J uly 2019 to J uly 2020. Urban Nevada Figure 5 and Figure 6 below visualize the location quotient for selected industries and how they have changed between 2010 and 2019 in Northern and Southern Nevada, respectively. As shown , Northern Nevada has seen greater growth in new sectors, particularly Manufacturing and Logistics & Operations, that have worked to diversify the region's economy. In Southern Nevada , however, Tourism & Gaming continues to dominate the region's economy. While other sectors have grown over the last decade, they have yet to grow to resemble a significant portion of Southern Nevada's economy. This is likely a critical component of the comparatively lower impact of the pandemic recession in Northern Nevada than in Southern Nevada. However, the large number of i ndustries that fall into the \"emerging\" category demonstrate that the region show s promise for future diversification efforts. 800-800-1,300-1,900-2,100-6,900-7,800-8,300-26,800-27,000-56,600 -138,000 Mining and LoggingFinancial ActivitiesManufacturingConstructionInformationOther ServicesEducation and and HospitalityTotal Location Quotients (LQ) allow an area's distribution of employment by industry, o wnership, and size to be compared to the national average. If an LQ is equal to 1, then the industry has the same share of its area employment as it does in the nation. An LQ greater than 1 indicates an industry with a greater share of the local area employment than is the case nationwide. For example, Las Vegas will have an LQ greater than 1 in the Leisure and Hospitality industry because this industry makes up a larger share of the Las Vegas employment total than it does for the nation as a whole.

As shown , rural Nevada's economy is notably more diverse than Southern Nevada's economy, though it does remain dependent on industries that typically respond aggressively to economic shocks , particularly Tourism, Gaming, and Entertainment and Natural Resources. However, more stable industries, such as Logistics & Operations and Manufacturing, have begun emerging in the rural economy, providing greater and more consistent employment opportunities to those with post-high school training but perhaps less than a traditional four-year degree. Figure 8, however, shows just how much the mining industry has grown in rural Nevada. While the location quotient for most of rural Nevada's industries range from 0.0 to 2.0, the region's mining industry faces a location quotient of over 40.0, far outweighing the location quotien t of industries that have traditionally dominated Nevada's economy, such as Tourism, Gaming, and Entertainment , which has a location quotient of just 1.2 in rural Nevada.

Each of these states exchanges people, goods, and ideas with Nevada. Despite having a population of just over 3 million, Nevada sits at the center of a trade region that exceeds 53 million residents, a region that exceeds in both population and GDP such nations as South Korea (pop. 51.8 million) and Spain (pop 47.3 million). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Nevada's two largest metropolitan areas\u2014 Las Vegas MSA (pop. 2,266,715) and Reno -Sparks MSA (pop.475,642) \u2014join in the two largest urban complexes (or \"megapolitan areas\" 46) in the western half of the United States. Las Vegas is part of the \"Southwest Triangle megapolitan cluster,\" which includes Southern California and Arizona's \"Sun Corridor\" megapolitan area (Phoenix a nd Tucson) .47 Together these regions now contain about 34 million people and form the second most populous megapolitan cluster behind the \"Northeast Megalopolis. \" Reno lies at the eastern edge of the Sierra -Pacific megapolitan area, which include s the B ay Area and Sacramento metros. The Sierra -Pacific region includes about 13 million residents. Likewise, Elko, a micropolitan area with 54,463 residents in 2018, maintains extensive economic and trade relations with megapolitan areas in the Mountain West. Elko and much of eastern Nevada connect to the \"Wasatch Range\" (Salt Lake City) and \"Front Range\" (Denve r) megapolitan areas. By 2020, the regions together contained over seven million residents. Nevada is privileged in that its logistics, tourism, technology, and resources industries are embedded in the w estern United States \u2014 a geographically broad but exten sively urbanized and fast-growing region that maintains some of the most innovative and export-driven regional economies in the developed world.

Las Vegas falls within a sphere that extends from California 's Central Coast to the Mexican border with Arizona. Reno's economic sphere incorporates much of Northern California. Elko's shared economic space stretches across Utah to Colorado's Front Range. Each of Nevada's Regio ns Remains Well-Positioned to Megapolitan Areas Throughout the Western United States Figure 9: Nevada's Megapolitan Clusters. Source: Robert E. Lang and Jaewon Lim, Brookings Mountain West --UNLV, 2020. These megapolitan areas exh ibit an economic integration either approaching or equal to what the U.S. Census Bureau defines as \"combined statistical areas\" (or CSAs) . Being a CSA is significant in that it shows urban space has achieved high levels of economic integration centered on commuting patterns. Nevada is becoming more connected with its neighboring states via a myriad of economic functions. Tech transfers from the Bay Area to metro Reno have transformed Northern Nevada. Las Vegas shares a wide array of trade, patents, highway, air links, and now direct labor markets with California and Arizona. Gold mined in central Nevada is processed in Utah and often managed from Colorado. Nevada's most important economic opportunities lie in deepening its ties to adjacent megapolitan areas. The state can induce both corporate relocation and skilled labor migration from the greater Southwest. Nevada maintains lower costs, less regulation, and less tax burden, especially when compared to California. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 125 27 Even before the pandemic, technology allowed an increasing share of workers to live in one region while performing jobs in other metropolitan areas. Distance commuting, beginning in many tech and sales sectors, made megapolitan geography possible. Flexible workspaces, where an employee needs to physically be present at a common job location once a week, or even onc e a month, allowed workers to commute from 50 or more miles away from their actual office. This is especially true for many gig-economy jobs in tech, media, and R&D -intensive sectors. Neva da, linking to and lying between the largest megapolitan areas in the West, is well positioned to benefit from an explosion in distance commuting as virtual workspaces become the norm following COVID-19. Consider that a tech worker in Silicon Valley can now live at Lake Tahoe and still check in at the \"office\" every day. Perhaps such a worker need s to attend a sales or all -staff meeting every few weeks and thus cannot simply move to Alaska or Hawaii. Northern Nevada is a lower cost, less congested alternati ve to the Bay Area, but m aintains highway and air connections back to California so that one can physically be present in San Jose or San Francisco on any given day. Likewise, Southern Nevada maintains extensive surface and air links to California and offe rs commuters large, ameni ty-rich master -planned communities. Given Nevada's urban geography, which connects the state to large -scale metropolitan systems in California and Arizona, surface transportation improvements between Las Vegas and Reno have a lower priority from the point of view of the workforce. The value from improving this connection is related to the completion of an integrated logistics network across the region, which will involve rail links rather than road and/or air (the complete rail right-of -way is still available). When it comes to the workforce, Nevada must double down on accessing California and Arizona, and in the case of Elko, the Mountain West and Northwest Megapolitan areas. Visionary Strategies Strategic initiatives to ensure medi um-term prosperity have been organized into the following five categories and are discussed in the relevant sections below: Regionally Designed Industrial Clusters Statewide Integration and Connectivity Technology-Driven Development Responsible and Sustainable Growth Comprehensive Placemaking Regionally Designed Industrial Clusters The impact of the Great Recession on Nevada's economy alerted state policymakers to the need for economic diversification. Prior to the economic crisis, Nevada's primary urban ar eas may have been classified as \"company towns,\" where local economies were ov erdependent upon a few employers in a single industry for economic growth. The policy response following the Great Recession called for a state -led pursuance of key industries on which Nevada could capitalize for new, stable growth. Growth in new and emerging industries has been notable, with advanced manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and healthcare emerging as strong contenders in Nevada's economy. The economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic has once again drawn attention to the need for economic diversification. Developments in the world economy, such as the push for more localized production and value chains, represent opportunities for Nevada. Businesses wi ll push for Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 126Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 28 proximate, smart supplier networks. Given its close location to the West Coast, this new imperative will drive new investment toward the state. This investment will tend to be technology- and skill - intensive, paying good wages to a properly prepared workforce. In order to make the most of these opportunities and build o n Nevada's unique geographical advantages, the recommendations below include a variety of necessary infrastructure investments. None can be done in a day or in a week, but even ambitious infrastructure programs will help the state quickly recover from the crisis, as well as lay the foundations for a new, resilient, economy in the future. The impact of this crisis will be felt for many months, perhaps several years. Furthermore, there will be no return to the world as it was in February 2020. Business travel and business meetings are now based on a wholly new technological infrastructure. Consumers' attitudes regarding entertainment and recreation have undergone a significant shift. The structure of the workplace has changed forever for millions of white-coll ar workers. Design New Approaches to Cluster Identification and Development Economic diversification has evolved differently in Nevada's various regions. In Northern Nevada , gaming, tourism, and hospitality gave way more completely to new industries following the Great Recession, particularly advanced manufacturing. In Southern Nevada , the dominance of the leisure sector is more pronounced, but the local economy has seen the emergence of data centers and logistics and transportation as promising avenues for future growth, among others. This growth will be accelerated by the present crisis. Southern Nevada is at the same fork in the road faced by Northern Nevada ten years ago. Its future will remain distinctive, and the legacy sectors of hospitality and entertainment will remain strong \u2014Vegas will remain Vegas. But the region needs accelerated growth in other areas \u2014including health services, logistics, and clean tech \u2014alongside this world -class entertainment cluster if the region is to be diverse, prosperous, and resilient in the future. The capabilities of Nevada's regional development authorities (RDAs) have been made clear in recent years and represent a valuable resource for fu ture diversification efforts. As RDA staff are embedded in their local communities, RDAs are well-positioned to identify and pursue promising industries for their respective regional economies. There remains a role for GOED to ensure the RDAs pursue a unif ied approach to diversification and that competing priorities are minimized. Likewise, at the state level, attention should be focused on integrating regional cluster strategies with a high-level economic diversification strategic plan that enables Nevada' s regions to establish, grow, and mature industries that diversify the state's economy. Specific areas of PPllaannss.. Enabl e RDAs to use their extensive knowledge of local capabilities to devise locally relevant clusters as part of a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that represent unique paths to economic success for each region. Integrate into Regional and Global Value Chains The global economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the production and distribution of critical goods. In the first several weeks of the pandemic, supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) were very low, threatening the ability of front -line workers to address local outbreaks of the disease. While the private sector has mobilized to produce many of these necessities in the short-term, the disruption of supply chains has urged state and national governments to regionalize, rather than globalize, the production of many goods. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 127 29 The \"reshoring\" of production to the United States presents Nevada with the opportunity to grow its nascent advanced manufacturing sector while integrating further into the regional economy of the western United States. The low cost of doing business in the state makes it an attractive destination for manufacturers who want to invest and produce in the United States and export globally but do not want to pay the typical cost of doing business on the West Coast. Likewise, Nevada remains an attractive destination for the \"next -shoring\" of the technology -intensive industries that comprise Industry 4.0. Nevada's proximity to major urban areas with large consumer populations throughout the western United States increases its attractiveness for advanced and technology manufacturing.

Enable Further Diversification of So uthern Nevada's Economy The leisure and hospitality industry continue to be prominent throughout Southern Nevada . The 2011 Brookings/SRI report identified opportunities for Las Vegas to diversify within this tourism core in areas such as live entertainment and e -sports. Beyond t his foundation the region has also attracted other medium- and high -tech industries and sectors with potential for further development, notably logistics and advanced manufacturing. Future growth in these industries, however, is contingent upon the communities of Southern Nevada being able to meet the needs of employers in these industries. Considerable work continues to be done at the state and local level on workforce development, but there remains a need for further industry -specific infrastructure development throughout Southern Nevada. Industries such as logistics and advanced manufacturing require medium- and large -scale infrastructure assets to establish a presence and grow. Developments like the APEX Industrial Park in northern Clark County have significantly expanded the region's capacity for manufacturing and logistics, and at least one study fo und the industrial park capable of creating around 20,000 direct jobs and up to 56,000 induced jobs throughout Southern Nevada. However, the same report found that adequate infrastructure remains a challenge for growth at APEX, and the lack of integrated transport options for employees and goods limits the opportunities for additional industrial development at the site. 48 Aside from the APEX Industrial Park in northern Clark County, there remains opportunity for additional development in other areas of Southern Nevada, where logistics and advanced manufacturing may be developed concurrently and capitalized on for regional growth. Areas of southern Clark County have received increased levels of interest for numerous projects, including the Meeting the needs of new industry clusters requires a suitable workforce and an enabling environment for going to scale. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 128Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 30 proposed second airport for the Las Vegas metro area, a manufacturing and business park, and other mixed- use developments. The establishme nt of an advanced manufacturing park and smart logistics hub in southern Clark County would contribute to the long-term visi on for this area of Southern Nevada and position the region as a major producer and distributor of goods in the western United State s. Southern Nevada also demonstrates significant potential for next-generation transportation services . In recent years, the Boring Company and Virgin's Hyperloop have established a presence in the region to test and, in the case of the Boring Company, deploy innovative transportation technologies. The high development and deployment costs associated with transportation infrastructure projects means that Southern Nevada currently holds a distinct competitive advantage over other regions of the United States because the region has already demonstrated an ability to deploy these technologies in real-world settings. Capitalizing o n the region's first -mover advantage will enable Southern Nevada to establish itself as a world leader in the development of innovative transportation technologies.

Statewide Integration and Connectivity Nevada's geographic proximity to major western markets makes it a competitive destination for U.S. manufacturers. Likewise, the strong air connectivity between Reno-Sparks and Las Vegas and many domestic and international destinations has enable d the continued development of the state's leisure and hospitality industries. However, intrastate connectivity continues to be a challenge for Nevadan residents and businesses. While N orthern and Southern Nevada are well-connected to other urban markets throughout the West, there remains a notable dearth of infrastructure between Northern and Southern Nevada , in both the eastern and western portions of the state. The benefit of further infrastructure investment is twofold: increased rail and truck connecti vity bolsters Nevada's opportunity to serve as a major transit hub for the western United States, and the development of this infrastructure represents opportunities for short-, medium -, and long-term employment in construction and transportation industries. Additionally, increased roadway connections between northern and Southern Nevada provide a more afforda ble alternative for intrastate transportation to businesses and residents of these respective regions. This means that there exist tremendous opportun ities for employment today while making transformational infrastructure investments that will set Nevada on a new path in the future. F urther development of Nevada's infrastructur e assets will support the emergence and growth of new industries. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 129 31 Integrate a nd Expand Capabilities between Northern and Southern Nevada With the help of GOED and federal policies, No rthern and Southern Nevada have successfully capitalized on their respective strengths to develop new industries and sectors, such as Opportunity Zone s. However, a continued lack of connectivity between Nevada's principal urban areas , as well as between the large metro and micropolitan areas like Las Vegas and Elko, remains an obstacle for the state's economic diversification ambitions, particularly the growth of the transportation and logistics industry. Both regions have sought to develop this industry \u2014as well as others that are dependent upon strong regional and national connections, such as advanced manufacturing \u2014 independently, rather than through a coordinated approach. Likewise, the missing connections between the northern and southern portions of the state have contributed to the \"missing middle\" of western Nevada, where economic opportunity has remained a consistent barrier for many of the region' s residents. Connecting northern and Southern Nevada with one another and the communities that lay betwee n them is a necessity for the state's residents and businesses. Much work has been conducted to identify opportunities for roadway expansion between R eno-Sparks and Las Vegas. The Intermountain West Corridor Study was completed in 2014 to outline the exten sion of Interstate 11 (I-11) from southern Las Vegas to Phoenix, Arizona, and subsequent proposals have been made to extend the I -11 corridor north to Reno -Sparks, connecting Nevada's two primary urban areas and connecting Las Vegas with I-80. 49 Expansion of I-11 should be seen beyond passenger transportation but also as the major infrastructure investment in the emerging Southwest Triangle Megaregion (s ee Appendix A regarding Nevada's unique geographic advantages) , which is on the trajectory to be one of the most economically strong American regions (but it is the only one without the interstate system between two of three major metropolitan areas: Las V egas and Phoenix ; major freight movement is going through Texas and California omitting Las Vegas). Aside from highway expansion, opportunity exists for development of rail lines, both freight and passenger, that connect northern and Southern Nevada , as we ll as the rural a nd frontier communities of western Nevada. Establishing multi-modal facilities in the Reno-Sparks and Las Vegas metro areas would provide anchors for future freight and passenger roadways and railways and create opportunities for industria l development in underserved western Nevadan communities. In Northern Nevada , the creation of the Innovation Park at Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, led by Blockchains, LLC, represents an opportunity to centralize medium- and high -tech manufacturing in the R eno-Sparks area w hile increasing regional and national rail connectivity. This connectivity would allow the communities between Las Vegas and Reno-Sparks to participate in the development of Nevada's western frontier.

Expand Broadband Accessibility Access to high -speed, reliable broadband internet service is required for the \"digital prosperity\"50 of our economy, educational systems, healthcare services, and state and local governments . Nevada's leaders face an enormous challenge . Too few people and communities have access to quality broadband technology: \"If broadband is essential infrastructure, then regulation and public policy Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 130Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 32 should support every American community having equitable access to broadband and the skills necessary to use it.\"51 For rural communities, broadband may be the only viable solution to the delivery of healthcare and educati onal services. For instance, Pennsylvania launched a broadband initiative with a focus on rural communities, with Governor Wolf noting: \"The critical need for high -speed Internet has become clear in light of our efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, as more families work and learn from home, businesses operate o nline services and patients access medical care through telehealth.\"52 Broadband access often varies by income, race, and remoteness. In the case of Nevada, the \"Las Vegas-Henderson -Paradise MSA\" has the highest rank of broadband access in the Mountain Wes t. However, 13.7% of the area's population maintain low broadband subscription rates.53 Access in the state's rural communities remains limited by the physical absence of the networks needed t o support broadband. 54 Access to broadband is essential to remote education and distance learning. School leaders and elected officials are searching for resources to provide broadband access to those who need it. Even in the state's most urbanized coun ty, the Clark County School District (CCSD) estimates that as many as 40 % of students require assistance to gain adequate internet services. 55 To help address these challenges, Attorney General Aaron Ford recently announced the launch of T - Mobile 's \"Project 10 Million\" to offer broadband access for educational needs. The program provides \"qualifying student households with access to broadband products and internet services before the start of the 2020 -2021 school year.\"56 Technology-Driven Development Nevada has long been a place where industry-shaping technologies are unveiled to a global audience. In recent years, the state has pushed further, facilitating the deployment and scaling of new and emerging technologies, such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous vehicles, and demonstrating their applicability in re al-world scenarios. Since the Great Recession, Northern Nevada has managed to attract a number of high-profile technology companies, including Panasonic and Tesla, that have enabled economic diversification and provided new employment opportunities for reg ional residents. Southern Nevada has also attracted technology firms, such as Switch and Hyperloop One, that have worked to diversify the local economy. Other developments, such as the formulation of the water innovations research and commercialization org anization WaterStart, have established Nevada as a thought leader in certain growing technology fields. Work remains to be done, however, to place technology at the center of Nevada's eco nomy. While new technologies are used throughout Nevada's industries , Nevada has struggled to become a producer and developer of technologies. Recent progress has been made in Southern Nevada to enable the development of new and innovative technologies in the region's dominant industries\u2014 gaming, hospitality, and entertainm ent\u2014through the creation of industry-specific accelerators, like Black Fire Innovation. Expanding the opportunities for technology development and deployment in globally-critical sectors \u2014such as manufacturing, energy, and logistics \u2014will fortify Nevada's ec onomy and place it among key producers of technology. Investor and mentorship networks for technology -focused startups are relatively unde rdeveloped in Las Vegas compared to the other metr o areas in the country. The COVID-19 impact on co-working and other startup support organizations is high compared to other sectors of the economy , creating an even greater need to strengthen Nevada's startup ecosystem , in partnership with Nevadan Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 131 33 organizations like StartUpNV as well as external ones . A good example is t he Innovation District designation by the City of Las Vegas and the launch of the International Innovation Center (IIC). The International Innovation Center will be a hub for the development of new and emerging technologies (IoT, artificial intelligence, vir tual and augmented reality, cybersecurity, water science and advance mobile data) and house local and international startups and established companies. Establish Southern Nevada as a World Data Hub Since the Great Recession, Southern Nevada has successful ly attracted several firms to establish data centers in the region, most notably Switch and Google. Due to its climate conditions and the low risk for natural disasters, Southern Nevada remains one of the most competitive locations in the United States for data centers. Factors such as available land parcels, energy stability and availability, and the availability of a skilled workforce, are particularly important for the data sector. According to research by the industrial real estate firm CBRE, Southern N evada ranks competitively among other metropolitan areas for construction and land costs and is middle-of-the -road for labor costs.57 Data centers are a catalyst for a wide range of qualitative economic benefits and are attractive assets to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in related industries. Data centers and the wider digital ecosystem stimulate growth through knowledge spillovers. Tech -focused FDIs are also considered a major driver of knowledge spillover through labor mobility, market competition, and market transactions with local companies. Power costs in Las Vegas, however, remain above average for comparative metropolitan areas.58 One way to address the comparatively higher power costs in Southern Nevada is to increase the deployment of renewable ene rgy sources; a 2018 study by the Association for Computer Operations Management (AFCOM) found that nearly 42% of companies that use data centers had either already deployed renewable energy sources or were intending to do so in the next year. Of those comp anies investing in renewables alongside their data centers, 60% indicated that renewables would help the financial bottom line of the data centers. 59 The increasing attractiveness of Southern Nevada to technology companies, particularly those looking to est ablish data centers in the region, heightens the need for a qualified workforce that can meet the needs of these employers. A 2018 report by AFCOM identified the top job types that are needed for a strong data center workforce, including cloud, facilities, and center technicians; operations and controls engineers; and program managers. 60 Each of these career pathways requires highly technical training, much of which is done at the post-secondary level. To position itself for exponentially greater growth in the data center industry, Southern Nevada must pursue education and training programs in these fields at the Clark County School District (CCSD), as well as the region's two - and four -year higher education institutes. Building out 5G networks and closing other digital divides (like broadband access), Nevada can position itself as the \"Data Capital of the Mountain West.\" With the presence of Switch and Google taking a lead, Nevada can claim a leadership position in data storage and become a world-renowned cluster in that business category. 61 Specific areas include: FFaacciilliittaattee tthhee DDeeppllooyymmeenntt ooff RReenneewwaabblleess ffoorr IInndduussttrryy..

Recruit Automation and Digital Technologies Firms The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transition toward greater automation and digitization of many routine, and some non-routine, tasks. As these technologies mature beyond the laboratory, companies will be looking for opportunities to deploy their innovations in a real-world context. Nevada has demonstrated its openness to being a testbed for autonomous technologies; Reno - Sparks' metro region is home to UNR -led \"Living Lab\" for autonomous vehicle technologies, while Southern Nevada is host to the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems (NIAS) and is an FAA- designated proving ground for unmanned aerial systems, one of a handful in the United States. Such designations will be a valuable feature of the state for companies operating in this space. The rec ruitment of automation and digital technologies firms also builds upon the state's push to integrate advanced manufacturing capabilities into the economy. Advanced manufacturing requires cutting-edge equipment and systems, such as those produced by automat ion and digital technologies firms. Clustering the producers and users of these technologies together creates critical mass in the local economy and incentivizes other firms to relocate to the area. Specific areas upport the development of human and knowledge capital in the advanced manufacturing arena to accelerate the grow th of Nevada's advanced manufacturing industry. Enable Technology-Based Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship has been a key focus of Nevada's recovery from the Great Recession. According to the K auffman Foundation's Indicators of Entrepreneurship, in 2019 Nev ada ranked 15th out of all U.S. states and Washington, D.C. in the percent of population that started a new business, indicating the highly entrepreneurial spirit of Nevadans. However, the dat a also reveal that the rate at which Nevadans start new business es has steadily fallen since 2016 and remains well below 2012 levels. Slightly offsetting this decrease in the rate of new entrepreneurs is the increasing number of jobs created by the average Nevadan startup; since 2010, the average number of jobs created by a Nevadan startup has increased from roughly 4.8 to about 6.4, a 31% increase, ranking Nevada sixth in the United States for startup job creation. Likewise, an increasing share of startups in Nevada are formed by choice (82.62%), rather than necessity, though the state remains below the U.S. average and ranks 40 th overall.62 While the above data indicate that Nevada has proven adept at fostering entrepreneurship throughout the state, much o f the state's business creation activity remains concentrated i n retail and other service -oriented sectors. There is an important distinction to be made: though \"entrepreneurship\" may be interpreted as any new business creation, there is a difference betwe en \"small business entrepreneurship \" and \"startup entrepreneurship.\" Many newly formed retail and service-oriented businesses would likely be classified as small businesses rather than startups due to their primary focus on local markets and limited interest in scaling nationally or globally. Startups, however, intend to create a new industry or disrupt an existing industry, frequently on an Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 133 35 international scale. To do this, many startups spend significant capital on research for a new product or service, of ten not seeing positive revenue for years.63 Encouraging growth in technology-driven entrepreneurship calls for a more intentional approach to entrepreneurship-supportive policies. Due to their focus on developing new products or services, startups require access to knowledge capital and competencies wit hin certain technical domains. Outside of the software space, startups looking to develop new products or services can also be capital-intensive (e.g., in energy or transportation), requiring consistent acce ss to funding sources over longer stretches of time. Mentorship from successful startup founders, as well as venture capitalists, are also valuable resources for those looking to establish technology-intensive startups. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has ha d a negative impact on startups and small businesses. Globally, 41% of startups are threatened because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Nevad a is not exempt from that statistic. 64 The responsibility of preserving startup companies falls on governments and their willingness to mitigate the impacts through grants, loans, deferring costs, payroll support, and other measures to alleviate investment uncertainty. At the state and local level , it is important to understand the pain points faced by local technology entrepreneurs when forming and scaling their firms. State and local leaders have been effective at doing this for larger tech companies \u2014such as Apple, Tesla, and Google \u2014enabling the firms to establish a presence in northern and Southern Nevada . A diffe rent suite of policies and initiatives will be necessary for enabling technology entrepreneurs to sustain their success.

Responsible and Sustainable Growth Nevada has consistently demonstrated a dedication for embracing sustainability as it develops and diversifies its economy. Since March 2019, the state has been a signatory of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which commits the state to a reduction in greenhouse g as emissions of over 25% by 2025. Not only has the state looked to reduce its impact on the environment to mitigate its contribution to climate change, but Nevada has also viewed sustainability as an economic opportunity on which it Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 134Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 36 can capitalize. According to the U.S. Climate Alliance, member states created more than 133,000 jobs in clean energy between 2016 and 2019, bringing the total employment in clean energy in these states to more than 2.1 million. Of the 25 member states, Nevada experienced the mos t significant growth in clean energy jobs, witnessing a 45.5% increase in clean energy employment between 2016 and 2019. 65 Nevada is well-positioned to maintain growth in the clean and green economy. As electric vehicles become more commonplace throughout the world, and as renewables achieve further integration within national electric grids, the need for energy storage solutions will increase significantly. Nevada has the opportunity to place itself at the center of energy storage supply chains, in large p art due to its enormous reserves of lithium. There is also potential for Nevada to export its expertise in water conservation and management, for which the state has become internationally renowned. It will be critical for state and local agencies to facilitate the actions of key players in these areas so that utilities, transportation networks, and consumers can move rapidly tow ard a sustainable future. Lead the Global Development of Energy Storage Supply Chains Mining has long been a significant componen t of Nevada's economy, and the discovery of large lithium deposits in Northern and Central Nevada positions the state to be a global leader in lithium production. Lithium plays a critical role in many new and emerging technologies, especially those concerned with energy storage for electric vehicles and electric grids. The mining of lithium provides a catalyst for Nevada to devel op a new component of its mining industry that is intimately connected to the global value chains in technology development and production. Likewise, the processing of other critical materials and minerals beyond lithium that are key to U.S.-based technolo gy production and development would position Nevada well within the national security apparatus, securing the state as a key component of U.S. technology supremacy. Nevada is currently well-positioned for this transition. The opening of Tesla's Gigafactory in Northern Nevada served as a critical first step in realizing the state's role in global energy storage supply chains. How ever, despite Nevada's significant known and probable lithium reserves, Tesla is forced to import lithium from outside of the United States for inclusion in their batteries. 66 Development of Nevada's lithium sector not only closes a critical gap in Nevada' s energy storage production, but also enables Nevada to become a net exporter of lithium. In fact, the expected yield of Thacker Pas s, the region of Northern Nevada that is proposed for lithium mining, may potentially fulfill 25% of today's global demand f or lithium, once the proposed mining development reaches full capacity.67 Specific areas centralization of lithium procurement and refinement within th e state of operations to position the state as a key player in the global energy storage supply chain. Transition to a Low-Carbon, Low -Emission Economy Nevad a's Climate Strategy has committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of over 28 % by 2025 and net-zero (near zero) by 2050.68 The state has made progress on this goal through several recent developments, including widespread solar energy deployment and electric vehicle adoption. The state's energy provider, NV Energy, remains committed to further usage of renewable energy technologies and adopting a greater variety of renewable energy sources. It has partnered with higher education institutions throughout the state, providing million-dollar grants to the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 135 37 University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UN LV) to develop a geothermal studies program (UNR) and a renewable energy studies program with an emphasis on solar energy (UNLV). In recent years, NV Energy has also begun harnessing emerging technologies \u2014including drones \u2014to monitor Nevada's energy transmi ssion network and identify potential fire threats. In deploying renewable energy technologies in the state's ener gy infrastructure network, however, NV Energy has faced challenges. Before making an investment in renewable energy infrastructure, the propose d project is assessed by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) using a cost-of -service- based framework , which does not take into consideration many of the current values held by energy infrastructure stakeholders, such as reducing carbon emissions. However, PUCN is obligated to use the cost -of-service framework by historic public statutes, making it diffic ult for the regulator to assess proposed investments according to newer standards tied to green energy. A scorecard approach \u2014for example, one that examines the number of jobs created by a proposed project and the expected carbon reduction \u2014would better enable NV Energy to flexibly integrate renewables into the state's energy network.

Transition to Water -Wise Economy The climatic conditions to which Nevada has long been accustomed have required the state to be innovative in how it exploits its water resources. Local governments, particularly in Southern Nevada , have incentivized residents to forego the typical greenery that is common in many suburban developments in favor of drought -tolerant landscaping that is more typical of the state's mostly desert climate. Initia tives such as these have helped to increase the resiliency of Nevada's communities, while also creating new opportunities in the development of water conservation technologies. The foundation of WaterStart in 2013 served as a catalyst for the emergence of Nevada's water conservation expertise. Through the commercialization assistance provided by WaterStart, Nevada has attracted companies developing key technologies to conserve water resources. Scaling these technologies \u2014not only throughout the state, but a lso across the United States and internationally \u2014 represents a significan t opportunity for Nevada to achieve a water-wise economy and grow an economic sector that is sure to be in demand as the consequences of climate change are felt across the globe.

Comprehensive Placemaking Nevada has experienced some of the nation's most rapid population growth over the last decad e. While much of the growth is concentrated in the state's two major urban areas, Reno -Sparks and Las Vegas, the growing opportunity for remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic opens much of Nevada's frontier to a new class of digitally - and geographically connected worker. Workers that were once constrained to urban and suburban localities due to their proximity to business now have the opportunity to relocate to areas that a re more affordable and offer a better lifestyle. Nevada's connectivity, particula rly via air travel, and low cost of living make it a competitive destination for these workers. To fully capitalize on the new geographies for living and working brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, a clear understanding of Nevada's communities is nece ssary. Mapping the benefits and challenges of living in Nevada's communities will help determine where interventions are necessary to ensure Nevada can meet the needs of a vib rant, diverse population. Some pain points, such as healthcare access, have been identified previously and remain imperative, especially during a pandemic. Other areas of interest, like placemaking, are newer but comprise an integral component of defining what it means to be a community in Nevada. Remove Barriers to Healthcare Access across Nevada Timely access to quality healthcare has been a consistent obstacle for many Nevada residents that has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges' (AAMC) State Physician Workforce Data Repo rt, Nevada ranks 45 th in the nation for the number of active physicians per 100,000 residents. The data are worse for the number of active primary care physicians and active general surgeons in the state, where Nevada ranks 48 th and 50th, respectively. Aro und 27 % of Nevada's active physicians are international medical graduates, the eighth highest rate in the United States, indicating an intense need to recruit medical professi onals to the state.69 In Nevada's urban regions, a lower -than-average number of pr imary care physicians means that many Nevadans face long wait times when seeking medical care. In Nevada's rural communities, long wait times are compounded by a lack of local options, requiring residents to drive to more urbanized areas of the state for m edical procedures. While Nevada has struggled to d evelop home -grown healthcare talent , much progress has been made on this front in recent years, notably through the establishment of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) School of Medicine, as well as the formation of several nursing programs at the state's two - and four -year colleges. According to AAMC's data, of those physicians who completed their graduate medical edu cation (GME) in Nevada, about 55 % chose to practice in the state, ranking Nevada s ixth in the United States for graduate medical student retention. However, Nevada again ranks poorly (44 th in the nation) for the number of medical residents and fellows enrolled in accredited programs. Additionally, of all the active physicians in Nevada, slightly more (17 percent) received their GME in California, not Nevada (14 percent).70 As Nevada is clearly successful at Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 137 39 retaining physicians who complete their GME in Nevada, further expanding opportunities for medical students to complete their residencies in Nevada may better enable the state to grow its healthcare workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for an adequate healthcare workforce in the state's localities. It has also illuminated the need for a greater diversity of healthc are access points aside from physical healthcare facilities, encouraging medical professionals to meet patients where they are located. By minimizing the need for individuals to physically go to see a medical professional, Nevada can reduce the strain on t he state's healthcare industry and increase the total number of patients a physician can see. Telehealth has become an area for growth within the healthcare industry, enabling individuals to access medical expertise for non-emergency conditions from their homes. Assembly Bill 292 (2015) enabled greater development of telehealth services in Nevada, and the COVID -19 pandemic has necessitated a dramatic increase in the use of telemedicine. 71 Increasing the opportunity for telehealth throughout Nevada, particularly in the state's rural and frontier communities, requires investments in the state's digital infrastructure, especially broadband connectivity.

As the state has continued to attract new residents at a record pace, new construction of mostly single- family homes has risen to accommodate this growth. Home prices also rose as the state exited the recession. Accord ing to the Lied Center for Real Estate at UNLV, w hereas the average new single- family home in Southern Nevada sold for around $300,000 in June 2014, the price had risen 35% to $463,000 in June 2020. A similar trend has been observed in the Reno-Sparks area, where the average new single-family home price rose 40% from $325,900 to $546,670 between June 2014 and Jun e 2020.73 There has clearly been a sh ift in builder preference for more lucrative, high- end homes in Nevada's two primary urban areas. The increase in pricing of new single-family homes is further compounded by the increase in pricing of existing single-family homes during the same period \u201444% to $365,000 in Southern Nevada and 50% to $502,000 in Northern Nevada . Across-the -board increases in the price of home ownership contribute to the polarization of local housing markets, where median earners are faced with fewer affordable options and are forced to compete for a smaller amount of housing stock, which can drive prices further. It is important that Nevada's urban, suburban, and rural communities meet the needs of a socioeconomically diverse population. This may require a more comprehensive approach to zoning and planning in Nevada's communities, where residential, commercial, and retail spaces are co - located to enable further population growth without inundating existing transportation infrastructure. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 138Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 40 Likewise, ensuring that affordable housing options are integrated into future residential development plans allows for a greater diversity of individuals to engage in Nevada's communities. The situation for commercial property is especially challenging becau se of the shortage of sites of the ap propriate size. Indeed , a recent study sees land rather than water as the principal constraint on the development of Clark County in the years ahead. The region is projected to require about 14,100 acres of developable employment land to meet the needs of the expected economic and job growth by 2035. Given that only 9,100 acres are available that are optimal for development, there is the possibility of a 5,000-acre shortfall by 2035.74 Specific aggressively pursue changes to federal law to release additional space for development. Expand the O utdoor Recreation Economy The COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged individuals to engage with their local and regional outdoor amenities. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, this renewed attention in the American outdoors as a result of stay -at-home orders a nd restrictions on indoor entertainment is built upon a trend that has been growing in the United States since the late 1990s. On a national scale, outdoor recreation has grown to a $646 billion industry that directly employs more than six million people. 75 While the \"recreation economy\" has long been present in Nevada, COVID -19 has rei nvigorated interest in the state's outdoor assets. Prior to the pandemic, the Nevada outdoor recreation economy directly employed 87,000 workers, generating nearly $13 billion in consumer spending, $4 billion in wages and salaries, and over $1 billion in state and local tax revenue. 76 Nevada has taken steps to recognize the potential the outdoor recreation economy represents for the state, notably through the creation of the Nevada Division of Outdoor Recreation (NDOR) in 2019.77 Continued development of the state's outdoor recreation portfolio can increase the quality of life for residents of Nevada's urban areas by providing opportunities for outdoor exploration while increasing economic opportunity for residents of Nevada's rural communities. Housed within the Department of Conservation and Na tural Resources, NDOR will also ensure that the growth of this industry does not come at the expense of the health of Nevada's public lands. Specific areas recreation infrastructure planning and implementation with small business development in rural communities. Support Entrepreneurship in Digital Arts and E sports Entertainment has been an integral compone nt of Nevada's economy. As creative content has increasingly become digital and easier to consume without requiring individuals to travel to one particular destination , a shift toward becoming a hub for digital arts creation provides local creatives the op portunity to produce and share thei r works to a broader audience. Entrepreneurship in the digital arts goes beyond the creation of digitized art. Indeed, emerging areas like game design are also a significant area of growth in Nevada, especially in Southe rn Nevada . The emergence of esports as the new frontier in gaming and digital entertainment will allow for a new Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 139 41 class of digital artist. Access to resources, such as game design studios and equipment, will enable entrepreneurs in this space to hone their skills and develop industry -leading games in Nevada. The presence of the gaming industry throughout the state provides these entrepreneurs with a built-in test bed for their games and the potential to scale beyond the state. Specific areas o f interest include: CCrreeaattee p rovide the infrastructure necessary for digitizing the performing arts Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 140Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 42 Capabilities to Realize the Vision In order to realize the se strategi es for the future, Nevada will need to build or rebuild key financial and institutional capabilities and develop realistic statutory actions . The capacity of the state and its associated institutions is stretched to the limits by the current crisis. Nevada ns have preferred a low - capacity state government, dispersed over three cities. But Nevadans cannot prosper in the future without accepting the need to invest in real management and financial capabilities. This does not necessarily mean a large government, rather it calls for an effective government. To be effective, systems must be modernized, and institutions reformed. Such initiatives would include those listed below: Fully fund the state infrastructure bank. Establish a sovereign wealth fund. Reinvent a Knowledge Fund and build a network of innovation and evergreen venture funds. Establish a single state office in support of Micro-, Small-, and Medium -Enterprises (MSME) . Grow Nevada's community banking network Modernize Nevada's fragmented administrativ e systems . Redesign governance and funding mechanisms for the community college system , such as through the academic enterprise model. Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience Capabilities to Realize the Vision The Future Beyond the Pandemic Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 141 43 Fund the State Infrastructure Bank Nevada needs to make significant investments in infrastructure if it is to keep growin g its economy. However, the state's ability to raise money is more limited than that of most states; for example, Nevada's state constitution bans toll roads. In response to these challenges Nevada lawmakers pass ed AB 399. This measure, commonly known as t he \"infrastructure bank bill,\" created the framework for the Nevada State Infrastructure Bank in order to fund roads, bridges, and other projects across the state. Such an institution not only allows the state to mobilize its own ability to borrow but prov ides an institutional environment ready to respond to federal infrastructure initiatives. Such initiatives, although much talked about, have not yet materialized. However, as the scenarios laid out at the beginning of this report indicate, recovery from this crisis may take a long time. Capital will be cheap, labor will be available, and it will be vital to complete the capital projects discussed in the section above if the state's economy i s going to grow in new, more resilient directions. The first orde r of business in building Nevada's capabilities for the future is to capitalize the bank, which at present is an empty shell. This could be achieved in a variety of ways, but seed funding fr om the state employee's retirement plan could be a viable path (al though CARES act funding may also be a possibility if constraints on the use of that funding allow). Given the list of projects already identified across the state with a high ROI it would be easy to then obtain other investors in the bank. Establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) are often used to smooth out public-sector revenues by calling on savings obtained from taxing natural resources (mitigating the necessity of funding substantial rainy- day funds out of general fund revenues) . There are many examples of SWF s in the U nited States and around the world (see the list of U.S. states with sovereign wealth funds in Appendix C ). Some states obtain modest revenues, altho ugh they can be vital in a crisis. New Mexico was able to shore up many small businesses early in the present crisis by calling on its SWF. Other states can use them in transformational ways: The University of Texas benefits from a Permanent University Fun d that now exceeds $20 billion. Nevada has several possible source s of revenue from which to draw in order to fill the fund. More important at this stage is to set in place an institution that was truly independent and transparent (many models exist). Vote rs may have reservations about revenue that disappears into the ge neral fund. A sovereign wealth fund tasked by statute with supporting applied research for business and workforce development would increase the confidence of the voters that the revenues we re being invested in the state's future (a model could be the Gold en Leaf Foundation in North Carolina). Establish the Nevada Innovation Fund Nevada's Knowledge Fund has recorded some high -profile successes in innovation and entrepreneurship. However, Knowledge Fund investments to date have ma inly e stablish ed sustainable research infrastructures and conduits of access for private companies to Nevada's three main r esearch institutions. This approach has provided research services and a talent pool to industry and helped to support projects in obtain ing federal research grants (DARPA, NIH). However, a change d mindset is required at the universities. Such a fund is not best thought of as an opportunity to build capacity. It is an opportunity to fuel business-based innovation in partnership with universities. A Nevada Innovation Fund, a new vision in this space, would make investments Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 142Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 44 targeting tech commercialization, spin -out company formation, and monetization of IP from r esearch institutions; it would also support the growth of entrepreneurial ecosystems (up to and including direct support of tech companies). Such a fund could work in at least four ways: IInnnnoovvaattiioonn CCaappaacciittyy BBuuiillddiinngg: Grant funding for applied R&D infrastructure and projects at Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) (similar to Knowledge Fund projects). Em phasis on university/private industry partnerships, such as the Nevada Health and Bioscience Asset Corporation at UNLV. IInnnnoovvaattiioonn TTrraannssffeerr: Grant funding for technology transfer projects at NSHE and private companies through Small Business Innovation R esearch/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) matching program (Focus on Technology Readiness Level [TRL ] 3 - 6) IInnnnoovvaattiioonn AAcccceelleerraattiioonn: Grant funding to accelerate innovation for private early-stage Nevada tech companies to help them scale (best p ractice: USTAR TAP). Creat ion of acceleration and venture building programs through collaboration with outside organizat ions (e.g., Rainmaking - UNLV). Support for Entrepreneurial Service Organizations (ESOs) to include mentoring, networking, entrepreneurial training for private entity or university researcher. I Innnnoovvaattiioonn VVeennttuurreess SSeeeedd FFuunnddiinngg: Through non -profit Nevada Ba ttle Born Growth Escalator, Inc. (NBBGE). Assistance with creation of Independent Commercialization Entity to offer NSHE path to effecti ve formation of spin -out companies while providing investors with clarity of ownership structure. Equity-based investment to early -stage companies with high potential to scale (through NBBGEI). Focus should be on NIF/KF project linked spin- outs. Establish an Office for Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSME) within GOED Support for MSME is especially important for a state like Nevada. The state is home to an enterprising population known for pursu ing gig work alongside regular employment, lifes tyle entrepreneurship or businesses (in the arts and outdoor recreation), or opp ortunities available from family-run businesses (especially valuable to recent immigrants). In short, MSMEs are a source of economic dynamism and often an important step on the economic ladder for immigrants and other disadvantaged populations. However, responsibility for state policy towards MSME s is spread across three part s of state government: T he Department of Business & Industry (B&I ), GOED , and the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) through its Small Business Development Centers (SBDC). As a re sult, there is limited coordination and conflicting communication , with no single office or leader charge d with owning all of the issues of imp ortance to this sector. Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) is an example of the kind of initiative such an office could coordinate. F ive states \u2014 Delaware, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, and Oregon \u2014 have implemented this federal program that facilitates small-business start ups. S tates that opt in can pay dislocated workers a weekly SEA allowance \u2014the sam e amount that an individual would receive in unemployment benefits \u2014with the individual encouraged to work full-time on his or her new venture instead of seeking a job. SEA also supports a wrap-around infrastructure through which participating individuals receive entrepreneurial training, business counseling, and technical assistance.78 Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 143 45 In the last legislative s ession , the Lt. Governor proposed an Ombudsman in her office to trouble- shoot small business issues. This is a move in the right direction but could be amplified by moving the small b usiness function from B&I to GOED. With the Lt . Governor serving on the board of GOED, this could create a working group and point of contact for sm all business inside GOED, led by the Lt. Governor , that addressed the present fragmentation of policy. Grow Nevada's Community Banking Network Community banks were essential to the success of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the present crisis. It was designed in a way that made community banks integral to its success. $525 billion was distributed in the four months from April through August and Community banks with $10 billion or less in assets made about 40 percent of the overall number and v alue of PPP loans. But Nevada is grossly underserved by community banks, and as a result was relatively slow to benefit from the PPP .79 Community banks are small, but they play a big role in local economies. A community bank i s a bank which has specialized knowledge of their local community and their customers and base credit decisions on local knowledge and information obtained through long-term relationships. T hey receive deposits from sources within a town or city and lend that money to local businesses t o create balance within that economy. Because community banks consider history and reputation of their customers when making decisions, they invest themselves in their customer's succes s and offer assistance, training, and support beyond that of national institutions. Such banks can take many forms, both private and not-for -profit. Most are certified by the federal government and are eligible for government support (through the federal CDFI Fund) as well as private funding. Nevada's regional leaders should mobilize partnerships of key regional institution s in support of their formation. This will enrich the ecosystem in which MSMEs operate and help ensure their success. Modernize Public Policy and Governance Introduction As individuals, families, businesses, schools, and communities across Nevada work to recover from the public health and economic devastation brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, elected officials have an opportunity to enact a series of reforms to modernize state government. These effort s should address structural deficiencies in government operations and policy issues including workforce, economic development, and taxation. For example, the Nevada Governor's Office of Science, Innovation & Technology (OSIT) should be empowered to establi sh enterprise -wide information technology systems (comparable to initiatives in Utah and Colorado). It is a given that Nevada is behind in adapting technology for the delivery of government. By contrast, Arizona implemented a cloud -based management system that ends the \"reliance on paper, outdated procedures and decentralized management [that] can hamstring a state's ability to disperse and track funds.\" 80 The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that states must operate in a 21st century technological environment. State employees require basic infrastructure to perform their duties. Laptop computers without cameras are not a budget savings measure if state workers cannot participate effectively in virtual meetings. Requiring paper copies of standard forms, accepting fax copies but not pdf documents, and being unable to respond to email inquiries is unacceptable. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 144Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 46 Nevada's efforts to manage federal stimulus funds, to administer healthca re and social services (most notably unemployment insurance), and to conduct legislative operations during the summer 2020 legislative special sessions demonstrate that relying on antiquated technology and outdated policies and procedures fail to serve the state. Federal Funds The state faces a period of austerity in its finance syst em, making it critical for state agencies to become more sophisticated in secur ing federal funds to support important services and ongoing policy priorities. Budget and policy decisions should be strategic and not reactionary to fiscal deficits. Where cuts need to be made , it must be done in a way that ensure s the state does not lose matching federal funds. Nevada has re cently taken steps to improve its acquisition and management of federal grants. When the state fails to pursue federal resources, the funds are distributed to other regions, placing Nevada further behind its peers. Local and state leaders across the natio n are accessing federal programs and developing public- private partnerships to bring resources to their communities. The Brookings Institut ion highlighted a sampling of innovative programs that engage idle restaurants, explore online job recruiting tools, including new \"apps,\" apply federal grants and public -private partnerships to help small businesses, and champion racial and social equity measures among others.81 Boards and Commissions Nevada relies on boards and commissions with statewide responsibiliti es to oversee many government and economic sectors. Despite their importance, these bodies often do not reflect the state's current populati on distribution and operate with antiquated charges that reflect a smaller, more homogenous, and rural -oriented state. For example, b ased upon an executive branch audit, Governor Sisolak's administration found that many of the state's occupational boards were misaligned and underperforming. Utah and Colorado have created a division of occupational licensing within thei r departments of commerce, a model suitable for B&I to follow . One benefit is easing the transfer of credentials for trailing spouses, often an obstacle to recruiting professionals to Nevada where both partners work . This suggests that these boards and com missions require additional reforms and greater oversight to improve performance and representation. Two recently created boards and commissions demonstrate state government adapting to changes in economic and social needs. The Cannabis Compliance Board focuses on marijuana policy and regulation in a manner similar to Nevada's Gaming Control Board. 82 The Patient Protection Commission recently voted to focus its work \"on healthcare issues facing the state, including workforce development, COVID-19 response, and telehealth.\"83 The body is even authorized to bring bill drafts directly to the legislature. These two new entities can serve as models for a review and modernization of existing Nevada boards and commissions. Such a review may identify and recommend the creation, dissolution, or merging of existing boards or commissions. Taxation Nevada's system of tax and finance rest s on a narrow base , in particular on a single industry, tourism. This leaves the larger Nevada economy vulnerable to economic disruptions, such as the downturn brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first three months of the pandemic, Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 145 47 Nevada lost 250,000 jobs. In April 2020 al one, visitation dropped 97.3%.84 To this end, a Legislative Study Commission or similar body could explore alternative revenue sources designed to broaden the tax base in order to limit volatility in revenues and ensure that the base tracks fut ure change in the economy . Another element to consider in the state's system of taxation is to draw on regional economic activity to support local services and infrastructure investments. The concept of regional taxes is not new. In Nevada, any consideration of regional taxes must reflect the state's economic geography. Mining, to a large extent, takes place in rural Nevada, while gaming and live entertainment concentrate in Southern Nevada . The introduction of legalized cannabis generated new state and local tax revenue and also raised conversations about its geographic allocation. Mining is treated as a regional tax, with a portion of revenues reserved for the localities where the resource is located. A similar carve out of the live entertainment tax to support local services and infrastructure, reflecting the concentration of industry and associated costs, would parallel the current tax arrangement for mining in rural Nevada. Reinvent Nevada's Workforce Institutions The sections below highlight governance, funding, and workforce development as it relates to the state's higher education sy stem. Options ar e considered for reforms to integrate innovation and workforce assets to help grow and diversify the state's economy. Governance and Administration for Wor kforce Institutions Nevada's regional institutions need active, locally recruited advisory boards wi th representation from sector industries that are within the campuses' service areas. These boards will be able to work directly with leadership to develop and assess campus policies, priorities, and performance. Aligning these institutions with regional constituencies will position the campuses to develop partnerships with local industry and governments. Examples from across the country demonstrate the benefits for workforce development and economic diversification that result from locally focused college governance. Funding The ideas presented below are designed to more effectively align resources to support the campuses' differing constituencies and missi ons, particularly as they relate to economic development. Implemented in 2013, the current formula used to distribute operational funding to the teaching institutions places the se colleges at a disadvantage as they compete against the universities for a finite resource . In order to address the se shortcomings, the state should develop separate for mulas for the universities and colleges that reflect these institutions' differing missions, service areas, and student needs. R esources should be dedicated to stu dents who are Pell-grant eligible and first- generation attendees to support their onboarding, advising, and mentoring . Furthermore, credentials, certificates, and other competency-based curricula should be fully rewarded under the formula for workforce institutions. The non -alignment between Nevada's colleges and the mix of degrees and certificate s awarded also has implications for accessing federal resources. Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) most comports with the federal government's definition of a community college, although that was truer several years ago than today as the school expa nds its four -year programs. As a consequence, TMCC Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 146Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 48 was the primary intake for federal workforce training funds during the Obama administration. Yet, the campus serves a region with just 16% of the state's population. Out of the $2 billion in Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACC CT) grants awarded nationally between 2011 and 2014 by the U.S. Department of Labor, Nevada received less than $24 million. Nevada needs genuine community colleges based in their communities. Nevada should redefine College of S outhern Nevada (CSN) , TMCC, and W estern Nevada College (WNC) to align with the federal government's definition of a two -year college. These colleges should focus on articulation, certification , remediation , stackable cred entials and work -place learning. They should serve as the principal institutions for public-private workforce development collaborations. In the recovery from the curre nt economic crisis, the federal government may fund workforce development and retraining initiatives as it did during the Great Recession. Nevada would be much better positioned to receive federal resources with three IPEDS -defined two -year colleges. Conversely, G reat Basin College (GBC), which offers bachelor's degrees in both arts and sciences, a degree portfolio consistent with a four-year school, should be reclassified as such. GBC should be elevated to a full four -year institution and place the Elko mi cropolitan area on a par with its regional peers , such as D urango, Colorado and Clovis, New Mexico \u2014both of which maintain four -year institutions that also offer limited graduate education. Elko lies at the center of an enormous rural space where the most p roximate four -year college is the University of Utah, 230 miles away. The lack of human capital in the area creates an over-reliance on mining, leaving the Elko area vulnerable to market swings in gold prices. Just as Las Vegas' economic health is over rel iant on a single industry, the same is true for many remote communities. Reimagi ning Nevada's Research Universities The first step in better connecting higher education and industry requires transitioning from the current \"state -controlled\" university structure to an \"academic enterprise\" model as exemplified by Arizona State University (ASU) (see Table 7 in Appendix C for a more detailed description) . Academic enterprise institutions, such as ASU , focus on \"social transformation.\" A hallmark of this approach is public-private partnerships that attract external resources for infrastructure investments and research initiatives. ASU vastly expanded its physical plant by offering private firms access to its nonprofit tax status in exchange for developing facilities that are shared with partners. For instance, State Farm's western headquarters was built on land leased to it by ASU and thus qualifies for property tax exemptions. In exchange, ASU receives academic space and funding, includ ing a $30 million donation for its career development program. Nevada's universities should pursue ASU-style, public-private partnerships with multiple industrial and private collaborations in order to expand their research and teaching capacities in an e ra of very restricted state resources . UNLV began switching to t his approach in 2019 to develop its medical education building via a non-profit development corporation. While this particular project was developed in partnership with local philanthropy, it nonetheless establishes a flexible method for using external resources to build what previously would have been a mostly state- funded and state - controlled building. The answer to the prospect of limited state support in the future is to engage multiple stakeholders, including local governments, with common interest in constructing academic facilit ies that will sustain applied technology and startup enterprises.

The Property Tax estimates s how relatively small hits to total state and local collections, from about 1% to 5% based on the scenario compared to No-Pandemic. This appears reasonable based on the continued strength of the housing market nationally and in the state.

These would be significant impacts to state and local coffers as the SUT is the largest revenue generator. Additionally, it is possible that enhanced U nemployment Insurance (UI) benefits and the direct pandemic payouts are inflating the model output s because they no longer benefit households. For this reason, these estimates may be overly optimistic in every scenario. Table 11: Forecasted Change in Sales & Use Taxes in Q4 2021 Compared to Expected Sales & Use Taxes Under No - Pandemic Scenario (in Millions). Source: RCG Economics . Best Case Most Likely Worst Consolidated The same limitations that exist regarding the SUT apply to the CTX. Even with this possible overestimation, the CTX is still expected to experience declines in 2021 of 3. 2% (Best Case), 16.0% (Most Likely ) and 36.4% (Worst Case). It makes sense that these drops are greater in magnitude than for the SUT because CTX revenues are largely dependent on spending that is easier to cut out of a household's budget, like cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.

Best Case Most Likely Worst The MBT is a state -level payroll tax. With lower levels of employment, it is expected that these revenues would be diminished as well. According to the model results, these declines in 2021 relative to the No-Pandemic case would amount to about 4.8% in the Bes t Case, 9.0% in the Most Likely scenario and 16.0% in the Worst Case.

First, basic univariate methods are likely to fail because the pandemic presents an economic shift. Second, there are simply not enough data to forecast economic variables analytically in a multivariate model. There are several variables that are helpful to the model, but not enough post-pandemic observations to estimate the variables' coefficients with any certainty. Another complication is that psychological/behavioral and socio logical effects are driving much of the response to the pandemic and associated economic outcomes. That makes it even more diffi cult to measure and predict. For this reason, RCG chose to take a less rigidly statistical approach to modeling economic outcome s relative to the pandemic. The model is based on applying what we think are reasonable assumptions, backed by data and the economic and medical literature, relative to certain drivers that shift a baseline level of GDP. The purpose of this section is to d escribe these assumptions based on the sources cited throughout the study. The model that drives the study's results has been performed in a series of steps. The first step define s the scenarios based on certain driver variables. Those variables are driven by assumptions that underl ie three scenarios. Next, these variables are used to drive decreases to a baseline GDP forecast that assumes the pandemic never occurred. Finally, the finalized GDP forecast has been used to forecast various indicators of intere st. Based on the information discussed below, three scenarios were created for the Nevada economic forecasts produced in the s tudy, in addition to a hypothetical fourth \" no-pandemic\" scenario, the baseline GDP forecast. These scenarios should provide a reasonable range of economic outcomes to make more informed decisions relative to the Nevada economy over the course of the next se veral quarters . The scenarios are: No Pandemic Best Case Most Likely C ase Worst Case As the name suggests, the no-p andemic scenario assumes that the pandemic never occurred. The Worst-Case scenario reflects a pessimistic view of the economic effects stemming from COVID-19. The Most Likely scenario represents a most likely outcome, based on the research discussed, while the Best-Case scenario present s an optimistic view. Basing this model on a baseline forecast that assumes that the pandemic did not occur ca rried the implied assumption that the structur e of the post -pandemic economy changed only relative to factors directly caused by the pandemic. This means that if the economy returns to normal today (i.e., COVID- 19 is cured and everybody returns to work), G DP will return to its pre-pandemic level and trend. This may not have been an ideal assumption but based on the economy's initial bounce back after the lockdown , it appears to be a reasonable assumption over the short term . The forecast horizon of the study is from approximately Q2 2020 to Q4 2021, depending on when the most recent data have been released for each indicator. Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 158Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 60 GDP Model No-Pandemic GDP Forecasts As discussed above, to project inflation-adjusted (\"real\") GDP and other indicators into the fut ure, RCG required a baseline real GDP forecast for the regional total. RCG has produced forecasts by sector as well, which is discussed below. These baseline forecasts, in 2012 dollars, estimated Nevada's real GDP assuming the Covid -19 pandemic had not occurred (see Figure III-19). These have been compared to the actual values of GDP that did occur in 2020. This has been done to later apply certain \"change\" facto rs to the baselines that arrive at the actual values thus far and then to project those \"change\" factors to forecast future GDP. The model includes natural economic growth because the baseline forecast is in real terms and captured the growth trend in the series since 2014. The GDP data have been obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). To produce the baseline GDP forecast, RCG has employed the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method. 90 A version of the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm91 is used to produce initial results and then several variations of the models were then run in order to choose a reasonable set of findings. These findings have been double-checked using several visual and analytical tests. 92 Setting Up Scenarios After estimating baseline, no-pandemic GDP, RCG continued estimating GDP under the three scen arios ( Worst C ase, Most Likely and Best Case). These scenarios have been developed based on the baseline GDP forecasts and three variables: Phase effects Self-isolation effects Unemployment insurance The discussion below describe s how the three factors have been used relative to the No -Pandemic GDP case to produce the results discussed in the previous section. It should be n oted that t here is also uncertainty around public policy options. Each potential new future policy will make it more difficult to mo del the impacts. Length of Pandemic Before discussing the three main effects, it is necessary to discuss the assumptions regarding the duration of the pandemic. We assume that both phasing and self-isolation will end based on the time to widespread vaccination or the time to herd immunity, whichever will occur first. According to Dr. Fauci, the economy will not return to normal \u2014as it was before COVID -19\u2014 until there is a vaccine. 93 In terms of time to achieving herd immunity, it is too early to estimate when that might happen. Based on the studies discussed above, there is too much uncertainty in what share of the population ha s been infected already. Additionally, the concept of herd immunity may not apply to a novel virus. Per Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, it is possible that neither natural disease nor vaccine provide long-term immunity. If this were to be the case, then COVID- 19 could be around for decades and simply become something that humans must survive. 94 However, because this possibility lies outside of the time horizon of the study, it is not included in the model. According to the New York Times, there were over 126 vaccines in development at the end of August.95 However, even if a vaccine were ready today, it will take time to produce and distribute, although pre -purchased vaccines may help speed distribution.96 Wealthy cou ntries will likely horde doses to inoculate their populations before exporting vaccines.97 In the case of the United States, Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 159 61 this will speed vaccination relative to poorer nations. Another possible problem is that the global supply chain may not be up to the task of quickly distributing a vaccine worldwide. This could be an issue if U.S. firms are unsuccessful in their efforts to develop a vaccine. 98 Still, in light of these variables, according t o USA Today's pandemic science panel, a vaccine should reach widespread attainability by mid-2021. However, according to Science, only about 50% of Americans plan to get the vaccine when it becomes available, with another 25% still unsure. 99 Relative to the research discussed, in the Worst-Case scenario, RCG has assumed that no vaccine will be discovered before 2022, resulting in a prolonged economic emergency. In the M ost Likely scenario, widespread availability of a vaccine in July 2021 is assumed. In the B est-Case scenario, availability will occur in April 2021. Phase Effects Phase effects refer to negative modifiers to GDP that will be caused by government -mandated business lockdowns . These lockd owns shutter businesses and effectively halt economic activity. They appear to help limit the spread of COVID- 19. 100 RCG produced a timeline of the phased lockdowns based on Governor Sisolak's state of emergency directives. The governor has since stated that he plans on moving away from a \"phased\" system of lockdown s.101 However, because the phases in this model have been used as a vehicle to develop a rate of active jobs in Nevada, rather than directly employ the phases as variables, our methodology in this regard should be appropriate. There have been five official phases of reopening described by the state government. We refer to these phases as: Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 , ranging from lockdown to back- to-normal . These phases have been intended to be rolled out based on certain milestones relative to COVID-19 case loads. However, the New York Times reported that few states that had planned to lift their lockdowns or had already done so by early May had met the White House guidelines for reopening.102 Nevada was in this group, as are most states.103 RCG uses definitions herein for the lockdown phases' inactive jobs, by industry, from GOED. This information reflected which sectors' businesses could remain open during each phase. Phase 0 refer red to a total lockdown. Only those businesses deemed \"essential\" cou ld remain open. RCG employ ed the GOED definitions to estimate weighted averages for the share of active workers in each two -digit NAICS104 industry. In Phase 0, businesses accounting for slightly more than 70 % of workers could remain open.105 In every succes sive phase, more businesses will likely be able to open. Phase 4 represent ed a \"normal\" economy \u2014no mandated business closures, meaning after the pandemic has ended. Additionally, RCG added a sixth phase to the mix. Through the July 10, 2020 Directive 027, the Governor declared that bars and taverns not licensed to serve food may only offer pick-up and delivery service. RCG assumes that these establishments will not open at all based on this restriction and referred to this altered version of Phase 2 as Phase 1.5. The following explanation provide d a sample of the method employed relative to the phasing. In the case of Phase 0, there will likely be a significant dampening effect on GDP. About 30% of jobs will be potentially inactive during Phase 0 (this is a lower-bound for the share of active jobs because not all locked down businesses will potentially lay- off all their workers). Research has shown that every one percent decline in GDP correlates to about a one percentage -point increase in the unemployment rate.106 Assuming that a one percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate roughly corresponds to a one percent decline in nonfarm jobs, there should be a 1:1 relationship between percent change in jobs and percent change in GDP.107 However, because this represents a lower- bound and there is wiggle room in this particular analysis since RCG had to manually estimate Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 160Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 62 variable effects \u2014an unavoidable drawback to t he problem of a lack of data \u2014we applied a 25% modifier to the 30 % change in jobs to obtain the change in GDP. This has result ed in an approximately eight percent dampening effect relative to the no-p andemic forecasted GDP on days where Nevada was in Phase 0 lockdown. We have repeat ed this me thod for each phase and estimated a weighted average of this effect based on the number of days that each phase will potentially be in effect over the course of a quarter. Following the steps above, RCG designed three scenarios for future phasing to correspond to the model's three scenarios (see Table III -2). The phase timelines concerning historical data have been produced based on the Governor's directive dates. The three scenario future timelines have been based on res earch discussed above. Reopening the economy will be an iterative process. In fact, large events, such as concerts, nightclubs, bars, and sporting events, may not reopen to the public until fall 2021. 108 In the Worst-C ase scenario , it is assumed that infect ions, hospitalizations , and deaths wi ll surge in the fall through early spring, leading to another Phase 0 lockdown, then reopen to Phase 1.5, before reverting back to Phase 0 lockdowns in fall 2021, as the scenario assumes no vaccine prior to 2022. In the M ost Likely scenario, it is assumed that there will be a minor surge of cases in the fall and winter of 2020, resulting in the state moving back into Phase 1. The state will likely return to Phase 2 in February. We assume that widespread vaccine availability will occur in July 2021 and, with it, a return to Phase 4. In the B est-Case scenario , it is assume d that the state will move to a Phase 3 reopening in December 2020, with widespread vaccination and Phase 4 following in April 2021. Self-Isolation Effects The second effect included in the model is the \" self-i solation\" effect. People are generally risk averse, which should lead to an increased propensity to shelter at home for many people, which is independent of government-mandated lockdowns. This self-isolation is most likely to lead to a reduction in spending that negatively affects GDP. In short, lockdowns take away the ability for people to participate in the economy, whereas, with self-isolation, people choose to limit their activity in the economy. 109 It is expect ed that over the course of the pandemic, self-isolation will likely pose the bigger cumulative threat to economic growth. In calibrating the model, three timelines (one for each scenario) are assumed relative to the effects of self -isolation on the economy (see Table III-3). Thes e dampening effects represent percentages of lost economic activi ty starting as of certain dates. For example, relative to the Most Likely scenario , RCG assumes a dampening effect of 0. 1 starting in mid -March. The 0. 1 effect refers to a 10% decline in GDP relative to the No -Pandemic baseline. RCG has arrived at a dampen ing effect of 10% by trial and error. Based on the phasing effects discussed above and the effects of unemployment benefits discussed below, a 10% dampening effect due to self -isolation best fit the data, relative to Q1 2020. There is a complication that could elongate this downward pressure on the economy. There is evidence suggesting that even if an effective vaccine were to be released in the middle of 2021, many people will decline vaccination. This is likely to cause the pandemic to go on longer than anticipated. A pair of recent polls, one by Pew Research 110 and one by the Associated Press,111 show that approximately 50 percent of Americans definitely plan on getting vaccinated and about 75 % say that they will probably get vaccinated. That is close to the currently assumed threshold of 70 % that the Mayo Clinic has reported as necessary to stem the spread of the virus.112 It is very possible that Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 161 63 due to low rates of vaccination, the virus continu es to spread and to dampen economic growth due to continued se lf-isolation among vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly. Additionally, any vaccine created is likely to produce less than 100% immunity. This could limit the severity of the disease but possibly not the spread. Dr. Drew Weissman of the Universi ty of Pennsylvania told Fortune that \" if the best COVID -19 vaccine is only 50 percent effective, that's still to me a great vaccine.\"113 While a 50%-effective vaccine will do much to stem COVID-19, the continuing transmission will likely lead to a lengthening in people's fear of the virus and, therefore, a longer-lasting propensity to self-isolate. Based on the above , in the Worst-C ase sce nario, RCG assumes a 10% hit to GDP through September, then rising to 15% in the fall and lasting throughout the forecast horizon in this scenario. In the M ost Likely scenario , we assume that this effect decreased to 7.5 % in April but will then increase to 10 percent in October , before returning to 7.5% in the spri ng. It will then decline to five percent with the introduction of the vaccine in July 2021 through the remainder of the year . In the Best-Case scenario, RCG assumes that the self -isolation effect decreased to five percent in April and will go to one percen t in Ju ly 2021 through the end of 2021. In general, in the Worst-Case scenario, RCG assumes that self-isolation will increase due to heightened fears of venturing outside caused by hypothetically increased deaths in the fall. In the Most Likely scenario , RCG assumes a slight increase in self-isolation in the fall and winter due to a modest increase in deaths, but then returning to Summer 2020 levels. We also assume that some propensities to self -isolate will remain after widespread distribution of a vaccine because polls show that many people are not planning vaccinations right away. This will likely lead to lingering infections and, therefore, fear of infection. In the B est-Case scenario, we assume a small amount of lingering fear starting in the summer due to only small levels of continuing transmission of COVID-19 following an April vaccine. 114 Unemployment Insurance The third major variable in the model is unemployment insurance. With the large number of unemployed workers in the state, a significant portion of personal income comes from these payments. There are two components: state UI and federal UI. The federal UI is meant to enhance state UI benefits and hold households over during the pandemic. To estimate these funds , RCG has collected data from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation (DETR) on the number of unemployment claims as well as the payment amounts. RCG then made various assumptions a bout the number of unemployed persons that will be receiving these benefits as well as the amounts they are likely to receive through the end of 2021. We assume there will be no change to the weekly historical claim payment, which was $369 per week in July 2020. 115 Again, there are three scenarios describing these outcomes. All dollar amoun ts are in 2020 dollars to match our GDP forecast. First, RCG developed assumptions relative to the number of unemployed persons collecting UI benefits. Generally, we assum e that the number of those receiving benefits will remain at the levels of the most c urrent data, about 301,500 claims per month in the state.116 This will continue until widespread distribution of a vaccine, at which time people should start finding employment again. This assumes that the labor market is in steady state as of July 2020. Then, because all of these levels are relative to a baseline GDP, it is necessary to subtract the standard unemployment benefits that will occur in normal times. We then assume that the number of those accepting UI benefits will decline linearly until reachin g the levels estimated for the end of 2021 in the three scenarios (s ee Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 162Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 64 Table III- 4). This assume s that the number of workers at the end of 2021 control s in part for the speed of the recovery. We also have assumed that people will go back to work when calle d in or upon finding a new job, which should happen in a timely manner despite receiving UI benefits.117 For the Worst-C ase scenario, because RCG assumes that there will be no vaccine available before the end of 2021, total persons receiving UI benefits rema ined at their August level throughout the forecast horizon. In the M ost Likely scenario, RCG assumes total UI claims will drop to 100,000 average monthly claimants by the end of 2021. This assumes that the state will regain about two- thirds of its jobs rel ative to August 2020, equivalent to approximately an eight or nine percent unemployment rate. In the B est Case, we assume that unemployment claims will return to 20,00 0 monthly claimants, approximately their pre -recession levels. Relative to the amount of the UI benefits, RCG assumes that the state UI benefits will remain unchanged compared to what they had been in July 2020. For the federal enhanced UI benefits, which may have started for some as early as late March, 118 RCG used a different set of assumption s for each scen ario (see Table III-5). In the Worst Case, we assume that gridlock in Washington, D.C. will continue to keep new enhanced benefits from taking effect.119 Recent reports indicate that lawmakers may strike a deal in September or that they may not do so until the next Congress begins. To account for this uncertainty, RCG assumes a 50-50 split in the chances of each possibility and picked a date in the middle . We have also assumed that these enhanced funds will decrease to $200 per week in January with benefits coming to an end in June 2021. In the B est-Case scenario, we have assumed that enhanced benefits will resume at $600 per week on September 13, declinin g to $400 per week in January 2021 and continuing through the end of 2021. Those UI benefit s should also continue to benefit the economy through the \"multiplier effect,\" which accounts for future spending of those same monies. To account for this effect, we applied a multiplier of 1.29, based on household-spending-induced effects in the most recent IMPLAN input- output 120 model for Clark County. Model Limitations The purpose of the model is to capture the major outcomes of various behaviors and policies to produce reasonable estimates of GDP through 2021. RCG believes that the model is successful i n this respect. However, there are factors at play that are only implicitly included or, in some cases, left out altogether. One major limitation of this model is discussed above. Because there are not enough data available, RCG estimates the outcomes of the model manually. At the time of writing, there is only one state - level data point collected relative to the pan demic. There fore, there is more than one solution to the hypothetical econometric formula estimated. In the case of federal stimulus stemming from the CARES Act, some policies are included implicitly, while others have explicitly not been included. For example, RCG did not include the $1,200 direct individual stimulus. Data on the personal saving rate show that saving in April spiked to an unprec edented 33.5 %. 121 This suggests that households are aware of the possibility of dire financial outcomes over the course of the pandemic and are putting aside funds to hold them over if necessary. In fact, a recent Forbes analysis has found that as much as 40 % of households are saving all the funds they received from the one-time payment.122 Money saved today is money spent tomorro w, so to speak. Therefore, because RCG assumes that all UI benefits will be spent immediately, we chose to be conservative with respect to the stimulus checks and assume that none of it will be immediately spent. We think this is a reasonable assumption be cause in our Most Likely Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 163 65 and Best-Case scenarios, UI fund s amount to far more than the stimulus checks and , there is still so little information available about how all of these funds have been used. This assumption linking UI to the stimulus should offset changes in the saving rate. In the case of the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\")\u2014 a program that dispenses loans meant to incentivize small businesses to keep their workers123\u2014those funds have not been included in the model explicitly. However, because RC G use d assumptions relative to the number of unemployed workers in the model, we did make implicit assumptions regarding the program. There are several other provisions in the CARES Act. However, we assume that they will have relatively little effect on GD P. Furthermore, by definition, business-to -business transactions do not directly affect GDP.124 Of course, these transactions do affect GDP indirectly. Still, we assume that there will be no major disruptions to business aside from those related to the pandemic. Another limitation stem med from lag effects caused by the economic crisis. For example, as spending declines, future revenues to the state and municipalities should decline as well . The secondary effects of these declines on future GDP is difficult to estimate in terms of both magnitude and timing and have not been included in the model. The final major limitation is tourism , a majo r component of the Nevada economy , particularly Southern Nevada . The Great Recession showed that tourism demand in Las Vegas lags economic growth nationwide,125 especially relative to California. Economic research suggests that is generally true for North Am erica.126 This lag effect is not included in the model explicitly, though it is considered relative to the model's final UI claim levels in Q4 2021 . GDP Forecast Results As of this August, there was only one data point for state -level GDP available that incl uded the pandemic with which to calibrate our model. For this reason, we have been able to obtain an estimate within a fraction of a percent of the actual Q1 2020 GDP estimate for Nevada. However, because our methodology is straightforward and contain s two scenarios capturing the most extreme outcomes as we ll as a most likely scenario, we believe that the results provided herein represent a reasonable set of outcomes for Nevada GDP th rough 2021. Nevertheless, as more data come in, RCG could revisit the underlying assumptions and update the forecast. The Q2 2 020 state -level GDP data are scheduled for release in early October 2020. 127 Indicator Models In addition to the forecast of real GDP, RCG has also produced projections for a set of economic and fiscal indicators for Nevada, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Reno-Sparks MSA. In this section, RCG describes the data and methodology used to develop these additional forecasts. A number of metrics were used to develop these forecasts, including tax collection and unemployment statistics, among others. A full list of the used metrics and their corresponding geographic availability (i.e., state, local, or jurisdictional) is available in Appendix A. RCG has employed a single method to foreca st the indicators to maintain conformity and consistency across the measures. 128 RCG used the ARIMA with Exogenous Input (\"ARIMAX\") model.129 This model forecasts an indicator based on its relationship with outside variables. In this case, RCG has used real GD P, as forecasted above, as the exogenous input.130 We expect GDP to be a good explanatory variable because GDP is generally a function of various economic indicators. Therefore, it should move together with or inversely relative to those i ndicators. The mode l enables us to measure how Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 164Nevada's Plan for Recovery & Resilience CONTINUED 66 real GDP moves with each of the Indicators in the past, and then uses the real GDP forecast above to predict how the indicators should change over the forecast horizon. In terms of th e dates that have been analyzed and forecaste d, a difference between this analysis and the above GDP forecast is that RCG forecasts the series starting with the most recent historical data rather than the last 2019 data point to improve forecasting results (i.e., fewer forecasted data points lead to more precision and accuracy). A limitation of this model is that in certain cases, because of the extreme circumstances of the pandemic, economic data have been outside of typical ranges. With no historical data on these types of swings, the model may overweight or underweight these swings in some cases. However, this situation is unavoidable regardless of the model type and, furthermore, RCG is comfortable that the results are generally reasonable. A second limitation, that at times can compound with the p revious limitation, is that because RCG used a single indicator as the exogenous input, the results of certain forecasts might not necessarily match the original assumptions. Rather than run the model on each geographic subset, RCG has run the model on tot al Nevada revenues and uses the average share of the subsets relative to the state data since 2014 to calculate those series' values . This is reasonable to do because the shares do not change significantly over that time frame. For each indicator, we have produced results for the same four scenarios as for GDP. Data for the model have been aggregated annually for all tax indicator s and quarterly for all economic indicators. GDP sector results have been reported in 2020 dollars. All other monies are reported on a nominal (non-inflation adjusted) basis. The data for the indicators come from various sources. RCG has identified and used the sources that show the most complete accounting of each tax, even if those sources provide less detailed information at the sub-state level. We have done this to get the best estimates of total collections. State totals generally reflect total collections in the state rather than the state's s hare of a tax. All tax results are presented in fiscal years, while economic indicator s are presented as quarterly. Monthly data on employment and unemployment came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Visitor data herein are sourced from the visitor and convention authorities of the Las Vegas and Reno -Sparks areas. We combined these to rep resent Nevada visitors. These monthly data do not account for total Nevada visitation, but cover about 90 percent. Data for Nevada visitation had not been updated in near ly a year and the Nevada Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs has suggested basi ng our estimates on these updated regional aggregates. RCG has also collected data on the Property Tax (also referred to as the \"Ad Valorem Tax\") and Room Tax from the Ne vada Legislative Counsel Bureau (\"NLCB\"). The NLCB does not break down collections by geography. Instead, they show allocations to the major revenue recipients aggregated by type, so in the case of the Property Tax: Nevada and Local G overnment & School D istricts. For the Room Tax, the breakdown includes Nevada, Local T ourism and CCSD. Anoth er tax series that has been collected is the Gaming Tax. Those annual data come from the Nevada Gaming Control Board and cover the state and largest counties. The data include gaming properties with annual revenues of at least $1 million, so it does not capture all of the tax revenues, but it does capture approximately 90 percent. Taxable sales (monthly) modified business tax revenue (quarterly), marijuana tax es revenue s (monthly), SUT (monthly) and CTX (monthly) data come from the Nevada Department of Taxation. Results are presented annually. Due to the way that many of these revenue sources are collected Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 165 67 and distributed, it is not feasible to separate them all by county. However, RCG has separated them locally to the extent practical. For taxable sales, we have produced forecasts for Clark and Washoe counties in addition to the state. The modified business tax (\"MBT\") is collected by the state and put into the state's gene ral fund. Therefore, while counties and municipalities benefit, they do so based on th e many formulas that are used to distribute those funds. Regarding marijuana revenues (derived from a retail excise tax and a wholesale excise tax), we have performed an analysis at the state level only. Sub -state data have only been published for one year at the time of writing and it is not feasible to run an analysis on so few data, particularly when there are not enough data to perform the state-level analysis , as disc ussed above . The SUT and CTX data are provided herein for each county as well as the state. RCG has analyzed these for Nevada, Clark County and Washoe County. Both taxes are comprised of several components. The SUT includes the state sales tax, the Local S chool Support Tax (\"LSST\"), Supplemental City-County Relief Tax (\"SCCRT\"), Basic City -County Relief Tax (\"BCCRT\") and county - level option taxes. The CTX is comprised of the Liquor Tax, Cigarette Tax, Real Property Transfer Tax (\"RPTT\") and Government S ervices T ax (\"GST\"). RCG has summed the various taxes together for each geography to obtain the totals for the two taxes at each level. As a note, RPTT data are not broken down by county, so the county-level results do not include that tax. Certain SUTs are re ported with CTX data. Those had to be separated. These data have been obtained from th e Nevada Department of Taxation's (\"Taxation\") \"Statistical\" and \"Consolidated Tax\" reports and aggregated by fiscal year and region.

There is a chance that people will not necessarily choose to self -isolate but will have to as a result of exogenous budget/employment factors. Nevertheless, whatever the reason for self -isolation, it is still likely to have the same relative i mpact and be captured in the model.

A second simpler method has been used to estimate fut ure marijuana revenues. This is because the ARIMAX model failed. There are two reasons for this. First, the marijuana market has yet to reach equilibrium because more consumers have been moving from the black market to the legal market. This introduced an outside factor into the formula that RCG has attempted to estimate. However, there are not enough data because the marijuana excise taxes are relatively new, which is the second and more important reason the model had issues. Collections began in July 2017 (FY 2018). Instead, RCG has applied the Nevada GDP growth rate to marijuana revenues and applied an extra assumed factor of four percent and two percent for the two years of the forecast, respectively. 129. As above, RCG has tested the model inputs and outputs for each indicator to ensure that the data are stationary, and the output residuals are not auto -correlated and are normally distributed. 130. \"An exogenous variable is a factor in causal modeling or causal system whose value is ind ependent from the st ates of other variables in the system.\" (From \"The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods,\" by Daniel Little, 2004 .) While this assumption is not strictly true as GDP and employment affect each other, RCG believes it is a weak assumption over the forecast horizon. \u0001Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development Annual Report 2020 | 175 GOED's Organizational Charts Michael Brown Executive Director Susan Skaggs Executive Assistant Gregory Bortolin Communications Director Bob Potts Deputy Director Joan Rueben Director, Procurement Tech.
