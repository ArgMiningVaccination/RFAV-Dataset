When done with the right support from an acupuncturist near me, detoxing can help improve your digestion, immune function, fertility, and many other aspects of your health. Store bought colon cleanse products or a juice cleanse won't really do the job, though. A [detox program with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/new-years-cleaning-detox/) and Chinese herbs will do more to optimize your health than just a [detox diet](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/detox-diets-why-to-do-one-what-to-eat) will. When we recommend our Detox Program at Art of Wellness, we are not talking about fasting or detox drinks, like a master cleanse. The goal of our program is to detoxify the organ systems of the body: it's a liver detox, kidney cleanse, lungs, heart, and spleen. This is a [full body cleanse](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-detox-your-body#1.-Limit-Alcohol) designed to give you a health reset. According to TCM philosophy, your body knows how to repair and renew itself, but it cannot do this job when it is congested and out of balance. In TCM, we have a broad concept of what \"toxins\" are and how they can affect our bodies and our health. Toxic chemicals that come from our [environment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18075622/), such as food additives, pesticides, cleaning products, and [beauty and hygiene products](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/harmful-chemicals-in-personal-care-products/) are certainly part of the problem. Drugs, medicines, alcohol, and unhealthy foods can also be toxic. So can behavioral habits, like sitting and looking at our [screens and devices](https://www.verywellmind.com/why-and-how-to-do-a-digital-detox-4771321) too long. But our own bodies produce toxins, too. The waste products our organs create are \"toxic,\" and if they are held in the body too long without being adequately cleared out, they can negatively impact organ function. Imbalances in the system can cause conditions of excess heat or phlegm, which can lead to all kinds of problems with both your physical and [mental health](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), lack of sleep, and extreme emotions can also contribute to toxic conditions in the body and mind. When the organ systems are out of balance, the body is under constant pressure to keep functioning, but we do not feel our best. Signs you need to detox include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), low energy, tired all the time - Foggy head, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [trouble concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Constipation - Trouble sleeping, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) - Weight gain - Hair loss - Hormone imbalances - Signs of rapid aging - Skin rash, [acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingernails are brittle, lined symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/menopause/) retention, edema, swelling in extremities [Inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) is largely created by toxic conditions in the body, and most pain conditions and chronic illnesses stem, at least in part, from inflammation somewhere. Why You Need a Liver Detox In conventional medicine, we think of the liver as being a sort of filter that removes toxins from the blood and helps metabolize fat. In TCM theory, we consider the liver to be the storehouse and distributor of blood; therefore, it also plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle. The liver is also strongly connected to a person's emotional life. Stress, lack of sleep, too much sugar, alcohol, fatty, fried foods, pharmaceutical medicines, and recreational drugs all tax the liver above and beyond what it needs to do just to keep the blood flowing to nourish the body. When too many demands are placed on the liver, it can cause all kinds of symptoms, including: fatigue, insomnia, and headaches. Feelings of anger, frustration, anxiety, and irritability may arise. Conversely, when a person is feeling bitter and resentful, and isn't able to express it, those unresolved emotions may begin to cause trouble with liver function. Just as the liver governs the blood, in TCM, the kidneys govern the water of the body, controlling elimination through the bladder, and maintaining [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/hypertension/) by keeping the right amount of water in the bloodstream. Signs that the kidneys are not balanced include: [problems with blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), edema, puffiness in the face or extremities, [UTIs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chronic fatigue, and [menopause symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), like dryness and hot flashes. Detoxing the organ systems, including the liver and kidneys especially, can help rejuvenate the digestion and allow better nutrition to reach all parts of the body, as the quality and flow of blood and other bodily fluids will be improved. Making sure that your excretory system is in good working order before starting a cleanse is important. If you are already having problems with constipation, for example, we will want to make sure we get things moving before we start cleansing the organs. Our detox also focuses on the body's largest excretory organ: the skin. Top 10 Reasons To Detox It is a good idea for everyone to detox periodically; detoxing every six months is reasonable for most people. Sometimes we will specifically recommend a detox for a patient when they are struggling with a particular health problem, or if they are planning a [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/). Detoxing can help: - Boost Immunity - a cleanse will help get your lymphatic system, which produces and transports immune cells and removes waste from cells, moving, improving the efficacy of your immune system. - Break Free From [Addiction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- if you are ready, a commitment to the detox program and food plan can help you end patterns of [substance abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153313/), drug use, alcohol addiction, [smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other types of dependency. [Infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/)- We often advise people who come to Art of Wellness for [fertility treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/fertility-treatment-plans/)to begin with the Detox Program. Not only will this help increase the chances of conception occurring, whether naturally or with the aid of ART, but it will also lay the foundation for your child's health in the future. [Improve sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- This works both ways. In order for the body to do its routine daily work of removing toxic waste, it needs plenty of sleep. The Liver, in particular, is working hard through the night to clean and deliver fresh blood to the cells. Sleeping on your side enhances your body's ability to do this work, allowing the internal organs to drain properly. When your body is functioning well, your sleep will be of better quality, more restful and refreshing. [Improve skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/)and hair - Dull eyes and skin, dark circles or bags, puffiness, and thinning hair are signs of stagnant blood and Qi. Nutrients from the right foods and Chinese herbs help to nourish the skin, and clear heat, dampness, and dryness. When old cells are removed, hair and eyes can shine again. Acupuncture treatment can help [stimulate collagen](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-7-19)production, which also happens while you sleep. - Weight loss - While our acupuncture detox is not about how to lose belly fat fast, many people will find that it gives them a good foundation for new eating habits. Detoxing the liver and kidneys will help your body metabolize fat better. - Balance hormones - severe [PMS symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)and mood [infertility in men (oligospermia)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can all be improved when hormone function improves. Acupuncture treatment can also help relieve conditions like [PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [fibroids/leiomyoma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)for women, and [BPH in men](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Reduce inflammation - many illnesses and pain conditions are inflammatory in nature.

Hard-to-treat conditions like autoimmune conditions and other systemic problems may be helped with alternative medicine when conventional medical treatments have not been successful. We treat many conditions with acupuncture and herbs, such support for people going through [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/). 7 Steps of Detox Program With TCM Acupuncture and Herbs Pain and dysfunction occur when there is imbalance and when there are areas of stagnation within the body. Think of the metaphor of a house that needs to be deep-cleaned; there are dark corners of the body that have been ignored for a while, where dust and cobwebs have gathered. The Detox program reaches into these pockets of stagnation, sweeps them clean, and makes sure they get some fresh air and sunlight shining on them, in the form of invigorated Qi and blood. - Acupuncture Treatments - the primary goal of acupuncture treatments during the detox phase is to get Qi moving freely, remove blockages, and to assist in elimination of toxins from the body. - Cupping Treatment - the TCM modality of cupping creates a vacuum-like suction that moves Qi and blood from the innermost parts of the body outwards. During the detox program, cupping helps to pull toxins out of the lungs and other organs. - Detox Herbs - the Chinese herb detox tea helps to clear heat and toxins from the body and improve digestion and elimination. - Foot Pad Detox - detox foot patches, worn as you sleep at night and removed in the morning, help to pull toxins and fatty deposits from the body. - Detox Bath - Sweating is an excellent way to remove toxins through the skin; this is why so many traditions rely on saunas and hot baths. Our herbal sachets allow you to enjoy a therapeutic herbal soak in your own bathtub. - Exercise - Your acupuncturist will instruct you on how to practice daily exercises, based on QiGong movements, that will help to get Qi and blood moving. - Nutrition - the food plan during the detox is based on whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of vegetables, flooding your system with nutrients.

The education provided by this article is not approved by FDA to diagnose, prevent, treat and cure human diseases. It should not stop you from consulting with your physician for your medical conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science. Because science focuses on testing ideas about the natural world with evidence obtained through observation, these aspects of acupuncture can't be studied by science. Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How to Treat Oligospermia With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. If you and your partner have been trying to get pregnant but it hasn't happened yet, maybe you are concerned that it could be due to male [infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/), or l [ow sperm count](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sperm-count/symptoms-causes/syc-20374585), also known as Oligospermia. Male factor infertility is an issue in 40-50% of cases when a couple is [having trouble conceiving](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Acupuncture and TCM herbs offer a male infertility treatment that can help improve sperm production, increase sperm count, and help men produce healthy sperm. [Infertility in men](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/m/male-infertility) is more common than you might think. [Statistics show](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691969/) that infertility increasing worldwide is an issue, as many couples are having trouble conceiving. Roughly one in ten couples find that they are not able to get pregnant without some form of fertility treatment. Most men don't know they may have this problem until they are trying to get their partner pregnant and things aren't working. When couples go in for a female and male infertility test, about half of the time they find that male fertility is compromised. The cause of infertility in male can be due to many variables, so it may take more testing to discover why there is a problem. In many cases, infertility in men and women is never fully explained medically. You can take a sperm count test at home, but that doesn't tell you the whole story. A fertility test for men, or [semen analysis](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/what-is-semen-analysis), performed through a doctor will give you more information about sperm motility, sperm shape, the concentration of sperm in your semen, the Ph balance of the semen, and other details that may help to determine if there is a problem with male factor infertility. Other, more specific tests can show: swimming speed and direction, whether there are antisperm antibodies (ASAs) present, the sperm's effectiveness at breaking through the outer wall of an egg, etc. Of men who are experiencing problems with infertility, about ten percent have [azoospermia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/azoospermia), which means a sperm count of zero, or no sperm in the semen. This can happen due to genetic conditions, radiation or chemotherapy treatments, use of some drugs, or anatomical abnormalities. One of the most common causes of infertility in men is [varicoceles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/varicocele/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378772), which are swollen veins in the testicles, similar to varicose veins. Varicoceles are not always noticeable, and often don't cause any problems. However, they can block proper blood flow in the testicles, cause the temperature of the scrotum to rise, and have a negative impact on sperm production. This condition can be treated with [surgery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051002/) to repair the veins, or redirect blood flow to healthier veins. Perhaps you have already heard about how beneficial TCM treatment can be for infertility in women, but you may not know that acupuncture for male infertility is also effective, whether used as an adjunct to ART (assisted reproductive technologies) treatment for male fertility, or as an alternative to conventional medical treatment. In the case of varicoceles, for example, studies have shown that men treated with acupuncture showed similar improvement in sperm motility and quality to men who had had minimally invasive surgery to help repair varicoceles. [Acupuncture treatment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26791438/) works on many levels, helping to improve blood circulation, [reduce inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/), cool excess heat, boost testosterone and erectile function, as well as helping to optimize overall health by reducing the effects of [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and [improving sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Cause of Low Sperm Count Problems with low sperm count and low sperm motility can be related to underlying health issues, or in some cases, lifestyle habits that may affect sperm production. - Varicocele - swelling in the blood vessels in the testicles that has a negative impact on sperm production and sperm quality. - Infections - some illnesses, like mumps, or sexually-transmitted diseases, like gonorrhea or [HIV](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), can cause inflammation, damage, and/or scarring in the testicles that can affect sperm health or the mechanical release of sperm from the testicles. - Ejaculation problems - chronic health conditions like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), the use of blood pressure medications like alpha-blockers, or injury to the urinary tract or spine, can cause problems with the process of sperm being mixed with semen from the prostate and exiting the body through the penis. Retrograde ejaculation, for example, means that semen and sperm are going into the bladder instead of being expelled through the penis during ejaculation. [Erectile dysfunction (ED)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can also be an issue. - I [mmune Infertility](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070912170104.htm)- autoimmune disorders can cause antibodies (antisperm antibodies, or ASA) to mistakenly attack sperm as if they were foreign bodies. This can happen in both men and women. (If a woman is producing ASAs, they attack the sperm when they enter the female reproductive system.) Some men who have had a vasectomy begin to develop these antibodies, and then, even after reversal of the vasectomy (vasovasostomy), they still have male infertility issues. - Blocked tubes - several sets of tubes are involved in proper functioning of the male reproductive system and the male urinary system. If any of these tubes (the vas deferens, epididymis, seminal vesicle, urethra) are blocked, due to infection, inflammation, scarring, or other damage, it can affect sperm making it into the semen and out of the body during ejaculation. [BPH and other prostate problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can cause inflammation in this area. - Hormone imbalance - low testosterone levels or imbalances in levels of FSH and LH, hormones can cause low sperm production. [Undescended testicles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4689328/)- a small number of male babies are born with one or both testicles that have not descended into the scrotum. In some cases, the testicles will descend within a few months on their own; in other cases, surgery is performed to correct the problem. If a boy grows into adulthood with his testes undescended, it can affect male fertility. - Cancer or other tumors - a tumor or imbalance in hormones due to [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/)(testicular cancer, prostate cancer, or bladder cancer) can disrupt sperm production. Side [effects of cancer](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/physical-side-effects/fertility-and-sexual-side-effects/fertility-and-men-with-cancer/how-cancer-treatments-affect-fertility.html)treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy can also slow down sperm production or stop it. These side effects can also affect libido and sexual function. - Chromosomal defects - several [genetic disorders](https://fertility.womenandinfants.org/services/male-infertility/genetic-disorders-infertility-in-men)can cause infertility in men due to syndrome, [Cystic fibrosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-cystic-fibrosis-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), Kleinfelter syndrome) [Celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- While there has only been limited research done thus far, there have been some connections made between [male infertility and celiac disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001971/), which is a type of autoimmune disorder. One study suggested that a gluten-free diet helped men with celiac disease to increase sperm count. Other things that can impact sperm count and sperm motility include the [use of recreational drugs like marijuana, opiates,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) hormone supplements meant to boost testosterone, or anabolic steroids taken to build more muscle mass. Medications used to treat autoimmune disorders, like [IBDs, Crohn's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc., can also affect male fertility. How to Increase Sperm Count - Medical Treatments Medical treatment and ART for male infertility depends first on testing to get as clear a diagnosis as possible. If it seems like some infection is causing problems, antibiotics may be prescribed, although in some cases, an extended infection may have already done some damage to the organs involved. If hormone imbalance is the problem, medications that alter the balance of FSH and LH, hormones crucial to sperm production, may be used, including estrogen receptor blockers, or human chorionic gonadotropin. As previously mentioned, surgeries to repair varicoceles can help to restore fertility. In many cases, though, the exact cause of male infertility is not known. Male infertility is a complex health issue. The physical mechanics of sperm production, erectile function, and ejaculation are all important. It is important to acknowledge that these forces are closely connected to a man's mental health and emotional health. If there is a lot of stress around trying to get pregnant, stress about having sex, stress in the relationship, or many other issues that may come into play, then the stress itself can have a real impact on sexual function and sperm production. Acupuncture and TCM is a good treatment method to address all of these physical and emotional issues at the same time, without unwanted side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Male Infertility and Oligospermia? First, let's make it clear: acupuncture treatment for low sperm count is not going to involve needles being placed anywhere near the scrotum or penis. Acupuncture works on a subtle level and is relatively painless. Patients usually find it relaxing, and often take a nap during the treatment. According to TCM theory, both blood and Qi need to flow smoothly throughout the channels of the body, nourishing the organs, for there to be optimal health. This is particularly true when it comes to promoting good reproductive health. Sperms must be ready to move through both the man's reproductive system and the woman's reproductive system, penetrate an egg, and start a new life. In order for healthy sperm to be produced, there needs to be a lot of blood and energy flowing to the testicles, where sperm are created. In TCM, dampness and phlegm are often the causes of blockages. Acupuncture treatment focuses on improving blood flow, not only to testicles, but also to the kidneys and liver. TCM theory considers the kidney to be the keeper of a person's \"essence.\" Essence is the life material that we inherit from our parents and pass on to our children. The kidneys are also considered to be responsible for the regulation and transformation of fluids in the body. Strengthening the kidneys, clearing heat, phlegm, and dampness from the organs, and nourishing the blood and Qi are the main focus of acupuncture treatment for low sperm count. Nutrition, diet, exercise, stress reduction, adequate sleep, and other lifestyle habits are important factors in treating low sperm count. Your acupuncturist near me will go over the details in order to help you choose foods that boost fertility and adjust your routines so that they are most beneficial for infertility. It helps to realize that sperm take about two to three months to mature, so acupuncture, herbs, and changes in lifestyle, as part of a holistic treatment regimen, need to be given adequate time and commitment to take effect. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735027/) confirmed that scrotal temperature and sperm count were improved in a significant number of men treated for oligospermia with acupuncture. A [study measuring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2305050015000226) sperm maturity and functionality found that patients treated with acupuncture for five weeks showed an increase in sperm function at the end of the five weeks, and then scored higher for sperm function again five weeks after treatment had ended. [Another study](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=30217) looked at acupuncture for low sperm motility and found that acupuncture helped increase sperm motility in a significant number of men. Chinese herbs [have been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6479084/) to have a positive effect on balancing FSH and LH levels. Acupuncture Near Me for Oligospermia in Los Angeles Dealing with male infertility due to low sperm count can be frustrating and stressful. It's important that you and your partner put together a team of supportive health care providers who are also experts in the field of infertility treatment. At Art of Wellness, we have over thirty-five years of experience providing the very best in integrative care for infertility.

[ How to Treat BPH With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Men, are you getting up to pee in the night? Having trouble beginning urinating when you have to go, or the flow of urine starts and stops? These may be signs of [BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20370087), also known as an enlarged prostate. Many men begin to have prostate problems as they get older, including [UTIs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), prostate infections, and inflammation of the prostate gland. Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve [prostatitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostatitis/) symptoms and urinary symptoms of BPH. BPH is a very common men's health concern. About half of all men over 60 feel some symptoms of [BPH](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/b/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-(bph)), and by the time men are in their 80s, the vast majority of men will have an enlarged prostate. Prostate enlargement or prostate infections are not necessarily signs of prostate cancer symptoms, but they can cause trouble peeing. Urinary problems due to BPH can be painful and frustrating. In a man's body, the prostate gland is located right below the bladder. The urethra, the tube through which both urine and semen flow out of the body through the penis, passes through the prostate. This means there is a small area of the prostate that surrounds the urethra. As the prostate grows naturally over time, or becomes inflamed due to infection or injury, this area of the prostate can press on the urethra and bladder, affecting the process of urination. [The prostate gland](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279291/) is a reproductive organ that produces [seminal fluid](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(17)30363-9.pdf), which, when combined with sperm from the testes and other fluid from the seminal vesicles, produces semen: the cloudy white fluid that comes out of the urethra through the penis when a man ejaculates. The prostate contains smooth muscle tissue that squeezes the fluid out, and small ducts that block the urethra when ejaculation happens, so that urine doesn't come out with the semen. Seminal fluid provides nutrients and energy for the sperm, and it also interacts with the chemistry in a woman's reproductive organs, so prostate health is really important for [men's fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). The prostate gland is different from most organs in that it [continues to grow](https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/understanding-prostate-changes) throughout a person's lifetime. This enlargement of the prostate is not entirely understood by medical science, but it is believed to be due to some mechanism of men's hormone functioning. BPH is called \"benign,\" because it has nothing to do with the cause of prostate cancer and does not even mean you are at higher risk for prostate cancer. According to conventional medicine, BPH is a normal part of aging. According to TCM theory, an enlarged prostate is more likely to cause problems when Qi is weak and specific organ systems are subject to too much damp heat. Acupuncture and herbs for BPH can help to restore healthy urinary function and reduce pain and inflammation in the prostate area. What Is BPH? The prostate gland goes through two [periods of growth](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/the-growing-problem-of-an-enlarged-prostate-gland): during puberty, when it doubles in size, and then from age 25 until old age. Prostate growth varies from individual to individual, but overall, the prostate grows larger at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0% per year. As the prostate is getting bigger, it can start to press on the urinary tract organs. As men [get older](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3739117/), they may begin to feel changes that make it more difficult to pass urine. Top 5 Signs of BPH include: - Trouble starting to urinate, having to strain to start peeing, hesitancy - Feeling like you can't completely empty your bladder, like you still need to pee - Feeling like you need to pee more often, reduced bladder capacity - Weak stream of urine, \"start and stop\" peeing, dribbling pee - Having to get up to pee at night, nocturia Having urine left in the bladder even after you went to the bathroom can cause bacteria to build up and lead to prostate infections, UTIs, and chronic urinary symptoms that come and go over months. Prostatitis can mean a variety of men's health issues that cause urinary symptoms and pain that are similar to symptoms of BPH. Prostatitis Symptoms The term prostatitis covers a few different kinds of men's health issues that cause swelling and pain in the male reproductive organs, including bacterial bladder infections, UTIs, bladder stones, prostate stones, or after having some sort of procedure (like a surgery, biopsy, or catheterization). It also includes CPPS, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, where there is pain in the genitals without any apparent cause. [Prostatitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15319-prostatitis) symptoms include: - Pain in the penis, testicles, or the area behind the testicles, the perineum - Painful urination, hurts to pee, dysuria - Urgency, frequency, feels like you have to pee all the time - Urine flow starts and stops, weak stream of urine - Painful ejaculation, burning ejaculation, hurts to pee after sex - Blood in semen [ED, erectile dysfunction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Prostate infections and related infections can be either acute (serious in the short term) or chronic (lasting a long time and difficult to get rid of). An acute bacterial infection of the prostate or urinary tract can cause painful urination, a frequent need to pee, feeling urgency to urinate, or having trouble urinating. If left untreated, this kind of infection can lead to fever, chills, and feeling seriously ill. Chronic bacterial infection of the prostate gland can cause someone to have recurrent infections and symptoms that come and go over a period of months. Some men can have prostatitis without any symptoms; this is known as asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. Many men don't realize they have this kind of inflammation in the prostate until they are trying to get their [partner pregnant](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and go through male infertility testing. Chronic prostatitis can negatively affect sperm count and male fertility. CPPS, pain in the prostate area or sexual organs, is thought to be related to autoimmune disorders, and/or stress. Obesity can also affect pain in prostate by adding extra pressure. Medical Treatment for BPH and Prostatitis When you go see your medical doctor about BPH, first they will likely do a rectal exam, which is how they can check the size of the prostate gland, and blood and urine tests to check for bladder infection, kidney infection, or prostate infection. They will also check PSA levels (prostate-specific antigen), which can indicate enlargement of the prostate. Normal PSA levels vary depending on age. If PSA levels go up significantly over a short period of time, it is considered a possible indication of [prostate cancer risk](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-age-specific-screening-guidelines), and your doctor may recommend further testing, like a biopsy. [Treatment for BPH](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370093) can involve medications called alpha-blockers that relax the muscles of the bladder and prostate (Flomax). 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are drugs that affect the hormones and can cause the prostate to shrink. These medications can take a while to be effective, and for some patients, they are not particularly helpful. There are also several types of surgery that are used to help BPH by removing parts of the prostate to help relieve pressure on the urethra, or by blocking blood flow to the prostate to prevent further growth. These surgeries are not indicated for all cases, though, and can have negative results for some men, including infections, bleeding, and ED. Antibiotics are used to [ treat prostatitis](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-prostatitis-any-cause-for-optimism-20091103211) and other UTIs related to enlarged prostate. These usually work well for acute infections, but not so well for chronic cases. Antibiotics are not effective for treating CPPS, which is by far the most common type of prostate problem. Can Acupuncture Help BPH Enlarged Prostate? TCM is a complete medical system that goes back thousands of years in China, with many written records of acupuncture points and herbal formulations used to treat all kinds of health problems. The TCM view of the organ systems of the body is a bit different from the way they are understood in western medicine. For example, TCM sees the reproductive organs as being related to the functioning of other organs, like the kidneys and liver. The prostate is considered to be closely related to the kidney system, and if the Qi (life force energy) of the kidneys or liver is weak, excess dampness and heat can begin to build up in the lower region of the pelvic area. TCM recognizes the strong connections between emotions and physical health. Feelings of anger and pent-up frustrations are associated with liver stagnation, while [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), worrying, and overworking can impact the kidneys and spleen. Lifestyle habits like lack of sleep, lack of exercise, poor diet, using drugs, or overdoing sexual activities can also create conditions for men's health issues like BPH to become problematic. An acupuncturist will look at each individual's situation to determine which organs are involved, and will use a [cupuncture points for prostate pain](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Maintaining+Prostate+Health+with+Acupuncture+and+Oriental+Medicine) and Chinese herbs for prostate inflammation to help restore balance to men's hormones and energy. Acupuncture to treat BPH and acupuncture points for prostatitis can help to relieve difficult urination, and pain in the prostate area, without down time or negative side effects. A [clinical trial](https://www.nature.com/articles/pcan201513) of 100 patients treated with acupuncture for BPH over the course of 6 weeks showed that over 90% of the men responded positively, reporting less pain in the prostate and improved urinary functioning. A systematic [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380320/) of eight studies involving over 650 men treated for BPH with TCM showed significant positive changes in men's health outcomes. A [review of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3739225/) using Chinese herbs for BPH suggested that herbal treatment for BPH may work even better than alpha-blockers. Acupuncture Near Me for BPH in Santa Monica, California Most men will deal with BPH as they go through the aging process, but there are steps you can take to minimize prostate problems. If you are feeling pain in the prostate, urgency to urinate, peeing more frequently, or like you can't empty your bladder completely, it might be worth it to try acupuncture and herbs to help prostate enlargement. Unlike medical treatments for BPH, there really is no downside to trying acupuncture for men's health issues. Dr. Tan and Dr. Cai at Art of Wellness in West Los Angeles have over 30 years of experience helping men improve their [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and sexual health. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ How to Treat UTI With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Why do I feel like I have to pee all the time? A urinary tract infection, usually referred to as UTI, is a bacterial infection that affects the bladder and/or other parts of the urinary system, causing urinary urgency, often accompanied by a burning pain when you go to the bathroom. [Acupuncture and TCM](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=28133) is a good way to get to the root causes of [frequent urination](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/frequent-urination/basics/causes/sym-20050712), including [recurrent UTIs](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16315). Urinary frequency, or an unusual urgency to urinate, can be caused by several different health conditions. A common cause of bladder pain, pressure on the bladder, or a burning sensation when peeing is a bacterial infection in the urinary tract, or UTI. But there can be many other reasons for constantly feeling like you have to pee, including [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), interstitial cystitis (IC), pregnancy, prostate problems, [ovarian cysts](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and more. Over half of all adult women have experienced a UTI (also called cystitis) at some point in their lives. Many [women get UTIs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502976/) frequently, making them the most common type of non-hospital-related infection in the U.S. Up to 6% of all doctor visits are related to UTIs. A UTI can occur when bacteria, usually E. coli, gets into the urethra and travels up into the bladder, or further into the urinary tract. This can happen because of hygiene habits, after sex or exercising, or the use of contraceptives or period products. It can also happen when urine sits in the bladder for too long, or because a person has a weakened immune system. While UTI treatment at home remedies such as drinking cranberry juice are popular, most women recognize that once they get that constant urge to pee, they have no choice but to rush to the doctor for antibiotics. Typical [UTI medical treatment](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353453) almost always involves confirming the infection by lab analysis, and a prescribed course of antibiotics, along with analgesic medicine (such as Pyridium) to help the UTI pain in bladder. Unfortunately, many women keep getting UTIs. Infections that are [antibiotic resistant](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982) are increasingly common, and antibiotics do not get to the root of the problem. [Interstitial cystitis (IC)](https://www.ichelp.org/about-ic/causes-of-ic/), or [painful bladder syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-interstitial-cystitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is a condition that causes a constant sensation of having to pee, or bladder pressure, even when there is no infection present. Recurrent UTI and IC are a significant source of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) for women, as they can cause almost constant pain and an inability to leave the house due to the constant urge to urinate. UTI in men is not as common as UTI in women. The more common cause of frequent urination in men is [benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which an enlarged prostate presses on the urinary organs, blocking the flow of urine, and causing backup that can lead to bacterial [urinary tract infection men](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/urinary-tract-infection-in-men-a-to-z). Sometimes what feels like a UTI might be something else. Growths in the pelvic area, such as ovarian cysts, [uterine fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or tumors can cause pressure in the bladder, bladder pain, or urinary frequency at night. Even when there is no infection, there may urinary symptoms such as: - Strong urge to pee frequently (more than 8 times per day) - Difficulty urinating - Urine is different color than usual - Pain during peeing, or burning sensation when peeing - Nocturia, frequent urination at night The conventional medicine answer to UTI is antibiotic treatment, but this is not the only answer for everyone. TCM methods of acupuncture and herbs can help with improving the function of bladder and kidney systems, reducing symptoms from recurrent UTIs, as well as helping to address the deeper problems that cause inflammation and pressure in the bladder. Top 10 Urinary Frequency Causes There are many possible causes of [frequent urination](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15533-urination--frequent-urination). - UTI (urinary tract infection, also called cystitis, or bladder infection) - Kidney infection - when bacteria move further up into the urinary tract, the [kidneys](https://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-disease/kidney-problems/kidney-infection.html)can become infected. Sometimes people with [nerve damage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)in the spine cannot feel UTI symptoms (neurogenic bladder), so the infection becomes more widespread. [Bladder stones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354339)- when the bladder does not empty completely, urine can crystallize and form hard stones, causing pain during urination. - Interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome) - a syndrome of urinary pain symptoms, the exact cause of which is unknown. Inflammation of the bladder lining may be due to trauma (from surgery or delivery/birth), overdistension, or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles. - Prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate accompanied by irritation of the nerves in the area; not necessarily an infection, although a bacterial infection of the prostate can occur. - Urinary incontinence - leakage of urine, occurs when the urethral sphincter that controls the flow and stoppage of urine is weak. More common in women and older people. - Vaginitis - inflammation of the vagina, usually due to infection. [Candida, or yeast infection](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is one type of vaginitis. - Diabetes - can cause a variety of urinary problems, due to the body producing more urine to process blood sugar, and nerve damage that leads to urinary retention and incontinence. Constant thirst is also a sign of diabetic urinary symptoms. - Side effects of [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/)in pelvic area - [cancer treatments](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/urination-changes)that affect the pelvis, including radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and surgeries to remove pelvic organs, can all cause irritation or damage to the bladder. - Overactive bladder (OAB) - a group of symptoms, including frequent urination, leakage, nocturia (getting up to pee at night), and primarily, a strong urge to urinate often. Considered to be caused by inappropriate signalling of the nerves that communicate between the brain and the urinary tract organs. Causes of frequent urination vary somewhat according to biological sex. Frequent urination in men is often caused by prostate problems, while frequent urination in women may be due to pregnancy or other womens' health conditions related to the ovaries or uterus. Pressure on the bladder because of pregnancy, or from other organs, can also cause urinary frequency and discomfort. This can happen due to an anterior prolapse, when the pelvic floor is weakened, and the uterus, intestine, or bladder drop from their normal position. When a woman is pregnant, the heavy uterus often causes more frequent urination, or, in some cases, urinary retention. Damage or trauma to the pelvic floor can occur during delivery, so many women experience weak pelvic floor muscles, prolapsed uterus or bladder, and ongoing urinary urgency after they have had a baby. In men, an enlarged prostate or [prostatitis](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/p/prostatitis-(infection-of-the-prostate)) (infection and inflammation of the prostate) can put pressure on the bladder and other parts of the urinary system. A frequent need to pee can also be caused by drinking too much coffee or alcohol, or taking diuretics. Can Acupuncture Help Frequent Urination? In Chinese Medicine, urinary problems come under the classification of \"Lin Syndromes.\" Lin disorders generally involve painful, \"dribbling\" urination and are caused by disharmonies in the Bladder and Kidneys, as well as involving other major organs like the Heart, Liver, and Spleen. Dampness and Heat are the primary pathogenic factors, so we use acupuncture treatment and herbal formulations to clear heat and dampness from the body. Top 5 TCM differentiations of UTI: - Damp Heat - characterized by frequent urination, burning sensation when peeing, painful pressure in bladder, dark urine or cloudy urine that smells unusual, feelings of nausea, bitter taste in mouth - Heart Fire - frequency and urgency, thirst, hot, red face and chest, trouble sleeping/insomnia, irritability, anxiety, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Liver Fire - excess heat causes painful burning during urination, headaches, [ringing in ears/tinnitus,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/)constipation, feelings of anger and frustration, redness in eyes and face. - Fatigue Lin - covers urinary disorders that involve incomplete emptying of the bladder, due to prostate enlargement or prolapsed pelvic organs. - Stone Lin - obstructions of the urinary system due to buildup of minerals that create stones in the bladder, [kidney stones](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), etc. Patients who have problems with recurring UTIs may be resistant to the antibiotics they've been given. TCM herbs can be used as an additional or alternative remedy from antibiotics and help to strengthen the immune system overall. [One review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481503/) of studies involving the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for UTIs concluded that the herbs, whether used alone or in conjunction with antibiotics, worked better than antibiotics alone. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447293/) showed that women who were prone to getting UTIs who were treated with acupuncture as preventative care only got a UTI one-third as often as women who didn't receive acupuncture. Acupuncture has also [been shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28326514/) to be highly effective for bladder pain due to interstitial cystitis. Studies have also shown that [TCM treatment](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1823-acupuncture-restores-urine-flow-blocked-by-enlarged-prostate) can relieve the blockage of urine caused by an enlarged prostate (BPH). Top 5 Tips for Preventing UTI What a relief! Now that you've gotten over that urinary tract infection, it's important to take steps to prevent getting another UTI. Here are some natural ways to prevent UTIs: - Drink more water - This may seem counterintuitive, as you don't want to have to pee even more. But you do want to be constantly flushing bacteria out of the urinary tract. Avoid drinks like coffee and soda, which can be irritating to the bladder. - Go when you feel you need to - Some therapies for overactive bladder or IC involve training yourself to hold urine, but for most people, this is not a good idea. Retaining urine for too long contributes to bacterial growth and causes overdistension of the bladder. - Hygiene - be sure to wipe from front to back when you go to the bathroom. Change clothes and underwear often, especially after sweating. During your menstrual period, change your pad and tampon frequently. - After sex - always go to the bathroom and urinate before falling asleep. - Avoid chemical products - Avoid using deodorants, douches, or scented wipes around the genital area. Consider whether contraceptive products like spermicides might also be part of the problem. Acupuncture Near Me for UTI While it is rare for a UTI to become so serious that you have a fever or become nauseated, urinary problems should be taken seriously before they become worse. If your UTIs keep coming back, or you constantly feel like you have to pee, it may be a sign that there is something deeper going on. As people age, urge incontinence, prolapsed organs due to weak pelvic floor muscles, and nerve damage can lead to more serious bladder problems. TCM provides a holistic way to treat urinary tract issues, as well as other, possibly hidden conditions in the pelvic region. Urinary urgency may be a signal of something else, so don't ignore it. Consult with your acupuncturist to find urinary frequency relief. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Herpes Simplex With Acupuncture and TCM & Xiaomei Ph.D. Cold sores around mouth, blisters on lips? Burning, itching sores around the genital area? Herpes simplex is a skin disorder caused by one of two viral infections: HSV-1 or HSV-2. TCM methods, including a painful [herpes](https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/treatment.htm) outbreak and prevent herpes simplex outbreaks in the future. Herpes simplex is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-05-2020-massive-proportion-world-population-living-with-herpes-infection) kinds of infectious disease, affecting several billions of people worldwide. It is estimated that about 66% of the world's population has had a HSV-1 infection at some point in their lives. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the viral infection that is associated with [oral herpes](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/herpes-hsv1-and-hsv2/oral-herpes) or orolabial herpes-the one that causes sores around the mouth, often referred to as \"cold sores\" or \"fever blisters.\" Herpes simplex virus type is the kind that causes genital herpes. Herpes virus is related to varicella-zoster viruses, the viruses that cause Chickenpox and [Shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). How do you get herpes? The skin infection caused by herpes simplex spreads from person to person through close contact. HSV-1, or oral herpes, can spread through sharing utensils, toothbrushes, or towels, or by touching one of the mouth sores, or kissing. HSV-2, or genital herpes, is usually spread through sexual contact is therefore considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD). In fact, either one of the two viral infections can cause sores on the mouth or genital area, or even on other parts of the body. If oral herpes, or HSV-1, gets into the eyes, it can cause serious damage, even causing scarring or permanent loss of vision. A person can pass herpes to another person even if they aren't having an active outbreak with visible sores. A pregnant woman can pass the herpes virus to her baby during birth, and the virus can also be passed during breastfeeding. Once a person has been infected with HSV-2, the virus stays in the body and can lie dormant, then resurface in periodic recurrent outbreaks. Initially, herpes skin disorders manifest in the skin cells, causing the red, painful, blister-like sores. After a while, the infection moves deeper, into the nerve cells, where it can lie dormant until something happens to activate it again, like an illness or stressful life event. Medical treatment for herpes simplex focuses on minimizing the pain of an outbreak of sores and attempting to prevent future outbreaks with antiviral medications. People who have genital herpes must take care to practice safe sex and avoid sex during outbreaks in order to prevent spreading herpes to their partners. People with herpes can suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) brought on by the knowledge that they may have to live with this highly contagious viral infection for the rest of their lives, and with the danger of possibly transmitting herpes simplex to others with whom they are intimate. Fortunately, TCM herbs and acupuncture offer an alternative medicine option for dealing with herpes simplex. TCM can help with quick healing of the burning sores that signify an outbreak, but can also work on a deeper level to strengthen the immune system so that it can fight the virus better from within. Top 5 Symptoms of Herpes Simplex [Signs of a herpes](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/herpes-simplex-symptoms) simplex infection depend on which type of viral infection you have, and where the infection spreads. Usually, symptoms manifest either around the mouth or genital area, but sometimes the herpes virus can spread to the eyes (herpes keratitis). The most common symptoms of herpes include: - Itching, burning, tingling around the mouth or genital area - Painful, fluid-filled blisters or sores around the mouth or genital area - Flu-like symptoms: fever, body aches, swollen glands - Trouble urinating, [burning sensation when peeing](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Pain in eyes, cloudy vision Once a person has had their first symptomatic period of a [herpes infection](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4248-genital-herpes-hsv-2), they may have recurrence of symptoms periodically-in some cases, frequently. The majority of people who have been infected with HSV-2 experience another outbreak within a year; some people experience recurrent outbreaks several times a year or as often as once a month. There are a few other skin conditions that might sometimes be mistaken for herpes simplex. Impetigo is a bacterial infection that can cause red sores to form around the mouth and nose. \"Jock itch\" is a fungal infection that can cause a red rash in the groin area. Folliculitis is when hair follicles become inflamed and form pimples with pus; this can happen in the facial or genital region due to shaving, but it can also be related to herpes, if the viral infection causes irritation and blockages in the hair follicles. Molluscum contagiosum is another viral skin infection that causes raised lesions to form; however, they are generally painless and flesh-colored, not similar to herpes lesions. [Bacterial vaginosis](https://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/default.htm), a common bacterial infection which can cause a burning sensation in the vagina, may increase a woman's chances of getting herpes and other STDs. What Triggers a Herpes Outbreak? The herpes virus is similar to the varicella virus (chickenpox) in that it stays in the body long after the initial infection, and can flare up and cause trouble later on. The varicella virus can lie dormant for many years, and then emerge as a case of Shingles late in life, causing a very painful rash. Herpes can cause rare or frequent outbreaks, depending on the severity of the initial infection, how or if it was treated, and what sort of care a person takes to prevent recurrences. A person who has experienced recurrent outbreaks may become aware of early signs that show up a few days before sores actually break out on the skin, such as tingling or shooting pain in the genital area or around the hips or legs. The things that can trigger a herpes simplex outbreaks include: - Illness, fever - Suppression or weakness of the immune system - Exposure to sunlight, changes of the season or temperature - Menstrual period, hormonal changes - Prolonged period of stress, emotional stress - Surgery, trauma Medical Treatment for Herpes Simplex The typical treatment for herpes simplex HSV-1 and famciclovir These medications may be taken intermittently, to help treat outbreaks when they occur, or, in some cases, may be recommended for daily usage to help prevent outbreaks from occurring. For some people, these medications help to reduce the frequency of outbreaks, and there is some evidence that they may help prevent a person's sexual partner from being infected. However, these antiviral medications do not help everyone who has herpes simplex. They can only reduce the spread of the virus in the body; they do not eliminate it completely. Some people may become allergic or resistant to the drugs. Some people experience side effects, including potentially serious kidney problems or unusual bleeding. TCM treatment with herbs and acupuncture can help to reduce the severity of herpes outbreaks and prevent recurrence, without any negative side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Herpes? From the TCM point of view, the redness and burning of the blister-like rash that accompanies viral infections like herpes and varicella is caused by heat and dampness. Clearing heat and damp from the liver and gallbladder will usually be one of the primary goals of acupuncture treatment and herbal supplementation, as this will help to quickly cool down an outbreak of the painful sores. Maintaining the health and balance of the liver system long-term will help to prevent future outbreaks. TCM also factors in emotional well-being when considering each individual's presentation of a disease. The flare up of herpes simplex viral infection is associated with stress and negative emotions, especially anger. Anger is connected to the Liver and Gallbladder, and also to the eyes, which is why sometimes the herpes skin disorder will manifest in the eyes. Learning lifestyle behaviors and dietary choices that will help to balance the emotions and reduce excess heat in the body will also help reduce the occurrence of herpes flare ups.
