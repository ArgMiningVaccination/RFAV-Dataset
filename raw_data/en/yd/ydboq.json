This document has been prepared by Many Hands Sustainability Center (MHSC) as part of its Nutritional Education and Job-Training Program , a program that offers former prisoners recovering from drug and alcohol addiction an opport unity to develop job skills, learn about all aspects of organic farming, and become educated about proper nutri tion and healthier lifestyle choices. This document has been prepared to educate people about how drugs and alcohol can disrupt the normal functioning of the body and how better nutrition can help diminish some of these biochemical and digestive problems. This document only focuses on one speci fic component of a comprehensive recovery treatment program\u2014better nutrition. It is not intende d to be used as a substitute for a doctor's advice or as a recovery treatment program. While research indicates that vitamin supplemen tation (e.g., amino acids, vitamins) may also be used successfully to support addiction recovery e fforts, especially at the start of a recovery program when biochemical imbalances are at th eir highest, this document primarily focuses on how to get the proper nutrients from food. A lthough the information contained herein was specifically compiled to help recovering drug and alcohol addicts, it may be useful to a wide range of people who work or live with recoveri ng addicts or for people who consume a \"typical American diet\" heavy in carbohydr ates, sugar, and caffeine. Although we all eat, few really think about what we are eating and what it can do to our bodies. We rely on very incomplete, simplistic, and often incorrect bits of nutritional \"knowledge\" in making our food choices, and we expect our bodi es to cope with whatever we give them. In recovery, this kind of behavior simply do esn't cut it (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Numerous resources relating to nutrition and addiction were cons ulted in the creation of this document, many of which are listed in the Section VII. List of Resources at the end of it. Many Hands Sustainability Center, located in Barre, Massachusetts, is a nonprofit educational center estab- lished in 2007 to educate about sustainable living, organic farming, and good nutrition. The Center is an outgrowth of Many Hands Organic Farm, which since 1984 has offered over 300 educational workshops on food/nutrition and organic farming and has helped launch a number of successful farm education programs across Massachusetts. 3II. What Is Addiction? Addiction is a complex physical and mental disease. Drug and alcohol addiction is a complex disease. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain diseas e. It is considered a brain disease because studies have shown that drugs and alcohol physically change the structure of the brain and how the brain works. In particular, drugs and alcohol have been shown to alter areas of the brain that can result in impaired judgment, la ck of self control, the inability to regulate emotions, and lack of motivation, memory or learning function. These documented brain changes can lead to uncontrollable cravings th at become more important than anything else\u2014 family, friends, career, or even one's own health, personal safety, and happiness. While drug and alcohol addicts have been hi storically thought to be weak willed, moral wrongdoers, or mentally ill, this type of brain research suggests otherwise. It suggests that addiction has physical roots as well as psychologi cal ones. These physical changes can often lead to severe biochemical imbalances (or exacerbate preexisting ones), nutritional deficiencies, and digestion problems. As the body becomes more and more imbalanced, it relies more on drugs and alcohol to alleviate the problems and to ma ke it feel balanced. Unfortunately, however, drugs and alcohol can only temporarily change one's mood or emotional state. Once the effects wear off, the user often seeks another short-te rm dose of relief. So unless these biochemical imbalances are addressed and corrected, in part through proper nutrition, a vicious cycle occurs with a greater need for drugs and alcohol to correct the imbalances. In addition to these biochemical imbalances, genetic predispositions (i.e., nutritional n eeds, metabolism) and ethnicity, food allergies/ sensitivities, poor dietary choices , psychological distress or mental illness, exposure to toxins and social pressure s can make a person more vulnerable to addiction or make it more difficult for a pe rson to stay clean and sober. Research has shown that a majority of addict s suffer from some of the following biochemical, nutritional, and metabolic disorders. Each of these disorders is di scussed further in this document and must be corrected before people can have the freedom and ability to choose addiction-free living (Finnegan, 1989). Depleted or malfunctioning brain ch emicals called neurotransmitters. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, that causes a wide range of sy mptoms like anxiety, fatigue, depression and panic attacks, as well as poor adrenal function. Digestive problems such as the overgrowth of yeast, Leaky Gut Syndrome, and the malabsorption of nutrients. Food allergies or sensitivities to common foods such as co rn, wheat, sugar, and dairy products. Nutritional deficiencies of key amino acids, vitamins (e.g., B-complex and vitamin C), and minerals (e.g., zinc, magnesium, and calcium). 4 Addiction Recovery Programs Historically most drug and al cohol treatment programs have included counseling and 12-step approaches like Alcoholics A nonymous (AA). While these ty pes of psychologically-based efforts are a necessary part of a successful recovery program, th ese approaches alone have not been shown to be very effective. For example, studies have shown that AA has a success rate of around 25 percent (Sehnert, 1992; Larson, 1992). Unfo rtunately, these efforts often address the psychological aspects of the disease without consid ering the physical aspects of the disease. As Dr. Charles Gant found after work ing as the physician and psychi atric consultant for the New York State prison system and dealing with hundred s of drug users and traffickers serving prison terms and documented in his book End Your Addiction Now : \"Unless the biochemical imbalances which are the true causes of substa nce problems are correcte d, the benefits of psychological counseling will be marginal for most people.\" While traditional recovery programs do help many people across the world, some lesser-known integrated, holistic programs rooted in nutri tion are reporting great success. Kathleen DesMaisons, Ph.D. and president of Radiant Recovery in Burlingame, California, for example, reports a 92 percent success rate in her nutri tionally-based program with alcoholics. Joan Mathews Larson, Director of the Health Recovery Center, reports a 70 percent recovery rate in her program which connects drug dependence wi th malnutrition and addresses common sugar sensitivities. In additi on to the psychological aspects of a ddiction, these type s of nutritionally- based treatment programs focus on the physical as pects of addiction. They work to correct biochemical imbalances, fix nutritional deficienci es, and manage digestive problems\u2014all keys to improving and stabilizing energy levels, mood, and mental clarity, which can lead to a more successful recovery (Atkinson, 2009). 5III. Addiction in the Brain Drugs and alcohol can disrupt how the brain functions. The brain functions primarily as the communication and control cen ter of the body. It is made up of billions of cells, called neurons, which communicate within the brain and to other parts of the body to perform all physical and mental activities. The brain is composed of three parts\u2014brain stem, limbic system, and cerebral cortex\u2014that co ntrol all the bodily functions from breathing and digesting food to thinking and controlling emotions. Neurons in the brain are working all the time, even during sleep. Because of all this activity, brain neurons require about twi ce the amount of fuel, or energy, that other cells in your body do (Franklin Institute, 2000). Neurons get this fuel from glucose, or blood sugar, which the body makes from the carbohydrates and other foods that you eat. Neurons in the brain do not have the ability to store glucose so they need a consta nt and steady supply of it to function properly. This need for a steady supply of glucose is often met with sugary snacks, sodas, and refined and processed food\u2014a common diet for recovering a ddicts who often trade one drug for a more widely accepted legal \"drug\" like sugar, caffeine, or nicotine. If too many sugary snacks filled with simple sugars are consumed, then severe fluctuations of glucose levels in the body can occur\u2014affecting how the brain functions and leading to common problems facing recovering addicts such as hypoglycemia and adrenal fa tigue (discussed below in Section IV. Addiction in the Body .) Neurotransmitters: Chemical Messengers in the Brain Brain neurons communicate with each other through an intricate ne twork of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitte rs work in the body to relieve pain, control stress, and produce all the reactions needed to shape how you think, act, and feel. These neurotransmitters travel from one neuron to the ne xt to deliver messages to receptor sites. Once a message is received at the receptor site, the neurotransmitter returns to be reused for another message or it is broken down by enzymes in the body and destroyed. Receptor sites are highly specializ ed and respond to only a particul ar set of messages carried by specific types of neurotransmitters. Some describe this process like a key fitting into a lock; only certain neurotransmitters can fit with certain receptors. Drugs and alcohol disrupt these natural processes in the brain by mimicking or otherwis e interacting with the neurotransmitters at receptor sites to prolong or accele rate the brain's natural proce sses. Some drugs, for example, occupy receptor sites and turn sign als to your body up or down while others turn signals on or off altogether. 6Neurotransmitters are manufactured in the brai n by assembling them from the nutrients in the food you eat, specifically amino acids found in pr otein-rich foods. If you have insufficient nutrients in your diet, like most rec overing addicts, you may produce inadequate neurotransmitters \u2014further disr upting your brain balances. Imbala nces like these can alter your mood and behavior and set up more cravings for drugs, alcohol, and other substances like refined sugar for a temporary fix. More specific information about Common Nutritional Deficiencies for recovering addict can be found in Section V. of this document. An Imbalanced Brain When the brain is receiving a ll the nourishment it needs throu gh food and is not receiving any mixed signals from outside drugs and alcohol , the brain neurons can function properly and naturally maintain a proper balance of neurotransmitters. However, once the inner balance of the brain is disrupted because of these outside chem icals or because of inad equate diets that are nutrient deficient and too high in su gar, the natural balance is disr upted. The brain is then forced to compensate in other ways. The brain may ope n up more receptors (upr egulate) or, if it not getting enough of a particular brain chemical, produce more of it. It may shut down receptors (downregulate) to produce less of a certain chemical if it appear s to be getting too much. The brain may also communicate that it is unhappy by sending physical messages to the body in the form of such things as headaches, joint pains, irritability, or diarrhea; these flu-like withdrawal symptoms are common problems fo r most recovering addicts. There are many different chemicals in the brain that function as neurotransmitters, but some common ones affecting mood and be havior and often linked with drug and alcohol addiction are described below\u2014serotonin, endorphins, GAB A, and catecholamines (e.g., dopamine and norepinephrine). Each of these can be severely disrupted and depleted in people with drug and alcohol addiction. Serotonin Serotonin is a brain chemical th at helps to regulate mood, sleep, pain, emotion, and appetite, as well as other aspects of brain function. This ch emical influences self-c ontrol, impulse control and the ability to plan ahead. Normal sero tonin levels, for example, prevent you from emotionally overreacting to difficu lt and frustrating situations. Some drugs disrupt the producti on, release, and reuse of sero tonin. Ecstasy (also known as MDMA or 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), for example, causes serotonin chemicals to remain in receptors for an abnormally long time. This keeps the receiving neurons artificially stimulated and temporarily increases the amount of serotonin in the brain. Eventually, the brain thinks it is producing too much serotonin and thus slows the natural production down (NIDA, 2006). The inability to produce serotonin in adequate amounts can result in emotional burnout from frequent emotional outbursts. It is also one of the primary causes of depression. People who have low serotonin levels do not have good impulse c ontrol and can often have shortened attention spans and feel depressed, and scattered. Low levels of serotonin can lead to cravings for simple carbohydrates like bread, pasta, a nd candy. Eating sugary and highly- refined or processed foods artificially stimulate the release of serotonin and elevates the serotonin levels in the brain, which make you feel more relaxed and comfortable after consuming them (Gant and Lewis, 2010). 7Nicotine and other highly-processe d foods can have a similar effect as well as (Wurtman and Wurtman, 1995). Endorphins Endorphins are brain chemicals that are naturally manufactured in the brain when the body experiences pain or stress. Endorphins help you feel good and are sometimes referred to as \"natural pain relievers\" or the natural opiates of the body. Endorphins help block the transmission of pain signals a nd allow you to continue physical ac tivity even in the presence of inflammation or injuries; they are responsible fo r what long-distance runners experience as the \"runner's high.\" Some drugs can disrupt the normal functioning of endorphins in your body. For example, opiate drugs like morphine, heroin, prescription painki llers (e.g., codeine, methadone, and Demerol), and alcohol have chemical structures that mimi c the shape of natural endorphins produced by the brain. That means that these drugs can bind to and occupy pain receptors designed to accept naturally-occurring endorphins. These drugs also interfere with the natural enzymes that break dow n the endorphins as part of the natural recycling of the neurotra nsmitters. As a result the drug occupies the receptors for longer periods of time, numbing pain and producing higher levels of euphoria. When the body's endorphins are not naturally being produced or th e receptors are not working correctly, you have a strong urge to get opiates elsewhere (like fr om marijuana or poppy plants) which make you feel good for a while. Then it wears off. This is w hy these drugs can become highly addictive. If your endorphin level is low, you may feel depr essed, impulsive, or victimized. You may also feel isolated, touchy, and tear ful. You may crave sugar, as many recovering addicts do. Researchers have discovered that the immune system is primarily made up of endorphin receptors. In fact, over 90 per cent of the receptors on all the immune cells of our bodies are endorphin receptors (Cowen, 2008). That means th at endorphins are the fuel for the proper functioning of the immune system and without them, you have a compromised ability to protect against such things as bacteria, viruses, can cer, and autoimmune di seases\u2014problems that are often higher for drug a nd alcohol addicts. Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) GABA is a brain chemical associated with me ntal relaxation in the body, as opposed to the emotional relaxation produced by serotonin. GAB A is important to he lp calm racing thoughts and is often associated with sleep. It has been labeled the \"natural Vali um of the brain\" (Gant and Lewis, 2010) because it works so well. GAB A also regulates moods by controlling other neurotransmitters in the body such as sero tonin, nonradrenaline, and dopamine which are discussed below (Cass and Holford, 2002). People often use alcohol and othe r depressants (e.g., Valium, Xana x) to unwind and relax. Part of what is really happening is that those substances are mimi cking the effects of naturally- produced GABA in the brain. While initially the a nxiety may be controlled, use of these types of substances can significantly impact the normal production of GABA in the brain. GABA production in the brain can also be disrupted when a diet is deficient in glutamine, which is one amino acid that makes GABA. Glutamine is th e single most abundant amino acid in the body and is involved in most bodily biochemical reactions (Gant and Lewis, 2010). Glutamine is 8especially important for the production of energy when sugar is in short supply. It is also important in digestion. If a person is deficient in GABA, it can be mo re difficult to relax as GABA deficiencies are associated with chronic anxiety and panic att acks as well as sleep pr oblems (Cass and Holford, 2002). Those deficient in GABA often have cravings for things such as carbohydrates, alcohol, nicotine, and other substances th at temporarily help you relax. Dopamine and Other Catecholamines Dopamine and norepinephrine are the two primar y catecholamine neurotransmitters produced by the brain. These handle the energizing functions of the brain and are required for you to focus intently on tasks or stay alert. Dopamine regulates short-term activ ities such as a burst of intense concentration while norepenephrine cont rols more sustained alertness. Stressful situations cause the brain to over-r elease catecholamines. When in the middle of a stressful situation at work or home, for example, you need more of the catecholamines to retain focus and keep going. This over-increased produc tion can cause the body to become depleted, which can leave you tired and unmotivated or with an inability to concentrate. Some stimulant drugs function by disrupting the na tural production and recy cling of dopamine in the brain. For example, amphetamines occupy dopamine receptors directly and mimic the effects of naturally-produced dopamine; they trick the br ain into thinking it is na turally producing those chemicals. Cocaine and cocaine-like substa nces like Ritalin do not allow the dopamine neurotransmitters to be recycled back to be re used or destroyed after delivering the message to the receptor. This causes dopamine to build up to abnormally high levels in the brain and is what causes the initial euphori a commonly reported by cocai ne abusers (NIDA, 2009). Recovery Foods for Neurotransmitters As described above, addictive substances can di srupt the balance of neurotransmitters in your brain, thereby affecting your m ood, mind, memory, and behavior. Y our diet can also influence the balance of neurotransmitters as well. If your diet is too low in the amino acids derived from the protein you eat, then you cannot make the nece ssary neurotransmitters. You can work toward correcting these brain imbalances by eliminating addictive substances lik e nicotine and sugar\u2014 that are hard to quit\u2014and by making sure you supply your brain with enough high-protein foods, which provide the body with the amino acids nece ssary to make neurotransmitters, along with essential fatty acids like Omega-3s which are discussed in de tail in Section V. Common Nutritional Deficiencies later in this document (Cass and Holford, 2002). The neurotransmitter serotonin, for example, is ma de from the amino acid tryptophan. If a diet is too low in tryptophan, then serotonin ca nnot be made. Julia Ross, author of The Diet Cure and The Mood Cure , suggests eating the following protein -rich foods containing tryptophan and serotonin along with carboh meals: pum pkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds, hazelnuts (a.k.a. filberts), al monds, pork, beef, wild game, shrimp, chicken, turkey, tempeh, tofu, kelp, bananas, and milk (if you are not dairy in tolerant). Ross also recommends a few other techniques to raise sero tonin levels: 1. Trying th e herb St. John's Wort, which has been shown to increase serotonin activ ity; 2. Exercising to tempor arily raise serotonin; and 3. Getting enough light, even if just from fu ll-spectrum light bulbs that mimic the sun, to 9help encourage the brain to take in extra tryptophan and help t hose who tend to get depressed in the winter and the evening. Full spectrum lighti ng also helps vitamin D levels and helps with absorption of vitamin C. In general, most experts recommen d that those in recovery consum e a diet that consists of high- protein meals at regular intervals to regulate the production of neurotransmitters and keep you free from cravings. Many of the nutritionally-based programs reviewed for this document also recommend supplementation of multiple amino acids (see the \"Nutritiona l Supplements\" at the end of Section V. Common Nutritional Deficiencies further in this document). Summary of Abused Substances an d Associated Health Problems The table below outlines, by substance, the neurotransmitters disrupted as well as some of the other associated health problems, most of which are discussed further in this document. (Table information from Gant and Lewis, 2010.) Drug Neurotransmitters Affected Associated Health Problems Alcohol GABA Serotonin Endorphins/Enkephalins May cause an excessive production of insulin, which can lead to hypoglycemia and diabetes. Makes liver work overtime to detoxify the body, which can lead to liver disease. May lead to osteoporosis as al cohol has a diuretic effect and causes the body to get ri d of fluids which depletes minerals, including calcium, as it draws fluids from the body. Disrupts neurotransmitters serotonin and GABA, which may lead to sleep disorders. Can cause migrai ne headaches and high blood pressure. Disrupts neurotransmitters that maintain a healthy emotional state which can lead to depression and anxiety. Disrupts production of the natural painkilling neurotransmitters endorphins/enkephalins, which can lead to an extremely low tolerance for pain. May lead to gastrointestinal disorders such as acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, leaky gut syndrome, maldigestion, yeast overgrowth , and intestinal bacterial infections. Impairs nutrient absorption by damaging the cells lining the stomach and intestines and disabling transport of some nutrients in the blood. May lead to nutritional deficiencies which cause further absorption problems. Common deficiencies are the amino acid glutamine, magnesium, calcium, and Omega 3 fatty the brain (brain's natural painkillers) sending fa lse signals that there are plenty of endorphins and enkephalins and that the brain's requirements for protein are satisfied. Makes user unaware of the need to eat, setting up a situation where malnutrition is common. Causes a downregulation (or reduction) in the normal production of the body's natural painkilling neurotransmitters to compensate for the over abundance of artificial opioids and can lead to chronic pain. Reduces manufacturing of endorphins and enkephalins, which are made from several amino acids, including tyrosine, glycin, phenylalanine, leucine, and methionine. This causes the brain to pr oduce fewer amino acids and a deficiency which is further exacerbated by malnutrition. Marijuana Dopamine Causes junk food cravings that contribute to dietary imbalances and nutritional defici encies, especially in such 10 things as Essential Fatty Acid s. Overconsumption of junk food also means that many people are consuming too many trans fats which do not support cell membrane function and repair. Also, THC (the psychotropic compound in marijuana) disrupts the normal repair and maintenance of cell membranes. Increases activity of dopamine, which regulates motivation and reward. May lead to depression, listlessness, and unmotivation. Stimulants (e.g., cocaine, catec holamine neurotransmitters in the brain and over-stimulates them, which eventually decreases the brain's ability to produce them. This can lead to problems such as anxiety, panic attacks, or depression. Occupies the neurotransmitte r catecholamine receptors in the brain and sends false signals that the need for food has been satisfied, which can lead to long periods without food and result in malnutrition. Affects catecholamine receptors in and around the heart, which can cause heart arrhythmia or palpitations in severe cases and lead to an increased risk of heart attack. Over-stimulates excitatory neurotransmitters, which can lead to difficulty falling as leep or staying asleep. Exhausts the brain's abi lity to produce relaxing neurotransmitters and may lead to violent and/or criminal/psychotic behavior. Can lead to other health problems like high blood pressure and bronchitis. 11IV . Addiction in the Body Addiction can lead to diet-related problems like hypoglycemia, adrenal fatigue, allergies, and digestive problems. As described above, drugs and alcohol disrupt the inner workings of the brain, causing depleted or imbalanced neurotransmitters in the brai n. These biochemical imbalances are further aggravated by poor diet choices and nutritional deficiencies. All of these biochemical changes deplete the immune system and cause or exacer bate other diet-related problems such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), adrenal fatigue, allergies, and digestive abnormalities such as \"Leaky Gut\" syndrome and intestinal overgrowth of yeast. Each of these conditions is discussed below. Hypoglycemia One common problem for recovering drug and al cohol addicts is hypoglycemia. In fact, some studies on inmates have shown that hypoglycemia rates can run higher th an 85 percent (Stitt, 2004; Schauss, 1981). Hypoglycemia is a state of low blood sugar in the body. While certain illnesses (e.g., liver disease and some types of tumors) can cause some types of hypoglycemia, this is usually rare (Stitt, 2004). A more co mmon form of hypoglycemia, called reactive or functional hypoglycemia, is caused by the type of food consumed (Pfeiffer, 1975; Stitt, 2004). In particular, this condition result s when a person habitually cons umes too many foods containing highly-refined sugar, including alcoho l, as shown in the list below. Hypoglycemia and Alcoholism Research has shown a connection between hypoglycemia and alcoholism. Below is a list of resources, most of which are published by Roberta Ruggiero, President and Founder of The Hypoglycemia Support Foundation, Inc., as listed in her book The Do's and Don'ts of Hypoglycemia . Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution: \"Experience sh ows that when an alcoholic succeeds in getting off alcohol, he usually substitutes sweet s. This is because almost all al coholics are hypoglycemic and sugar provides the same temporary lift that alcohol once did.\" Dr. Joan Mathews Larson, Ph.D. in Seven Weeks to Sobriety : The Proven Program to Fight Alcoholism Through Nutrition lists a number of research studies that demonstrate the connection between hypoglycemia and alcoholism (e.g., J. Poulos, D. St afford and K. Caron compared 100 alcoholics, outpatients and halfway-house residents, to a control group of nurses and teenagers. 96 of the 100 alcoholics were hypoglycemic while only 14 of the control group were. Emanuel Cheraski, M.D. found 75 to 90% of the alcoholics studied were hypoglycemic). James R. Milam, Ph.D. and Katherine Ketcham in Under the Influence : \"While the diagnosis of hypoglycemia may be mistakenly used by people to explain unrelated psychological and emotional problems, there is no question that the great majority of alcoholics suffer from chronic low blood sugar. When given the 5-hour glucose toler ance test, over 95 percent of bot h early- and late-state alcoholics experience a spike in blood sugar after intake of sugar and then a rapid plunge.\" Dr. Harvey M. Ross in Hypoglycemia: the Disease Your Doctor Won't Treat : \"What is most important is the plethora of doctors and counselors who ignore the results of the research that proves that the alcoholic has a blood sugar problem.\" 12Dr. Alexander Schauss in Diet, Crime and Delinquency suggests that if you treat the alcoholics for hypoglycemia there can be a success rate as high as 71% compared to 25% for approaches like AA. Dr. John D. Tintera, M.D concluded after years of research that even recovered alcoholics who have been sober for many years continue to suffer the effects of hypoglycemia and states that \"...by far the most important part of the physiological treatment of alcoholics is the complete restriction of easily absorbed carbohydrates.\" Dr. David Williams in Hypoglycemia: The Deadly Roller Coaster : \"To combat alcohol and other drug abuse, abstinence, proper diet, nutr itional supplementation, and educat ion about abuse and hypoglycemia must be part of the program.\" How Does It Work? When foods are digested, they are broken down into many nutrients. These nutrients are then absorbed into the bloodstream to be used by the body. One of the nutrients absorbed is glucose, or blood sugar. Glucose provides fuel for the body through a complex process. Because sugary or highly-refined foods like white bread, donuts, soda and alcohol are already broken down into their simplest forms, they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and can destroy the natural balance by sending the blood sugar leve ls skyrocketing (Tintera, 2000). To counteract this surge in blood sugar, your body is forced to produce insulin from the pancreas. As the pancreas works to control the frequent and excessive in take of sugars, it can become over-sensitized and produce too much insu lin (Larson, 1997), which in turn removes too much sugar from your bloodstream and causes your blood sugar to drop down below normal levels. When glucose levels drop, cells in the body (and brain) can be starved. This can lead to a host of physical and emotional problems\u2014shakin ess, mood swings, irritability, emotional instability, sudden fatigue, mental confusion\u2014a ll common problems for recovering addicts. When glucose levels drop, it also prompts the adrenal glands to start working and send out adrenaline. This signals the liver to release emergency sugar (glyc ogen) to prevent further insulin shock, which can then trigger more unpleasant re actions like shakiness, weakness, sweatiness, and rapid heartbeat (Larson, 1997). Caffeine, anot her commonly overused beverage for addicts, can also produce these symptoms as it stimulates the adrenal glands to trigger the release of stored glycogen to temporar ily raise blood sugar levels. Consuming excessive amounts of refined sugars in any form gradually breaks down the body's ability to manage blood glucose (Larson, 1997; Ti ntera, 2000). This process, however, may take place slowly over a long period of time. Like an y addiction, you might notice it takes more sugar (or other drug-like substance) to maintain your inner balance and combat the periods of let down. This accumulated roller coaster of ups and downs can damage the adrenal glands because they are forced to work overtime. It can then lead to something known as Adrenal Fatigue, which is discussed in the next section. Recovery Foods for Hypoglycemia Many recovering addicts have inconsistent eatin g patterns and diets full of highly-processed carbohydrates and sugar. This coupled with the extra assault from consuming drugs and/or alcohol can cause a person to have low blood suga r. The best way to manage this type of hypoglycemia is to have glucose enter the bl oodstream steadily. This can be done by changing eating habits: 13 Eliminate simple carbohydrates from your di et, especially highly-refined and processed carbohydrates that are quickly abso rbed by the body. (See Section V. Common Nutritional Deficiencies for more information about carbohydrates and other nutrients.) Replace simple carbohydrates with more complex carbohydrates, or starches, that can be found in foods such as whole grains and vegetables. Add protein and fats to your diet since carbohydrates are absorbed more slowly with fats. Do not skip meals. Instead eat at regular intervals throughout the day to regulate blood sugar levels. If you suspect hypoglycemia, work with a practitione r to get a glucose tolerance test and follow the diet tips as described in V. Common Nutritional Deficiencies and VI. Eating in Recovery later in this document. Adrenal Fatigue Adrenal fatigue is another common problem facing recovering drug and alcohol addicts. Adrenal fatigue is the condition in the body where the adre nal glands do not function at optimal levels. While adrenal fatigue can occur because of st ress or other factors, one common reason for adrenal fatigue in recovering addi cts is the constant demands put on the glands to manage the rise and fall of blood sugar levels in the body as de scribed above. This can cause the adrenals to become overworked and adrenal fatigue to set in. How Does It Work? Adrenal glands are part of the endocrine system and help regulate your mind and body. They are located over the kidneys and are responsible for s ecreting hormones, partic ularly ones that deal with stress. These glands are pa rticularly important because they are the prime regulators of the chemical processing that converts what we eat and drink into subs tances to help our bodies to function, grow, change, rebuild, and repair. Adrenal glands are designed to cope with emergenc ies. For example, they release adrenaline, the hormone that gives you a quick surge of en ergy and mobilizes you when in danger. The adrenaline rush makes your heart pump faster and makes you more alert. It also tells your pancreas to release insulin to reduce the high le vels of sugar in your blood. Unfortunately, if you are under stress, have infections, use drugs, smoke, or have poor eating habits, your body forces the adrenal glands to work more frequently th an designed and can lead to adrenal fatigue. Many people disrupt their adrenals because they consume too much sugar and/or highly-refined carbohydrates. Because these substances are stripped of their v itamins, minerals, and fiber, they are easily and quickly absorbed by the body. This shoots up the blood sugar levels and forces the adrenal glands to go into action. This can ha ppen multiple times daily, something the adrenal glands are not designed to do. Eventually they begin to respond more slowly to the \"danger\" signals and do not reduce the rapi dly rising blood sugar levels as quickly. When your adrenals are reacting slowly or late, your blood sugar conti nues to rise so your body releases more insulin to get the sugar out of your bl ood and into your cells. This se ts up more pronounced blood sugar ups and down and symptoms such as fatigue, re stlessness, confusion, shakiness, frustration, irritable, difficulty remembering, anger, weepine ss, and/or anxiousness. These can lead to other problems like lack of sleep or stress. 14 Recovery Foods for Adrenal Fatigue Your adrenal glands are the regulators of your disposition, your mental efficiency, and your personality. \"Whether they regulate well, and help you, or regulat e poorly, and harm you, depends, in large measure, upon what you eat (Tintera, 2000).\" Like hypoglycemia, adrenal fatigue can be best managed with the diet\u2014s tabilizing your blood sugar levels throughout the day by eating meals at regular intervals. It is especially importa nt to eat a meal in the morning to offset the energy used up th rough the night. Meals should cons ist of unrefined carbohydrates (whole grains) with protein and oils (nuts and seeds) such as oliv e, walnut, fiber, flax and high- quality fish oil. Diets should al so contain a lot of vegetables. Those with adrenal fatigue should also eliminate highly-refined ca rbohydrates, sugar, caffeine, c hocolate, hydrogenated fats, and other types of \"junk\" food. More specific information about nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats can be found in Section V. Common Nutritional Deficiencies of this document . If you suspect adrenal fatigue, consid er getting tested by your doctor. Allergies/Sensitivities Allergies are another common problem for many recoveri ng drug and alcohol addicts. Dr. Charles Gant, former physician a nd psychiatric consultant for th e New York State prison system and author of End Your Addiction Now , notes that a high percentage of his substance abuse patients have multiple allergies and that \"removing specific allergens from their diets and limiting their exposure to environmental allergen s are often significant keys to restoring the emotional and biochemical foundations necessary fo r recovery.\" If identified, foods and other allergens can be avoided in recovery until the digestive systems are healed and capable of handling them again. Allergies to food, pollen, dust, and environmental chemicals can cause or contribute to a wide range of symptoms such as runny nose, headaches , hives, and asthma. In some cases, allergies have also been linked to increased violence (Sti tt, 2004) and conditions such as Attention Deficit Disorder (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Allergies can also lead to digestive problems and a depleted immune system. Environmental Allergies A study at the Health Recovery Center in Calif ornia showed that 56 percent of clients were sensitive to chemicals in th e environment (Larson, 1997). The most common sensitivity was to ethanol, which is found in natural gas, gasoline, paints, automobile exhaust, alcohols, plastics, some hand lotions and perfumes, disinfectan t cleaners, tobacco smoke, and hydrocarbons. Common reactions to those sensitiv e or allergic to environmenta l toxins are fatigue, exhaustion, \"spaciness\", mental confusion, depression, cravings , and irritability. Because of the chemical exposures associated with certain jobs\u2014house pa inters, garage mechanics, hair stylists, printers\u2014people in these occupations may be mo re susceptible to alcoholism than others. Food Allergies People recovering from drug and al cohol addiction often have \"cla ssic\" allergies to pollen as well as allergies to various foods. Some common f ood allergies are: peanuts, milk, eggs, grains (wheat, rye, or corn), tomatoes, citrus fruits, yeast, soy, and choc olate. Studies indicate that some alcoholics may even be allergic to alcohol, or more specifically to the underlying ingredients in alcohol. As cited in Larson ( 1997), Theron Randolph, M.D. in his work with members of AA 15One Study: Milk and Crime The Schauss-Simonsen study in 1978 compared the diets of 30 chronic juvenile offenders to the diets of kids who had behavior problems but no criminal background. They found that the children who got in criminal trouble drank a lot more milk. The results as described by Schauss (Schauss and Simonsen, 1979) and cited in Larson (1997) are: The male offenders consumed an average of 64 ounces of milk a day, while their comparison group only drank an average of 30 ounces daily. Similarly, the delinquent females drank an average of 35 ounces of milk a day, while the comparison group of non-delinquent girls consumed only 17 ounces daily. Among the delinquent boys, two reported drinking more than 113 ounces of milk, or over 14 eight ounce glasses daily. discovered that many alcoholics were allergic and/or addicted to the sugars, grapes, and grains from which alcohol is made. Likewise, Dr. Herbert Karolus studied 422 alcoholics and found that most were allergic to wh eat or rye, the grain bases of many distilled liquors (Larson, 1997). Although some adverse food reactions may be pr esent from birth, some develop over time because of chronic exposure or biological damage. Food allergies may develop with drug and alcohol addiction, due to damage to the gastrointestin al tract. Allergies may also develop over time when eating a limited or repetitive diet or because a diet lacks essential nutrients and fiber (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). While some allergy symptoms ma y occur instantaneously like hi ves or swelling, other reactions make take hours or days to appear, which m eans they may go undiagnosed for a while. When allergies go undiagnosed, and you c ontinue to eat the offending foods, the body is forced to adjust by \"down regulating\" the immune system to essentially ignore the threat. By ignoring threats, however, you are teaching your body to ignore other potentially dangerous threats, increasing your susceptibility to other illnesses and autoimmune disorders. Delayed food allergies can also lead to a vari ety of digestive problems, like L eaky Gut and yeast overgrowth as discussed below. If you crave certain foods, it may also be possible that you are allergic or addicted to those foods. Those foods may then be improperly metabolized in your body and trigger psychoactive chemicals that produce an initial high soon followed by a loss of control and othe r negative symptoms like fogginess, fatigue, and depression. If you suspect allergies or food sensitivities, you should avoid those foods. In order to determine those foods specifically, you may also want to get skin testing and blood sc reens by your doctor. Or check out various diets designed to target allergies (i.e., eliminatio n diet) (Larson, 1997). Leaky Gut If you are allergic or sensitive to certain foods and do not realize it for years, you may unknowingly expose your digestive tr act to substances that can ups et the intestinal lining. The intestinal lining is an importa nt barrier between your inner body and food and beverage you eat; it absorbs nutrients and rejects to xins. If your intestinal lining is inundated with a heavy load of toxins or allergens, it can become inflamed or damaged and disrupt the way the digestive system functions. This can lead to chronic health probl ems like arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Leaky Gut syndrome can occur as a result of taking certain medications, infections, food allergies, or a nutrient-deficien t, low-fiber diet. What happens is that large spaces in the gut eventually develop and allow bacteria, toxins, an d undigested food particle s to mistakenly enter the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, the body r ecognizes them as \"foreign\" invaders and triggers the immune system prompting an allerg ic or autoimmune reaction. Leaky Gut syndrome 16is a common problem associated with allergies, gas, bloating, sy stematic yeast infections, and arthritis. Recovery Foods for a Leaky Gut Because the intestinal lining has the highest ra te of cell turnover in the body, it has a great potential to heal itself; healing your digestive tract can be as impor tant in recovery as rebalancing your brain chemistry (Gant and Lewis, 2010). Dr. Lauri M. Aesoph, N.D, naturopathic physician, medical writer, and Senior Editor for the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine in her book, How to Eat Away Arthritis, recommends a seven-day cleansi ng diet of salads, soups, and juices to give your liver a rest and reduce th e amount of harmful compounds it must manage. Once the purifying week is over, she recommends a nutrient-dense week of basic whole foods to help start mending your gut. These foods are fi lled with fiber and complex carbohydrates and include fresh raw fruits, fresh vegetables (raw or lightly st eamed), beans, and legumes, non- gluten whole grains (i.e., brown rice, quinoa, amar anth, millet), some cold water fish, and a small amount of raw, unsalted seeds along with water, herbal teas and a small amount of canola or olive oil. Certain foods can stress the dige stive system and should be av oided\u2014foods like highly saturated fat, protein, and simple carbohydr ates as well as refined foods . Additives and preservatives create intestinal changes which disrupt digestion and permit passage of oversized molecules into the blood. This not only overwhelms a hardwork ing liver, but disrupts your immune system. Unlike fresh, raw foods, cooked refined foods have very little or no natural enzymes left. This places a greater demand on your body's digestive enzyme reservoir. Yeast/Candida Problems Yeast problems are another problem commonly asso ciated with addiction, especially alcoholism and sugar addictions. This condition, widely kno wn as Candida, or sometimes referred to as Candida-related complex (CRC) or Candida albicans , is widespread and causes a yeast overgrowth in the digestive tract, sinuses, and va ginal area. Pilot studies of the medical records of 213 patients treated at the H ealth Recovery Center in Cali fornia were published in the International Journal of Biosocia l and Medical Research in 1991. Th ey showed that 55 percent of the women and 35 percent of the men had histor ies of probable Candida overgrowth (Larson, 1997). How Does It Work? There are over 400 different types of single-celle d organisms, primarily bacteria and yeast, which inhabit the large intestine and are sometimes referred to as intestinal flora. Some of the microorganisms, like acidophilus and bifidobacter ia, are beneficial. Others like Candida, salmonella, and staphylococcus are harmful. For healthy individuals, a balance is maintained between the good and the bad microorganisms. This ba lance is critical to the digestive process, absorption of nutrients, and production of vitami ns in the body. When the balance is disrupted, the harmful microorganisms, which are usually found only in small amount s in the intestinal tract, start to multiply and outnumber the benefi cial ones. These harmful microorganisms release toxins that may cause localized infections which can spread to the liver a nd other organs. It also forces the immune system to produce antibodies a nd inflammatory mediator s to counteract the effects of toxins. 17Recovery Foods for Yeast Problems Yeast thrives with diets that are filled with highly-refined ca rbohydrates and/or sugar. When yeast digests sugar, it produces alcohol, among ot her toxins. These toxins kill off many forms of bacteria that are beneficial in the body and disrupt the na tural balance. When the body's mechanism for keeping them under control is th rown out of balance (by poor nutrition and drug/alcohol use) the harmful bacteria will flour ish and cause infection in the tissues. Because the yeast feed on carbohydrates, an overgrowth will cause intense cravings for and addictions to alcohol and sweets. These cravings will dimi nish once the infection is under control. Diet can be used to control and reduce yeast pr oblems. Among the resources reviewed for this document, many different types of foods and diet ary plans are suggested. Most plans, however, contain three general steps, as desc ribed by Dr. John Finnegan in his book Addictions: A Nutritional Approach to Recovery : 1. Stop feeding the yeast by eliminating highly-refined and sugary foods and simple carbohydrates and reducing complex carbohydrates; 2. Repopulate the gastrointestinal tract with beneficial bacteria using food and supplements; 3. Eat a nutrient-dense, high fiber diet so the benefic ial bacteria can grow more easily. (Note: In his book he also recommends killing the yeast with various herbal extracts like golden seal, Fortune Delight tea, garlic, calendula, methylsulfanomethane, or other formulas. See book for more details.) Nutritionist Julia Ross, author of The Mood Cure and The Diet Cure , provides more specific information: she suggests eating a nutrient-rich di et for four weeks including eggs cooked at a low temperature, freshly prepared soups (without cream or milk), fres h nuts and seeds, goat cheese, unsweetened yogurt, buttermilk, legumes, beans, lentils, peas, protein (fish, antibiotic- free poultry, beef, lamb), vegetables, whole grains (basmati rice, millet, or amaranth). She also suggests you add some anti-yeas t or anti-fungal foods, such as avocado, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, spices (cinnamon, cloves, oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric), non- hydrogenated coconut oil, collards, fresh lemon, garl ic, kale, olive oil, fl ax oils, and onion. She also recommends avoiding alcohol and yeast- containing foods, like bread and dairy (except butter and unsweetened yogurt) as well as ferm ented products like apple cider vinegar, hops, malts, soy sauce, pickles and other pickled vegeta bles. Other foods to a void are fresh and dried fruit, fruit juices, a ll types of mushrooms, processed meats, and simple carbohydrates, like cookies, muffins, soda, and candy. Her book also describes some anti-yeast supplement programs include lactobacillus, pau d'arco, grapefruit seed extract, garlic, oregano oil, ginger, and biotin. In Seven Weeks to Sobriety: The Proven Progr am to Fight Alcoholism through Nutrition (1997), Larson recommends reducing yeast w ith some natural non-drug yeast supplements such as citrus seed extract (antifungal agent that fights Candida ), caprylic acid (shown to heal the intestinal tract and eliminate or greatly reduce the Candida growth in the intestinal tract), kyolic garlic extract (antiviral, antibacteria l, and antifungal herb), and la ctobacillus acidophilus (friendly bacteria in intestines that compete with the ba d bacteria). She uses these in conjunction with hydrochloric acid with betaine, wh ich help to increase absorption of food and nutrients. She then recommends starving the harmful yeast by eating fewer carbohydrates while raising protein and fat intake and avoiding refine d sugars and other simple-suga r foods, dairy products (except unsweetened yogurt and kefir), and foods that are high in mold and yeast (i.e., cheese, peanuts, alcoholic drinks, and dried fruits). 18Acupuncture (Reuben, 1998) As the Chinese discovered thousands of years ago, inserting needles into the skin at specific sites can make organs and glands work better, helping the body heal from disease. Despite this long history, only in the late 1970s did acupuncture start to become recognized as an e ffective tool in drug detoxification. Today over seven hundred drug treatment centers all over the world use acupuncture as part of their drug treatment programs. Acupuncture can be used to help stop headaches, muscle aches, nausea, insomnia, depression, and other disruptive discomforts of withdrawal that can block recovery. Those who receive acupuncture for drug detoxification do it in conj unction with counseling and other recovery efforts. For example, those in drug treatment programs such as Recovery Systems in Mill Valley, CA and Radiant Recovery in Burlingame, CA receive acupuncture along with counseling, nutritional education, and bi ochemical restoration. In addition to dietary changes, Larson (1997) also suggests strengthening the immune system. She recommends getting dry h eat or sunlight because yeast thrives in wet, cold, and damp conditions; homes with little natural sunlight or homes that have mold or mildew promote yeast overgrowth. She also recommends avoi ding exposure to toxins that can lower immunity\u2014things like chemical sprays and solvents as well as highly-processed foods. She recommends exercise to encourage your lymph fluid to remove bacteria from the body. She also suggests acupuncture to restore the immune, digestive, and eliminative systems, as well as the adrenal glands (see box to the left). 19V . Common Nutritional Deficiencies Many recovering addicts are malnourished. Most recovering addicts have de veloped serious nutriti onal deficiencies of key proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals and disrupted their ability to digest carbohydrates effectively (DesMaisons, 1998; Finnegan and Gray, 1990; Larson, 1997; Stitt, 2004; and others). While some of these nutritional deficiencies are cause d by the physical and biochemical changes that occur from drug and alcohol use, others happen becau se of poor dietary choices. In fact, Barbara Reed Stitt Ph.D., a former pr obation officer and author of Food & Behavior: A Natural Connection, reviewed the diets of t housands of probationers and noticed the following common food patterns: 1. No breakfast. 2. High consumption of sugar and refined carbohydrates. 3. High consumption of processed foods. 4. Low consumption of protein. 5. Low consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. 6. High milk consumption. Dietary habits, such as thos e above, provide too much suga r and too few vital nutrients\u2014 nutrients that are especially important for recovering addicts who ar e battling chemically- depleted brains and bodies, digestive problems, a nd other health issues th at prevent them from absorbing and utilizing nutrients effectively. While research is still discovering new and intr icate ways the body and brain chemistry work, we do know the brain and body require the presence of all nutrients [e.g., vitamins (Vitamin B), minerals, essential fatty acids] in order to functi on properly. Research show s that the lack of a single vitamin or mineral can cause metabolic imb alances that will create addictive cravings (Stitt, 2004; Finnegan, 1989). The late biochemist Roger Williams, for example, found that rats that were deficient in certain vitamins (e.g., V itamin A, thiamine, ribof lavin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin B6) consumed more alcohol than th ose that were not vitamin deficient. But once those vitamins were returned to th e diet, alcohol consumption decreased (Beasley and Knightly, 1994; Williams, 1956). In addition to setting up more cravings, nutritiona l deficiencies can also be a major cause of withdrawal-like symptoms such as fatigue, depr ession, irritability, mental derangement, and other conditions that block recovery and lead to a relapse. Below is a closer look at what specific 20nutrients the body needs\u2014carbohydrat es, proteins, fats, vitamins , and minerals\u2014and which ones are lacking for many recovering addicts. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates provide the sugar, or glucose, needed by all parts of the body for fuel (e.g., brain, central nervous system, kidneys, and muscles). Ca rbohydrates are also important for intestinal health and waste elimination. The USDA recommends 45 to 65 percent of daily calorie intake should come from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates can be found in many types of food and come in two different forms: complex or simple (sugar). Unfortunately, many recovering dr ug and alcohol addicts, like most Americans, consume too many simple carbohydrates a nd too few complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates are found in hi ghly-refined and/or processed foods, sugary colas, alcohol, pastries, and other types of food that c ontain white sugar and white flour . Simple carbohydrates have been stripped of all their nutrients (e.g., enzymes, vitamins, mi nerals) and fiber. They consist primarily of sugar that does not need to be broken down by the body. In fact, simple carbohydrates are broken down so qui ckly by the body that they ar e often absorbed into the blood nearly instantaneously, providing a jolt of energy. In contrast, complex carbohydrates are found in food such as whole grains, nuts and seeds, potatoes, squash, and many other kinds of vege tables. Complex carbohydrates are sometimes referred to as starches and have sugars that are still combined w ith vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Because complex carbohydrates remain combined with other nutrients, the body slowly breaks them down into sugar to be used by the brain and body. This slow breakdown process allows the body to absorb sugar in the bloodstream over a longer period of time, which provides the body with a steady stream of energy. Carbohydrate Nutritional Deficiencies Carbohydrates and sugar are highly addictive (G ant and Lewis, 2010) and often a problem for people recovering from drug and al cohol addiction. In particular, most consume too many simple carbohydrates and not enough complex carbohydrates, which can lead to severe malnourishment as well as problems related to digestion and nutrient absorption, like hyp oglycemia and adrenal fatigue as discussed previously in Section IV. Addiction in the Body of this document. Recovery Foods for Carbohydrates Hypoglycemia, adrenal fatigue, and other carbo hydrate-metabolism health problems are best managed with the diet by incr easing proteins, and reducing si mple carbohydrates and replacing them with more complex carbohydrates in the form of vegetables and whole grains (Fishbein and Pease, 1988). Also, meals should be eaten at regu lar intervals to stabil ize blood sugar throughout the day. Simple carbohydrates that should be avoided or eliminated from th e diet are things like cereals (except oatmeal), breads, pies, cakes, spaghetti and other white pasta, all sweet soft drinks, alcohol, caffeine, and other type s of \"junk\" food that lack nutri ents. These simple carbohydrates should be replaced with complex carbohydrates li ke whole grains, nuts, and seeds, and many vegetables that are more slowly absorbed in the body whereby placing less pressure on your 21Essential Eating any type of protein will raise the amount of amino acids in your bloodstream. However, for amino acids to function, you must either eat complete proteins that contain all the essential amino acids or supplement your diet with other complementary ones. Animal food proteins (meat, fish, eggs, dairy products) are usually complete while plant proteins (vegetables, beans, and grains) are generally incomplete. If eating a vegetarian diet, you must be sure to combine different types of proteins to make sure the body is getting all the essential amino acids. For example, beans and rice combined makes a complete protein while separate they are incomplete. While historically it was thought that each separate meal needed to consist of a complete protein, research now suggests that getting a complete amount of protein over an entire day is sufficient (DeMaisons, 2008). adrenal glands. Also add proteins and high-quality fats (i.e., olive, flax, fish oil) as carbohydrates are absorbed more slowly when consumed with fats. Also note that when purchasing f ood at the store, check the labels to avoid food heavy in sugar. Sugar can be found in many forms such as sucros e, glucose, dextrose, corn sweetener, corn syrup, corn starch, molasses, brown suga r, and honey (Fishbein and Pease, 1988). Proteins and Amino Acids Protein is needed for growt h, tissue repair, healthy immune systems, essential hormone production, digestive enzymes, and energy when carbohydrates are not avai lable. Protein also preserves lean muscle mass. Protein does not usually get absorbed directly into the bloods tream, but rather it is first broken down by the body into amino acids. Some amino acids can be manufactured by the body, but others\u2014essential amino acids\u2014cannot and must be consumed daily for proper functioning of the body. For example, neurotransmitters in the brain are made up of amino acids that you get solely from the pr otein you eat. Another neurotransmitter, serotonin, is derived from tryptophan-rich foods like turkey and milk. According to the Dietary Reference Intakes pub lished by the USDA, 10 to 35 percent of our calories should come from protein. However, re search suggests that ch emical substances like alcohol can impair the digestion of proteins into amino acids, the processing of amino acids by the small intestine and liver, and the amount of protein secreted by the liver (Feinman, 1989). That means you need to eat even more protein and amino acids when recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. Protein/Amino Acid Nu tritional Deficiencies People often underestimate how many proteins/a mino acids are needed for the body to function properly. Every second the bone marrow makes 2.5 m illion red cells. Every four days most of the gastrointestinal tract and blood platelets are re placed. Most of the white cells are replaced in ten days. All this continuous repair wo rk requires amino acids (Braverman, 1987). When a body is under stress or chemically imbalanced, as is the case for most recovering addicts, even more protei n/amino acids are required than normal. For one thing, nonessential amino acids may become essential amino acids as the body works to supply the increased need for amino acids resulting from the increased breakdown caused by drugs and alcohol. Dr. Joan Mathews Larson, Ph.D., director of Health Recovery Center (a holistic center that combines psychological, spiritual, and nutritional components in treatment) notes in her book, Seven Weeks to Sobriety: The Proven Program to Fight Alcoholism Through Nutrition, that alcoholics and drug addicts are often so depleted of amino aci ds that their conversion 22process from protein to amino acids often slows or stops altogether. This deficiency can lead to common recovery problems of depression, poor reca ll, hostile and aggressi ve behavior, mental confusion, anxiety, and paranoia. Hundreds of research studies at Harvard, MIT, and elsewhere have conf irmed the effectiveness of using just a few targeted amino acids \"precursors\" to increase the key neurotransmitters, thereby eliminating depression, anxiety, and crav ings for food, alcohol, and drugs (Ross, 1999). Recovery Foods for Proteins/Amino Acids The brain and the body depend on proteins/amino acids. They are especially important in recovery and can be found in meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, milk, nuts, and legumes as well as in smaller amounts in complex carbohydrates and vegetables. While many people consume a large quantity of their protein from beef (e.g., hamburge rs), that particular pr otein source can be high in fat and not as easily digested as some other sources (Stitt, 2004; Lappe, 1975). Below is a list of alternative high-quality protei n choices. The body doesn't store amino acids, as it does fats or carbohydrates, so it needs a daily supply of amino acids to make new proteins. High Quality Protein Choices (Cass and Holford, 2002) Grains/Legumes Fish/Meat Nuts/Seeds Eggs/Dairy Vegetables Combinations Quinoa, Brown Rice, Tofu, Corn, Chickpeas, Lentils Tuna, Cod, Salmon, Sardines, Chicken Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Cashew Nuts Eggs, Yogurt (natural), Cottage Cheese Peas, Other Beans, Broccoli Lentils and Rice, Beans and Rice Because amino acids play a critical role in promoting good health and proper brain function, most programs reviewed for this document stress ed the importance of eating three to six high- protein meals per day. In addition, most progr ams supplemented a good diet with amino acid supplements (see Nutritional Supplements discussed below), especially at the start of the pro- gram until the body can readjust from all the imbala nces and start absorbing nutrients effectively. Tyrosine is one of the common nutrients supplemented at the start of a recovery program. It is a non-essential amino acid that is a natural stimulant and thought to help turn off chocolate and caffeine cravings. It can be found in natural sources such as algae, kelp, and other seaweeds, milk, sunflower or sesame or pumpkin seeds, pumpkin pulp, banana, and turkey (Ross, 1999). Fats Fats are an important nutrient needed for norma l growth and development as well as for energy. Fats are also needed to absorb certain vitamins (e.g., Vitamins A, D, E, K, and carotenoids) and are needed to maintain healt hy cells in the body (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Fat is also required for the production of serotonin to el evate mood and promote good sleep (Ross, 1999). Fats are composed of fatty aci ds, two of which are known to be absolutely necessary to the body\u2014linoleic acid (Omega-6) and linolenic (Omega -3) acid. These are called the essential fatty acids and they are what the body uses to construct a variety of substances that are important to the functioning of the cardiovascular, immune, a nd nervous systems. These two essential fatty acids are not produced in the body and must be obtained solely from the diet (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). 23Essential Fatty Acids and Alcoholism Researchers have suggest ed that consuming a diet high in naturally-occurring essential fatty acids from fatty fish like mackerel and salmon have caused some people of seafaring areas like Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales to lose the digestive enzymes necessary to build essential fatty acids from other fat sources naturally. That means that once people switched to the more modern diets lacking in essential fatty acids, their bodies did not have the ability to get the proper essential fatty acids like they did from their old diet. Not all people from ethnic backgrounds are going to be deficient in essential fatty acids and develop alcoholism, but if you are a descendent of one of these countries there is a good chance you may have unique essential fatty acid needs. (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Although fats often have a bad repu tation in the era of \"low-fat\" or \"no-fat\" options, the USDA recommends that 20 to 35 percent of your calor ies come from high qual ity fats. There are two main types of fats needed by the body\u2014saturat ed and unsaturated fats\u2014and a third type, hydrogenated/refined fats, wh ich should be avoided. Saturated Fats : These can be found in food like butter, eggs, fish, chicken, meats, and un-hydrogenated coconut oil, and are typica lly high in cholestero l. Saturated fat and cholesterol help stre ngthen cell membranes, protect th e liver from alcohol and other toxins, enhance the immune system, and he lp the body absorb the calcium needed for bone health. Cholesterol from saturated fats is also needed for the proper function of the serotonin receptors in the brai n that regulate mood and emoti ons as discussed previously in Section III. Addiction in the Brain (Engelberg, 1999; Enig and Fallon, 2000). Some saturated fats like butter and un-hydrogenated coconut oil can also help keep you feeling full longer and stabilize your blood sugar levels because they take longer to burn off than other nutrients like carb ohydrates (Ross, 1999). A Note about Cholesterol While many are concerned about consuming saturated fatty acids because of the cholesterol levels and associated increase in the risk of heart disease, others suggest that the cholesterol issue is more complicated than simply avoiding saturated fatty acids or high cholesterol foods. In fact, studies show that high cholesterol is linked to overall lifestyle changes and diets in the modern age. \"Heart disease, cancer, and other degenerative diseases rise precipitously wh enever a natural, wholefoods diet, even one high in saturated fat, is replaced with a modern diet high in refined carbohydrates and processed foods (Beasley and Knightly, 1994).\" It has been shown that sugar and junk foods raised blood cholesterol levels, despite their low cholesterol content (Braverman, 1989). Unsaturated Fats : These fats can be found in high-quality fish oils and vegetable oils like sesame, saffl ower, corn, and flax seed. They are high in the essential fatty acids Omega-3 and Omega-6, which are the nutrients used in th e largest amount by the body's digestive processes. The body uses these essential fatty acids to produce energy and heat, strengthen cells, and regulate many bodily functions like the immune system and nervous system. Most commercial vegetable oils contain very little Omega-3 fatty acids and large amounts of Omega-6 fatty acids. Refined or Hydrogenated Fats : These fats are prevalent in many diets t oday as they can be found in margarines, shortening, or refined/hydroge nated oils. These hydrogenated oils are manufactured from a process that rearranges the fa tty acid molecules and creates trans fatty acids, which are difficult to digest and may cause problems su ch as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Nutritional Deficiencies for Fats 24Organic Foods and Essential Fatty Acids Modern agriculture and industrial practices have reduced the amount of Omega-3 fatty acids in commercially-available vegetables, eggs, fish and meat. For example, organic eggs from hens feeding on insects and green plants can contain Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids in the beneficial ratio of approximately one-to-one while commercial supermarket eggs can contain as much as nineteen times more Omega-6 than Omega- 3 fatty acids. (Simopoulos, 1992; Enig and Fallon, 2000). The average US diet now contains one-sixth as much Omega-3 as the diets of 1820. It is one of the most deficient fats in modern day diets. While an excess of fats, particularly poor qual ity ones like hydrogenated oils, contributes to disease, an inadequate intake of fats can also cause poor healt h. Too little Omega-3 fatty acid, for example, can lead to asthma, heart disease, and learning deficiencies. Too much Omega-6 can cause imbalances that interfere with prostagla ndins, a hormone-like substance which is important for a proper functioning of cardi ovascular, immune, Fallon, 2000). Many doctors have found that alcohol and drug addicts have deficiencies of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, and that adding them to th eir program greatly aide d recovery (Rudin and Felix, 1987; Bates, 1987; Finnegan, 1989; Finne gan and Gray, 1990). They provide the body with raw materials to build the prostaglandins which are crucial to th e recovering addict or alcoholic (Bates, 1987; Finnegan, 1989; Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Recovery Foods for Fats High-quality fats are important in the diet. The best sources of di etary fat for people in recovery are natural whole grains and seed s, various fish (i.e., the best for fats being mackerel, herring, sardines, tuna, anchovy, salmon, trout), and unsaturated oils like extra virgin olive oil that are as fresh and unprocessed as possible. Dairy and m eat should be used sp aringly (Beasley and Knightly, 1994; Cass and Holford, 2002). Because many people are especially deficient in Omega-3 fatty acids, the diet should also be supplemented with either high quality fish oils and/or flax seed oil. These oils are delicate and should be kept in the refrigerator and should not be used for cooking. Rather, they can be used to drizzle on salads, vegeta bles and the like (Enig and Fallon, 2000). When purchasing oils, be sure they are in opaque containers and keep them refrigerated so they do not go rancid. Stay away from products that say \"hydrogenated\" or \"partially hydrogenate d\" and synthetic products like margarine. Also, look for cold pressed oils as they are closer to their natural state, having been extracted by pressure alone rather than by heat as well. Hi gh heat can destroy nutrients. According to the Weston A. Price Kitchen Transition (Lipinski, 2003), here are thr ee types of high-quality fats: Butter is a useful fat as it a good source of soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Butter also contains important minerals like manganese, zinc, chromium, and iodine. The saturated fat in butter enhances our immune function, protects the liver from toxins, provides nourishment for the heart in times of stress, gives stiffness and integrity to our cell membranes, and aids in the proper utilization of Omega-3 essential fatty acids. Olive oil is a rich source of antioxidants, relieves the pain and inflamm ation of arthritis, normalizes blood fats and cholesterol, stimulat es strong gallbladder contractions, and is known for increasing longevity. Olive oil is good for saut\u00e9ing vegetables or as a base in salad dressings. Coconut oil is also a rich source of some saturated fatty acids, especially lauric acid, which has strong antifungal and antimicrobial pr operties. It is extremely heat stable and can be used for baking, frying, and saut\u00e9ing. 25Nutrient-depleted soils = Nutrient-depleted food As soils become overused and treated with chemicals and synthetic fertilizers, minerals become depleted. That means that the food growing in those soils also becomes depleted. So when possible, opt for organic produce which has been shown to produce fruits and vegetables with higher vitamin and mineral content. Vitamins/Minerals Vitamins and minerals are needed in small qua ntities each day in order for the body to function properly. These substances are needed for proper cellular function and for all bodily processes. No vitamin works on its own. Vitamins and minera ls work together through a complex process that is not fully unders tood. Vitamins are required for every biochemical process in the body, but they cannot function unless the minerals are there too. Minera ls are a catalyst for these biochemical processes. If all essential vitamins are not consumed in balanced amounts, the effectiveness of any single vitamin is greatly re duced, if not nullified entirely (Harte and Chow, 1964; Stitt, 2004). Nutritional Deficiencies Alcohol and drug users are often de ficient in key minerals such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, and chromium as well as vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins (Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, 2000; Ma rsano, 1989; Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Dr. Beasley in Food for Recovery notes that he has never cared for a recovering alcoholic or any other addict who was not deficient in vitamins and mi nerals\u2014both because of their abysmal diets and because of the addiction-induced damage to the organs that process nutrients. Zinc : Unbalanced meals and the over consumption of sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs can leach out the liver's extra st ores of zinc. Zinc is an es sential mineral that can have many benefits in recovery. The processes are quite complicated and not completely understood, but zinc is believed to help w ith liver function, aiding a healthy immune system, as well as brain function. Zinc also he lps insulin do its job and helps digest the food you eat (DesMaisons, 1998). Deficiencies in zinc may produce symptoms such as cold extremities, poor peripheral circulation, loss of taste, smell, poor wound healing, lethargy, poor appetite, acne, and hypothyroidism. Chromium : Chromium is a mineral that is needed in trace amounts in the body to regulate blood sugar, or glucose. This is es pecially important for those who suffer from hypoglycemia as discussed previously in this document. Symptoms of chromium deficiencies are hypoglycemia, diabet es, and heart disease (Larson, 1997). Also note that foods high in simple sugars are low in chromium (Kozlovsky, Moser, and Anderson, 1986; National Institute of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements website, 2010). Finnegan and Gray (1990) note that c onsuming refined sugars and carbohydrates can increase chromium loss up to 300 percent. Calcium/Magnesium : Many drug and alcohol a ddicts have calcium deficiencies. This is due in part to a poor diet and inadequate intake of calcium. It is also due to the fact that sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and other drugs cause the body to eliminate calcium. Caffeine has been shown to double the urinary excre tion of calcium (Werbach, 1987; Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Finnegan and Gray in Recovering from Addiction indicate that calcium 26is one of the most important nutrients needed in ample amoun ts for the recovering addict (1990). Similar to calcium, magnesium is also needed for a strong and calm nervous system but is often found deficient among those consuming high levels of sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Low calcium and magnesium levels are a majo r contributing factor to the irritability, pain, and muscular/nervous system disord ers that alcoholics a nd addicts experience during the withdrawal and recovery phases. Iron : Addicts and alcoholics are especially prone to develop anemia because substance abuse can damage the liver and prevent the body from absorbing iron efficiently. Poor eating habits can also lead to anemia. Thos e suffering from low iron levels may have a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, poor memory, and headaches. There are many factors involved in proper di gestion of iron. A diet high in good quality protein, with many additional s upportive nutrients such as Om ega-3 fatty acids, copper, Vitamin C, and B-complex vitamins, may be needed to successfully treat anemia. Potassium : Many recovering addicts have pot assium deficiencies. Excessive consumption of salt, use of caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and poor dietary habits all contribute to the development of a potassium deficienc y. Symptoms of this deficiency are muscle cramps, fatigue, weakness, and constipation. Th is deficiency is a major cause of high blood pressure and heat disease. Also, low potassium levels can weaken adrenal and liver function (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Selenium : Alcoholics were found to have below normal levels of selenium and those with liver disease found to have the lowest levels (Werbach, 1987; Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Low levels of selenium can lead to cancer and heart disease. Vitamin C : Vitamin C plays an important role in brain function. It speeds detoxification and acts as a scavenger that consumes free ra dicals, which are the destructive by-products of toxin activity within your body. The body requ ires more Vitamin C in times of stress, such as recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. Many nutritionally-based programs find Vitami n C to be one of the most essential ingredients in the treatment of addiction becau se it is a primary det oxifier of drugs and poisons from the system (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). Vitamin C also helps counterbalance some of the withdrawal diffi culties and can help rebuild the liver, adrenals, and immune system. Vitamin C helps the adrenals recover from adrenal fatigue as described above. It also helps your br ain chemicals work properly by supporting the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan into serotonin. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that can be absorbed easily but is not stored in the body. It is \"flushed\" out in the urine so you need a steady and constant supply in your diet. 27B-Complex Vitamins : B vitamins are important for metabolism and are required to break down carbohydrates to fuel the body. They also enhance the functioning of the immune and nervous system and promote cell growth, healthy skin, and muscle tone. There are eight different B-complex vitamins. Deficiencies in the B vitamins, especially thiamin and niacin, can cause many psychological symptoms such as paranoia, hyperactivity, confusion, confabulation, and depr ession. Niacin, for example, is critical for the conversion of tryptophan into sero tonin, which regulates mood and emotions. Thiamin is important for carbohydrate metabolis m. Pantothenic acid is a nutrient that helps to combat stress. The eight B-complex vitamins Biotin Folate Pryridoxine (B 6) Folic acid (or cobalamins, B 12) People who are recovering from drug and alc ohol addiction and use excessive amounts of sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and drugs often deve lop serious Vitamin B deficiencies. Some of these deficiencies may have even been present before the addiction. In fact, B vitamin deficiencies have been shown to cause crav ings for addictive substances. For example, Finnegan and Gray (1990) cite experiments in Finland by the British Journal of Medicine where rats deficient in B-vitamins were more likely to choose alcohol than water. But when the B-vitamins were replaced, the ra ts began to choose water again. Some symptoms of B-complex deficiency are fatigue, depression, anxiety, inability to concentrate, poor memory, insomnia, rapid/irre gular heart beat, swo llen/inflamed tongue, dry skin around the nose and cracking around the lips. Bill Wilson, co-founder of AA, Dr. Russell Smit h, Dr. Abram Hoffer, Dr. Janice Phelps, Dr. Roger Williams, Dr. Carl Pfeiffer and ma ny other physicians have found B-vitamins to be a tremendous asset during recovery (F innegan and Gray, 1990). Use of B-vitamins has been found to eliminate or greatly dimi nish withdrawal symptoms, help clear up cravings, improve mental outlook and stab ility and aid regeneration of the liver, endocrine glands, and nervous system. Recovery Foods for Vitamins and Minerals Below is a list of foods that are rich in the commonly deficient vitamins and minerals listed above. In addition to a diet high in these key vitamins and minerals, many nutritionally-based addiction programs also recommend vitamin and mineral supplementation, which is discussed in the next section. Foods High in Key Vitamins and Minerals 28Zinc Oysters, gingerroot, round steak, lamb, pecans, peas , shrimp, parsley, and potatoes (Larson, 1997). Chromium Chromium is widely distributed in food, but most contains only small amounts of it: meat and whole- grain products like whole wheat and rye, some fr uits, shellfish like oysters and shrimp, vegetables, brewer's yeast, cornmeal, butter, and spices. (A nderson, Bryden, and Polansky, 1992; National Institute of Health, Office of Diet ary Supplements factsheet website). Calcium Dairy products, almonds, sunflower seeds, parsl ey, meat, fish, eggs, whole grains, beans, and vegetables. Magnesium Leafy green vegetables, kelp, peas, molasses, nuts like almonds and cashews, brown rice, whole grains, and seafood (Merck, 2010; Beasley and Knightly, 1994; Larson, 1997). Iron Liver, oysters, leafy greens, red meat, blackstr ap molasses, kelp, brewer's yeast, eggs, and beans (Finnegan and Gray, 1990; Merck, 2010). Potassium Potatoes, bananas, leafy green vegetables, or anges, whole grains, and sunflower seeds. Selenium Butter, smoked herring, wheat germ, bran, liver, and eggs. Vitamin C Fresh fruits and vegetables like green peppers, citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage . Note: Many nutritionally-based program s also supplement with large doses of Vitamin C; however, it is highly acidic and when used in moderate or large dose s it can cause ulceration of the digestive tract and further depletion of calcium and magnesium levels in many people. If supplementing with large doses, be sure to consult a doctor. B-complex Found in most whole, unprocessed foods such as potatoes, lentils, chili peppers, tempeh, beans, brewer's yeast and molasses. Note: Some supplementation may be required for those that are severely imbalanced; however, severe liver damage and other health factors some times associated with alcohol and drug addiction may make it especially difficult for some people to tolerate supplements of B-vitamins such as niacin (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). That means that a variet y of healthy food alternatives is even more important. Nutritional Supplements Many of the nutritionally-based addiction recovery programs reviewed for this document recommend supplementation of the various nu trients described above (e.g., amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes). Some argue that an oversupply of nutrients is necessary at the start of a recovery program because the body is so thoroughly depleted both of nutrients and of the ability to digest and absorb nutrients correctly. Larson (1997) asserts that just \"eating right\" cannot restore depleted levels of nutrients at the start of a pr ogram because of the significant deficiencies and absorption issues. In one st udy of alcoholics, for example, the B-vitamin pantothenic acid was administer ed orally but researchers f ound that the alcoholics couldn't absorb it; instead it was all eliminated in the urine. They f ound that it took 10 weeks before their bodies could absorb it (Tao and Fox, 1976; Larson, 1997). If you opt to take supplements, they should be used in conjunction with a good diet and not instead of it, and you should always consult with your doctor. Taking supp lements is not a quick fix. Kathleen DesMaisons, Ph.D., President and CEO of Radiant Recovery, a treatment program for alcoholism, drug addiction, depression, and co mpulsive behavior, pu ts it best in her book Potatoes not Prozac : People with addictive bodies love to take something, be it pills, white powder or special mixtures from a can. Taking something becomes the solution rather than creating a lifestyle with a healthy relationship to food. Eating food as your solution to sugar sensitivity or addiction demands that you think about what food you will eat, when, how, and with whom. 29VI. Eating in Recovery Food can be used to support addiction recovery efforts. Proper food and nutrition are essential in a reco very program as they keep the body and brain strong and functioning properly. Ma ny biochemical and health problems can be diminished by changing food habits and food choices. In fact, ch anging food choices can be beneficial to most Americans, many of whom consume too many ca rbohydrates and sugar and not enough nutrient- dense foods. Practitioners working with recovering addicts have repeatedly found that people become well much quicker, with far fewer symptoms\u2014and stay drug free much longer\u2014when they follow principles of good nutrition. Most substance abusers need three square meals a day with good quality protein, complex carbohydrates, and fats served at each meal. They often need snacks as well, especially du ring the early stages of recovery. (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). As you read through the tips below, keep in mind that it may be difficult to establish specific quantities and types of food; ev ery person is different and has unique dietary requirements based their ability to absorb, transpor t, and digest nutrients. In addition, your metabolism depends on a wide range of individualized fa ctors\u2014genetic background, age, envi ronment, activity level, food choices, and allergies. That means a diet for your neighbor or roommate may not be appropriate to meet all of your specific nutritional needs. What to Eat All recovering drug and alcohol a ddicts can benefit from food th at is of the very highest nutritional value to help balance their depleted bodies and brains. Below are some general guidelines for the types of foods to eat. Whole foods Whole foods are foods that have not been altered ex tensively from their original state. That is foods that are not peeled, cored, refined or chemically cha nged from their origin al state. It is recommended that you eat food with all the parts, including peels or sk in, to get all possible nutrients. A potato, lightly baked wi th the peel, contains fiber and extra nutrients. Potatoes that are cut, diced and fried into French fries retain very few nutrients but do c ontain lots of bad fats and cholesterol. Whole foods naturally provide th e balance of nutrients needed to digest them easily. An egg, for example, is high in cholesterol. However, it also has ju st the right balance of nutrients to allow the body to process and use that choleste rol (Braverman, 1987). Often our grain is broken up, or refined, to remove bran from the wheat, rice and other grains. In doing so, that also removes key nutrients and fiber. Likewi se, there is a major difference in the nutrients between a ripe apple from the tree a nd the syrup-sweetened one from a can. 30Whole Grains You need carbohydrates for energy. It is r ecommended, however, that you consume complex carbohydrates from whole grains, like oatmeal a nd brown rice. Whole grai ns provide the outer (bran) and the inner germ layers along with th e starch. Because the body cannot digest the whole grains as quickly as processed grains, it helps ke ep the blood sugar and insulin levels from rising and falling. This is particularly us eful for those who are hypoglycemic. Fiber Fiber is a tough, chewy plant subs tance that does not break down in the stomach and helps to move digested food smoothly thr ough the intestine. Fiber also helps to moderate the absorption of carbohydrates. Even complex carbohydrates can break down t oo quickly into glucose and cause a hypoglycemic reaction if fiber is totally absent. Again eating the whole, natural food is better, as the skins, seeds, and bran are the richest sources of fiber. Protein A majority of the nutritionally-based programs re viewed here stress th e importance of a high- protein diet. Eat proteins, mainly from legumes, whole grains, brow n rice, seeds, raw nuts, eggs, fish, and meats like organically-grown chicken. Be sure to get a good mix of proteins that are complete so that you get all of the essential amino acids. Fats Good quality fats are an important component of the diet for a recovering addict. The best sources are from oils found in nuts, seeds, and fi sh. High quality flax seed oil and fish oils may also be useful for Omega-3 fatty acids, which are deficient in many peopl e. Also look for extra virgin, cold-pressed oils (e.g., ol ive oil and coconut oils) that have not lost nutrients to processing. Stay away from hi ghly-processed oils, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, as well as oils in fried foods (Ross, 1999). Fruits and Vegetables Fruits and vegetables are among the most importa nt foods in recovery as they are high in vitamins and minerals and low in fat and calorie s. Unfortunately, most recovering addicts, along with the rest of the American population, are not getti ng the amounts they need daily. If they are getting some fruits and vegetables they often consume a large portion of them in forms high in fat or low in nutrients like iceber g lettuce, French fries, and po tato chips. (Putnam et al., 2002). Eat locally-grown fruits and vegetables when they are in season. Fruits and vegetables that are fully ripened on a tree or a vine are more nutritious than those th at are picked before they are ripened then shipped long distances before bein g stocked in your supermarket. A tomato, for example, that is ripened on the vine has more than twice as much Vitamin C as one that is machine-picked while still green (Beasley and Knightly, 1997). Also look for vegetables and fruit rich in color as they are usually the highest in nutrients (Ross, 1999). Local farm stands, farmers markets, or CSAs are a good way to find these types of nutrient- dense, in-season food. If these are not available, th en try to stick to organi c fruits and vegetables if possible, as chronic pestic ide exposure puts a tremendous st rain on the body and detoxification system, compromises the immune system, and in creases the body's requ irements for certain vitamins, particularly A and C. (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). 31 Also remember that the food is only as good as the soil in which it is grown. Over-farmed, nutrient-depleted soil that has been heavily tr eated with chemicals produces nutrient-depleted crops. Organic farming balances the ecological environment: soil is enriched with organic materials such as fish meal, cover crops, and kelp rather than synthetic chemicals, and it relies on biological controls, such as predat ory insects, rather than pestic ides. Because of these types of measures, organically-grown fruits and vege tables have a higher nutritional value. Meat Meat and poultry are an excelle nt source of protein as well as many essential vitamins and minerals. They are an important part of the di et for those in recovery. Animals raised in confinement and fed conventional grain, however, ar e loaded with saturate d fat and cholesterol. Organic, free-ranged and grass-fed animals are far lower in saturated fats and cholesterol. Also, overuse of antibiotics in the meat and dairy business has led to potentially lethal antibiotic- resistant strains of salmonella that are now a significant health threat. Hormones ingested in meat, milk or poultry, as well, can upset the delicate balance of our bodies and brains. Seafood Seafood is good for those in recovery as it provides complete proteins and vitamin B12. It is also a good source of Omega-3 essential fatty acids, which can reduce immunological problems like arthritis and asthma. It also provides you with important trace minerals like iodine, fluoride, selenium, zinc, and copper, and several majo r minerals. Phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and iron are all found in fish. Choose car efully, though, as fish can collect toxins in their fatty tissues from chemical and biological wastes found in the sea. What Not to Eat Poor nutrition is one of the critic al risk factors for substance a buse. If you ignore your diet, then you put yourself at risk for a relapse (Gant a nd Lewis, 2010). If you eat a diet high in \"junk food\" you may find it hard to stay substance- free. Junk food is highly-processed, containing preservatives, hormones, artificial colorings, and sugar. Below is a list of some items to avoid. Sugar Sugar is one of the common foods that a recovering addict turns to when trying to stay clean and sober. That is because sugar works much like drugs and alcohol to provide temporary relief from the low blood sugar levels common among recove ring addicts. Unfortunately, consuming sugar in the form of candy bars, cake, doughnuts, and soda (along with other highly-refined carbohydrates like white flour) can exacerbate hypoglycemic problems. Sugar is everywhere and comes in many forms like sucrose, corn sweeteners, honey, maple syrup, and molasses. It is found in many foods lik e flavored yogurts, fruit drinks, ketchup, pizza, hot dogs, bread, and some peanut butters. You can recognize sugars and avoid them in commercial foods by looking at the labels for ingr edients that end in -os e or -ol (DesMaisons, 1999). Refined sugars like sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, and dextrose provide no nutritional value. In fact, they do the opposite\u2014they actually deplet e the body of enzymes, minerals and vitamins, especially the B-complex vitamins. (Lipinski, 2003). When a meal is nutritionally poor, your 32body must remove what nutrition it can from your own stores to metabolize the sugar, thus robbing you of precious nutrients. Those that are trying to avoid s ugar often turn to artificial sw eeteners. These can cause problems with weight gain, increased cravings for sweets, impaired coordination, decreased mental function, diabetes, MS, Parkinson's, seizures, a nd migraine headaches. It is recommended that you replace artificial an d refined sugar with naturally-occurr ing sweeteners like raw cane sugar, pure maple syrup, raw honey, or molasses. But us e them sparingly, as na tural sweeteners can similarly affect your blood sugar levels and contri bute to cravings for sweet s. Be sure to balance sugar with good fats and protein to help stab ilize blood sugar and reduce cravings for sweets (Lipinski, 2003). Processed Foods A majority of the sugar in our diets comes fr om prepared, processed foods (Stitt, 2004; US Dietary Goals, 1977) . Processed foods are foods that have be en altered from their original natural state for safety or convenience\u2014food that ha s been cut, diced, cooked, puffed, ground, canned, or changed from its initial state. Not all pro cessed food is bad. For example, frozen food is processed but is still a good source for fruits and vegetables when fresh is not available. There are many processed foods that are not healthy, ho wever, because they are made with saturated fats, sugar, sodium, artificial flavorings and colors, and other unhealthy additives. Many processed foods are stripped of nutri ents. As Paul Stitt writes in his book Beating the Food Giants (2004 as cited in Stitt, 2004): \"The milling pr ocess destroys 40 per cent of the chromium present in the whole grain, as we ll as 86 percent of the manganes e, 89 percent of the cobalt, 68 percent of the copper, 78 percen t of the zinc, and 48 percent of the molybdenum. By the time it is completely refined, it has lost most of its phos phorus, iron and thiamin, and a good deal of its niacin and riboflavin. Its crude fibe r content has been cut down cons iderably as well. White flour has been plundered of most of its vita min E, important oils, and amino acids.\" White Flour White flour is a highly-processed food choi ce and should be avoided. The body breaks down white bread like sugar and it can l ead to many of the same problems. When whole wheat flour is processed and turned into white flour, the B- vitamins, as well as vitamin E, calcium, zinc, copper, manganese, potassium, and fiber are rem oved. Because it is lacking fiber, it can cause constipation and other bowel problems. Wheat is also a major allergen and may cause reactions like headaches, fatigue, malabs orption, irritability, upper re spiratory congestion, nausea, diarrhea, and other bowel disorder s like celiac and Crohn's disease. White flour is found in most co mmercial breads, crackers, past a, bagels and pancake mixes. Avoid these types of food and re place them with whole grains and complex carbohydrates. Additives A number of additives in food have been associat ed with changes in the brain and can contribute to hyperactivity and/or learning difficulties. Some of these additives include: monosodium glutamate (MSG) found in commercially processed foods such as stocks, sauces, chips, dips, and processed meats; phenylethylamine found in choc olate; tyramine found and Chianti; xanthines from caffeine; and aspartam e which is the artificial sweetener known as 33NutraSweet. Aspartame has been shown to bloc k the synthesis of serotonin (Wurtman, 1983; Fishbein and Pease, 1988). These additives can also cause some individuals to experience mania, shortened attention span, distractibility, and impaired problem-solving ability (Drake, 1986; Walton, 1986; Fishbein and Pease, 1988). Phosphates are another group of additives used in processed foods that should be avoided. Phosphates can be found in beverages, oils, bake d goods, soft drinks, and fruit products. They have been associated with hyperactivity in certain children whose behavioral problems diminished when the phosphates were removed from their diets (Walker, 1982; Fishbein and Pease, 1988). Check your labels for all these additives and try to avoid buying products that contain them. High Fructose Corn Syrup High fructose corn syrup is a common ingredie nt found in many processed and packaged food. It has shown in studies to lead to obesity and cardiovascular disease (USDA, 1984). It can deplete the body of nutrients and raise blood levels of cholesterol. It may also accelerate the aging process. High fructose corn syrup is found in a wide range of foods, including brea d, cereals, soft drinks, and even in some ketchup and spaghetti sauces . Check your labels and try to avoid it. Hydrogenated Oils Hydrogenated oils are made by rearranging the fatty acid molecu les. These create trans fats which are difficult to digest and can cause problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Hydrogenated oils are found in almost all processed foods, commercial salad dressings, sandwich spreads, and margarine. It is recommended to stay away from hydrogenated oils and replace them with real butter or oils, such as extra-virgin cold-pressed olive oil, flax seed oil, and coc onut oil. All are rich sources of saturated fatty acids and some vitamins. Caffeine Many recovering addicts turn to caffeine when trying to recover from drugs and alcohol. Unfortunately, caffeine is just another type of dr ug that alters your chemical balance. It pumps adrenaline into the bloodstream which tempor arily provides energy. Ad renaline also dumps stored sugar into the bloodstream which triggers an outpouring of insulin. Caffeine stimulates the adrenal glands, leading eventual ly to adrenal exhaustion and sy mptoms like fatigue, lack of physical endurance and stamina, impaired ability to deal with stress, depressed immune systems, allergic reactions, weight gai n, low blood pressure, dizziness a nd lightheadedness or blacking out when standing up. Caffeine also stimulates the liv er to release more sugar in the blood stream and further stresses the body's delicate sugar- regulating mechanism. It also impairs calcium absorption. While it may be hard to kick the caffeine addic tion, start slowly. For example, you may want to begin by cutting your caffeine intake in half each week until you no longer need it. Also, eat protein-based meals with natu ral carbohydrates and good fats to keep your blood sugar stable and reduce your craving fo r sugar and caffeine. 34 When to Eat Besides eating high-quality foods, eating at the right time is also an important part of the nutritional puzzle for recovering addicts, especi ally with those who are hypoglycemic or sugar sensitive. It is important for the body to receive a steady supply of fuel to control blood sugar levels. This can improve mood and self-control and provide adequate levels of important neurotransmitters like beta-endorphi n and serotonin. This can also help to reduce cravings that often block recovery efforts. In the studies reviewed for this document, seve ral different eating patterns were shown to work well for recovering addicts. For example, Food & Behavior recommends three main meals along with light snacks every couple of hours so that your blood sugar does not drop to a crisis point. In contrast, Potatoes not Prozac recommends eating only three hi gh-protein meals per day at regular intervals. That program does not recommend the \"6 times a day\" eating plans for sugar- sensitive people because snacking often leads to grazing for those that are sensitive to sugar. Instead, it is recommended that you never go more than 6 hours between eating, except between dinner and breakfast. In general, you need to listen to your body a nd see what works for you. Also, since it is not always possible to time when you are hungry or need a snack, carry healthy snacks with you such as nuts and seeds, dried fruit (if you ar e not sugar sensitive), and sliced carrots. Can Food Work in Recovery? While it is still up for debate and not widely us ed in many current drug and alcohol recovery programs, a number of studies in dicate that correcting biochemical imbalances with nutrition can have an affect on behavior and recovery. Some studies are listed below in loose chronological order. More information can be found in Section VII. List of Resources . 1940s - 1950s: Roger J. Williams, the biochemist who named folic acid and found pantothenic acid (one of the B-vitamins), publishes findings from years of study at the University of Texas about the impact of diet on alcohol consumption in animals in the book called Biochemical Individuality . The data indicate that animals give n the choice between alcohol and water chose alcohol more frequently when they were nutritionally deficient than when they were well fed (Williams, 1956; Williams, 1962; Beasley and Knightly, 1994). Rats on high quality diets voluntarily consumed far less alcohol (less sugar) than those on deficient diets. Williams is also able to shift alcohol consumption up and down based on deliberately subtracting and adding vitamins to their diet (Williams, 1962). 1935 - 1945: Studies indicate addiction is a disease with me tabolic causes. Dr. J. W. Tintera, Dr. Abram Hoffer, Dr. Broda Barnes identify these metabolic imbalances as poor adrenal function, low thyroid, low blood sugar, and nutritional deficiencies (Finnegan and Gray, 1990). 1960s - 1970s: Dr. John Tintera, endocrinologist, studies the relationship between low blood sugar and alcohol abuse. His research indicates that re covered alcoholics continue to suffer from hypoglycemia, even after many years sober, and that controlling it is the most important part of physiological treatment of alcoholics (Tintera, 1974; Larson, 1997). 351970 - 1982: Barbara Reed Stitt, probation officer for the Cuya hoga Falls Municipal Court in Ohio, starts a successful dietary therapy program for probatione rs. She reports that ov er 80 percent of her probationers were able to lead healthy, cr ime-free lives after goin g through her program focused on correcting biochemical imbalances with food and better nutrition (Stitt, 2004). For more information about her program consult her book Food and Behavior: A Natural Connection . 1980: Dr. Theron Randolf, the father of clinical ec ology (a field of medicine that asserts that allergies to foods and environmental chemicals cause a number of physical conditions) finds that addictions to food and alcohol can produce alternating highs and lows. In his work with AA, he discovers that many recovering alcoholic s are allergic and/or addicted to the sugars, grapes, and grains from which alcohol is made and finds that people begin to crave alcohol when exposed to the underlying component to which they are addicted (Randolph and Moss, 1980; Larson, 1992). 1983: Ruth M. Guenther, researcher at the University of Texas, studies alcoholics in a typical AA treatment program (28 day in treatment) and co mpares it to alcoholics in the same program with an added nutritional component consisting of dietary changes, vitamin and mineral supplements, and nutrition education. The nutritio n education included weekly classes on the basics of nutrition, menu planning, shopping and food preparation, and how to read labels to recognize hidden sugars, alcohol, and preser vatives. She finds that six months after discharge from the hospital, 81 percent of the study group were not drinking compared to 38 percent of the control study group (Gunther, 1983; Beasley and Knightly, 1994). 1980s - 1990s: Dr. Kenneth Blum, brain researcher at the Un iversity of Texas, is one of the early researchers to note that addiction is a biochemical disease. He finds that restoring natural endorphins and neurotransmitters destroyed or depleted by alcohol could restore normal moods (Larson, 1992). Allian ce for Addictions Solutions (http://www.allianceforaddictionsoluti ons.org/resources/scientific-studies ) provides further information about him and a partial list of his publications, some dating to the 1960s. 1980s: Research at Brunswick Hospital Center an d Comprehensive Medical Care in New York apply a similar program to that of Ruth Guenther's program above. 111 patients with severe and chronic alcoholism participate, all with de ficient diets, and many with failed recovery attempts. 80 percent are clinically malnourished, almost two-thirds have liver disease, and almost half are also addicted to other drugs. Patients spend 28 days in the hospital followed by a 12-month program of medical follow-up as well as aftercare and AA meetings. 91 of the original 111 patients were still in the program after one year and 74 percent were sober and stable (Beasley and Knightly, 1994). 1986: A study of patients receiving in-patient treat ment for alcoholism where half receive only the regular treatment plan and half receive a nu tritional program as well. Six months after discharge, only 33 percent of the patients in the regular program remain sober, whereas 81 percent of the nutritionally-supported group remain sober. (Phelps, Keller, and Nourse, 1986; Finnegan and Gray, 1990). 1987: Joan Matthews Larson, Ph.D. publishes findings of a study of 100 alcoholic patients who participate in an experimental 6-week outpatient treatment program concentrating on biochemical restoration combined with psychotherapy. 85 percent of the people reported themselves as abstinent and stable 12 and 42 months post treatment. This article can be found on the Alliance for Addiction Solutions website (http://allianceforaddictionsolutions.org/i mages/pdfs/HRC_Alc_Study_proofed.pdf ). Also, more information about this type of treatment program can also be found at the Health Recovery Website (http://www.healthrecovery.com/HRC_2006/AlcoholismDrugAddict.htm ). 361990s: Kathleen DesMaisons, Ph.D., president and CEO of Radiant Recovery in Burlingame, California establishes a diet and nutrition-based recovery program. It is based on her three- year program working with DUI offenders in San Mateo County, California (called the Biochemical Restoration Program) on using diet and nutrition to reduce sugar cravings. People are educated about what foods to avoid, when to eat, and what to eat. She finds that people in the control group were charged again for more serious offenses at four times the rate of those in the nutritionally-based program (DesMaisons, 1992, 1998). See the Radiant Recovery website ( http://www.radiantrecovery.com ) for more information about this program as well as other helpful articles and resource materials. 1990s - 2000s: Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a professor of criminology and sociology at Cal State Stanislaus, has been studying the effects of vitamins on inmates in California for over 20 years. His findings show that young adu lt men receiving vitamin supplements have a 38 percent drop in serious behavior problems. In a larger study of prison diets in CA, NY, OK, VA, and FL, he finds that prisoner's eating habits could be used to predict future violent behavior. Shoenthaler's studies suggest that low concentrations of nutrients in the blood can wreak havoc on electrical activity in the brain and affect processing of neurotransmitters like serotonin. (The Crime Diet, 2003; Alliance for Addiction Solutions, 2010). 2000: Schoenthaler and Bier (2000) study the effects of vitamin-mineral supplementation on juvenile delinquency of school children. Their findings indicate that poor nutritional habits in children can lead to low concentrations of water-soluble vitamins in blood and impair brain function and subsequently cause violence and other serious antisocial behavior. Correction of nutrient intake, either through a well-balanced diet or low-dose vitamin- mineral supplementation, corrects the low concentrations of vitamins in blood, improves brain function and subsequently lowers institutional violence and antisocial behavior by almost half. 2002: Dr. Bernard Gesch and colleagues at the University of Oxford find that improving the diets of young offenders (adding vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids) reduces criminal offenses by 25 percent (Gesch, B et al., 2002; BBC, 2002). 2003: Gesch, Hammond, and Hampson (2003) report evidence that adverse behavior in prison is reduced by vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. Despite the results, however, Gesch noted that many offenders do not make the right food choices even when they are available. 2004: Grant et al. (2004) study nutrition education in substance abuse treatment programs. Results indicate that nutrition educatio n is an essential component of substance abuse treatment programs and can enhance treatment outcomes. 2010: While serving as the medical director at Tully Hill Hospital and reported in his book End Your Addiction Now (2010), Dr. Gant reports an 83 perc ent success rate in ending patients' addictions. Gant and his colleagues believe that biochemical imbalances in the body must be attended to before recovery can happen and th at alcoholism is primar ily a brain chemistry imbalance fueled by a deficiency in certain nutrients. He shows that a critical part of treating addiction is to replenish missing nutr ients through food and supplements. . 37VII.
