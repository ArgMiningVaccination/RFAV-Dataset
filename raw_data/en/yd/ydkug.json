Many of you will be asked to lend you help over the next year as we convert the Prioritized List from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM and we appreciate any assistance you can lend. vii Executive Summary The Health Services Commission (HSC) continued to fulfill its legislative mandates in regards to its maintenance and review of the Prioritized List of H ealth Services during the 2009-11 biennium. The Commission's most recent bien nial review of the Prioritized List of Health Services, concluded in May 2010, resulted in relatively few changes. The following significant changes are reflected in the Prioritized List of Health Services being reported in Appendix C: 1) A review of the dental lines by the De ntal Services Subcommittee resulted in an increase from eight lines to twenty-one. A comprehensive review of the dental lines had not be conducted in ten years and this review resulted in a higher level of granularity so that those serv ices that truly are of less im portance would be eliminated from coverage first should reductions need to be made. 2) Outpatient services for the treatment of influenza we re split out from old line 634, Other Viral Infections Excluding Pneumonia Due To Respiratory Syncytial Virus In Persons Under Age 3, into a ne w line with a ranking of 424. The 2012-13 Prioritized List of Heal th Services appearing in Appendi x C is still in draft form. The final version of the list a nd its associated will be posted on the Commission's website this fall at http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/HSC/current_prior.shtml once the October 1, 2011 interim modifications have been incorporated. That list wi ll go into effect January 1, 2012 pending legislative funding and appr oval of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the resulting benefit package. The Commission continues to use th e process it established at the direction of HB 3624 (2003) to use clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in prioritizing health services. Evidence-based research and cost-effectiveness analyses, where ava ilable, are used to confirm a service's current placement on the list or determine whether and where a new treatment should be added to the list. The Commission formalized their proce ss of reviewing the ev idence on topics and potentially using that information to make changes to the Prioritized List. Practice guidelines continue to be an increasing ly important mechanism in striving to use the state's limited resources in the most effective manner. Seventeen new guidelines were developed over the past two y ears and sixteen previously existing guidelines were modified. This includes the development of guidelines in the areas of ancillary and diagnostic services, where cost increases have been outpacing other sectors. The Commissi on also developed one new statement of intent and revise d two others to clarif y their intent for the coverage of services not appearing on the Prioritized List. In the process of maintaining the Prioritized List over the last two years, the Commission produced four sets of interim modifications that were forwarded to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House. Nearly 5,000 individu al changes were made as part of the interim maintenance of the list, many of which were ne cessitated by annual updates to the diagnosis and procedure codes used to define the condition-treatment pairs. None of the interim modifications viii made from October 2009 through April 2011 were determined by the Oregon Health Authority's Actuarial Services Unit to have a significant fiscal impact requiring pr esentation to the Oregon Legislative Emergency Board. In June 2010 the Commission's Mental Hea lth Care and Chemical Dependency (MHCD) Subcommittee began the work of converting th e ~50 MHCD lines from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM. They completed that process in Fe bruary 2011 and have established a process for converting the remaining lines on the list. The Commission and its staff have now begun working with providers from all other specialty areas in converting the lines representing the conditions they treat. This work will be completed as part of the next biennial review and will result in a list to go into effect in conjuncti on with the implementation date of ICD-10-CM on October 1, 2013. The Health Services Commission appreciates the opportunity to play a part in extending health care to as many Oregonians as possible and looks fo rward to the role it may have as the state looks to transform its health care system. CHAPTER ONE: PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR 2012-13 2 Charge to the Health Services Commission The Health Services Commission was established to: \"[R]eport to the Governor and Legislature a list of health services , including health care services of the aged, blind and disabled...and including those mental health and chemical dependency services...ranked by priority, from the most important to the least important , representing the comparative benefits to the entire population to be served....The recommendation shall include practice gui delines reviewed and adopted by the Commission....\" 1 (emphasis added) The Commission is composed of twelve member s. There are five physicians, including one Doctor of Osteopathy, four consumer representativ es, a public health nurs e, a social services worker and, with by the passage of SB 850 2 during the 2009 legislative session, a dentist.3 The Commission relies heavily on the input from its subcommittees and ad hoc task forces.4 A Commissioner will often chair a subcommittee or task force, with its composition depending on the purpose of that body. If appropriate, memb ership from outside of the Commission will generally include representatives of specialty -specific providers, consumers, and advocacy groups within the area of interest. The Commission's Prioritized List of Health Se rvices is made up of condition-treatment pairs composed of diagnosis and treatment codes used to define the services being represented. The conditions on the list are represented by the coding nomenclature of the International Classification of Diseases, Ni nth Revision, Clinical Modifi cation (ICD-9-CM). Medical treatments are listed using codes from the Amer ican Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), Fourth Edition, the American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology (CDT) and the Healthcare Co mmon Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). The Commission maintains the Prioritized List by making changes in one of two ways: 1. The Biennial Review of the Prioritized List of Health Services, which is completed prior to each legislative session accord ing to the Commission's established methodology. 2. Interim Modifications to the Prioritized List that consist of: a. Technical Changes due to errors, omissions, and changes in ICD-9-CM, CPT-4, CDT or HCPCS codes; and, b. Advancements in Medical Technology that necessitate changes to the list prior to the next biennial review. 1 Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 414.720(3). 2 SB 850 (2009) can be found in Appendix A. 3 A list of the Commission membership can be found in Appendix B. 4 Chapter Four outlines the activities of the Commission's subcommittees and task forces. 3 The list assumes that all diagnos tic services necessary to dete rmine a diagnosis are covered. Ancillary services necessary for the successful treatment of the c ondition are to be presumed to be a part of the line items. This means that codes for prescription drugs, durable medical equipment and supplies, laboratory services, and most imaging services are not included on the Prioritized List but are still reim bursed as long as the condition for which they are being used to treat appears in the funded region (current ly lines 1-502 of the April 1, 2011 list). The Prioritization Methodology As of January 1, 2008, the Prioritized List reflect s a ranking of health services based on a new methodology that places a higher emphasis on pr eventive services and chronic disease management The new methodology ensures a bene fit package that provides the services necessary to best keep a population healthy rath er than waiting until an individual gets sick before higher cost services are o ffered to try to restore good health. The prioritization methodology first de fines a rank ordered list of ni ne broad categories of health care to establish a basic framew ork for the list (see Fi gure 1.1). Next the methodology calls for each of the line items on the Prioritized List to be assigned to one of these health care categories. Once the line items have been assigned to one of th e nine categories, a list of criteria is used to sort the line items within the categories (see Figure 1.2). These m easures are felt to best capture the impacts on both the individual's health a nd the population health that the Commission believes is essential in determining the relative importance of a condition-treatment pair. The HSC Medical Director and HSC Director have worked with individual HSC physician members and other volunteer physicians w ith OHP experience to establish ratings for each of these measures for all 692 line items on the list. In the case of mental health, chemical dependency and dental services, the ratings were established by the Subcommittees on Mental Health Care and Chemical Dependency and Dental Services. Since not every service in Categor y 1 is more important than ever y service in Category 2 and so on a weight is applied to each category that wa s then multiplied by the total criteria score for each condition-treatment pair achieved an appropria te adjustment in the majority of the cases. The category weights are shown in parentheses af ter the title for each cat egory in Figure 1.1. A total score is then calculated for each line using the following formula to sort all line items within each of the health care categories, with the lowest net cost used to break any ties: Impact on Healthy Life Years + Impact on Suffering Category + Population Effects Need for Weight X + Vulnerable of Population Affected X Effectiveness X Service + Tertiary Prevention (categories 6 & 7 only) 4 FIGURE 1.1 RANK ORDER OF HEALTH CARE CATEGORIES 1) Maternity & Newborn Care (100) - Obstetrical care for pregnancy. Prenatal care; delivery services; postpartum care; newborn care for conditions intrinsic to the pregnancy. 2) Primary Prevention a nd Secondary Prevention (95) - Effective preventive services used prior to the presence of disease and scr eenings for the detection of diseases at an early stage. Immunizations; fluoride treatment in children; mammograms; pap smears; blood pressure screening; well child visits; routine dental exams. 3) Chronic Disease Management (75) - Predominant role of treatment in the presence of an established disease is to prevent an exacerbation or a secondary illness. Medical therapy for diabetes me llitus, asthma, and hypertension. Medical/psychotherapy for schizophrenia. 4) Reproductive Services (70) - Excludes maternit y and infertility services. Contraceptive management; vasectomy; tubal occlusion; tubal ligation. 5) Comfort Care (65) - Palliative therapy for conditions in which death is imminent. Hospice care; pain management. 6) Fatal Conditions, Where Treatment is Aimed at Disease Modification or Cure (40) - Appendectomy for appendicitis; medical & surg ical e; medical therapy for stroke; medical/psychotherapy for single episode major depression. 7) Nonfatal Conditions, W here Treatment is Aimed at Disease Modification or Cure (20) - Treatment of closed fractures; medical/psychotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorders; medical therapy for chronic sinusitis. 8) Self-limit ing conditions (5) - Treatment expedites reco very for conditions that will resolve on their own whether treated or not. Medical therapy for diaper rash, acute conjunctivitis and acute pharyngitis. 9) Inconsequential care (1) - Services that have little or no impact on health status due to the nature of the condition or t he ineffectiveness of the treatment. Repair fingertip avulsion that does not incl ude fingernail; medical ther apy for gallstones without cholecystitis, medical therapy for viral warts. 5 FIGURE 1.2 POPULATION AND INDIVIDUAL IMPACT MEASURES Impact on Healthy Life Years - To what degree will the conditi on impact the health of the individual if left untreated, considering the median age of onset (i.e., does the condition affect mainly children, where the impacts could potentially be experienced over a person's entire lifespan)? Range of 0 (no impact) to 10 (high impact). Impact on Suffering - To what degree does the conditi on result in pain and suffering? Effect on family members (e.g. dealing wit h a loved one with Alzheimer's disease or needing to care for a person with a life-long disa bility) should also be factored in here. Range of 0 (no impact) to 5 (high impact). Population Effects - The degree to which individuals other than the person with the illness will be affected. Exampl es include public health conc erns due to the spread of untreated tuberculosis or public safety concerns resulting from untreated severe mental illness. Range of 0 (no effects) to 5 (widespread effects). Vulnerability of Population Affected - To what degree does the condition affect vulnerable populations such as those of cert ain racial/ethnic descent or those afflicted by certain debilitating illnesses such as HIV disease or alcohol & drug dependence? Range of 0 (no vulnerability) to 5 (high vulnerability). Tertiary Prevention - In considering the ranking of se rvices within new categories 6 and 7, to what degree does early treatment prevent complicati ons of the disease (not including death)? Range of 0 (doesn't prevent complic ations) to 5 (prevents severe complications). Effectiveness - To what degree does the treatm ent achieve its intended purpose? Range of 0 (no effectiveness) to 5 (high effectiveness). Need for Medical Services - The percentage of time in wh ich medical services would be required after the diagnosis has been established. Percentage from 0 (services never required) to 1 (services always required). Net Cost - The cost of treatment fo r the typical case (including lifetime costs associated with chronic diseases) minus the expected costs if treatment is not provided -- including costs incurred through safety net providers (e.g., emergency departments) for urgent or emergent care related to the injury /illness or resulting complications. Range of 0 (high net cost) to 5 (cost saving). 6 Hand adjustments were applied by the Commissi on where the application of this methodology did not result in a ranking that reflected the importance of the service, which was the case in fewer than 5% of the line items (compared to over 70% of cases using the previous methodology). The following two examples illustrate line items that were given a very high score and a very low score as a result of this process. Schizophrenic Disorders Category 3 Weight: 75 Impact on Healthy Life Years: 8 Impact on Suffering: 4 Effects on Population: 4 Vulnerability of Population Affected: 0 Effectiveness: 3 Need for Service: 1 Net Cost: 5 Total Score: 3600 75 x [(8+4+4+0) x 3 x 1] = 3600 Grade I Sprains of Joints and Muscles Category 8 Weight: 5 Impact on Healthy Life Years: 1 Impact on Suffering: 1 Effects on Population: 0 Vulnerability of Population Affected: 0 Effectiveness: 2 Need for Service: 0.1 Net Cost: 4 Total Score: 2 5 x [(1+1+0+0) x 2 x 0.1] = 2 Services near the top of the list as a result of this reprioritization include maternity care and newborn services, preventive services found to be effective by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and treatments for chronic diseases su ch as diabetes, major depression, asthma, and hypertension, where ongoing maintenance therapy can prevent exacerbations of the disease that lead to avoidable high-i ntensity service utiliza tion, morbidity, and death. Biennial Review of the Prioritized List The Commission conducted its tenth bi ennial review of the Prioritized List of Health Services in the spring of 2010. Having developed a new prioritization methodology and conducted a reprioritization of the entire list in 2006, there was not the ne ed for a significant number of changes. Also reducing the need for an intensiv e biennial review was the fact that the interim modifications to the Prioritized List have taken on a larger importance as the list matures, to the point that they are now includi ng nearly all of the changes that involve individual codes (as opposed to the creation, deletion, merging or spli tting of entire line items). The creation and modification of practice guidelines are now also being handled exclus ively as part of the interim modification process (see Chapter Two for a discussion of all new and modified guidelines during the last two years). Finally, some Commission member s and particularly its staff continue to play key roles in work defining value-based benef it package for consideration as part of the health reform plan envisioned for the state by the Oregon Health Policy Board, filling time that was previously devoted to the maintenance of the Prioritized List. 7 For these reasons, the list being submitted fo r use during the 2012 and 2013 calendar years looks quite similar to that included in th e Commission's June 2009 biennial report5. Figures 1.3 through 1.6 show the major changes in the composition of line items as a result of this biennial review process. Figure 1.3 indicates that the postconcussion syndro me line was merged in to the line including the treatment of moderate and seve re head injury so that the c ontinuum of treatment is included in a single line. Figure 1.4 shows that treatments for influenza we re split out of the lin e including most viral respiratory infections. A guideline was previous ly in place to indicate the intent to cover hospitalization for influenza so this change ne gates the need for that guideline and moves the coverage of Tamiflu and other outpatient services for influenza to a high er line that reflects the ability to prevent death in a significant numbe r of patients, particularly the elderly.

Provider supplied evid ence showed that treatment effectiveness was much better than when the ranking was last consid ered. In addition to this line moving, the treatment of pars plan itis was added to this line a nd taken out of the line including ophthalmologic conditions with no effective trea tments available or no treatment necessary. Again, with recent evidence showing treatment ef fectiveness that warranted a higher placement. Most of the changes made during this biennial review involve the pr ioritization of dental services. With ten years having pa ssed since the last ri gorous review of th e dental lines on the list, the recently formed Dental Services Subcommittee spent over a year reviewing the composition of these lines, forming new lines, and applying the priori tization methodology to recommend the placement of the resulting lines to the full Commission. Figure 1.6 shows the eight dental lines from the 2010-11 Prioritized List that became twenty-one lines on the new list provided in Appendix D of this report.

Changes in line structur e occurred both in the funded and non-funded regions of the list, but the two lines between whic h the funding line was drawn for the 2010-11 list did not more; therefore new line 511 best equates to the benefi t package represented in lines 1-502 (the funded portion) of the 2010-11 list. The re vised Prioritized List of Health Services was then forwarded to the Oregon Health Authority's Actuarial Services Unit for pricing determinations. The actuarial analysis of the expected per capita costs of pr oviding various levels of services for the 11 different Medicaid elig ibility groups appears in their September 2010report titled, \"Oregon Health Plan Medicaid Demonstration: Anal ysis of Calendar Years 2012-13 - Average Costs6.\" Upon the approval of this Health Services Commission report, the 76th Oregon Legislative Assembly will set a funding level for the Prioritized List of Health Services for calendar years 2012-13 appearing in Appendix C. This will es tablish the basis for the OHP Plus and OHP Standard benefit packages for the Medicaid De monstration, whereby further exclusions may be applied. Only an abbreviated ve rsion of the list appears in A ppendix C with line numbers and line descriptions, but no codes. The complete draf t 2012-13 Prioritized List of Health Services is posted on the Commission's website, again at www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/HSC/ . Interim Modifications to the Prioritized List In addition to the work on the biennial review of the Prioritized List, the Commission continues to maintain the list as necessary during the interim periods. Fore most, this is a need to account for changes in the medical codesets on which th e list was built. The Commission asked for the authority to make adjustments to the list during the interim period that was granted in 1991 in the following statute: \"The commission may alter the list duri ng the interim only under the following conditions: a) technical changes due to errors and omission; or, b) changes due to advancements in medical technology or new data regarding health outcomes. If a service is deleted or added and no ne w funding is required, the Commission shall report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and th e President of the Senate. However, if a service to be added requires increased funding to avoid discontinuing another service, the Commission must repor t to the Emergenc y Board for funding.\"7 (emphasis added) The Commission accepts recommen dations for interim modificati ons from staff, other state agencies, participating health care plans, health care providers, OHP clie nts and other interested entities. The requests are initially forwarded for consideration to the Health Outcomes Subcommittee for physical health services, th e Subcommittee on Mental Health Care and Chemical Dependency Subcommittee or the Dental Services Subcommittee, as appropriate. A Subcommittee will often require at least two meetings to first hear the request and then have staff collect the necessary information in order to make a decision A requesting party can assume that it will likely take 3-4 months, and possibly longer, depending on the completeness of the information initially provided and the timing of the receipt of the request in comparison to the next scheduled Commission meeti ng. It should also be noted th at the Commission's decisions are based on what is best for the entire OHP population, not any one individual case. 6 Available at http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/healthplan /data_pubs/rates-costs/main.html . 7 ORS 414.720(5)a, (5)b and (6) 12 While these considerations continue to be used when new line items are created or entire line items are moved, most changes to the Prioritized List over the last seventeen years since its implementation have involved decisions to place/move individual codes representing specific medical treatments. Prior to 2003, most new tech nologies were added to the list in the absence of specific knowledge on the effectiveness of such a service. However, legislation passed during the 2003 session has had a profound effect on which services are included on the Prioritized List since then. House Bill 3624 directed th at the Health Services Commission: \"Shall consider both the clin ical effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of health services in determining their relative importance using peer-reviewed medical literature as defined in ORS 743.695.\" 8 In 2010 the Commission formalized its process as shown in Figure 1.7 for determining when evidence is compelling enough to consider placi ng a new service on the Prioritized List or reviewing the placement of a se rvice already on the list. Fi gure 1.8 provides an algorithm describing the Health Services Commission's process for incorporating both clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness when evidence warrants a change to the list. Finally, Figure 1.9 describes in which instances a change will i nvolve revising line rankings according to the prioritization methodology as part of the biennial review process described at the beginning of this chapter as opposed to when the change can be done during the interim period between biennial reviews . Technical Changes As the Prioritized List attempts to match some 14,000+ ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes with 8,000+ CPT-4 treatment codes, the Commission is aware that some appropriate condition-treatment groupings do not appear on the list . Some of these codes are om itted purposefully. For instance, appropriate diagnostic services are covered under OHP whether or not the final diagnosis appears in the funded region. Additionally, approp riate ancillary services such as prescription drugs and durable medical equipment are covered if the condition which they are being used to treat lie in the funded region. Because of the volume of codes that represent diagnostic and ancillary services, and the fact that they are ofte n associated with many different diagnoses, these codes usually do not appear on the list. Instea d, the Division of Medical Assistance Programs (DMAP) maintains electronic files to account for these co des and their fee-for-service reimbursement. Other appropriate pairings of condition and treatme nt codes may have been left off inadvertently. As these pairings are iden tified through DMAP's claims processing system, providers, or managed care plan s, the necessary changes are ma de to the list as interim modifications. Technical changes are typically made to the list only twice during a calendar year. Implementation of these technical changes coinci des with the release of new ICD-9-CM, CPT, CDT and HCPCS codes. Technical changes th at include the new ICD-9-CM codes always become effective on October 1 st of each year. Changes involving new (cont'd on page 17) 8 ORS 414.720 (4b). 13 FIGURE 1.7 GUIDELINES FOR SUBMITTED MATERIALS TO THE HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION The Health Services Commission will consider health services topics when evidence is presented to indicate that cu rrent condition-treatment pairings may be inappropriately ranked on the Prioriti zed List or are in need of updating. Situations where topics may be reviewed include: A new treatment that has become available, with acceptable evidence of its clinical effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness A change in current practice, best supported by high quality systematic reviews and/or evidence based guidelines When acceptable evidence is unavaila ble, expert opinion alone indicating that a more effective or cost-effectiv e treatment exists or that community standard of care differs from the current pairing wi ll be considered Please note that review of a topic does not necessarily lead to a change in the Prioritized List. All presenters to t he Commission must provide disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. The HSC relies heavily on high quality evidence and evidence-based guidelines in making its prioritization decisions. Lower quality evidence may be considered in situations where higher quality evidence is difficult to obtain (e.g., rare clinical conditions).

Discretion will be used, with the HSC Medical Director consulting with the Health Outcomes Subcommittee Chair, to determine if medium or low quality sources will be included for Commissioner review. A listing of other materials submitted but not included for Commissioner review will also be included in the packets to acknowledge their receipt, along with the reason for their omission. 15 FIGURE 1.8 PROCESS FOR INCORPORATING INFORM ATION ON CLINCAL INFORMATION AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS INTO THE PRIORITIZED LIST The HSC will review evidence as outlined in Figure 1.7. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of a treatment will be used according to the following algorithm: Effectiveness of treatment Probably effectiveUnknown EffectivenessNot effective Other treatments known to be effective?Do not add to, or remove from List Other treatments known to be effective? No Yes No Consider cost-effectiveness (see below). Compare favorably?Move, remove or do not add to List Yes No Add to or keep on ListIs treatment part of an established practice guideline? Yes No Consider limitation of treatment by step therapy or guidelineDo not add to, or remove from ListEffective 16 FIGURE 1.8 (CONT'D) The cost of a technology will be considered according to the grading scale below, with \"A\" representing compelling evidence for adoption, \"B\" representing strong evidence for adoption, \"C\" representing moderate evidence fo r adoption, \"D\" representing weak evidence for adoption and \"E\" being compelling evidence for rejection: A = more effective and cheaper than existing technology B = more effective and costs < $25,000/LYS or QALY > existing technology C = more effective and costs $25,000 to $125,000/LYS or QALY > existing technology D = more effective and costs > $125,000/LYS or QALY > existing technology E = less or equally as effective and more costly than existing technology FIGURE 1.9 OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION'S PRIORITIZATION PROCESS Placement of a New ICD-9-CM Code In most cases a new ICD-9-CM code will simply be a higher specificity for an existing code and will be placed on the list where its third or fourth-digit parent code already exists. In cases where the ICD-9-CM code represents a new disease or where the code of higher specificity does not belong on the line where the existing code is placed, the code is placed on the most appropriate line according to the methodology shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. This will be done as an interim modification effective October 1. Placement of a New CPT-4 Code Use the criteria described in Figur e 1.7 to determine whether the use of the procedure is experimental and, if not, whether evidence warrants its placement on the line in which the diagnosis code for which pairing is desired exists. If evidence does not support placement at this level of priority, use the process described in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 to determine where the pairing should be placed. This will be done as an interim modification effective April 1. Placement of a Previously Non-paired CPT-4 Code Use the criteria described in Figur e 1.7 to determine whether the use of the procedure is experimental and, if not, whether evidence warrants its placement on the line in which the diagnosis code for which pairing is desired exists. If evidence does not support placement at this level of priority, use the process described in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 to determine where the pairing should be placed. This will be done as an interim modification unless a significant fiscal impact results. Deletion of an Existing CPT-4 Code Use the criteria described in Figure 1.7 to determine whether the use of the procedure is experimental or if evidence dictates that the code should be removed from a line or the list in general. This can be done as either an interim modification or, if public or provider input is desired, as a biennial review change. Movement of an Existing Line Item This can only be done during the biennial review process. Use the process described in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 to determine new placement. 17 FIGURE 1.9 (CONT'D) Movement of an Existing ICD-9-CM/CPT-4 Code Pairing This can be done either during the biennial review process or as an interim modification if there is no significant fiscal impact. Use the process descri bed in Figures 1.1 and 1.2 to determine placement. Creation of a New Guideline As this is likely to result in a cost savings, a new guideline can usually be created as an interim modification. Revision of an Existing Guideline This can likely be done as an interim modification, but a significant change or deletion of the guideline in its entirely could potentially need to be done as a biennial review change. (cont'd from page 12) CPT, CDT and HCPCS codes are made as early as possible in the new year, but the timing of their release combined with the volume of new codes for re view have not allowed the Commission to make their decisions in time to allow for the successful implementation of these changes at the first of the year. In order to assist DMAP and the mana ged care plans in being HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and A ccountability Act of 1996) compliant, the HSC places information on their probable action i nvolving new procedure codes in mid-December, prior to their effective date. Detailed docum entation on all interim modifications to the Prioritized List of Health Services dating back at least three years can be found on the Commission's website at the following address: www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/HSC . On January 15, 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv ices (CMS) announced that the implementation of ICD-10-CM will take place on October 1, 2013. The Health Services Commission began work on the conversion of the Pr ioritized List of Health Services from ICD- 9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes June 2010. Staff wo rked with the Subcommittee on Mental Health Care and Chemical Dependency (MHCD) Services to map the new codes to existing lines. As in past exercises involving significan t review of the Prioritized List , it is being recommended that some current lines be split, merged, added or deleted. Beginning in April 2011 HSC staff began meeting with the first of 40+ provider groups to gain their assistance with the conversion of the non-MHCD lines on the list. The recommendations resulting from this work will be brought back to the Health Outcomes Subcommittee for review and then forwarded to the full commission for final consideration. It is anticip ated that the conversion of the list will be completed along as a part of the bienni al review of the list in June 2012. Advancements in Medical Technology The Commission periodically receives requests to modify the placement or content of condition- treatment pairs to reflect signi ficant advancements in medical technology. These requests often come from medical providers a nd commercial developers of em erging technologies, but will be accepted from any source. The Commission staff assembles needed background information and arranges to have experts testify before the H ealth Outcomes Subcommittee as it prepares a recommendation for the full Commission. 18 If an added service is projected by the OHA's Actuar ial Services Unit to ha ve a significant fiscal impact on the OHP Medicaid Demonstration, the Health Services Commission is required to appear before the Legislative Emergency Boar d to request additional funding. To date, no interim modifications have been found to have such a significant fiscal impact. During the 2009-11 biennium the Commission reviewed a number of issues that fall under the medical advancements category, as presented in Figure 1.10. FIGURE 1.10 MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS REVIEWED Technology Name/Description Commission Action Intrathecal pumps for chronic non-cancer pain control Deleted from Lines 397 (Disorders of Spine with Neurologic Impairment), 552 (Acute and Chronic Disorders of Spine without Neurologic Impairment) and 624 (Disorders Of Soft Tissue). Kept on cancer and dysfunction lines. Codes which allow for maintenance of pumps were kept on Lines 397, 552 and 624 with a specification that these pumps are only covered for pumps implanted prior to April 2009. Heart-kidney transplants Codes for renal transplants added to the cardiac transplant line, Line 279 (Congestive Heart Failure, Cardiomyopathy, Transposition of Great Vessels, Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome) with a guideline Growth hormone treatments Growth hormone treatments were expanded to several additional conditions, including chronic renal insufficiency, Noonan's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and SHOX; but not cystic fibrosis. Treatments with growth hormone for adults were not included. Small bowel transplant Removed from Line 253 (Short Bowel Syndrome - Age 5 or Under) Varicose vein treatments Not added to list Gamekeepers thumb Arthroplasty for repair of gamekeepers thumb added to Line 403 (Disruptions of the Ligaments and Tendons of the Arms and Legs, Excluding the Knee, Grade II and III) Vertebroplasty Removed from the list Second solid organ transplants Removed guideline restricting their coverage Anesthesia catheters No change to list 19 FIGURE 1.10 (CONT'D) Technology Name/Description Commission Action Botulinum injections for spasmodic dysphonia Not added to list Negative pressure wound therapy Coverage added with ancillary guideline Stereotactic body radiation therapy No change to list Treatments for chronic sinusitis No change to list Contralateral breast reconstruction No change to list Non-myeloablative transplants Added to the list Hyperbaric oxygen treatment No change to list Hip core decompression Added to Line 381 (Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Osteochon dritis Dissecans, and Aseptic Necrosis of Bone) with guideline Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units Removed from the list Home sleep test Recommended DMAP add to Diagnostic File Nutritional counseling Added to list Tip of the nose reconstruction Added to list with guideline Cardiac CT angiogram Not added to list Value-Based Services The Health Services Commission ha s identified 20 sets of health care services, known as value- based services (VBS), which can be used ri ght away by insurance companies and purchasers both in the private and public sectors. Value-base d services are medications, tests, or treatments that are highly effective, low cost, and ha ve lots of evidence s upporting their use. The Commission recommends these services have no cost sharing (copays or coin surance) to patients in order to encourage the us e of these services, given th eir high level of benefit. The VBS concept is based on the work of the Oregon Health Fund Board Benefits Committee, refined through a series of public workgroup and Health Services Commission meetings. Removing barriers to these effective services and treatments should help reduce higher cost interventions (like hospital admissions), leading to lower health care costs and a healthier population. Services had to meet the following criteria for inclusion: Ambulatory services (i.e. out patient), and include medi cations, diagnostic tests, procedures, and some office visits Primarily offered in the medical home 20 Primarily focused on chronic illness management , preventive care, and/or maternity care Of clear benefit, strongly supported by evidence Cost-effective Reduce hospitalizations or Emergency Departme nt visits, reduce future exacerbations or illness progression, or improve quality of life Low cost up front High utilization desired Low risk of inappropr iate utilization Some examples of value-based services include : insulin and certain medications for diabetic patients; generic blood pressure medications a nd nurse case management for congestive heart failure patients; and certain gene ric medications and lab tests for patients with coronary artery disease. For a complete list please see http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/HSC/docs/VBS.pdf . The Commission has established VBS separate from the Prioritized List of Health Services so that this tool can be used immediately. While the VBS concep t can be applied to the Oregon Health Plan (OHP), many OHP reci pients already receive these serv ices with little or no cost- sharing. Instead, it is expected that the VBS concept could have a more significant impact in the commercial health insurance market, where these se rvices could explicitly be offered without the considerable copays or co insurance often required now. Similar proposals from the Health Leadership Council and the American Heart Association were examined and incorporated where applicable. The inclusion of specific health care services required high-quality supporting evidence such as Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled clinical trials and evidence-based guide lines. In the future, other services will likely be reviewed, and the VBS updated annually to ensure that the most current evidence is used for designing coverage. HSC Policy Regarding Medicati ons, DME and Other Ancillary Services Multiple questions have come to the HSC in r ecent years which directly address coverage of particular medications. Oregon ha s a process in place to evaluate medications and other types of treatments through the reviews of the Health Resources Commission (HRC) and the Division of Medical Assistance Program's (DMAP's) Drug U tilization Review (DUR) Board. As discussed in the previous section, the HSC considers prescription drugs to be ancillary treatments. Therefore they have only reviewed a drug in the context of whethe r its effectiveness of treating a condition will affect the ranking of that condition on the list. HS C staff has worked with HRC and DMAP staff to clarify the HSC's role and au thority on the coverage of specific medications and similar ancillary services. As part of th ese discussions, the HSC developed the following policy that was finalized just after th e publishing of the Commission's 2009 report: The Health Services Commission (HSC) has auth ority over the Prioritized List, including placement of conditions and treatments on the list. The HSC is expected to include cost- benefit assessments for treatments considered for inclusion on the list, balancing the needs of 21 the OHP population as a whole and the expe nditures of limited resources. The HSC can create, in an open and public manner, guide lines which recommend restrictions or limitations on the coverage of medications, durable me dical equipment (DME), or other ancillary services, as they relate to conditions and treatments on the Prioritized List. Such guidelines are expected to be implemented to the best ability of DMAP and prepaid managed care health services organizations, as allowed by federal a nd state rules and regulations. These guidelines set a minimum coverage level for DMAP a nd the prepaid managed care health services organizations. Decisions of the HSC regarding medications, DME, or other ancillary services which are not placed into guidelin es are considered advisory only. CHAPTER TWO: CLARIFICATIONS TO THE PRIORITIZED LIST OF HEALTH SERVICES 23 Practice Guidelines The 1993 Oregon Legislative Assembly expanded the Commission's charge to include the development and/or adoption of practice guidelines to refine the Prioritized List of Health Services. Additional legislation in 1997 revi sed the charge and allowed the Commission discretion as to whether a line item on the list would benef it from a clarifying guideline: \"In order to encourage effe ctive and efficient medica l evaluation and treatment, the commission may include clinical practi ce guidelines in its prioritized list of services. The commission shall actively solicit testimony and information from the medical community and the public to bu ild a consensus on clinical practice guidelines developed by the commission.\" 9 The Commission uses practice guidelines to classi fy the severity of conditions that are not adequately described by an ICD- 9-CM diagnostic code. For a speci fic diagnosis there is usually a continuum of treatments: watchful waiting, trea ting medically, minimally invasive procedures, or the most aggressive procedures. The sever ity guidelines adopted by the HSC since 2002 are \"indications for a definitive procedure\" de rived from comparing pertinent guidelines from specialty societies and the National Guideline Clearinghouse10. Guidelines are also used to identify effective pr eventive services for both children and adults and are increasingly necessary for rapidly advancing tr eatment options that are more beneficial for a subset of patients than for the general population. The prevention guideline s associated with the list are largely based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force' s (USPSTF's) Guide to Clinical Services, Second Edition (1996) and its subsequent updates. During the past biennium, the Commission added several guidelines and modified others to assure the most effective use of Oregon Hea lth Plan funds. Seventeen new guidelines were developed, including criteria fo r negative pressure wound ther apy, spine MRIs, and cancer treatment near the end of life. The Commission made modifications to seventeen previously established guidelines such as those on bariatric surgery, PET scan s, rehabilitation therapies and lymphedema treatment. In addition, five statem ents of intent or guide lines were deleted and added to the list as a coding specification incl uding guidance for mastocytosis and intestinal malabsorption. In the case where an existing guideline has been revised, all new text is underlined and deleted text is indicated with strikethrough. Statements of Intent Death With Dignity Act The Commission approved, then revised the Palli ative Care Task Force's recommendation to clarify the Commission's intent on the coverage of services related to the Death With Dignity Act. 9 ORS 414.720 (4) 10 www.guideline.gov 24 It is the intent of the Commission that services under ORS 127.800-127.897 (Oregon Death with Dignity Act) be covered for those that wish to avail themselves to those services. Such services include but are not be limited to the attending physician visits, consulting physician confirmation, mental health evaluation a nd counseling, and prescription medications. Hospitalization For Acute Viral Infections This Statement of Intent was deleted and translat ed into a guideline for services appearing on the Prioritized List of Health Services and placed with lines 540, 547, 561 and 634. Most acute viral infections are self -limited (e.g. colds, infectious mononucleosis, gastroenteritis). However, som e viral infections such as viral pneumonia, aseptic meningitis, or severe gastroenteritis may require hospitalization to treat the complications of the primary disease. Accepted coding practices insist that the und erlying condition in these cases be the p rinciple diagnosis. For example, complicated viral pne umonia requiring respiratory support with a ventilator would have a principle diagnosis of viral pneumonia and a secondary diagnosis of respiratory failure. Since the ICD -9-CM code for viral pneumonia has historically appeared only on a non -funded line, treatment has not been reimbursable regardless of the severity of the disease. In contrast, the code for viral gastroenteritis appears on line 296 and any necessary outpatient or inpatient services wou ld be covered. The Commission has added the following stat ements to indicate their intent that reimbursement for the treatment of certain condi tions appearing low on the Prioritized List should be provided in severe cases of the disease. Diagnosis: OTH ER NONINFECTIOUS GASTROENTERITIS AND COLITIS Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY Line: 541 Treatment of non -infectious gastroenteritis of significant severity that is associated with dehydration should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requi rement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. Diagnosis: VIRAL, SELF -LIMITING ENCEPHALITIS, MYELITIS AND encepha litis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis of significant severity that is associated with either obtundation or dehydrat ion should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. 25 Diagnosis: ASEPTIC MENINGITIS Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY Line: 562 Treatment of aseptic meningitis of signific ant severity that is associated with either obtundation or dehydration should be a c overed service if the case fulfills the requi rement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. Diagnosis: OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS, EXCLUDING PNEUMONIA DUE TO RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS IN PERSONS UNDER AGE 3 Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY Line: 635 Treatment of viral pneumonia of significan t severity that is associated with either respiratory failure or dehydration should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity o f illness. Integrated Care Understanding that many high-risk medical client s may be best served by receiving supportive services for their physical health conditions in a mental health setting, the Commission accepted the MHCD Subcommittee's recommendation to add a new statement of intent to facilitate integrated care. Recognizing that many individuals with mental health disorders receive care predominantly from mental health care providers, and recognizing that integrating mental and physical health services for such individuals promotes patient-centered care, the Health Services Commission endorses the incorporation of ch ronic disease health management support within mental health service systems. Although such supports are not part of the mental health benefit package, mental health organiz ations (MHOs) that elect to provide these services may report them using psychiatric rehabilitation codes which pair with mental health diagnoses. If MHOs choose to provide tobacco cessation supports, they should report these services using 99407 for individual counseling and S9453 for classes. Nerve Blocks This Statement of Intent was deleted and translat ed into a guideline for services appearing on the Prioritized List of Health Serv ices and placed with Lines 1,4,7,10,11,14,22,26,30,31,33,35,40- 43,48-55,57-65,68,70,72-79,83-103,105,106,108-111,113,115,116,118,122-126,129-132,136-139,141-151,153,154,158,159,161-167,169-173,175-178,181,182,184,186-202,204,206-208,211,214,215,217-222,224-227,229-234,236-238,240,242,243,245,247-250,252-263,266-268,270-280,282,285-287,290-293,296-298,300,302,303,306-314,317-325,327,329-335,337-340,342-345,347-354,358-363,365-367,370-373,375-382,385,386,388-392,394,397-404,406-408,410,413,415-419,421-424,426,428,431-437,440-443,445-449,451-454,456-460,462,464,465,468,469,475-477,480-485,487-489,491-498,500-502 and 556. 26 The Health Services Commission intends that single injection and con tinuous nerve blocks should be covered services if they are requi red for successful completion of perioperative pain control for, or post -operative recovery from a covered operative procedure when the diagnosis requiring the operative procedure is also cov ered. Additionally, nerve blocks, are covered services for patients hospitalized with trauma, cancer, or intractable pain conditions, if the underlying condition is a covered diagnosis. Palliative Care The palliative care statement of intent wa s revised according to the recommendations of Palliative Care Task Force. It is the intent of the Commission that comfort palliative care treatments services be covered for patients with an a life-threatening illness with <5% or severe advanced illness expected 5 year survival be a covered service. to progress toward dying, regardless of the goals for medical treatment and with services ava ilable according to the patient's expected length of life (see examples below). Palliative care is comprehensive, specialized care ideally provided by an interdisciplinary team (which may include but is not limited to physicians, nurses, social workers, etc.) where care is particularly focused on alleviating suffering and promoting quality of life. Such interdisciplinary care should include assess ment, care planning, and care coordination, emotional and psychosocial counseling for patients and families, assistance accessing services from other needed community resources, and should reflect the patient and family's values and goals. Comfort/ Some examples of palliative care includes the provision of services or items that give comfort should be available to and/or relieve symptoms for such patients. There is no intent with a life-threatening/limiting illness, 1. without regard to limit comfort/ a patient's expected length of life: Inpatient palliative care services according to the expected length of life (e.g., consultation; and, Outpatient palliative care consultation, office visits. 2. with an expected median survival of less than one year, as supported by the best available published evidence: Home-based palliative care services (t o be defined by DMAP), with the expectation that the patient will move to home hospice care. 3. with an expected median survival of six months) for such patients, except as specified by Oregon Administrative Rules. or less, as supported by peer-reviewed literature: Home hospice care, where the primary goal of care is quality of life (hospice services to be defined by DMAP). It is the intent of the Commission to not cov er diagnostic or curative care for the primary illness or care focused on active treatment of that certain palliative care treatments be covered when these treatments carry the primary goal to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life, without intending to alter the trajectory of the underlying disease progression . 27 Some examples of covered comfort/ palliative care treatments include: Radiation therapy for painful bone metasta ses with the intent to relieve pain and improve quality of life. Surgical decompression for patients with <5% expected 5 year survival malignant bowel obstruction . Medication therapy such as chemotherapy with low toxicity/low side effect agents with the goal to decrease pain from bulky di sease or other identified complications. Cost of chemotherapy and alternative me dication(s) should also be considered. Medication for symptom co ntrol and/or pain relief; In-home, day care services, and hospi ce services as defined by DMAP; Medical equipment (such as wheelchairs or walkers) determined to be medically appropriate for completion of basic activities of daily living; and supplies (such as non-motorized wheelchairs, walkers, bandages, and catheters) determined to be medically appropriate for completion of basic activities of daily living, for management of symptomatic complications or as required for symptom control. Acupuncture with intent to relieve nausea. Cancer treatment with intent to palliate is no t a covered service when the same palliation can be achieved with pain medication s or other non-chemotherapy agents. It is NOT the intent of the Commission that coverage for palliativ e care encompasses those treatments that seek to prolong life despite substantial burdens of treatment and limited chance of benefit. See Guideline Note 12: TREATMENT OF CANCER WITH LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT PROVIDED NEAR THE END OF LIFE. Ancillary And Diagnostic Services Not Appearing On The Prioritized List One of the earliest decisions made in developing th e Prioritized List is that it would only apply to treatments after a definitive diagnosis is established; that diagnostic services necessary to determine the diagnosis would alwa ys be covered. In the nineteen years since that decision was made, diagnostic tests have become more advan ced, more expensive, and are utilized more frequently, in part due to the practice of defensive medicine. Beginning with PET scans during the 2003-05 biennium, the Commission has conti nued to develop guidelines for diagnostic services to help ensure appropriate utilization and control costs. CPT and HCPCS codes for PET scans were added to specific lin e items on the list, but codes for non-prenatal genetic testing and other diagnostic services remain off the lis t. In 2010 the Commission developed the first guideline for an ancillary service, negative pressure wound therapy, with the same goal of controlling costs through a ppropriate utilization. MRI of the Spine Diagnostic Service This new guideline was crafted to define when spinal MRIs should be allowed. 28 MRI of the spine is covered in the following situations: 1. Recent onset of major or progressive neurologi c deficit (objective evidence of reflex loss, dermatomal muscle weakness, dermatomal sensory loss, EMG or NCV evidence of nerve root impingement), suspected cauda e quine syndrome (loss of bowel or bladder control or saddle anesthesia), or neurogenic claudication in patients who are potential candidates for surgery; 2. Clinical or radiological suspicion of neoplasm; or, 3. Clinical or radiological suspicion of infection. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Ancillary Service A new guideline was created to determine under which circumstances this ancillary service should be covered. In developing this coverage guideline the Commission drew heavily from the recommendations from the evidence review conducted by the Health Resources Commission. Negative pressure wound therapy (97605, 97606) is a covered benefit only for patients who: 1. Have wounds that are refractory to or have failed standard therapies; 2. Are not suitable candidates fo r surgical wound closure; or, 3. Are at high risk for delayed or non-healin g wounds due to factors such as compromised blood flow, diabetic complications, wounds with high risk of fecal contamination, extremely exudative wounds, and similar situations. Guideline Notes For Health Se rvices That Appear On The Prioritized List Attention Deficit And Hyperactivity Disorders Children Age Five and Under Line 133 The guideline title was amended to clarify for w hom the services apply. The previous title was 'Attention Deficit And Hyperactiv ity Disorders In Early Childhood.' Adjustment Reactions In Children Age Five and Under Line 461 The previous title was 'Adjustment Reactions In Early Childhood.' Th e guideline title was amended and the guideline restructured to clarify for whom the services apply. ICD-9-CM code 309.89 can be used for individuals of any age. However, when using it for children five years of age or younger, who have experienced abuse or neglect, the following must apply: A) The child must demonstrate some symptoms of PTSD (such as disruption of his or her usual sleeping or eating patterns, or more increased irritability/lower frustration tolerance) but does not meet the full criteria for PTSD or any other disorder. 29 B) 309.89 is limited to pairings with the following procedure 90812 Medication Management, 90862, is not indicated for this condition in children five years of age or younger. Note: Cessation of the traumatic exposure must be the first priority. Infants and toddlers may benefit from parental guidance regarding management of the child's symptoms, parental guidance around enhancing safety and stability in the child's environment, and therapeutic support for the parents. Two V-codes, the use of V61.20 (Counseling for Parent-Child Problem, Unspecified, must involve all of the following: ) and V62.82 (Bereavement, Uncomplicated), may only be used as secondary diagnoses to the primary diagnosis of 309.89, and only for children five years of age or younger. A) When using V61.20, the following must be five years of age or younger apply: 1) Service provision will have a clinically significant impact on the child. 2) A rating of 40 or below lower has been assessed on the PIR-GAS (Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale). 3) V62.82, Bereavement, Uncomplicated, is on ly included in this line when identified as a secondary diagnosis with a primary diagnosis of ICD -9-CM 309.89, Other Specified Adjustment Reactions. The use of same limitations in pairings to CPT and HCPCS codes as given for ICD-9-CM code 309.89 apply, with the only exception being that 90810 and 90812 cannot be used. B) When using V62.82 is only appropriate when a child birth through five years old , the following must apply: 1) The child exhibits a change in functioning subsequent to the loss of a primary caregiver, ; 2) The child exhibits at least three of the following eight symp toms AND symptoms are present for most of the day, for more days than not, f or at least 2 weeks : a) Crying, calling and/or searching fo r the absent primary caregiver, b) Refusing attempts of others to provide comfort, c) Emotional withdrawal manifesting in lethargy, sad facial expression, and lack of interest in age-appropriate activities that do not meet mood disorder criteria, d) Disruptions in eating and sleeping that do not meet criteria for feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood, e) Regression in or loss of previously achieved developmental milestones not attributable to other health or mental health conditions, f) Constricted range of affect not attributable to a mood disorder or PTSD, g) Detachment, seeming indifference toward, or selective \"forgetting\" of the lost caregiver and/or of remi nders of the lost caregiver, 30 h) Acute distress or extreme sensitivity in response to any reminder of the caregiver or to any change in a possession, activity, or place related to the lost caregiver; 3) The symptoms in B(2) above are exhibi ted for most of the day and for more days than not, for at least 2 weeks. 4) The same limitations in pairings to CPT and HCPCS codes as given for ICD-9- CM code 309.89 apply. Note: Intervention should include persons significantly involved in the child's care and include psychoeducation and developmentally-specific guidance. V61.20 and V62.82, used as secondary diagnosis codes to 309.89 , in children age five and younger are limited to pairings wi th the following procedure therapy: 90810, 908 12 Medication management, 90862, is not indicated for these conditions in children age 5 and under. 309.89, Other Specified Adjustment Reactions, may be used in children age five and younger when the child demonstrates some symptoms of PTSD (such as disru ption of his or her usual sleeping or eating patterns, or more increased irritability / lower frustration tolerance) but does not meet the full cri teria for PTSD or any other disorder. Cessation of the traumatic exposu re must be the first priority. Infant s and toddlers may benefit from parental guidance regarding management of the child's symptoms, guidance around enhancing safety and stability in the child's environment, and therapeutic support for the parents. Use of 309.89 in children age 5 and under, without a secondary diagnosis of V61.20 or V62.82, is limited to pairings wi th the management, 90862, is not indicated for these conditions in children age 5 and under. Guideline Note 20, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders In Children Age Five And Under Line 133 31 The guideline title was amended to clarify for w hom the services apply. The previous title was 'Attention Deficit and Hyperactiv ity Disorders In Early Childhood.' Autism Spectrum Disorders Line 210 This new guideline was developed by the MH CD subcommittee and revised by the Health Outcomes Subcommittee as the condition was split in to a new line, to call attention to additional supports the Commission belie ves a patient may need. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of treatment (e.g., Applied Behavioral Analysis) for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, effective treatments may be available for co-morbid conditions such as mood disorders. When treating co-morbid conditions, that condition, not an ASD diagnosis, should be the primary diagnosis for billing purposes. The treatment of co-morbid mental he alth conditions should be consistent with the treatment methods, frequency, and durat ion normally applied to those diagnoses. Treatment of neurologic dysfunctions that may be seen in individuals with an ASD diagnosis are prioritized according to the four dysfunction lines found on the Prioritized List (Lines 77, 317, 372 and 404). Treatment for associated behaviors, such as agitation, that do not meet the criteria for co-morbid mental health diagnoses should be limited in frequency to a maximum of 8 hours of behavioral health service per month, subject to utilization management review by the mental health organization (MHO) or other relevant payer. Bariatric Surgery Lines 33,607 The bariatric surgery guideline was am ended to achieve the following goals: Have the guideline apply to the restored line in the nonfunded porti on of the list that includes surgeries for individuals that do not have type II diabetes or otherwise do not qualify for surgery under the higher ranking line. Eliminate coverage of multiple surgeries of the same type when not due to the failure of the original surgery. Eliminate the requirement of a six-mont h observation period pr ior to surgery. Expand access through surgical facilities that ha ve not yet acquired center of excellence certification but are progre ssing towards that status. Bariatric surgery for obesity is included on Line 33 TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS, and Line 607 OBESITY under the following criteria: A. Age 18 B. 2. BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes 2. BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes For inclusion on Line 33: BMI 35 with co-morbid type II diabetes. For inclusion on Line 607: BMI >=35 with at least one significant co-morbidity other than type II diabetes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) or BMI >= 40 without a significant co-morbidity. 32 C. No prior history of Roux-en-Y gastric by pass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, unless they resulted in failure due to complications of the original surgery. D. Participate in the following four eval uations and meet criteria as described. 1. Psychosocial evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed mental health professional) a) Evaluation to assess compliance with post-operative requirements. b) No current abuse of or dependence on alcohol. Must remain free of abuse of or dependence on alcohol during the six-month observation period immediately preceding surgery. No current use of nicotine or illicit drugs and must remain abstinent from their use during the six- month observation period. Testing will, at a minimum, be conducted within one month of the surgery to confirm abstinence from nicotine and illicit drugs. c) No mental or behavioral disorder that may interfere with postoperative outcomes 1. d) Patient with previous psychiatric illness must be stable for at least 6 months. 2. Medical evaluation: (Conducted by OHP primary care provider) a) Pre-operative physical condition and mortality risk assessed with patient found to be an appropriate candidate. b) Optimize medical control of diabetes, hypertension, or other co- morbid conditions. c) Female patient not currently pregnant with no plans for pregnancy for at least 2 years post-surgery. Contraception methods reviewed with patient agreement to use effective contraception through 2nd year post-surgery. 3. Surgical evaluation: (Conducted by a li censed bariatric surgeon associated with program 2) a) Patient found to be an appropriat e candidate for surgery at initial evaluation and throughout a six -month observatio n period leading to surgery while continuously enrolled on OHP. b) Received counseling by a credentialed expert on the team regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure 3 and understands the many potential complications of the surgery (including death) and the realistic expectations of post-surgical outcomes. iii. If the patient is found to no lo nger be an appropriate candidate for surgery for any reason listed in these criteria during the six -month observation period, a new six -month observation period w ill be required to precede surgery once surgic al candidacy has been re -established. 4. Dietician evaluation: (Conducted by licensed dietician) a) Evaluation of adequacy of prior dietary efforts to lose weight. If no or inadequate prior dietary effort to lose weight, must undergo six-month medically supervised weight reduction program. b) Counseling in dietary lifestyle changes E) Participate in additional evaluations: 1. Post-surgical attention to lifestyle, an exercise program and dietary changes and understands the need for post-surgical follow-up with all applicable professionals (e.g. nutritionist, psychologist/psychiatrist, exercise physiologist or physical therapist, supp ort group participation, regularly scheduled physician follow-up visits). 33 1Many patients (>50%) have depression as a co-m orbid diagnosis that, if treated, would not preclude their participation in the bariatric surgery program. 2All surgical services including evaluation are to be performed at a center of excellence for bariatric surgery as recognized by Medicare. All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) or the Surgical Review Corporation (SCR), or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway-directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have perf ormed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric ca ll coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric- grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care fo r patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing ACS or SRC certification, it must also restrict ca re to lower-risk OHP patients including: age < 65 no major elective revis ional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel-chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary co mpromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). 3Only Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy are approved for inclusion. 4The patient must meet criteria #1 and , #2, and #3 , and be referred by the OHP primary care provider as a medically appropriate candidate, to be approved for evaluation at a qualified bariatric surgery program. Basic Restorative Dental Care Line 357 This guideline was revised to specify when retreatment of a cr own is appropriate. Composites for posterior teeth will be reimbursed at the same rate as amalgams and choice of material left crown to root ratio is 50:50 or better; 2. the tooth is restorable without other surgical procedures; or, 3. loss of tooth would result in the need for removable prosthodontics. Cancers of Esophagus, Liver, Pancreas, Gallbladder and Other Biliary Lines 337-339,452 This guideline was edited to make the language consistent with Guideline Note 12, Treatment of Cancer with Little or No Benef it Provided Near the End of Life. Retreatment with chemotherapy after failure from the first full course of chemotherapy places the patient in the less than 5% chance of survival category. See Comfort/Palliative Care Statement of Intent category of treatment of cancer with little or no benefit provided near the end of life. See Guideline Note 12. 34 Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request Line 1 The new guideline was developed to curb incr easing requests for cesar ean delivery without medical necessity. Cesarean delivery on maternal request without medical or obstetrical indication is not a covered service. Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion Line 492 After a literature review, this guideline was amended to remove the requirement that both ears be affected and add language regarding effusion (a collection of fluid that occurs within the middle ear). Antibiotic and other medication therapy a re not indicated for children with bilateral chronic nonsuppurative otitis media with effusion (OME) . Children with bilateral chronic nonsuppurative otitis media OME present for 3 months or longer or with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss at any time should have hearing testing. Children with bilateral chronic nonsuppurative otitis media OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or struct ural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. For the child who has had bilateral chronic nonsuppurative otitis media OME and who has a hearing deficiency diagnosed by formal audiometry testing, bilatera lin in the better- hearing ear of 25 dB or greater , myringotomy with tube insertion recommended after a total of 4 to 6 months of bilateral effusion with a documented bilateral hearing deficit. Adenoidectomy is an appropriate surgical treatment for bilate ral chronic nonsuppurative otitis media OME in children over 3 years with their second set of tubes. First time tubes are not an indication for an adenoidectomy. Cochlear Implantation, Age 5 and Under Line 297 The guideline title was amended to clarify for w hom the services apply. The previous title was 'Cochlear Implantation, Age Less Than 5.' Complicated Hernias Line 175 For clarity, the Commission added their defin ition of incarcerated to the guideline. 35 Complicated hernias are included on this line if they are incarcerated (defined as non- reducible by physical manipulation) or have symptoms of obstruction and/or strangulation. Congenital Chordee Lines 451,677 This new guideline was introduced as a new 2011 diagnostic code for the condition was placed on the list. Congenital chordee is included on Line 451 only for severe cases (35 degrees of curvature or greater) and for all cases asso ciated with hypospadias. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Screening Lines 1,3,4 This new guideline was created to define use of this form of genetic testing. Cystic fibrosis carrier testing is covered for 1) non-pregnant adults if indicated in the genetic testing algorithm or 2) pregnant women. Disruptive Behavior Disorders in Children Age Five and Under Line 438 The guideline title was amended to clarify for w hom the services apply. The previous title was 'Disruptive Behavior Diso rders in Early Childhood.' Early Intervention for Psychosis Lines 27,32,294 This new guideline was added to make clear th e Commission's intention for the coverage of these services, which is not necessarily eviden t from a strict listing of procedure codes. These lines include \"early intervention for psycho sis,\" a multidisciplinary specialty team-based intervention that includes: 1. Psychiatric medication management 2. Individual counseling 3. Family group therapy 4. Family individual therapy The goal of the early intervention is to minimize harms of a first outbreak of psychosis and improve long-term functioning. 36 Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent (ESA) Guideline Lines 33,65,78,101,102,105,123-125,131,138,144,159,166-168,170,181,197,198,206-208,219, 221,222,229,230,232,236,243,249,252,275-278,280,286,291,309-311,313,319,337-339,350,354,365,452,612 This guideline was created to clarify when this treatment should be used. A) Indicated for anemia (Hgb < 10gm/dl or Hct < 30%) induced by cancer chemotherapy, in given within the previous 8 weeks or in the setting of myelodysplasia or in chronic renal failure, with or without dialysis . 1. Reassessment should be made after 8 weeks of treatment. If no response, treatment should be discontinued. If response is demonstrated, EPO ESAs should be titrated to maintain a discontinued once the hemoglobin level between reaches 10,and 12 unless a lower hemoglobin level is sufficient to avoid the need for blood transfusion. B) Indicated for anemia (Hgb < 10gm/dl or HCT < 30%) associated with HIV/AIDS. 1. An endogenous erythropoietin level < 500 IU/L is required for treatment, and patient may not be receiving zidovudine (AZT) > 4200 mg/week. 2. Reassessment should be made after 8 week s. If no response, treatment should be discontinued. If response is demonstrated, EPO ESAs should be titrated to maintain a level between 10 and 12. C) Indicated for anemia (Hgb < 10 gm/dl or HCT <30%) associated with chronic renal failure, with or without dialysis. 1. Reassessment should be made after 8 week s. If no response, treatment should be discontinued. If response is demonstrated, ESAs should be titrated to maintain a level between 11 and 12. Growth Hormone Treatment Lines 411,485 This new guideline was created to reflect those cond itions for which growth hormone treatment has been shown to be appropriate and effective. Treatment with growth hormone is included only for children with: pituitary dwarfism, Turner's syndrome, Prader-Willi-syndrome, N oonan's syndrome, short stature homeobox- containing gene (SHOX), chronic kidney disease (stages 3, 4, 5 or 6) and those with renal transplant. Treatment with growth hormone should continue only until adult height as determined by bone age is achieved. Treatmen t is not included for isolated deficiency of human growth hormone or other conditions in adults. Health and Behavior Assessment/Intervention Lines 1,6,8,10-18,20-22,25,26,28,29,33-37,39-42,46,47,50,52,53,55,56,61,63,65,66,68,70,73,75, 78,79,81,83,84,86,91,93,95,97,99-102,105,108-111,113,115,119,122-124,128,134,135,137,138,140,141,144,146,147,149-151,158,159,164-169,173,179,181-183,185,190,191,193,195-197,199,201,202,205,207-211,219,221,222,225,228-230,233,234,236-238,244,246,249,250,252-256,265-268,271-279,284,286,287,289,291,292,301,303,305,309-313,319,325,330,332,336-340,350,352, 37 354,355,359,365,369,370,373,374,384,391,397,404,407,416-419,426,428,429,432,435,437,439, 441,452,455,459,462-464,469,480,482,496 This guideline was revised to expand access to these services through other health care professionals. Health and behavior assessment and interven tions (CPT codes 96150-96154) are included on these lines when provided subject to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) guidelines dated 2/1/06 located at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/viewlcd.asp?lcd_id=13492&lcd_version=48&basket=lcd%3A1 3492%3A48%3AHEALTH+AND +BEHAVIOR+ASSESSMENT%2FINTERVENTION%3 ACarrier%3ANHIC%7C%7C+Corp%2E+%2831142%29%3A . In addition, Managed Care Organizations may authorize employees of organizations holding certificates or letters of approval from DHS and a Medicaid vendor number to deliver these services (i.e., not delivering services as an independent practitioner). Hepatic Metastases Line 338 This new guideline was created to identif y when treatment is most beneficial. Hepatic metastases (ICD-9 code 197.7) are covered in this line only when: 1. Treatment of the primary tumor is covered on a funded line in accordance with the criteria in Guideline Note 12, TREATMENT OF CANCER WITH LITTLE OR NO BENEFIT PROVIDED NEAR THE END OF LIFE; 1. There are no other extrahepatic metastases; and, 2. The only treatment covered is hepatectom of liver (CPT codes 47120, 47122, 47125 or 47130). Hip Core Decompression Line 381 This new guideline was created to specify when this treatment is shown to be effective. Hip Core Decompression (S2325) is covered only for early/pre-collapse (stage I or II; before X-ray changes are evident) avascular necrosis of the hip (femoral head and/or neck). Hospitalization for Acute Viral Infections Lines 540,547,561,634 This guideline was converted from a Statement of Intent to a guideline and placed on the lines listed above. 38 Most acute viral infections are self-limited (e.g. colds, infectious mononucleosis, gastroenteritis). However, some viral infections such as viral pneumonia, aseptic meningitis, or severe gastroenteritis may require hospitalization to treat the complications of the primary disease. Accepted coding practices insist that the underlyi ng condition in these cases be the principle diagnosis. For example, complicated viral pneumonia requiring respiratory support with a ventilator would have a principle diagnosis of viral pneumonia and a secondary diagnosis of respiratory failure. Since the ICD-9-CM code for viral pneumonia has historically appeared only on a non-funded line, treatment has not been reimbursable regardless of the severity of the disease. In contrast, the code for vira l gastroenteritis appears on Line 296 and any necessary outpatient or inpatient services would be covered. Reimbursement for the treatment of certain conditions appearing low on the Prioritized List should be provided in severe cases of the diseases identified on the following four lines. Line: 540 Condition: OTHER NONINFECTIOUS GASTROENTERITIS AND COLITIS Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY Treatment of non-infectious gastroenteritis of significant severity that is associated with dehydration should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. Line: encephalitis, myelitis and encep halomyelitis of significant severity that is associated with either obtundation or dehydrat ion should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. Line: 561 Condition: ASEPTIC meningitis of signific ant severity that is associated with either obtundation or dehydration should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines using an index of severity of illness. Line: 633 Condition: ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AND COMMON C O L D Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY Treatment of viral pneumonia and influenza of significant severity that is associated with either respiratory failure or dehydration should be a covered service if the case fulfills the requirement of hospital admission guidelines us ing an index of severity of illness. Treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza should comply with state and national public health recommendations. 39 Intestinal Malabsorption Line 241 The guideline note was replaced by a coding specif ication on line 241, Intestinal Malabsorption that reads, \"ICD-9 code 579.8 (Other specified intestinal malabsorp tion) is included on this line only for chronic exudative ente ropathy, and protein-losing enteropathy.\" ICD-9 code 579.8 (Other specified intestinal malabsorption) is included on this line only for chronic steatorrhea, exudative enteropathy, and protein -losing enteropathy. Mastocytosis Lines 222,676 The guideline note was replaced by a coding specification on line 222, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas that reads, \"Maligna nt and systemic mastocytosis (202.3) are included on Line 222. Mastocytosis limited to the skin (757.3) resides on Line 675.\" Mastocytosis limited to the skin resides on Line 676. Medical and Surgical Management of Obesity Not Meeting Criteria Specified in Other Obesity-Related Guidelines Line 608 This guideline was deleted and la ter replaced when the bariatric surgery guideline was associated with this line item. Non-surgical management of obesity is included on this line for those services that do not meet the criteria found in Guideline Note 5. Bariatric surgery for the treatment of morbid obesity is included on this line for those individuals who d o not meet the criteria found in Guideline Note 8. Mental Health Problems in Children Age Five and Under Related to Neglect or Abuse Line 180 The guideline title was amended and language cha nged to clarify for whom the services apply. The previous title was 'Mental Health Probl ems in Early Childhood Related to Neglect or Abuse.' 995.52, Child Neglect (Nutritional), 995.53, Child Sexual Abuse, and 995.54, Child Physical Abuse, may be used in any children age five and younger when there is evidence or suspicion of abuse or neglect. These codes are to be used when the focus of treatment is on the alleged child victim. This can include findi ngs by child welfare of abuse or neglect; or 40 statements of abuse or neglect by the child, the perpetrator, or a caregiver or collateral report. Although these diagnoses can be used p reventively, i.e. for children who are not yet showing symptoms, presence of symptoms should be demonstrated for interventions beyond evaluation or a short-term child or family intervention. Use of The codes 995.52-995.54 may be used in children age five and younger and, in these instances only is limited to pairings with the following procedure codes: Assessment and Screening: management, 90862, is not indicated for these conditions in children age 5 and under. Mood Disorders in Children Age Eighteen and Under Line 213 The title was changed (from 'Mood Disorders in Early Childhood') and the text of the guideline modified to expand the scope to in clude children through age eighteen. The use of 296.90, Unspecified Episodic Mood Disorder, is appropriate only when the following apply: For children five 18 years old and under. In the presence of significant difficulty with emotional regulation that causes functional impairment. Use of 296.90 for children five years old and under is limited to pairings with the following procedure codes: Assessment and Screening: 41 413,415-419,421-424,426,428,431-437,440-443,445-449,451-454,456-460,462,464,465,468,469,475- 477,480-485,487-489,491-498,500-502,556 This guideline was converted from a Statement of Intent to a guideline and placed on the lines listed above. The Health Services Commission intends that si ngle injection and continuous nerve blocks should be covered services if they are requi red for successful completion of perioperative pain control for, or post-operative recovery from a covered operative procedure when the diagnosis requiring the operative procedure is also covered. Additionally, nerve blocks are covered services for patients hospitalized with trauma, cancer, or intractable pain conditions, if the underlying condition is a covered diagnosis. Obesity Line 8 This guideline received minor revisions for clarification. Medical treatment of obesity includes is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nutrition and exercise, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face to face contact more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1- 2 weeks) are covered for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss. Maintenance visits a re covered no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Pharmacological trea tments are not intended to be included as a treatment services on this line. See also Guideline Note 61 Parotid Gland Pleomorphic Adenoma Line 311 The guideline note, added this biennium, was replaced by a coding specification on line 311, Cancer of Oral Cavity, Pharynx, Nose and Larynx that reads, \"ICD-9 code 210.2 is only covered on line for parotid gland pleomorphic adenomas.\" ICD-9 code 210.2 for parotid gland pleomorphic adenomas. Pet Scan Lines 125,166,167,170,182,207,208,221,222,243,276,278,291,311,337 The PET scan guideline was revised for clarity. PET Scans are indicated only covered for diagnosis and staging of the following cancers only : Solitary pulmonary nodules and non-small cell lung cancer Lymphoma Melanoma Colon cancer 42 PET scan is covered only for the initia l staging of cervical cancer and only when initial MRI or CT is negative for extra-pelvic metastasis. PET scan of head and neck cancer is only covered for 1. initial staging when initial MRI or CT is equivocal, 2. evaluation of cervical lymph node metast ases when CT or MRI do not demonstrate an obvious primary tumor, and 3. evaluation of suspected recurrence of head and neck cancer when CT or MRI does not demonstrate a clear cut recurrence. For diagnosis, PET is covered only when it will avoid an invasive diagnostic procedure, or will assist in determining the optimal anatomic location to perform an invasive diagnostic procedure. For staging, PET is covered in the following situations: Clinical management of the patient will differ de pending on the stage of the cancer identified and either: 1. the stage of the cancer remains in doubt after standard diagnostic work up, OR 2. PET replaces one or more convention al imaging studies when they are insufficient for clinical management of the patient. AND Clinical management of the patient will differ depending on the stage of the cancer identifie d Restaging is covered only for cancers for which staging is covered, and for testicular cancer. Restaging is not covered for cervical cancer. For restaging, PET is covered after completion of treatment for the purpose of detecting residual di sease, for detecting suspected recurrence or to determine the extent of a known recurrence. PET is not covered to monitor tumor response during the planned course of therapy. PET scans are NOT indicated for routine follow up of cancer treatment or routine surve illance in asymptomatic patients. PET scans are also indicated for preoperative e valuation of the brain in patients who have intractable seizures and are candidates for fo cal surgery. PET scans are NOT indicated for cardiac evaluation. Pickwickian Syndrome Lines 8,211 This guideline was added then later deleted dur ing the reporting period when a new ICD-9-CM was created that made this guideline unnecessary. 278.8 (Other hyperalimentation) is included on these lines only for coverage of Pickwickian Syndrome/Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Reconstruction of the Nose Line 273 43 This new guideline clarifies the Commission's in tent that nose reconstr uction be covered for situations where it is done for non-cosmetic reasons. ICD-9 code 748.1 is on this line only for reconstruction of absence of the nose and other severe nasal anomalies which significan tly impair physical functioning. Rehabilitative Therapies Lines 12,50-52,63,73-75,77,79,84,88,89,93,94,97-100,108,109,115,116,122,129,139,141-143, 145,146,158,161,165,179,184,185,189,190,192,194,195,201,202,208,217,227,237,239,270,271,273,274,279,287,288,292,296,301,303,306-308,317,334,340,347,348,362,366,368,372,373,375,379,381,382,384,397,403,404,428,434,436,440,448,460,469, 480,497,508,539,551,569,587,610, 627 This guideline was added to the line for the treatment of urinar y incontinence and the guidelines text was revised to indicate a narrower range of V-codes that should be coded as a principle diagnosis. Physical, occupational and speech therapy, and cardiac and vascular rehabilitation, are covered for diagnoses paired with the respec tive CPT codes, depending on medical necessity, for up to 3 months immediately following stabilization from an acute event. Thereafter, the following number of combined phy sical and occupational therapy visits are allowed per year, depending on medical necessity: Age < 8: 24 Age 8-12: 12 Age > 12: 2 Following 3 months of acute therapy, the fo llowing number of speech therapy visits are allowed per year, depending on medical n ecessity (with the exception of swallowing disorders, for which limits do not apply): Age < 8: 24 Age 8-12: 12 Age > 12: 2 An additional 6 visits of speech, and/or an a dditional 6 visits of physical or occupational therapy are allowed, regardless of age, whenev er there is a change in status, such as surgery, botox injection, rapid growth, an acute exacerbation or for evaluation/training for an assistive communication device. No limits apply while in a skilled nursing facility for the primary purpose of rehabilitation, an inpatient hospital or an inpatient rehabilitation unit. If the admission/encounter is for reh abilitation, a V code from category V57.1-V57.3, V57.8 should be listed as the principle/first diagnos is. The underlying diagnosis for which rehab is needed should be listed as an additional diagnosis and this diagnosis must appear in the funded region of the Prioritized List for the admission/encounter to be covered. 44 Repair of Nose Tip Line 324 This new guideline clarifies the Commissi on's intent regardin g nose tip repair. Nose tip repair is included on this line only to be used in conjunction with codes 40700, 40701, 40702, or 40720 or subsequent correction of physical functioning. Second Bone Marrow Transplants Lines 78,102,105,125,131,166,170,198,206,232,280,313 After hearing the Health Re sources Commission's findings on the effectiveness of non- myeloablative bone marrow transplants, the guid eline was amended as follows. The previous title was 'Second Bone Marrow Transplants; Non-Myeloablative Stem Cell Transplants.' Second bone marrow transplants are not cov ered except for tandem autologous transplants for multiple myeloma. Non -myeloablative transplants (mini -transplants) are not covered. Second Solid Organ Transplants Lines 92,170,253,254,255,256,279,332,575 The commission made the decision to delete their guideline on second solid organ transplants and therefore let the United Network for Orga n Sharing (UNOS) determine organ allocation. Second solid o rgan transplants of the same type of organ are not covered except for acute graft failure that occurs during the origin al hospitalization for transplantation. Stabilization of Periodontal Health, Complex Restorative, and Removable Prosthodontics Line 498 This guideline was edited to remove a clause that no longer applies. Only for the treatment of severe drug-induced hy perplasia (D4210, D4211). To be used in conjunction with making a prosthesis (D7470, D7970). Limited to two reimbursements (D5850, D5851). Must have four or more miss ing posterior teeth per arch with resulting space equivalent to that loss demonstrating inability to masticate (D5110, there are pockets of 5 mm or greater (D4341). 45 Synagis Line 3 This new guideline was developed to define for whom the treatment is most effective. CPT code 90378, Synagis (palivizumab), is covere d for infants meeting one of the criteria given below (A-E), according to the treatment guidelines for each criterion: A) Infants younger than 24 months who have co ngenital heart disease (CHD) or chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD, formerl y called bronchopulmonary dysplasia) AND require medical therapy 1) Therapy is initiated within 6 months before the start of the RSV season 2) Maximum 5 doses B) Infants younger than 12 months with congenital abnormalities of the airway or neuromuscular disease 1) Maximum 5 doses C) Had a gestation age of 28 weeks or less 1) Initiated during the RSV season before the infant reaches 12 months 2) Maximum 5 doses D) Had a gestation age of 29 weeks and 0 days to 31 weeks and 6 days 1) Initiated during the RSV season before the infant reaches 6 months 2) Maximum 5 doses E) Had a gestational age of 32 weeks 0 days to 34 weeks 6 days 1) Born within 3 months before the start of RSV season or at any time throughout the RSV season 2) Have at least 1 of these 2 risk factors a) Infant attends child care; or b) One or more siblings or other children younger than 5 years live permanently in the child's household. 3) Should receive prophylaxis only until they reach 90 days of age or a maximum of 3 doses (whichever comes first). TIPS Procedure Lines 225,231,302,359 A new guideline was developed for Transvenous Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) TIPS procedure (CPT code 37182, 37183) is included on these lines for patients who: 1. Have failed sclerotherapy and have acute bleeding from varices; or 2. Have failed sclerotherapy and have had 2 or more episodes of re-bleeding requiring a transfusion during a 2-week period; or 3. Requires bleeding control from varices and surgery is contraindicated; or 4. Are liver transplant candidates who require bleeding control from varices; or 5. Have severe debilitating ascites or hepatic hydrothorax refractory to medical management (e.g., oral diuretics and repeated large-volume paracentesis). 46 Treatment of Cancer with Little or No Benefit Provided Near the End of Life Lines 101,102,123-125,144,159,166,167,170,181,197,198,207,208,219,221,222,229,230,232, 243,249,252,275-278,280,286,291,309-311,319,337-339,354,452,574,612 This guideline was converted from a Statement of Intent to a guideline and placed on the lines listed above. This guideline only applies to patients with advanced cancer who have less than 24 months median survival with treatment. All patients receiving end of life care, either with the intent to prolong survival or with the intent to palliate symptoms, should have /be engaged with palliative care providers (for example, have a palliative care consult or be enrolled in a palliative care program). Treatment with intent to prolong survival is not a covered service for patients with any of the following: Median survival of less than 6 months with or without treatment, as supported by the best available published evidence Median survival with treatment of 6-12 months when the treatment is expected to improve median survival by less than 50%, as supported by the best available published evidence Median survival with treatment of more than 12 months when the treatment is expected to improve median survival by less than 30%, as supported by the best available published evidence Poor prognosis with treatment, due to limited physical reserve or the ability to withstand treatment regimen, as i ndicated by low performance status. Unpublished evidence may be taken into consid eration in the case of rare cancers which are universally fatal within six months without treatment. The Health Services Commission is reluctant to place a strict $/QALY (quality adjusted life- year) or $/LYS (life-year saved) requirement on end-of-life treatments, as such measurements are only approximations and cannot take into account all of the merits of an individual case. However, cost must be taken into consideration when considering treatment options near the end of life. For example, in no instance can it be justified to spend $100,000 in public resources to increase an individual's expected survival by three months when hundreds of thousands of Oregonians are without any form of health insurance. Treatment with the goal to palliate is addressed in Statement of Intent 1, Palliative Care. Tympanostomy Tubes In Acute Otitis Media Line 413 While a guideline had already exis ted on the use of typanostomy t ubes in chronic otitis media, this new guideline was created regarding the use of this treatment in acute otitis media. Tympanostomy tubes (69436) are only included on this line as treatment for 1) recurrent acute otitis media (three or more episodes in six months or four or more episodes in one 47 year) that fail appropriate medical management, 2) for patients who fail medical treatment secondary to multiple drug allergies or who fail two or more consecutive courses of antibiotics, or 3) complicating conditions (i mmunocompromised host, meningitis by lumbar nerve paralysis, onset dizzine ss/vertigo, need for middle ear culture, labyrinthitis, or brain abscess). Patients wi th craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay may be considered for tympanostomy with their first ep isode of acute otitis media. Vertebroplasty Lines 159,498 This guideline was added then deleted during the reporting period afte r a study which showed the treatment to be ineffective. Vertebroplasty is included on these lines under the following criteria: 1. Must be performed wit hin the first 6 weeks after fracture A. Acute nature of fracture must be documented by MRI, Xray or other modality 2. None of the following may be present: A. Coagulation disorder B. Underlying vertebral infection C. Severe cardi opulmonary disease D. Extensive vertebral destruction (>50% of height) E. Neurological symptoms related to spinal compression F. Lack of surgical back up for emergency decompression 3. Must document A. Disabling pain caused by no n healing vertebral fracture B. Vertebral height is not more than 50% collapsed C. Procedure is not performed on a prophylactic basis D. Risks of open surgical approach are greater than risks of percutaneous approach E. Analgesic th erapy fails to control pain or the ri sks of analgesic therapy outweigh the benefits Medical Codes Not Appearing on the Prioritized List Since the implementation of the OHP, certain medical codes have been absent from the Prioritized List. In some cases this has been due to the lack of information about the condition or treatment, but in many cases the omissions were made purposefully. In the case of ICD-9-CM codes, this may be because they represent signs and symptoms that correspond to diagnostic services that are covered until a definitive dia gnosis can be established. Additionally, ICD-9-CM codes that represent secondary diagnoses are ne ver covered in isolation because payment of a claim should be based on the prioritization of the treatment of the underlying condition. CPT-4 and HCPCS codes can similarly be missing from the Prioritized List. If a code represents an ancillary service, such as pres cription drugs or the removal of sutu res, it is left off of the list and its reimbursement depends on whether the conditi on it is being used to treat is in the funded 48 region of the list. Procedure codes representing dia gnostic services are also left off the list since those services necessary to determine a diagnos is are covered by OHP. Only after the diagnosis has been established is the list used to dete rmine whether further treatments are covered under the plan. In addition, a procedure code may be de signated as an excluded se rvice if it represents an experimental treatment or cosmetic servi ce, and therefore left off the list as well. Staff of the Division of Medi cal Assistance Programs (DMAP), working with the Commission and its staff, have developed a list of codes re presenting excluded services. Eventually, with the recent implementation of the new Medicaid Ma nagement Information System (MMIS) in December 2009, it is envisioned that OHP providers and contracted health plans will have web- based access to the same claims processing inform ation used by DMAP so that service coverage will be as uniform as possible under all OHP delivery systems. CHAPTER THREE: SUBCOMMITTEES AND TASK FORCES 49 The Health Services Commission continues to rely on the work of its subcommittees in fulfilling its mandates. In addition to the ongoing work of the subcommittees, the Commission has appointed task forces to focus on specific issues. Health Outcomes Subcommittee The Health Outcomes Subcommittee (HOSC), chaired by Lisa Dodson, MD, since May 2008, is composed of the dental representative and the five physician members of the Commission.11 This Subcommittee is the first to review the need for any coding changes, develop or modify any necessary guidelines or investigate new advancements in medical technology. In essence, the HOSC has reviewed virtually ev ery change to the list ever made. Health Outcomes Subcommittee meetings are often th e forum where opinions from providers, health plan administrators, advocacy groups, and other interested parties are first presented. The HOSC uses high quality clinical evidence and clinical expertise to make recommendations for changes in code placement, line prioritization and guideli nes. All work of the HOSC is formulated into recommendations to be forwarded to the full Commission for a final vote. Mental Health Care and Chem ical Dependency Subcommittee The Mental Health Care and Chemic al Dependency (MHCD) Subcommittee12 has provided the Commission with invaluable info rmation and recommendations rela ted to the prioritization of MHCD services since its creation in 1989. During the last biennium, the MHCD Subcommitt ee created a new Autism Spectrum Disorder line and reviewed guidelines on chronic organic mental disorders and childhood mental health disorders. They also recomme nded adding peer-delivered servi ces for chemical dependency to the Prioritized List. They identi fied a series of MHCD \"Value-B ased Services\" that should be offered with minimal barriers in order to incentivize use of low- cost, highly-effective services. The MHCD has initiated the pr ocess of incorpora ting the new ICD-10-CM codes into the Prioritized List, and also made recommendati ons for line name changes and condition groupings as part of the biennial review. Dental Services Subcommittee The Dental Services Subcommittee was formed in 2008 to advise on the prio ritization of dental services on the Prioritized List. The Dental Services Subcommittee13 consists of members of the oral health provider community, OHP Dental Care Organizations , and other oral health care advocates. 11 See Appendix B for a list of the physician members on the Health Services Commissi on that make up the HOSC. 12 See Appendix B for the roster of the Mental Health Care and Chemical Dependency Subcommittee members. 13 See Appendix B for the roster of the Dental Services Subcommittee members. 50 The Dental Services Subcommittee reviewed all of the dental codes on th e Prioritized List and revised and further stratified the eight dental lines into 21 dental lines (see Figure 1.6). They then recommended rankings for these new dental li nes using the established methodology shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. The Subcommittee also reviewed the new CDT codes and made recommendations on placement on the Prioritized Li st and refined the exis ting dental guidelines. They also identified a series of dental \"value-based services,\" low cost, highly effective dental services that should be offered with minimal barriers to enco urage utilization. The Subcommittee will offer recommendations fo r ICD-10-CM conversion for the dental lines on the Prioritized List in 2011. Genetics Advisory Committee The Genetics Advisory Committee14 is comprised of genetics pr ofessionals and was reconvened in 2010 to advise the HSC on coverage decisi ons for genetic testing for children with developmental delay, intellectua l disability, and autism. The Committee reviewed the Non-prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline and made recommendations to the HSC on screening for genetic etiologies of developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies, and autism in children. The Committee will continue the discussion with the HSC to discuss potential m odifications to the non-prenatal genetic testing guideline. In the next biennium, the Committee will convene a group to discuss cancer genetic testing as well. 14 See Appendix B for the roster of the Genetics Advisory Committee members. CHAPTER FOUR: RECOMMENDATIONS 52 The Health Services Commission is pleased to offer these recommendations to the Governor and 76th Oregon Legislative Assembly: 1. Adopt the Prioritized List of Health Services for calendar years 2012-13 appearing in Appendix C; 2. Adopt the practice guidelin es that have been incorpor ated into the aforementioned Prioritized List; 3. Use the Prioritized List to delineate servi ces that are not as effective as others to determine the benefit packages under the Oregon Health Plan; and, 4. Consider the use of the Prioritized Li st and the recently developed Value-Based Services in defining benefits for other publicly funded health programs as well as an option for a value-based benefit packag e within the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange under development The Commission thanks the Governor and Legisl ature for the opportunity to continue in its service to the citizens of Oregon.

(503-373-1985) APPENDIX C: PRIORITIZED HEALTH SERVICES FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: A USER'S GUIDE TO THE PRIORITIZED LIST LINE DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 2012-13 PRIORITIZED LIST OF HEALTH SERVICES STATEMENT OF INTENT AND GUIDELINE DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 2012-13 PRIORITIZED LIST OF HEALTH SERVICES FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: A USER'S GUIDE TO THE PRIORITIZED LIST C-3 Readers of this document have many questions when they first confront the Prioritized List. A summary of the most frequently asked questions and their answers should familiarize the reader with the format of the list, define importa nt terms, and provide educational examples. 1) Does the line descriptor contain every diagnosis? Each line has a desc ription of both a condition and treatment. For some lines there is only one condition, but for others there may be many. The line descriptor contains the most frequent condition or a cluster of conditions represented by the ICD-9-CM codes. For exampl e, cystic fibrosis occurs by itself on line 26, but the codes on line 215, described broadly as Zoonotic Bacterial Diseases, include plague, tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, cat-scra tch disease and other specific diseases. 2) What do the line numbers represent? The line numbers represent the rank order of the condition-treatment pairs assigned by the H ealth Services Commi ssion. Therefore the services on line item 1 are most important to provide and line item 692 the least important in terms of the benefit to be gain ed by the population being served. 3) How is the funding line established? The 76 th Oregon Legislative A ssembly will review the Prioritized List included in this report. If this report is accepted, they will establish a funding line for this list in accordance with th e state budget. Upon approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), th e benefit package represented by the services listed on or above that funding line will be reimbursed under the Medicaid Demonstration beginning no earlier than January 1, 2012. 4) Why do many diagnoses appear more than once? A given diagnosis or condition may have a continuum of treatments including me dical, surgical, or transplantation. All transplantations for either bone marrow or solid or gans have a separate line in addition to the medical/surgical treatment. These treatments of a condition may vary in their effectiveness and/or cost and therefore receive different rankings by the Health Services Commission. 5) What about diagnostic services? Except for rare instances, diagnostic services are always covered and do not appear on the list. If a condition is diagnosed that appears below the funding line, the diagnostic visit and any necessary tests wi ll be covered, but subsequent office visits and ancillary services su ch as home health services will not. 6) What about preventive services? The Oregon Health Plan enc ourages prevention and early intervention. Preventive services for adults (line 4) and childr en (line 3) are ranked high and described in detail in the prev ention tables appearing in Appendix D of this report. In addition, preventive dental services are in cluded on line 58. With only a few exceptions, primarily in the areas of mental health a nd chemical dependency where the Commission added services, the prevention tables repres ent those services determined by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to improve im portant health outcomes, with their benefits outweighing harms (Recommendations A and B). C-4 7) What are ancillary services and are they covered? Ancillary services are those goods, services, and therapies that are considered to be integral to the successful treatment of a condition. Ancillary services are reimbursable when used in conjunction with a covered condition. 8) Are prescription drugs covered for all diagnoses? The Commission considers prescription drugs to be an ancillary servic e. Therefore, it is the inte nt of the HSC that only funded condition-treatment pairs include the coverage of prescription drugs. However, the Commission has discovered that since the diagno sis is not included with a prescription, the pharmacy has no way to determine if a drug is being prescribed for a condition falling below the funding line. Within the past few years, pr escribing physicians have been asked to check a box to indicate whether or not the prescription is for the treatment of a covered condition. 9) Are mental health care and chemical depende ncy services a part of the Prioritized List? Mental health care and chemical dependency li nes are fully integrated and prioritized along with physical conditions. Mental health lines are distinguished by the listing of \"psychotherapy\" under the treatment description. The listing of psychotherapy represents a broad range of mental health therapies provided by differe nt types of mental health professionals in various settings. 10) What are statements of intent? Statements of intent allow the Commission the ability to indicate their intent for coverage of services that cannot be easily identified by medical codes. These statements appear later in this appendix immediately follo wing the Prioritized List. 11) What are practice guidelines? Guidelines are used to further delineate conditions where the coding system does not adequately disti nguish between sub-groups that are treated differently or to indicate the most effective use of a particular trea tment. See Chapter Two for further detail on new guidelines developed and existing guidelines that were modified over the last two years. A lis ting of the guideline titles is provided at the end of this appendix. This includes guidelines associated with diagnostic and anci llary services that don't appear on the Prioritized Li st as well as services that do appear on the list. A full listing of the practice guidelines are posted on the Commission's website (shown below). 12) Where are the indexes? Condition and treatment indexes to the list by common medical terms will also be posted to the Commission's website (shown below) once the January 1, 2012 list is finalized this fall. These terms will be cross-referenced with the corresponding ranking of that condition or treatment on the Prio ritized List. Indexes to the current list (dated April 1, 2011) appear on th e website now, and the revised ones will look very similar. 13) What other resources are available to answer other questions I may have?
