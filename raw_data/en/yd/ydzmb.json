Presentations will draw from the four methodologies that Ayurveda recognizes as valid approaches to gathering reliable evidence: direct experience, research, experimentation, and traditional textual evidence. As a comprehensive medical system that combines detailed preventative strategies, lifestyle and diet guidance, and disease management protocols, Ayurveda promises to not only enhance and complement both mainstream medical care and other alternative health care modalities but also answer today's growing demand for individualized treatment. The conference will showcase reliable evidence of the effective application of Ayurveda within the mainstream health care system. "}
