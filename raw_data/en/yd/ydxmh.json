Anthroposophy is described as a path of knowledge to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe...which is accessible to direct experience through inner development. Steiner's Anthroposophy is unique in its approach to phenomenological research and epistemology, as it is one of the few spiritual streams to be able to bring down objective spiritual knowledge which can be applied in everyday practical activities or world affairs and enliven them. Anthroposophy can also mean consciousness of one's humanity or the wisdom of the human being. Steiner emphasized that Anthroposophy as a spiritual path, builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent judgement, and he considered the purpose of human evolution was the development of the qualities of love and freedom. The following are some of the areas of applied Anthroposophy: Curative Education, Education (Steiner & Waldorf schools), Painting, Architecture, Drug Rehabilitation, Sculpture, Nutrition, Eurythmy, Medicine, Religion, Speech and Drama, Agriculture, Economics, Social therapy, Philosophy, Biography, Counselling/Psychotherapy. Education is the best outwardly known aspect of Anthroposophy working in practical life, then probably biodynamic agriculture and medicine. Rudolf Steiner wrote many books as well as giving thousands of lectures which were recorded, and many of these have been translated into English. Some of his most well known books include: 'Esoteric Science: An 'Manifestations of Karma' and 'Theosophy'. Collected lectures include the eight volumes of lectures called 'Karmic Relationships', 'Foundations of Human Experience', 'Psychoanalysis and Spiritual Science', 'The Psychology of Body, Soul, and Spirit', plus many others.
