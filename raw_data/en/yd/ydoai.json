It is not an all- inclusive document. The item numbers correspond to the in spection report. IDAPA 16.06.02 - Rules Governing Standards for Child Care Licensing are applicable to all child cares that are licensed or receiving Department subsidies (ICCP). Child Care Guidelines Age & Health of Provider / Supervision (1) The owner o r operator and all staff are responsible for the direct care, protection, supervision, and guidance of children through active involvement or direct observation. Provider must be 18 years old or older. Persons 16 or 17 may provide care if directly supervi sed by a provider. A caregiver must not work when ill as per Rules and Regulations Governing Idaho Reportable Diseases. All individuals at the facility who are thirteen (13) years of age or older, have direct contact with ch ildren, and/or who are on the p remises for twelve (12) or more hours per month must complete and receive a Department crimin al history and background check clearance. Documentation of this clearance must be on -site and provided to the inspector during the initial and annual inspection CPR/First Aid Training (2) All providers, owners, and staff members who provide direct care to children are required to have a current certification in pediatric rescue breathing, infant -child CPR and pediatric first aid treatment from a certified instruc tor. If the facility provides transportation of children outside the facility at any time, persons that accompany the transportation must be currently certified in pediatric CPR/FA. Be sure to take a CPR and First Aid course that is approved for child care in Idaho Child - Staff Ratio (3) Child to staff ratio must be adhered to during all hours of operation . Ratios are determined by a point system. Points are determined by the age of children. 12 points per staff member is the maximum. Zero to less than 24 months is equal to 2 points. 24 months to under 36 months is equal to 1 1/2 points. 36 months to under 5 years old is equal to 1 point. 5 years old to under 13 years of age is equal to a \u00bd point. Local jurisdictions (cities) that require child care lice nsing may have more stringent requirements. Staff/Children Excluded When Ill (4) Provide a written procedure that outlines what will be done if a child becomes ill while in your care. This procedure must address: a. Keeping the child separated from the rest of the children to prevent spreading disease. b. Not allowing children to attend if they have had diarrhea, vomiting, or a fever (101 oral, 102 rectal, 100 axillary (armpit), accompanied by behavior changes or other signs or symptoms of illness within a 24 -hour period. c. Notification of a parent or guardian.
