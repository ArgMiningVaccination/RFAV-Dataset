Essential oils are highly aromatic, pure botanical oils that are distilled (most frequently by steam or water) from the leaves, needles, stems, flowers, bark or roots of particular aromatic plants. Most essential oils are steam or hydro distilled. however, citrus essential oils are typically cold pressed from the rinds (peels) of citrus fruits, but are sometimes also available as steam distilled oils. Because of their natural composition, essential oils possess many highly beneficial properties. Look to each essential oil's description for details of its properties and applications. It takes a great deal of botanical material to produce essential oils. Essential oil yields range from less than one percent to about 3 percent. A few essential oils offer slightly larger yields. Because the amount of essential oil produced can vary from one botanical to the next and because botanicals can vary in cost, you will also find that essential oils can vary in price. Essential oils should never be applied directly to the skin without first either diluting the oil adequately in a carrier oil or incorporating it at proper dilution into your formulation. For more information, please refer to our [Essential Oil Safety](/library/eosafety.asp) library article. Our beautiful line of therapeutic quality Organic Essential Oils is certified NOP Organic by CCOF and meet the national organic standards established by the USDA National Organic Program.

When you inhale the oil directly from the bottle, the thin bottle neck can prevent the aroma from fully divulging its complexity and its full palette of aromatic notes. Fragrance and Perfume Test Strips are ideally suited for evaluating the aroma of essential oils, CO2 extracts, absolutes, fragrance oils and other aromatics. They're also wonderful for evaluating blends and fragrances that you create for personal care or aromatherapy formulations.
